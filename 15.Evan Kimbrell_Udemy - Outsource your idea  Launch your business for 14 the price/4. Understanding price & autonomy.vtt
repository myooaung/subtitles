00:10.720 --> 00:15.910
Hey guys welcome back to the course so in this lecture we're going to talk about the relationship between

00:15.910 --> 00:18.130
price and autonomy.

00:18.130 --> 00:24.180
When you're hiring a contractor or an outsourced freelancer so this is actually just a quick video.

00:24.190 --> 00:30.160
I want to introduce a concept that once I kind of understood this it really helped me wrap my head around

00:30.160 --> 00:35.110
what's a good bid what should I expect and what's an efficient kind of route to take.

00:35.110 --> 00:40.810
When I look at the freelancers that are giving me proposals now you've probably noticed right off the

00:40.810 --> 00:47.290
bat there is going to be like a smorgasbord of different prices from different freelancers.

00:47.290 --> 00:52.000
Obviously the price depends on a lot of different things and you can obviously tell very quickly that

00:52.000 --> 00:57.550
place people who are bidding from say the United States are going to bid higher than someone who's bidding

00:57.550 --> 00:59.070
from say Sri Lanka.

00:59.080 --> 01:03.780
So it's obvious that the country of origin makes a big deal in price.

01:03.790 --> 01:06.640
There's also a lot of other factors that go into it.

01:06.670 --> 01:12.190
We're going to talk a little bit more in-depth in the next lecture about the factors that go into pricing

01:12.220 --> 01:13.990
and what you should kind of understand.

01:13.990 --> 01:20.230
So when someone says this is going to take me $20 an hour or you know $200 for your project there's

01:20.230 --> 01:25.150
a lot that's codify into that and you need to break it down to actually understand where you can find

01:25.150 --> 01:28.270
cost savings but also understand whether or not you're getting a good deal.

01:28.270 --> 01:32.940
Now the concept of autonomy is very important when it comes to freelancers.

01:32.950 --> 01:39.940
You want your freelancer to be as autonomous as possible know what do I mean by that I mean that if

01:39.940 --> 01:43.140
your freelancer or your firm runs into a problem.

01:43.150 --> 01:46.620
How capable are they of solving that problem.

01:46.630 --> 01:52.040
Now you might think to yourself I have made my specification sheets of my instructions perfectly.

01:52.090 --> 01:54.630
There's no way they're going to run into issues.

01:54.730 --> 01:56.030
I have everything planned out.

01:56.100 --> 01:56.490
OK.

01:56.530 --> 01:58.990
That's just flat out not true.

01:59.140 --> 02:05.560
Even professionals even companies that have been outsourcing for 20 years they still run into issues

02:06.160 --> 02:11.920
and they still run into problems that they could not possibly have foreseen when they wrote their spec

02:11.920 --> 02:13.900
sheets or when they originally posted their job.

02:13.900 --> 02:17.610
Just a general rule of thumb is that you should expect issues.

02:17.710 --> 02:19.290
Any little technical bug.

02:19.300 --> 02:21.490
Any clarification issue.

02:21.490 --> 02:27.190
Any type of say even if you're outsourcing your marketing a response that you didn't expect from a potential

02:27.190 --> 02:35.290
customer or really kind of any issue infrastructure issues issues getting gaining access to the accounts

02:35.290 --> 02:36.270
you give them.

02:36.400 --> 02:38.560
There's a lot of different things that can go wrong.

02:38.560 --> 02:43.660
Now what you need to understand about autonomy and how this relates to price is that the more you pay

02:43.930 --> 02:49.720
the more likely you are freelancer is going to be capable of solving their own problems on their own

02:49.930 --> 02:51.130
without help from you.

02:51.130 --> 02:58.420
So let's take an Indian web developer as an example an Indian web developer that lives outside of a

02:58.420 --> 03:05.050
big city that has been working for let's say four to five years and they do primarily let's say javascript

03:05.050 --> 03:06.020
and Ph.

03:06.400 --> 03:11.350
That person could potentially charge you let's say eight to 12 dollars an hour.

03:11.350 --> 03:15.370
They could even be as cheap as five dollars an hour if they're less experienced.

03:15.370 --> 03:21.700
Now if you saw someone that was bidding $10 an hour it's pretty safe to assume that they're not going

03:21.700 --> 03:24.660
to be very autonomous if something goes wrong.

03:24.790 --> 03:29.110
Their ability to think on the fly to understand your project as a whole.

03:29.100 --> 03:35.250
Understand the bigger picture of your project and then to make pivots as they go is going to be limited.

03:35.260 --> 03:40.840
This is something that you need to understand when you're paying less money per hour or per project.

03:40.840 --> 03:46.120
They are not going to be able to figure out their own issues and they're going to be pinging you much

03:46.120 --> 03:47.200
much more often.

03:47.200 --> 03:52.660
So now let's use the same exact example let's assume though that these Indian web developers same skill

03:52.660 --> 03:52.990
set.

03:52.990 --> 03:56.550
Maybe they have had more time working with web development.

03:56.560 --> 04:01.870
Maybe they've had more Western clients maybe they live in a bigger city where they have access to better

04:01.870 --> 04:05.190
facilities maybe they have better English skills their price.

04:05.200 --> 04:08.650
Let's just say $20 an hour to $25 an hour.

04:08.650 --> 04:10.960
Now that's probably on the higher end.

04:11.320 --> 04:16.840
But when you need to understand that situation is that there is an implied association with that price

04:16.840 --> 04:20.630
because $20 to $25 is very expensive for India.

04:20.770 --> 04:26.080
So you have to assume what they mean is that not only are they good at web development they're good

04:26.080 --> 04:30.520
at projects and they're good at freelancing in general they're probably a smart person and they can

04:30.520 --> 04:33.670
probably figure out their issues as they arise.

04:33.700 --> 04:40.120
Now a $10 an hour web developer is not going to be expected to understand who your customers are why

04:40.120 --> 04:41.760
you're selling why.

04:41.770 --> 04:44.340
You know whatever you're building is a good idea.

04:44.350 --> 04:48.310
They don't need to understand the politics betime maybe even the organization you're running and how

04:48.310 --> 04:50.210
it's going to integrate with them.

04:50.260 --> 04:51.580
They don't need to understand all that.

04:51.580 --> 04:55.480
They probably won't even understand it whether or not this is expensive for you whether or not you have

04:55.480 --> 04:57.980
lots of money to continue the project.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.280
They are only going to be focused on what exactly you tell them to do.

05:01.300 --> 05:06.700
Now a person who is $20 to $25 an hour probably is going to understand a little bit more.

05:06.820 --> 05:09.250
They're going to ask you more questions about who you selling to.

05:09.250 --> 05:14.910
They might even come up suggestions but they might not understand as well as you do and most likely

05:14.910 --> 05:20.100
they won't understand as well as you do but they'll understand it to a much greater degree than if you

05:20.100 --> 05:22.100
had someone that was only $10 an hour.

05:22.100 --> 05:24.450
So what does this mean for you and your project.

05:24.450 --> 05:31.500
Well previously we had talked about what are kind of the prerequisites for outsourcing or contracting.

05:31.650 --> 05:37.280
And we talked a little bit about who the types of people are who outsource or contract.

05:37.320 --> 05:43.770
And really how it kind of changes depending on how it like how it affects yours as you have with contracting

05:44.190 --> 05:50.340
it really kind of depends on how many times obviously you've done this before but also how integrated

05:50.340 --> 05:55.260
in the process you want to be a lot of people who are outsourcing do not want to have to check in three

05:55.260 --> 06:01.560
times a week or have to do a significant amount of work on their side to say update requirements update

06:01.560 --> 06:07.910
the specification sheets change instructions provide information to the freelancer.

06:08.040 --> 06:12.360
So really you know you need to think about how involved you want to be in your process.

06:12.480 --> 06:17.220
If you really are OK with being there every step of the way and I typically suggest that you should

06:17.220 --> 06:19.160
be as involved as possible.

06:19.200 --> 06:22.020
In that case then you should expect to pay more.

06:22.080 --> 06:27.570
And if you end up taking the cheaper option who someone whose prices at the lower end of the range of

06:27.570 --> 06:28.650
what you'd expect.

06:28.650 --> 06:34.200
Well then you're going to have your expectations pretty much broken because that person is going to

06:34.200 --> 06:35.970
be asking you a lot of questions.

06:35.970 --> 06:39.980
That person is going to be constantly coming back to you with the information they need.

06:39.990 --> 06:43.230
There's a good chance they can screw up and build something incorrectly.

06:43.220 --> 06:44.630
You never go back and fix it.

06:44.640 --> 06:50.460
So technically they are cheaper but if you calculate how much time you spend on it it's not as much

06:50.460 --> 06:52.080
of a bargain as you would think.

06:52.290 --> 06:57.240
So take a second think about your project to think about your organization and think about how much

06:57.240 --> 07:03.480
time you're willing to spend on your project and whether or not you're comfortable with having a close

07:03.480 --> 07:08.640
kind of feedback loop with the person who's working on your project and then make a decision accordingly

07:08.640 --> 07:09.690
based on price.

07:09.690 --> 07:16.440
So the main takeaway here is every area every expertise every project is going to have a range and the

07:16.440 --> 07:22.050
more they charge the more autonomous they're going to be the projects and they go a lot more smoothly

07:22.080 --> 07:26.100
because these people are gonna understand more of the project and they're going to be able to make decisions

07:26.130 --> 07:31.440
on the fly that you're OK with where someone who is cheaper is either not going to make that decision

07:31.530 --> 07:36.070
or they're probably going to make that decision wrong which requires more effort from you.

07:36.120 --> 07:42.180
So don't obviously just go with the cheapest option go with the one that matches your expertise level

07:42.330 --> 07:44.050
and matches your commitment level.

07:44.100 --> 07:48.420
If you're someone who has lost expertise and you're really committed to this project then you can save

07:48.450 --> 07:49.370
a lot of money.

07:49.380 --> 07:53.730
But if you're in the middle make sure that you work with someone who's a little bit more capable and

07:53.730 --> 07:56.770
a little bit more dynamic than say the cheapest option.

07:56.790 --> 08:04.710
All right I'll see in the next lecture.
