00:06.420 --> 00:10.460
So at this point in the course you have come up with the idea.

00:10.500 --> 00:17.780
You posted it online and now you're sifting through the masses of people that have responded to your

00:17.780 --> 00:18.680
ad.

00:19.050 --> 00:23.290
Hopefully you've posted it on oDesk Lance and freelancer.

00:23.340 --> 00:23.740
That's it.

00:23.750 --> 00:29.430
I suggest that's the best way of casting your net as wide as possible depending on how specific your

00:29.490 --> 00:33.450
application is or how well you've described your application.

00:33.450 --> 00:40.930
I would imagine you probably if you've waited about 24 hours have anywhere between 20 and 50 bids.

00:41.160 --> 00:47.850
I think the bulk of them will probably come from freelancer because that is where the people follow

00:47.940 --> 00:52.580
the quantity over quality credo Elance are gonna be a lot fewer.

00:52.590 --> 00:55.620
But the quality they're going to be much higher.

00:55.620 --> 01:01.360
Those are going to be the developers are probably got to put on your shortlist picking a freelancer

01:01.360 --> 01:03.790
is crucial later in this course.

01:03.800 --> 01:07.000
We're going to do this in real life in application.

01:07.120 --> 01:11.520
If you're new to the course you probably won't see that because at the very beginning of the Course

01:11.590 --> 01:19.300
I'm going to start off by taking ideas and then starting the process of recruiting developers to build

01:19.300 --> 01:19.810
the idea.

01:19.810 --> 01:21.220
So if you're too early.

01:21.220 --> 01:23.970
Just be patient it'll come out in a week or so.

01:23.980 --> 01:28.960
Right now we're just going to talk over in general how do you pick a good freelancer.

01:29.290 --> 01:34.070
And this is a scale that I've developed over the last five years in the last hundred some applications.

01:34.120 --> 01:37.960
I'm going to teach you how I do it how I rank my freelancers.

01:38.080 --> 01:42.810
There could be other ways of doing it out there and I'm not saying those are wrong.

01:42.820 --> 01:44.830
I'm saying this is what's worked for me.

01:44.830 --> 01:49.630
I can walk you through my logic and my rationale for why I do it this way.

01:50.050 --> 01:52.090
I rate them on five things.

01:52.090 --> 01:54.520
Number one is relevancy.

01:54.610 --> 01:59.420
Relevancy means that when you're looking at a freelancer look at their portfolio.

01:59.650 --> 02:06.010
How many applications have they done that are similar to what you're building not only similar in subject

02:06.320 --> 02:10.210
similar in industry and similar in size.

02:10.390 --> 02:15.830
Does it three dimensions that I look at these so when my projects was a taxi management app.

02:15.850 --> 02:21.370
Now I'm going to look for someone who one hopefully has worked in some kind of logistics application

02:21.640 --> 02:28.900
Hopefully someone who's worked in cars or taxis or transportation sub that to look for someone who has

02:28.900 --> 02:36.520
built any type of application that I think controls moving parts and controls actual employees if they

02:36.520 --> 02:42.760
don't have that next Cobley a strike against them then I'm going to look for applications they've built

02:42.760 --> 02:44.350
that have similar features.

02:44.500 --> 02:46.690
My application text messaging.

02:46.720 --> 02:51.090
It also had an online screen or they can pick their shifts and pick their hours.

02:51.100 --> 02:57.100
It also had a system where they could communicate the root text message and that text message system

02:57.100 --> 03:00.490
was essentially like a robot that would talk back to them.

03:00.490 --> 03:01.450
That's a little obscure.

03:01.450 --> 03:05.950
So I'm going to look for but I'm going to look for somebody who's maybe built text message apps before

03:06.100 --> 03:08.530
really anything along those lines.

03:08.860 --> 03:14.590
I might look for someone who's done online scheduling that could be something if they have neither one

03:14.590 --> 03:16.040
of those then.

03:16.110 --> 03:19.230
It's probably a strike in my book as well for the term relevancy.

03:20.890 --> 03:24.830
The last sub dimension under relevancy is going to be scope.

03:24.940 --> 03:26.860
Look at the application they've built.

03:26.860 --> 03:30.930
If you're proposing to build an application that you think will take a month to build.

03:31.030 --> 03:35.690
See how many other applications they've built that also took them roughly a month.

03:35.710 --> 03:40.960
Most of the freelancing applications will show you how long their projects lasted.

03:40.960 --> 03:45.070
ODesk will tell you how many hours they build on a particular project.

03:45.120 --> 03:52.430
Elance I believe you can just go and look at the job posting freelancer is similar in that regard.

03:52.750 --> 03:58.000
So if you're looking for a big project look to see that they have big project experience of you doing

03:58.000 --> 04:04.350
a smaller project then maybe you want to make sure that they can pull off a quick job as well.

04:04.390 --> 04:09.940
They're not going to disappear because the application that they signed on to build is only going to

04:09.940 --> 04:10.880
take them a week.

04:11.860 --> 04:19.090
If you have the case where they have either all small project experience or all big project experience

04:19.180 --> 04:22.390
I always err in favor of big project experience.

04:22.390 --> 04:25.030
I never really hold that against them and that's the only thing they do.

04:25.030 --> 04:27.430
That just means that they like larger projects.

04:27.430 --> 04:34.000
But in my experience developers who work on larger applications have a larger breadth of skill and also

04:34.000 --> 04:36.360
they're just more responsible in general.

04:36.370 --> 04:40.650
So that's not necessarily a knock against them if they only have short projects.

04:40.660 --> 04:43.780
That means that they could be a less mature freelancer.

04:43.780 --> 04:45.800
That could mean that they're not nearly as committed.

04:45.820 --> 04:50.820
That can mean that they have other commitments that can actually get in the way.

04:50.830 --> 04:53.590
The second criteria I use is experience.

04:53.620 --> 04:58.840
This is probably the most obvious one and I think that honestly when you look at a freelancer and you

04:58.840 --> 05:04.240
want to determine how you rate them on experience just click on their profile and just take a quick

05:04.240 --> 05:05.390
gander.

05:05.390 --> 05:10.270
It shouldn't take you more than a couple of minutes to get a general idea of how experienced they are

05:10.780 --> 05:16.720
the way that you do this is you just simply look at the freelancer see how many projects they have specifically

05:16.720 --> 05:18.510
how long they've been doing this.

05:18.520 --> 05:19.730
That's another big one.

05:19.780 --> 05:25.970
They've only been on the application for a year or maybe six months that could be a red flag.

05:26.320 --> 05:31.330
If it's the case that they've only been using that platform for a short period of time you can always

05:31.390 --> 05:33.710
ask them once you get to your shortlist.

05:33.790 --> 05:39.460
Say how long have you been making web applications and they will tell you often within their resumes

05:39.490 --> 05:44.020
or their profile descriptions it'll say I've been a developer four and a half years.

05:45.010 --> 05:51.330
Use that as a general gauge of how mature they are and how comfortable you are with them.

05:51.760 --> 05:55.240
The biggest thing is what's going to happen when they run into a problem.

05:55.360 --> 06:01.720
People who are more experienced are less likely to run away and they're less likely to have an incomplete

06:01.780 --> 06:04.820
project more experience is better.

06:04.870 --> 06:10.360
But keep in mind obviously that if you're trying to cut costs you might have to forego a little bit

06:10.360 --> 06:11.780
of experience.

06:11.890 --> 06:17.250
Also look at your application and have a deep think about how complicated this really is.

06:17.380 --> 06:22.810
You can reach out to the freelancers and ask them how complicated is this and they will generally give

06:22.810 --> 06:24.320
you a good idea.

06:24.640 --> 06:26.050
And that's a good way of engaging.

06:26.050 --> 06:32.280
OK this is a medium difficulty project or this is a low difficulty project if that's the case then experience

06:32.280 --> 06:34.910
is not nearly as important of a criteria.

06:35.720 --> 06:37.100
Criteria number three.

06:37.100 --> 06:39.880
And this is the biggest one for me.

06:39.880 --> 06:47.620
It is interest every time you've heard someone who has a hiring or H.R. guru They always tell you is

06:47.640 --> 06:50.570
really really important about hiring someone.

06:50.720 --> 06:56.870
They always tell you that that person needs to show interest in your company and that is kind of a startup

06:56.870 --> 07:02.600
motto as well that people who are interested but lack the skills can learn the skills that people with

07:02.630 --> 07:06.630
the skills who lack the interest are just going to be kind of dead in the water.

07:07.380 --> 07:10.190
I believe that works for freelancers as well.

07:10.200 --> 07:12.580
And in this case look for interest.

07:12.780 --> 07:15.030
How do you tell if they're interested.

07:15.030 --> 07:21.600
Typically you'll see a range of responses to your project that range could be on one end of the spectrum

07:21.690 --> 07:25.130
which is that they sent you a copy and pasted message.

07:25.170 --> 07:29.140
And in that copy and pasted message you could notice that nothing has been modified.

07:29.160 --> 07:33.410
How do you tell if something is modified in their copy paste message.

07:33.550 --> 07:40.100
The way I tell is if I post a project with specifics to it say I posted my Twilio taxi application.

07:40.150 --> 07:43.600
Do they mention anything about Twilio in their application.

07:43.600 --> 07:46.360
That's generally a dead giveaway for me.

07:46.360 --> 07:53.690
Did they mention any of the skills that I listed as prerequisites or desired skills on my job posting.

07:53.750 --> 07:57.400
There's no mention wow they didn't even read it at all.

07:57.400 --> 08:02.260
Now the other end of the spectrum in terms of interest will be that someone will just send you a message

08:02.530 --> 08:06.060
and they're commenting directly to you about the project.

08:06.070 --> 08:12.400
Maybe they're responding with a question that is definitely a better sign a better sign is them saying

08:12.670 --> 08:18.220
I like this project I'm interested in this project or a way that they're illustrating that they've thought

08:18.220 --> 08:19.330
about your project.

08:19.420 --> 08:24.910
They're spending time on your bed and they are showing that when they read your bed they're thinking

08:24.940 --> 08:25.720
about it.

08:26.760 --> 08:31.950
That's a good way of just of telling how interested and how committed they are to it.

08:32.010 --> 08:37.890
There are freelancers who are good at hiding that what they do is they have templates that they can

08:37.890 --> 08:44.640
modify very quickly and it's very hard for you to tell whether or not it's been written by hand or it's

08:44.640 --> 08:46.600
just a copy and paste message.

08:47.520 --> 08:52.410
The way that you can easily get through this is just by messaging them and I'll show you this and we

08:52.410 --> 08:55.410
actually go through and do this for real.

08:55.620 --> 08:59.430
What you can do is just message them really quickly send them a sentence saying what do you think about

08:59.430 --> 09:00.480
the project.

09:00.480 --> 09:02.760
How long do you think it'll take now.

09:02.790 --> 09:05.690
What that will do is a lot of people who don't even check their accounts.

09:05.700 --> 09:06.720
They just won't respond.

09:06.720 --> 09:07.650
So there you go.

09:07.660 --> 09:09.140
You save yourself some time.

09:09.150 --> 09:14.020
Some people respond to give an inadequate answer and some people will respond and blow you away.

09:14.130 --> 09:17.810
They'll say you know I think these are the hard parts about it here are the easy parts about it.

09:17.810 --> 09:20.070
This is my best guess of time.

09:20.070 --> 09:21.820
And then they'll ask you questions.

09:22.020 --> 09:26.240
That means that the person's engaged and that is generally a positive sign.

09:26.460 --> 09:31.560
Another positive sign is when they verbally say they're interested in it or they mention that they built

09:31.560 --> 09:32.760
something in the past.

09:32.820 --> 09:39.300
Those are always good interest will keep their focus on the application and interest will make it such

09:39.300 --> 09:43.680
that they're more willing to put an extra work and they're less willing to charge you for that extra

09:43.680 --> 09:45.680
work because it just comes naturally to them.

09:45.840 --> 09:52.110
If this is drudge work for them you're probably going to run into more issues than if it's someone who's

09:52.110 --> 10:01.300
really committed the fourth criteria that I use is availability availability is pretty easy to tell.

10:01.420 --> 10:05.300
You just simply ask them if you don't trust their responses.

10:05.300 --> 10:08.280
What you can do is you can look at their profiles.

10:08.390 --> 10:14.110
Most of these freelancing Web sites they will tell you what other projects they are working on.

10:14.180 --> 10:20.990
A lot of times it's hard when a studio responds It's like a firm or an agency responds.

10:21.170 --> 10:26.660
You know that they have other projects and you know that they're not going to be realistic when you

10:26.660 --> 10:30.290
ask them hey what's your bandwidth going forward.

10:30.290 --> 10:32.560
How many people can you devote to this project.

10:32.570 --> 10:37.630
They always lie or they always exaggerate because they don't want to lose the sale.

10:37.700 --> 10:41.680
And they always overestimate their ability to shift resources around.

10:41.750 --> 10:48.620
That is something I've known just from being in the studio game for so long that is inevitable and the

10:48.620 --> 10:50.630
best people do it regardless.

10:51.700 --> 10:57.670
Have a look for yourself look at their profile see how many active projects there are.

10:57.790 --> 11:01.750
You can tell that some are active and some of them look like they're abandoned.

11:01.780 --> 11:02.980
That's a red flag.

11:02.980 --> 11:07.660
It looks like there's a small project that started six months ago and it's not wrapped up.

11:07.660 --> 11:12.070
It's not necessarily their fault but it's something that you should keep in mind if you're not looking

11:12.070 --> 11:13.430
at an agency or a studio.

11:13.430 --> 11:17.530
Again IRA go back to what I said originally which is that you can just ask them what's your availability

11:17.530 --> 11:18.120
like.

11:18.340 --> 11:20.740
And for the most part they will be honest.

11:20.830 --> 11:25.930
If it's the case of a freelancer I think that your tolerance for how many other projects they have should

11:25.930 --> 11:27.080
be lower.

11:27.130 --> 11:33.250
I say this because say of a freelancer he might think he's extremely productive and they might be extremely

11:33.250 --> 11:34.300
doctor if he or she.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.680
However there are certain things they cannot predict.

11:36.700 --> 11:40.000
They don't know when a bug might hit one of their projects.

11:40.030 --> 11:45.970
They don't know when the scope of a project changes or when someone that they're working with changes

11:46.060 --> 11:49.300
the specifications for the project or if someone disappears.

11:49.300 --> 11:50.590
Things happen.

11:50.590 --> 11:55.330
So what can happen is if they're if they're billing your application and they're building three other

11:55.330 --> 12:03.250
things it is likely that one of the other projects can balloon and every well in tensioning developer

12:03.250 --> 12:05.640
I've met still makes this mistake.

12:05.680 --> 12:11.080
They always think that they can quantify how long and how much how much time they're going to spend

12:11.410 --> 12:13.160
on their other projects.

12:13.270 --> 12:14.260
And that always changes.

12:14.260 --> 12:15.960
It is too variable.

12:16.000 --> 12:21.070
Now if the freelancer says they have other job and we talked about this previously about how finding

12:21.100 --> 12:23.980
off hours freelancers is fantastic.

12:24.370 --> 12:27.130
If they didn't have another job that I think is an exception.

12:27.130 --> 12:28.060
Why do I say that.

12:28.060 --> 12:33.760
Because their job is typically nine to five if they've been with that job for a long period of time.

12:33.760 --> 12:37.490
They're more realistic about how often they have to have overtime.

12:37.510 --> 12:40.280
How often do their projects at work balloon.

12:40.480 --> 12:42.570
If it's one job that's one job it's not.

12:42.560 --> 12:46.000
Two other projects that they have limited familiarity with.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.740
So if they have another job that seems fine.

12:48.760 --> 12:51.990
Typically I look for people that have a lot of availability.

12:52.000 --> 12:56.650
There's one other thing that I think you should keep in mind if they have a wide open schedule that's

12:56.650 --> 12:57.250
a good thing.

12:57.280 --> 12:58.470
And it's a bad thing.

12:58.470 --> 12:59.800
They have a wide open schedule.

12:59.800 --> 13:03.340
Ask them are you going to be taking on other projects while you do this.

13:03.340 --> 13:06.770
That's a crucial thing that you should ask them criteria.

13:06.770 --> 13:09.560
Number five is responsiveness.

13:09.620 --> 13:15.830
A lot of people think that I read too much into responsiveness and I think I read too little into it.

13:15.860 --> 13:18.100
I think this is huge.

13:18.380 --> 13:23.540
When I message them how fast do they respond when I message them and I ask them two questions.

13:23.540 --> 13:28.850
They respond to both questions or do they only respond to one or are they even more Spohn to one and

13:28.850 --> 13:32.830
it's not the correct response responsiveness for me is huge.

13:32.960 --> 13:38.810
Because the more I ping them and the more they respond in a shorter period of time that shows me that

13:38.810 --> 13:42.200
they're active shows me that they're engage it shows me that they're interested.

13:42.200 --> 13:47.710
Remember previously on the oDesk lecture it shows you how often they respond to their contacts.

13:47.720 --> 13:49.130
That's a great sign.

13:49.130 --> 13:54.860
Now someone who only responds sometimes or they get around to it every 48 hours is not someone that

13:54.860 --> 14:00.350
you want to go into a project with because what happens when your servers crash and you have to message

14:00.350 --> 14:00.730
them.

14:00.770 --> 14:03.340
How responsive are they.

14:03.440 --> 14:07.880
You should try to talk to them outside of these systems.

14:07.910 --> 14:15.470
See if they have Skype they have Skype then you can talk to them directly and with minimal back and

14:15.470 --> 14:16.650
forth time.

14:16.760 --> 14:19.180
I'll talk about that in a little bit more in the next lecture.

14:19.310 --> 14:22.830
Why not having Skype is actually a really bad thing.

14:22.940 --> 14:24.110
Look for responsiveness.

14:24.110 --> 14:26.760
How do you know if there are spots of really simple.

14:26.840 --> 14:29.010
I call it the ping test.

14:29.060 --> 14:34.970
What I do is I will message them a quick question see how fast they respond how is fast within an hour

14:35.060 --> 14:35.810
superfast.

14:35.840 --> 14:37.870
Within two hours that's quite fast.

14:37.870 --> 14:39.290
Are they in another country.

14:39.360 --> 14:43.150
Well if they're not in the country take what I just said and multiply it quite a bit.

14:43.160 --> 14:48.140
I think if they respond within five or six hours considering this is a freelancer Web site and you're

14:48.140 --> 14:54.590
not necessarily a client yet and then you have time zones you can take that into consideration if they're

14:54.590 --> 14:57.990
in your country and they're not responding within a couple hours.

14:58.010 --> 15:00.040
I don't generally like that.

15:00.060 --> 15:04.270
This is also depends on how many people we have bidding on your project and how choosy you want to be.

15:04.280 --> 15:08.570
Personally I do not like people who do not respond and ask them questions and I don't like people who

15:08.570 --> 15:10.120
take a day to respond.

15:10.190 --> 15:11.890
That makes me anxious.

15:11.960 --> 15:17.060
If you want to go a little bit hardcore about it like me I send them a ping message at midnight.

15:17.060 --> 15:18.320
See how they respond.

15:18.350 --> 15:22.920
I'll send them something kind of at the range of when they should be awake when they should be asleep.

15:22.940 --> 15:24.990
I just want to see how connected they are to their phone.

15:25.010 --> 15:26.320
For me this is huge.

15:26.330 --> 15:31.910
Someone who's interested in my project who has a decent amount of experience who is very responsive

15:31.910 --> 15:34.360
is a very good candidate for me.

15:34.400 --> 15:38.900
I think that when we go ahead and do a real live version of this you guys will get a lot more out of

15:38.900 --> 15:39.310
it.

15:39.440 --> 15:43.580
If you have questions at this point in the lecture feel free to post it in the group discussion and

15:43.580 --> 15:45.040
we can talk about it.

15:45.050 --> 15:50.840
There are other criteria I'm leaving out and I admit that these are the five that I care about and they're

15:50.840 --> 15:52.470
not really in any order.

15:52.490 --> 15:55.160
I think that you kind of rate them on all five.

15:55.460 --> 16:00.800
And I think what I'll do is probably attach a tech sheet that you can actually use some kind of visualization

16:00.800 --> 16:03.700
that will help you rate them in your head.

16:04.070 --> 16:08.420
After a while you'll get really good at this and you'll be able to rattle it off very quickly after

16:08.420 --> 16:10.890
a while you also kind of get a gut feeling for.

16:10.940 --> 16:14.150
Is this a good applicant or is this about to print in the next lecture.

16:14.150 --> 16:19.970
I'm going to talk about the five things I've recognized that are red flags that you probably didn't

16:19.970 --> 16:21.390
realize were red flags.
