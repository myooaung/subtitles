00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.910
Okay,

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:07.720
So when this section,

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.290
we're gonna talk about why dogs jump on us in the first place.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:16.860
Most dogs are going to do this jumping behavior because it's kind of innate.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:23.610
They would have been jumping towards their mother's mouth or towards their mom when the mom

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:24.440
would return.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.400
It's pretty natural that they do this.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:33.070
The other reason that the puppies continue to do it into adulthood is we have conditioned

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.750
them to do this.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:35.610
What?

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.860
I mean,

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:36.450
where that is,

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.170
every time we got home or every time the puppy got excited and jumped on us,

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.240
we allowed them to.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:48.180
We even reinforced it by saying O que puppy and loving on them and do whatever else we do.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.750
All of that is actually reinforcing and telling the dollar that we like that they're doing

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.130
that and that it's rewarding to them.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.430
So they're going to keep doing that.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.250
That's most of the time why dogs continue to do this behavior into their adult ages.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.990
Dogs do this because they're excited to see us or see new people or see other things,

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.520
and we have clips of wild dogs doing this so we know what's in a native thing that they

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.320
would be doing in the wild anyways,

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.800
but they don't always do it.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.040
And throughout their whole life they would normally do it as puppies when their mom or dad

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.540
would come home and they would have food in their bellies that they would regurgitate to

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.470
the pups while the pups would look at the mom and dad's faces to get them to kind of

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.410
initiate this regurgitation so they could get fed well,

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:33.400
that behavior,

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.230
if continuously rewarded,

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:36.970
would continue through the dog's life.

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:42.400
The parents don't continue to regurgitate food for their puppies As a dogs get older,

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.900
they stop doing that so eventually becomes not rewarding to jump and look at the other dogs

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:47.580
faces.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:48.860
So they stop doing that.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.520
We never stopped loving on our dogs when I jumped on us,

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.980
so they never learned that was no longer okay.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.080
So in this course,

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.630
we're gonna teach them what to do instead,

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.560
whether that means we want them to sit before people greet them,

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.150
whether that means we want them to down before people greet them.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.520
Whether that means we don't want them to interact with people at all.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.810
Whatever we you was the owner decided you want them to do is what you will be able to teach

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.210
them through this course.

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.740
So Step one,

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.570
I want you to get a video clip.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.260
Maybe just a couple seconds of your dog being introduced to a new person,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.310
or even just you coming through the front door and see how excited they get.

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.180
See how they react.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.220
Watch them jump on.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.880
You watch what you do in response to them.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.390
And that is gonna be your first clip for your,

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.390
uh,

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.750
course project.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:57.590
All right,

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.630
so now on to the next section,

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.250
we're going to talk about what we need to do about this going forward.
