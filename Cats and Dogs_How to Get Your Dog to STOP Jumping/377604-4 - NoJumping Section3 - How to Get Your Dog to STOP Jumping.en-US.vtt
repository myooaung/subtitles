00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.010
step one is going to show you how to get immediate results.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.450
And I mean that in the most literal sense.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.450
What I want to do is to not let them practice this jumping behavior.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.760
What I specifically mean is,

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.040
if you know someone's coming to the door like the door bell has rung and the dog charges

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.510
the door,

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.460
I want you to put a leash on and on physically,

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.660
bring them back to a place that is further away from the door so they cannot reach the new

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.800
person until they're calmer.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.050
You given permission.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.950
So I have a clip here of Mika being tied up on the stairs,

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:43.580
uh,

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.480
stairwell so that she can't get to me until she's calm.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.550
And then the other option is to keep the dog separated.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.110
When I want you to do is either take a leash,

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.060
put it on your dog and tie them to a table or put them in their crate.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.920
Ideally,

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.660
if they're not great trained,

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.490
we were not going to address that in this course,

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.050
but it is a great time to use your crate.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.950
Um,

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.120
otherwise,

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.070
you can put them a leash on them and keep them physically separated.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.380
If you don't have a doorway or some physical buried to keep them away from the new person

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.250
until they are calm,

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.570
you can.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.150
That or you should physically separate them with a doorway or a baby gate or something that

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.410
won't allow them to get to the new persons that they're so excited to meet until they're

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.850
called.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.600
This is step One.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.170
You're gonna get immediate results because you are not going to allow the dog to interact

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.950
with the new person until they're called step One.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:52.620
So how we're gonna practice this is probably gonna need either a friend or a tely sta leash

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.620
.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:53.320
Um,

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.160
you could do this a drone front door.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.680
But I basically want you to do is either have your friend come to the front door or have

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.460
somebody come to you.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.350
Um,

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.720
it could be a significant other.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.010
Just anybody the dog's gonna be excited to see.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.700
And if your dog is excited to see everybody,

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.930
then you can ask anybody to help you.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.340
But if you're all alone and you're doing just you and your dog,

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.350
I totally understand that doing what you're gonna do then is you're going to start with

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.540
putting a leash on your dog and putting them in a place where they can't physically get

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.480
access to you.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.130
Ideally,

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.340
we talk about like a baby gate or a doorway,

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.710
but ideally,

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.800
the door would be something that you could see the dog there so you can monitor whether

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.870
they're calm or not.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.040
If you can't see through the door,

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.600
that's fine.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.580
If the daughter time glass panes in it,

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.850
what you can do is just kind of crack that are open,

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:40.820
See if they're calm.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.400
If they're just ready to charge to the door,

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.750
then you're gonna wait and this is gonna be a waiting game.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.080
It's gonna take a lot of patients,

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:53.350
and this is the first approach of preventing is we just don't want them to act,

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.120
be able to practice that behavior now the other way,

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.400
we can get them to not jump on us.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.450
It's become armed with treats and things to keep them on the ground.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.140
So in certain scenarios wouldn't training.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.430
I have even taken whole handfuls of the dog kibble.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.460
As I approach a dog who I think is gonna jump.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.910
I would just drop all the kibble on the ground and their former interested in going to the

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.380
kibble nine times out of 10.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.150
So they'll stay on the ground and while they're on the ground that they're being rewarded

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.050
by the kibble and then I will approach him and I will calmly touch them and talk to them

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.630
and then reward them that way as well.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.580
So they're being rewarded for being on the floor.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.320
If for any reason,

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.170
they decided to give you all of the attention and tried to jump towards you,

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:45.280
that is when I want you to turn off your attention to them so immediately turn your back,

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.210
walk away.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:47.050
Um,

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.160
do not engage with them whatsoever.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.020
And by that I mean,

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.450
don't touch them at a lot of people.

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:53.980
Want to push the dog off and say,

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:54.250
You know,

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.640
get down,

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.000
get off.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.450
Whatever.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.570
What you're really doing is turning that into a game,

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.070
and it will turn into your dog's favorite game.

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:02.220
If you just push him off,

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.700
push him off,

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:03.460
push him off.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.690
Well,

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.190
that's just a game that they're gonna play with you.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.180
So we're not gonna do that now.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.540
If you're doing this practice with a friend What I'm going to suggest is that you,

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.570
the dog owner,

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:20.470
holds the leash while the dog is attached to the leash and then have the new person

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.150
approach.

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.940
If the dog it's super excited and starts to get their paws off the ground and start to jump

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:27.550
towards the person,

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:33.810
that's gonna be the queue for the other person to turn around just 180 degrees and walk a

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.340
couple steps away and totally ignore the dog.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.170
And as they approached with,

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.780
we want them to be pretty neutral.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.940
They should be making eye contact.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.840
That shouldn't be kissing sounds and talking to the dog.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.300
They should pretty much be walking towards you with a person and ignoring the doc.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.550
This is the ideal,

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.580
easiest way to start.

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:54.840
We can make it more challenging.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:55.360
Give them mortar.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.470
Schalken's as we go,

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.250
but we got to give them a baseline first.

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.100
So as you approach the dog,

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.250
stay calm.

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.130
Don't don't make eye contact with them,

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.430
and don't be reaching towards everything.

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:08.000
Just basically,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.250
go as if you're gonna go shake the owner's hand.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.420
That's the objective for the helper in this case.

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.720
Now,

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.080
while your helper is ignoring the dog.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.960
You,

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.450
the owner should be ignoring the person you focus on your dog,

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:27.500
rewarding them verbally or otherwise for keeping all four paws on the ground.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.720
You can even put them.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.150
You can keep their attention and keep them calm and keep them on the ground.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.640
If you determine that you think your dog is going to be calm enough to interact with the

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:38.210
person,

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:44.860
I like to suggest to the the oncoming person that they asked that they can pet your dog or

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:45.550
whatever like Oh,

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.560
can I say hi was a pretty common thing you say.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.910
And what you should then say is,

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:51.340
Yes,

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:56.590
you can as long as they stay seated and they like to be scratched,

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.270
our patted petted here or there.

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:05.530
So I always like to direct people towards the chin or the chest of the dog because a lot of

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:05.760
dogs,

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.550
if you put their head over there,

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.900
if you put your hand over their head,

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.780
they start to lean up and go towards the hand,

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.170
and that initiates them,

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:13.950
started to jump.

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:17.450
So if you would come in underneath their chin and you do here or there chest,

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:19.650
I probably just bumped the mic.

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:21.830
If you consider that the chin or their chest,

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:26.010
they're not as likely to jump up towards the hand to get that attention there that's gonna

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.650
keep them on the ground that little bit longer.

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:29.710
All right,

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.450
now that you've heard my description on how to practice,

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:33.820
go do it.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:38.770
Get a video of you and your friend or you yourself working with your dog on these behaviors

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:42.550
and this is gonna be your second chapter of your progress video.

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:44.150
Go give it a drying.

00:06:44.150 --> 00:07:06.640
Okay,

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:11.400
before you go have this other really cool tip that I think is one of the coolest things you

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.850
can do in dog training.

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:15.850
And that is when you turn a distraction into acute.

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:19.620
So what I mean by that is a Q is what we say to our dogs.

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:20.450
Sit down,

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:21.150
stay,

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:24.780
come Whatever All of those those commands are accused.

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:26.540
And if we turn a distracter,

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:27.390
a k,

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:34.580
a new person or a person coming to greet you into a Q than we're getting everybody that

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:39.660
comes towards our dog to help us in this process of getting them to not jump on people so

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:42.340
normally when people are gonna approach your dog.

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:42.800
They want that.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.600
You can only say something pretty generic like,

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.380
Can I pet your dog or can I say higher?

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:55.270
Something along those that nature And what you can do is step one is the distracter.

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:59.650
The person's going to se that phrase.

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:05.100
So you have to determine what that the common popular phrases around you in your area.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:11.250
And then what you're gonna do next is you're going to cue the dog to do whatever you want

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:12.680
them to dio whether that be,

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:13.110
sit,

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:16.550
are down or who Whatever you decide,

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:19.350
stay is it wasn't Come next,

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:20.830
then third,

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:23.620
you're gonna communicate with the other person's.

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:23.980
And yeah,

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:25.700
you can pet my dog as long as they sit.

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:26.350
Yeah,

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:26.540
yeah.

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:27.040
Yada.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.470
Will you repeat that cycle?

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:30.650
Enough times that the dog get smart enough.

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:31.580
They don't need to go.

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:35.870
123 They understand that one always leads it to which always leads to three.

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:38.850
So you the person coming up to you was one saying,

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:39.000
Oh,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:39.940
can I pet your dog?

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:41.100
Two.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:45.310
Is you telling your dog to sit and three is them getting rewarded by interacting with the

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:48.590
new person if they find interacted with people rewarding.

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:51.230
And they're probably Those seconds are should be the ones jumping on people.

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:52.450
So you're probably OK there.

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:54.450
Eventually,

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:56.250
your dog is really efficient.

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:59.250
It knows this process that one leads the two that leads the three.

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:02.850
They're eventually going to not need this middle step.

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:03.970
There you go.

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:05.150
Someone has to pet me.

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:09.550
I'm interested in being petted and they plop down and they sit right away.

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:13.560
So that is how you turn a distraction into a Q.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.930
And it is so cool when it happened,

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:17.090
because people are gonna go.

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:17.510
Oh,

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:18.010
wow.

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:22.250
Your dog is so well behaved because they already know what comes next on what they need to

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:25.250
do to get the reward makes sense.
