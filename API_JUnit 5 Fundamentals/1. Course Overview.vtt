Hi everyone.

2
00:00:02.675 --> 00:00:09.363
My name is Esteban Herrera.

3
00:00:09.363 --> 00:00:12.646
Welcome to my course, JUnit 5 Fundamentals.

4
00:00:12.646 --> 00:00:15.645
I have been working with Java for more than 10 years.

5
00:00:15.645 --> 00:00:19.695
I love the language and teaching all I know about it.

6
00:00:19.695 --> 00:00:24.725
An important part of developing high-quality software is testing.

7
00:00:24.725 --> 00:00:29.026
As a developer, you are in charge of unit testing your code,

8
00:00:29.026 --> 00:00:33.419
and in Java, JUnit is the most popular framework for this task.

9
00:00:33.419 --> 00:00:36.817
This course is designed for developers who are new to

10
00:00:36.817 --> 00:00:40.351
unit testing and want to learn JUnit 5,

11
00:00:40.351 --> 00:00:45.619
or already know JUnit 4 and want to learn about the features of the new version.

12
00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:48.455
Some of the major topics that we will cover include the new

13
00:00:48.455 --> 00:00:52.476
architecture of JUnit 5 and the problem it solves,

14
00:00:52.476 --> 00:00:56.931
how to use JUnit to create a static and dynamic test,

15
00:00:56.931 --> 00:01:00.390
how to extend JUnit with the new extension mechanism,

16
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.950
and how to integrate JUnit with Gradle and Maven.

17
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.530
By the end of this course,

18
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.883
you'll understand how to use JUnit 5 to write unit tests.

19
00:01:10.883 --> 00:01:15.568
Before beginning the course, you should have a basic knowledge of Java 8,

20
00:01:15.568 --> 00:01:19.394
streams, lambda expressions, and default methods in interfaces.

21
00:01:19.394 --> 00:01:31.000
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn JUnit 5 with the JUnit 5 Fundamentals course at Pluralsight.
