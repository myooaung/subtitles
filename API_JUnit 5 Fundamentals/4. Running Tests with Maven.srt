00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,670
If you have watched the module Introduction to JUnit 5,

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:09,250
you'll remember I showed you the minimal configuration to run JUnit 5

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:14,690
tests with Maven where you have to configure the Surefire plugin in

4
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:17,540
addition to adding the JUnit dependencies,

5
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,930
but you can also add more options in the configuration

6
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,480
section inside the plugin element.

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,570
You can include wildcard patterns to execute only

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,440
certain classes or even packages.

9
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,330
By default,

10
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:35,840
the Surefire plugin will automatically include all test

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,420
classes with the following patterns,

12
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:43,720
all Java files whose names start or end with Tests,

13
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:48,050
all Java files whose names end with Tests,

14
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:52,890
and all Java files whose names end with TestCase.

15
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,050
And just as you can include classes that don't follow

16
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:01,640
any of these naming conventions, you can also exclude them.

17
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,440
In addition, you can use tags to include or exclude classes.

18
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:11,040
We'll talk about this in the next clip. And in the properties section, you

19
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,240
can set configuration parameters with a key value syntax.

20
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,740
All right, let's review an example of how to filter tests with Maven.

21
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:25,560
I have opened the Maven project that you can find in the directory

22
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,240
of the demos of this module. In the file pom.xml.

23
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:37,050
I already have a Maven Surefire plugin section. So I'm going to add a

24
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:43,100
configuration section to add an includes element to include only the classes

25
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:50,140
of the package com.wiredbraincoffee.reward.tests.

26
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:54,300
I'm going to import the changes, but it's not necessary

27
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:59,110
because instead of using the IDE, I'll use the terminal to

28
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:06,640
execute the command mvnw test.

29
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,230
Maven didn't execute all the tests that this project contains, only the tests

30
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:26,000
contained in the package com.wiredbraincoffee.reward.tests. Tests run 19, skipped 1.
