To learn JUnit, this course will use the following scenario. Imagine we are

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,370
working for the company Wired Brain Coffee. This company owns a chain of

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,640
successful coffee shops all over the country.

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,870
We want to grow and stay competitive, so we are

5
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:21,940
implementing a loyalty program for our customers.

6
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,230
In this program,

7
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:28,840
every order generates points, and you can exchange points for rewards.

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:35,590
In particular, the system can give three types of rewards. A conversion reward.

9
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:36,720
In this case,

10
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:42,740
the customers can convert their points into money. A discount reward.

11
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:46,170
In this case, the system gives a discount for an

12
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,740
amount of points. And a gift reward.

13
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:50,820
In this case,

14
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,290
the system gives a product of the customer's order as

15
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:58,240
a gift for an amount of points.

16
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:08,000
So all the examples and demos of this course will be related to testing the implementation of these types of rewards.
