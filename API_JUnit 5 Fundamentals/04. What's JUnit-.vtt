00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:04.080
This course is about the tool you are going to use

2
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.260
to write a good suite of tests, JUnit.

3
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:13.840
JUnit is a simple, openâ€‘source framework to write and run repeatable tests.

4
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.450
And it's a simple framework indeed.

5
00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.030
Using the API JUnit provides,

6
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.820
you write a class to test some assumptions of another

7
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.740
class or method of your application,

8
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.040
which is usually known as the subject under test.

9
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:36.940
When the test runs, JUnit tells you if those assumptions succeeded or failed.

10
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.040
In terms of the API,

11
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:45.220
JUnit 5 is more an evolutionary rather than a revolutionary release,

12
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.940
at least in comparison to JUnit 3 and JUnit 4.

13
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.720
The main change of this version is it's architecture.

14
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.950
Unlike previous versions of JUnit, JUnit 5 is composed of several

15
00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.840
different modules from three difference of projects,

16
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:13.000
JUnit Platform, JUnit Jupyter, and JUnit Vintage. This is a big change. Let's talk about it.
