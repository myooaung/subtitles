The problem with non-durable topic subscriptions is that if

2
00:00:03,597 --> 00:00:05,793
you are not actively consuming messages,

3
00:00:05,793 --> 00:00:10,170
then typically you do not receive any messages that were published

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,160
to the topic while the client was disconnected.

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,588
We get around this by using a durable subscription.

6
00:00:16,588 --> 00:00:19,381
If I go back to the consumeFromTopic method,

7
00:00:19,381 --> 00:00:21,466
than rather than calling createConsumer,

8
00:00:21,466 --> 00:00:25,595
I can change it to createDurableSubscriber,

9
00:00:25,595 --> 00:00:27,590
which returns a TopicSubscriber object,

10
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:30,782
which we will also return from our method.

11
00:00:30,782 --> 00:00:34,915
Now, we also need to provide the name of our subscription.

12
00:00:34,915 --> 00:00:37,038
It's entirely up to you what you want to call it,

13
00:00:37,038 --> 00:00:39,822
but in my case, I'm going to use test-subscription.

14
00:00:39,822 --> 00:00:41,834
Back in my main method,

15
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:45,178
I'm changing the message consumer to a TopicSubscriber

16
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:47,796
and changing all the references to it.

17
00:00:47,796 --> 00:00:52,639
Now you can see here I'm still closing the TopicSubscriber, that's important.

18
00:00:52,639 --> 00:00:55,587
When you close a durable subscription,

19
00:00:55,587 --> 00:00:57,363
we are basically saying to the message broker,

20
00:00:57,363 --> 00:01:02,230
keep any messages for me until I connect or start again.

21
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,907
We actually need to do one other thing,

22
00:01:04,907 --> 00:01:07,918
which is define a client ID on our connection.

23
00:01:07,918 --> 00:01:11,030
Again, this is pretty much what you want it to be,

24
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,161
depending on your application.

25
00:01:12,161 --> 00:01:14,613
I've just added something arbitrary here.

26
00:01:14,613 --> 00:01:17,305
When you no longer want to keep messages on the

27
00:01:17,305 --> 00:01:20,734
broker while you're disconnected, then you need to close TopicSubscriber,

28
00:01:20,734 --> 00:01:25,586
but you also need to call unsubscribe on the session using

29
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:32,000
the same subscription ID we used earlier, which in my case is test-subscription.
