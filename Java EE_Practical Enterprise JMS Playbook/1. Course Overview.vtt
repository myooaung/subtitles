00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.449
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:01.449 --> 00:00:09.386
My name is Grant Little, and welcome to my Practical Enterprise JMS Playbook.

3
00:00:09.386 --> 00:00:13.445
I have been working as a software developer and architect for over 20 years now,

4
00:00:13.445 --> 00:00:17.681
and a huge proportion of my experience has been in the Java space,

5
00:00:17.681 --> 00:00:19.017
and that includes JMS.

6
00:00:19.017 --> 00:00:21.353
Did you know that many of the world's largest organizations use

7
00:00:21.353 --> 00:00:25.546
messaging systems as a core part of their infrastructure to allow them

8
00:00:25.546 --> 00:00:28.753
to create dynamic and loosely-coupled applications.

9
00:00:28.753 --> 00:00:31.190
This course is specifically designed for using JMS within an enterprise,

10
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.557
not only focusing on the JMS APIs themselves,

11
00:00:34.557 --> 00:00:36.646
but also what other tools can aid you.

12
00:00:36.646 --> 00:00:38.212
By the end of this playbook,

13
00:00:38.212 --> 00:00:41.750
you should have a good understanding of some techniques and

14
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.380
frameworks that will allow your JMS implementation to be

15
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.802
successful in an enterprise setting.

16
00:00:45.802 --> 00:00:49.915
Some of the major topics we will cover include examining the various JMS APIs,

17
00:00:49.915 --> 00:00:52.818
and how these can be applied to solve some complex

18
00:00:52.818 --> 00:00:55.196
problems for production systems, what frameworks,

19
00:00:55.196 --> 00:00:55.614
tools,

20
00:00:55.614 --> 00:00:59.336
and techniques we can use to develop performant and

21
00:00:59.336 --> 00:01:01.389
scalable solutions quickly using JMS,

22
00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:03.522
we'll also look at some tools you'll need in place to be able to

23
00:01:03.522 --> 00:01:06.340
run and administer a successful JMS environment.

24
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.201
Before beginning this course, you should have a good understanding of Java,

25
00:01:09.201 --> 00:01:12.668
as well as a basic understanding of messaging in JMS.

26
00:01:12.668 --> 00:01:15.420
You should also have some knowledge of the Spring Framework or Java

27
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.703
Enterprise Edition to get the most out of it.

28
00:01:19.703 --> 00:01:28.000
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn JMS with this Practical Enterprise JMS Playbook at Pluralsight.
