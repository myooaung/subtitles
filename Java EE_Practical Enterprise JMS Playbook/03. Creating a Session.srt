1
00:00:01,084 --> 00:00:04,035
The next thing we need to create is a session.

2
00:00:04,035 --> 00:00:06,886
Now a session is generally the transactional scope

3
00:00:06,886 --> 00:00:09,024
of one or more JMS operations.

4
00:00:09,024 --> 00:00:10,187
So during the construction of one,

5
00:00:10,187 --> 00:00:14,521
we need to think about whether or not the session is to be transacted,

6
00:00:14,521 --> 00:00:17,498
and also something called the acknowledgement mode.

7
00:00:17,498 --> 00:00:18,991
You'll see those parameters in use,

8
00:00:18,991 --> 00:00:21,496
but I'm going to cover them in more detail in a

9
00:00:21,496 --> 00:00:22,449
later section within this module.

10
00:00:22,449 --> 00:00:25,116
So if you're looking for specific information on those,

11
00:00:25,116 --> 00:00:27,513
then please jump to that section.

12
00:00:27,513 --> 00:00:31,071
Note that this operation can throw a JMS exception.

13
00:00:31,071 --> 00:00:34,556
You can probably tell if you've been following along

14
00:00:34,556 --> 00:00:36,221
that there is a common pattern,

15
00:00:36,221 --> 00:00:40,597
in that we can also create a QueueSession object in a similar way,

16
00:00:40,597 --> 00:00:43,030
as well as a TopicSession object.

17
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:47,481
I'll write those methods out here for completeness.

18
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:52,428
Also, we need to create the XA versions of these three methods.

19
00:00:52,428 --> 00:00:54,354
Creating an XA session is similar,

20
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:58,611
it can be created from a XAConnection object by

21
00:00:58,611 --> 00:01:01,717
calling the createXASession method.

22
00:01:01,717 --> 00:01:04,583
This time you don't need any parameters to the method,

23
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:09,459
following the similar pattern that our createXAQueue session and

24
00:01:09,459 --> 00:01:12,508
createXATopicSession methods that work in a similar way,

25
00:01:12,508 --> 00:01:22,000
you just need to use the XAQueueConnection and XATopicConnection objects respectively.
