There's been a lot of great stuff covered in this module.

00:00:04.308 --> 00:00:09.222
We looked at declaring ConnectionFactories using both XML and annotations,

00:00:09.222 --> 00:00:11.100
message converters, the JmsTemplate,

4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.311
and how it can be used to both send and receive messages,

5
00:00:16.311 --> 00:00:18.776
the Spring DefaultMessageListenerContainer,

6
00:00:18.776 --> 00:00:22.062
and consuming messages asynchronously.

00:00:22.062 --> 00:00:29.000
In the next module, we'll be looking at using JMS within a Java Enterprise Edition environment.
