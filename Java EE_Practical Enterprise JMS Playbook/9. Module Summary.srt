1
00:00:02,383 --> 00:00:04,024
So that's it for this module.

2
00:00:04,024 --> 00:00:05,938
Let's quickly go over what we covered.

3
00:00:05,938 --> 00:00:08,259
I started off by demonstrating how to configure the

4
00:00:08,259 --> 00:00:10,803
WildFly application server for use with JMS.

5
00:00:10,803 --> 00:00:15,779
We then looked at how to define queues and topics inside WildFly.

6
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:16,241
Next,

7
00:00:16,241 --> 00:00:19,965
we looked at creating a generic and reusable-messageSender session

8
00:00:19,965 --> 00:00:23,091
Bean that hides some of our JMS boilerplate code.

9
00:00:23,091 --> 00:00:27,359
We then looked at how we can use a generic messageSender EJB

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,013
to send messages using both the JMS 1.

11
00:00:31,013 --> 00:00:32,383
1 and 2.

12
00:00:32,383 --> 00:00:33,296
0 specifications.

13
00:00:33,296 --> 00:00:35,824
We then looked at how we can receive messages

14
00:00:35,824 --> 00:00:37,412
asynchronously using message-driven Beans.

15
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:38,438
And finally,

16
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:44,100
we looked at how you can implement your own message converter to work

17
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,516
with business objects within your JE application.

18
00:00:46,516 --> 00:00:47,285
In the next module,

19
00:00:47,285 --> 00:00:55,000
we will be looking at administering and monitoring your JMS application within production, so I hope you'll join me for that.
