1
00:00:01,917 --> 00:00:05,191
Well that's it for this module and this Practical

2
00:00:05,191 --> 00:00:06,771
Enterprise JMS Playbook as a whole.

3
00:00:06,771 --> 00:00:08,474
If you followed it all the way through,

4
00:00:08,474 --> 00:00:11,401
then I hope you got enough knowledge to at least start

5
00:00:11,401 --> 00:00:13,587
preparing your JMS solution for the enterprise.

6
00:00:13,587 --> 00:00:17,106
But to quickly recap, let's briefly go over what we covered.

7
00:00:17,106 --> 00:00:19,920
We first started to consider the big question,

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,074
should use JMS at all, and some of the alternatives.

9
00:00:24,074 --> 00:00:25,582
We then looked at some basic JMS plays,

10
00:00:25,582 --> 00:00:29,153
which you can use to refresh yourself if you need to.

11
00:00:29,153 --> 00:00:34,293
Next some more advanced JMS features, which can be useful within the enterprise.

12
00:00:34,293 --> 00:00:35,968
Then we looked at using JMS within the Spring Framework,

13
00:00:35,968 --> 00:00:39,269
some of the benefits it offers, and quickly getting going with JMS,

14
00:00:39,269 --> 00:00:43,794
and removing a lot of the boilerplate code that's required.

15
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:46,842
Then onto JMS within a Java Enterprise Edition environment,

16
00:00:46,842 --> 00:00:49,911
specifically using JNDI to look up your resources,

17
00:00:49,911 --> 00:00:52,475
and the use of the JMS 2.

18
00:00:52,475 --> 00:00:53,122
0 API.

19
00:00:53,122 --> 00:00:54,737
And finally in this module,

20
00:00:54,737 --> 00:00:58,150
we've gone over some techniques for monitoring and

21
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,269
administrating your JMS solution.

22
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:06,000
Well, that's all from me. If you have any questions or queries, then please let me know.
