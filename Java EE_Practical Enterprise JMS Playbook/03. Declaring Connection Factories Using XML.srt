00:00:02,331 --> 00:00:05,153
So to ensure my project compiles and runs,

2
00:00:05,153 --> 00:00:09,113
I've added a couple of dependencies in my project's pom.

3
00:00:09,113 --> 00:00:09,905
xml file.

4
00:00:09,905 --> 00:00:14,557
These are the latest spring-jms and activemq-client jars.

5
00:00:14,557 --> 00:00:15,821
Inside my applicationContext.

6
00:00:15,821 --> 00:00:19,836
xml file, I've declared a new Bean called ActiveMqConnectionFactory,

7
00:00:19,836 --> 00:00:23,694
which creates the ConnectionFactory for us.

8
00:00:23,694 --> 00:00:27,997
The properties are all similar to those we have seen in previous modules.

9
00:00:27,997 --> 00:00:32,733
I'm also creating a second ConnectionFactory called cachingConnectionFactory.

10
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:36,305
It takes our activeMqConnectionFactory as a reference

11
00:00:36,305 --> 00:00:38,318
and effectively acts as a wrapper.

12
00:00:38,318 --> 00:00:40,839
It will take care of caching connections, sessions, etc.

13
00:00:40,839 --> 00:00:41,622
for us.

14
00:00:41,622 --> 00:00:45,663
In its configuration, I've enabled caching to consumers and producers,

15
00:00:45,663 --> 00:00:50,442
as well as telling it to reconnect when an exception occurs.

16
00:00:50,442 --> 00:00:53,251
If you happen to be using Spring within a JEE environment,

17
00:00:53,251 --> 00:00:57,736
then your ConnectionFactory should be registered in the JNDI.

18
00:00:57,736 --> 00:00:58,559
In this case,

19
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:08,000
you should a jndi-lookup to get a reference to your ConnectionFactory for use within Spring and not declare your own.
