00:00:02.692 --> 00:00:05.407
First we declare the message converter we will be using,

2
00:00:05.407 --> 00:00:06.605
which is the MappingJackson2MessageConverter.

3
00:00:06.605 --> 00:00:10.359
You need to set the target type of the message,

4
00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:14.132
in our case we want it to be a text message.

5
00:00:14.132 --> 00:00:16.145
You can also set the name of the JMS property that will be

6
00:00:16.145 --> 00:00:19.048
used to store the fully-qualified class name.

7
00:00:19.048 --> 00:00:22.677
In our case, we'll be using _messageType.

8
00:00:22.677 --> 00:00:25.637
So onto our definition of our JmsTemplates.

9
00:00:25.637 --> 00:00:28.029
First the definition for queue destinations.

10
00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:30.921
I'm simply creating a new instance of the JMS template,

11
00:00:30.921 --> 00:00:34.187
passing in the cachingConnectionFactory in the constructor,

12
00:00:34.187 --> 00:00:37.838
and finally I'm setting the all-important message

13
00:00:37.838 --> 00:00:39.929
converter Bean we just created.

14
00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:41.263
Then onto the topicJmsTemplate,

15
00:00:41.263 --> 00:00:51.000
the only difference between this one and the queueJmsTemplate is to call the method set pubSubDomain with a value of true.
