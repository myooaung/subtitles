Hi, this is Grant Little from Pluralsight,

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:07,685
and welcome to this Practical Enterprise JMS Playbook.

3
00:00:07,685 --> 00:00:10,398
Let's quickly go over some of the content in this course.

4
00:00:10,398 --> 00:00:15,244
To start with, we'll look at should you consider using JMS at all,

5
00:00:15,244 --> 00:00:17,599
some of the pros and cons of using JMS,

6
00:00:17,599 --> 00:00:20,195
we'll be using Apache's ActiveMQ in our examples and demonstrations,

7
00:00:20,195 --> 00:00:26,189
so we will look at getting enough information to get it up and running.

8
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:27,944
We will then cover off some basic JMS use cases.

9
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:30,882
This course does assume you already have some JMS knowledge,

10
00:00:30,882 --> 00:00:33,741
as it's not a beginner's JMS course,

11
00:00:33,741 --> 00:00:37,939
but I have included this as a place you can go back to

12
00:00:37,939 --> 00:00:39,725
and refer to for some basic use cases.

13
00:00:39,725 --> 00:00:42,151
We then look at some more advanced use cases and some of the JMS

14
00:00:42,151 --> 00:00:45,269
features that can typically be useful in an enterprise

15
00:00:45,269 --> 00:00:46,873
environment or for more advanced scenarios.

16
00:00:46,873 --> 00:00:49,499
We then look at some of the frameworks available that

17
00:00:49,499 --> 00:00:51,908
make working with JMS a breeze.

18
00:00:51,908 --> 00:00:55,304
We will look at using JMS with both the Spring Framework and

19
00:00:55,304 --> 00:00:59,303
also within a Java Enterprise Edition, OR JEE environment.

20
00:00:59,303 --> 00:01:00,841
Once you have your code developed,

21
00:01:00,841 --> 00:01:03,195
then you will also need to think about administering and

22
00:01:03,195 --> 00:01:10,000
monitoring your application when it's in the wild, so we will touch on some techniques that can help with that.
