00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.172
We're going to be using Apache's ActiveMQ for our demonstrations.

2
00:00:07.172 --> 00:00:09.421
So this module is all about getting our demonstration

3
00:00:09.421 --> 00:00:10.927
environment configured and working.

4
00:00:10.927 --> 00:00:17.242
Apache ActiveMQ is a fairly typical and widely-used JMS implementation.

5
00:00:17.242 --> 00:00:20.385
It has lots of good features and well matured at this stage.

6
00:00:20.385 --> 00:00:24.280
At the time of recording this course, it does only support though JMS 1.

7
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:24.998
1 specification,

8
00:00:24.998 --> 00:00:28.301
therefore the vast majority of the examples we'll be

9
00:00:28.301 --> 00:00:31.742
looking at will be using the JMS 1.

10
00:00:31.742 --> 00:00:32.602
1 spec.

11
00:00:32.602 --> 00:00:34.895
There is now also a JMS 2 specification,

12
00:00:34.895 --> 00:00:37.338
which does simplify the client API a little.

13
00:00:37.338 --> 00:00:41.710
We will look at some examples of those changes in a later module.

14
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:42.881
So to get started,

15
00:00:42.881 --> 00:00:46.393
let's go to the ActiveMQ website and click on the Download link.

16
00:00:46.393 --> 00:00:51.176
I'm using Linux as my operating system and specifically Linux Mint,

17
00:00:51.176 --> 00:00:52.363
which is based on Ubuntu.

18
00:00:52.363 --> 00:00:55.999
If you're using this or any other Unix-style environment including Mac,

19
00:00:55.999 --> 00:00:59.387
then you can download this version; otherwise,

20
00:00:59.387 --> 00:01:02.605
you'll need to download the Windows version.

21
00:01:02.605 --> 00:01:04.285
Once you've downloaded the archive,

22
00:01:04.285 --> 00:01:07.644
you will then need to extract it a suitable location.

23
00:01:07.644 --> 00:01:11.022
In my case, I'm extracting it to my Applications folder.

24
00:01:11.022 --> 00:01:15.458
Now really I'm only going to be using the ActiveMQ for development purposes.

25
00:01:15.458 --> 00:01:17.710
If you're installing it for a production environment,

26
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.471
then there will be lots of other configuration that you

27
00:01:20.471 --> 00:01:22.662
will need to follow and put in place.

28
00:01:22.662 --> 00:01:25.259
Every JMS implementation is different in this regard.

29
00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.218
I can't directly provide any advice on that,

30
00:01:27.218 --> 00:01:32.318
other than to refer to the documentation for your selected JMS provider.

31
00:01:32.318 --> 00:01:34.575
As this is a course on Practical Enterprise JMS,

32
00:01:34.575 --> 00:01:39.974
not Practical ActiveMQ, I'll use the basic out-of-the-box configuration.

33
00:01:39.974 --> 00:01:41.606
Now that I've extracted the archive,

34
00:01:41.606 --> 00:01:44.625
I'm going to change directory into this created folder,

35
00:01:44.625 --> 00:01:49.189
and then look for the BIN folder and change into that.

36
00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:50.928
There are a few files in this folder,

37
00:01:50.928 --> 00:01:56.323
but I'm going to use the ActiveMQ executable script with a parameter of start.

38
00:01:56.323 --> 00:01:59.268
On Windows, you will find a similar ActiveMQ.

39
00:01:59.268 --> 00:02:02.458
bat file that you can execute in a similar fashion.

40
00:02:02.458 --> 00:02:04.077
Now that the server is running,

41
00:02:04.077 --> 00:02:07.970
I can go back a directory and look into the data directory.

42
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.536
This is where the log files are placed,

43
00:02:09.536 --> 00:02:12.589
so you can have a look there to see if there are any

44
00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:14.272
issues or want any further information.

45
00:02:14.272 --> 00:02:14.616
Actually,

46
00:02:14.616 --> 00:02:17.712
from this file it shows me the admin consoles

47
00:02:17.712 --> 00:02:19.864
available on localhost on port 8161.

48
00:02:19.864 --> 00:02:24.096
So if I open a web browser, and go to that URL,

49
00:02:24.096 --> 00:02:25.747
then I can see the application is running.

50
00:02:25.747 --> 00:02:30.738
I specifically want to look in the Manage ActiveMQ Broker section.

51
00:02:30.738 --> 00:02:34.737
So I'll click on that link, and I'm prompted for a username and password.

52
00:02:34.737 --> 00:02:38.757
The default username is admin, and the password is also admin.

53
00:02:38.757 --> 00:02:38.907
Again,

54
00:02:38.907 --> 00:02:40.705
this is the kind of thing you want to change if you're

55
00:02:40.705 --> 00:02:42.352
creating a production and configuration.

56
00:02:42.352 --> 00:02:45.270
Now that I'm in the Broker admin console,

57
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.254
it gives me some basic information about the host machine,

58
00:02:48.254 --> 00:02:50.329
service uptime, and resources used.

59
00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:55.655
Using the sections along the top, Ic an look at various bits of information,

60
00:02:55.655 --> 00:02:57.587
including the various queues, topics, subscriptions,

61
00:02:57.587 --> 00:02:57.876
etc.

62
00:02:57.876 --> 00:03:01.695
Most of them are going to be empty, but just to show that,

63
00:03:01.695 --> 00:03:03.487
I'll click on the queue section.

64
00:03:03.487 --> 00:03:06.088
As expected, we currently have no queues registered,

65
00:03:06.088 --> 00:03:08.324
so there's nothing to display.

66
00:03:08.324 --> 00:03:10.113
Let's test the broker.

67
00:03:10.113 --> 00:03:12.792
I can click on the Send link along the top.

68
00:03:12.792 --> 00:03:16.064
This brings up a page that allows me to send a text message onto a queue

69
00:03:16.064 --> 00:03:20.162
that theoretically could be consumed by a JMS client.

70
00:03:20.162 --> 00:03:21.272
Let's send a message.

71
00:03:21.272 --> 00:03:23.770
So, it's going to be going to the foo.

72
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:29.179
bar queue, and I'll simply enter some text into the text box for the message.

73
00:03:29.179 --> 00:03:30.317
This is a test.

74
00:03:30.317 --> 00:03:31.739
Then we click on Send.

75
00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.271
Now if I go back to the queue section,

76
00:03:34.271 --> 00:03:37.092
then I can see we now have a queue called foo.

77
00:03:37.092 --> 00:03:39.853
bar, and it has one message pending consumption.

78
00:03:39.853 --> 00:03:44.909
In the Views section, there are a number of useful links that we can use.

79
00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:45.414
For now,

80
00:03:45.414 --> 00:03:48.645
we're simply going to click on the Atom fee to give us an XML

81
00:03:48.645 --> 00:03:50.922
representation of the message that was sent.

82
00:03:50.922 --> 00:03:54.928
And here we can see the message content we sent.

83
00:03:54.928 --> 00:03:57.080
I can also perform some operations,

84
00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.387
which include sending another message to the queue,

85
00:03:59.387 --> 00:04:00.478
which we have already demonstrated,

86
00:04:00.478 --> 00:04:03.611
but we can also purge or remove all the messages from the

87
00:04:03.611 --> 00:04:05.621
queue by clicking on the Purge link.

88
00:04:05.621 --> 00:04:09.742
As you can now see, the pending message count has gone to 0,

89
00:04:09.742 --> 00:04:11.923
as the message has been de-queued.

90
00:04:11.923 --> 00:04:15.551
I can also delete the queue from here by clicking on the Delete link.

91
00:04:15.551 --> 00:04:17.897
There's a lot more you can do and see in here,

92
00:04:17.897 --> 00:04:21.434
so I'd advise you to take the time and take a look around the various views.

93
00:04:21.434 --> 00:04:22.917
If you mess things up,

94
00:04:22.917 --> 00:04:26.144
then you can easily stop the message broker and extract the

95
00:04:26.144 --> 00:04:28.375
downloaded package again to ensure everything is clean.

96
00:04:28.375 --> 00:04:30.543
In fact, let's jump back quickly to the commandline,

97
00:04:30.543 --> 00:04:33.531
and show you how you can stop the broker.

98
00:04:33.531 --> 00:04:35.557
Well, it's pretty obvious really.

99
00:04:35.557 --> 00:04:38.414
Rather than calling ActiveMQ with a parameter of start,

100
00:04:38.414 --> 00:04:40.901
you call it with a parameter of stop.

101
00:04:40.901 --> 00:04:43.599
Although this course assumes some knowledge of JMS already,

102
00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:51.000
the next module is comprised of various plays that you can refer back to for some basic tasks in JMS.
