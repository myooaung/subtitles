1
00:00:00,706 --> 00:00:04,182
Sometimes messages need to be consumed based on some priority,

2
00:00:04,182 --> 00:00:05,870
although you can't guarantee this,

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:10,094
you can give hints to the message broker to at least try.

4
00:00:10,094 --> 00:00:12,165
Jumping back to the sendMessageToTopic method,

5
00:00:12,165 --> 00:00:14,682
and by the way, you can do this for queues as well,

6
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:18,496
on the messageProducer, I'm calling the setPriority method,

7
00:00:18,496 --> 00:00:22,080
passing in a value of 9, which is the highest priority,

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,721
0 is the lowest, and 4 is the default if it's not set.

9
00:00:26,721 --> 00:00:30,788
Generally priority 0 to 4 are considered normal priority,

10
00:00:30,788 --> 00:00:33,500
while 5 to 9 are expedited.

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,106
Doing it this way will mean all messages sent by the

12
00:00:36,106 --> 00:00:37,924
messageProducer will have a priority of 9.

13
00:00:37,924 --> 00:00:41,079
If you do want to do it on a message-by-message basis,

14
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:44,609
then you need to do it a different way.

15
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:48,492
In this case, you need to use a different variant of the send method.

16
00:00:48,492 --> 00:00:51,950
You still pass the message as the first parameter,

17
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:55,929
second is the delivery mode, which I've set to be NON_PERSISTENT,

18
00:00:55,929 --> 00:00:58,618
and the third is the message priority.

19
00:00:58,618 --> 00:01:00,319
So to be realistic,

20
00:01:00,319 --> 00:01:04,902
this would probably become a parameter of the sendTextMessageToTopic method,

21
00:01:04,902 --> 00:01:06,823
and then set here.

22
00:01:06,823 --> 00:01:12,281
The fourth parameter is the set time to live, which we'll come to in a second.

23
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:15,526
Doing it on the send method allows you to control

24
00:01:15,526 --> 00:01:17,149
the priority for every message.

25
00:01:17,149 --> 00:01:19,326
Sometimes a message might have a finite lifespan,

26
00:01:19,326 --> 00:01:22,978
for example, you might expect a message to be processed within 10 seconds.

27
00:01:22,978 --> 00:01:23,707
If it hasn't,

28
00:01:23,707 --> 00:01:26,136
then some other part of the system will notice that

29
00:01:26,136 --> 00:01:28,652
message hasn't been processed and try again.

30
00:01:28,652 --> 00:01:32,450
You don't want lots of these messages building up in your queues or topics.

31
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,958
In this situation, you want them to expire.

32
00:01:35,958 --> 00:01:39,782
Again, we can do this for all the messages sent by a messageProducer,

33
00:01:39,782 --> 00:01:42,273
by setting the time to live on that producer.

34
00:01:42,273 --> 00:01:46,582
The value is in milliseconds with a default of 0,

35
00:01:46,582 --> 00:01:48,737
meaning the messages don't expire.

36
00:01:48,737 --> 00:01:52,705
Similar to the message priority, we can also set it on a per-message basis.

37
00:01:52,705 --> 00:01:54,976
Again, to be relevant in this situation,

38
00:01:54,976 --> 00:02:02,000
it would probably be more likely to be passed in as a parameter to the sendTextMessageToTopic method.
