00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:04.770
The best way to learn any programming languages by

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.385
applying the concepts in solving real-world use case.

00:00:08.385 --> 00:00:10.905
Welcome to this course of your Python project

00:00:10.905 --> 00:00:14.340
using real-world coding framework and unit testing.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.960
This course will take you from

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.740
your academic background to a real-world Python developer role.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.665
You'll learn how to organize the code,

00:00:22.665 --> 00:00:25.470
how to do logging and error handling,

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.055
how to read configuration from properties fail,

00:00:29.055 --> 00:00:32.140
and various other concepts.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.470
In the real world is a Python developer.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.250
You will be testing your code before handing it over to the acuity.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.530
In this course, you'll learn how to unit test

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.350
your Python application using various techniques.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.490
This course is very hands-on and we abused by Chuck for all our development one,

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.505
PyCharm is a popular idea in the real world.

00:01:04.505 --> 00:01:10.070
You'll start from basic Python concepts and step-by-step understand how to build

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.650
an application following some of the industry best practices is part of the project work.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.905
You learn how to interact with a database from a Python application.

00:01:18.905 --> 00:01:22.100
You'll also learn how to build rest API using Python,

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.920
a popular way of extending data in the real world.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.740
You do not need to have any prior knowledge in Python.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.730
However, if your basic programming skills and some database knowledge,

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.950
then we're definitely succeed in this course.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.480
Let's dive in and get started.
