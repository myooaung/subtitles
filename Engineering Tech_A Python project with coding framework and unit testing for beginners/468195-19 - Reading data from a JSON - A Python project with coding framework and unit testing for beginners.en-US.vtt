00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
Let's now see how to read data from a file.

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.425
And later on, we'll use that data to insert into the database table.

00:00:07.425 --> 00:00:10.485
Will go to JSON editor online.

00:00:10.485 --> 00:00:13.425
Upper typing the JSON string in the Code tab,

00:00:13.425 --> 00:00:14.730
you click on the three tab.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.050
If everything is fine,

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:17.385
it would load correctly.

00:00:17.385 --> 00:00:19.740
But if there are any errors, for example,

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.525
if I put a single quote here,

00:00:21.525 --> 00:00:23.460
it shows an error here.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.965
If we click on tree, it would not load.

00:00:25.965 --> 00:00:29.610
Json is a popular way to access data in the real world.

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:35.070
And we would be storing the course information in a JSON file and reading it from there.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.680
And later, we'll use this data to insert into the database table.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.665
Let's copy this. Within PyCharm.

00:00:42.665 --> 00:00:48.900
Let's create a new JSON file under the root directory called cornstarch JSON.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.770
Now we'll go to index.php.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.750
Can read that JSON file.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.210
To work with JSON files in Python,

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.150
you need to first import that JSON package.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.205
Simply do importation fast duty to read the content of the file.

00:01:10.205 --> 00:01:14.840
And you can read that the way you read content from any text file.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.370
With open, then the filename that is courts dot JSON.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.965
Now let's declare a variable called new course,

00:01:24.965 --> 00:01:33.230
and we'll simply say JSON.org if we need to convert the JSON string before printing.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.980
Now we can see new courses getting printed here.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.370
It is reading the content from the JSON file that

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.270
we just created and displayed in the console.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.210
Now let's make a few other changes.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.400
Will change the file type is JSON here.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.990
Whatever JSON string we are creating will return that. From here.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.600
Let's have a variable grade Jason.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.070
And we'll populate God,

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.975
return value in that variable.

00:02:14.975 --> 00:02:21.695
Let's print it here also. It runs fine.

00:02:21.695 --> 00:02:26.970
And we can see that it is getting displayed in the driver program.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.180
Next, we'll understand how to insert this JSON string to the course catalog pebble.
