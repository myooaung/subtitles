00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:05.745
Let's download it and install Postgres equal.

00:00:05.745 --> 00:00:11.140
Go to post-classic collapse eight and go to the download link.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.515
I'll be downloading for Windows.

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:19.960
Click on download the installer.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.890
Let's pick 10 dot 14.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.710
I will download for Windows 64-bit.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.990
Once downloaded, click on the installer.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.710
Click Next.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.070
You can leave the default directory.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.850
No need for stock below.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.400
Will give our admin.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.710
Admin, you can choose any password.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.020
5, 4, 3, 2 is the default port.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:04.535
Let's install. Suppose this sequence has been installed.

00:01:04.535 --> 00:01:16.140
To Lord post-classic will simply take BCR and click on it.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.304
Bcr administer interface to a database.

00:01:21.304 --> 00:01:26.015
It opens it in localhost port phi 1, 4, 0, 1.

00:01:26.015 --> 00:01:29.690
If PCR, when takes time to Lord search where PC quill,

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.810
which should also be present on your machine.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.189
That is the command-line tool to Enter postgres.

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:40.040
When prompted for local laws just hit

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.275
Enter on database or default database postgres hit Enter.

00:01:45.275 --> 00:01:49.290
What is 542, that's 34 port.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:56.569
And the username which Postgres password for the user positivists.

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:59.690
So that is the password that you would have given during installation.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.195
I gave Arduino, so I'll enter that.

00:02:02.195 --> 00:02:05.615
And now I am in the Postgres database.

00:02:05.615 --> 00:02:07.625
Let me clear this schema,

00:02:07.625 --> 00:02:13.220
create schema, future R6 schema.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:19.040
Makes sure you have the semicolon up terribly DDL SQL statement.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.605
I'll create a schema, schema and then magically the table schema,

00:02:24.605 --> 00:02:27.245
dark future Next underscore course catalog.

00:02:27.245 --> 00:02:32.030
But w lab, six fields edge described here.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.670
So the table got created successfully.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.015
Let's insert some records to this course catalog pebble.

00:02:41.015 --> 00:02:42.980
This table lays course ID,

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.685
course name, course 67, and creation date,

00:02:46.685 --> 00:02:49.850
where inserting a row with course I did

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.480
two course name Hadoop Spark hotter as future skill,

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.550
and this is the core sex.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:56.930
And in a JSON format,

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.660
we specified the core section type education or course name.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.345
It is varchar character waiting,

00:03:05.345 --> 00:03:09.020
which is like stream course ID's integer and not null.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.795
Clear some date is date which is not null.

00:03:11.795 --> 00:03:14.615
And we've added a constraint dot-dot-dot.

00:03:14.615 --> 00:03:16.400
Course ID is the primary key.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.570
Let's hit Enter.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.720
We do not enter the schema name correctly. Let's do that.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.655
Insert another row.

00:03:25.655 --> 00:03:28.505
Now we have entered two rows.

00:03:28.505 --> 00:03:31.770
Let's select data from this table.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:39.020
We can see that we have a futuristic schema course catalog table.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.470
And within that we have two records.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.015
So this is how we can install Postgres and create Schema,

00:03:47.015 --> 00:03:54.210
create table, and use this database for your application development.
