00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.925
Till now we have built a Python application which can store some data in a database.

00:00:05.925 --> 00:00:09.495
And we have also built a module which can read data from that database.

00:00:09.495 --> 00:00:13.350
Let's now understand how we can give people access to read and write from

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.540
this database without giving them

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.605
all the database credentials or access to our Python modules.

00:00:19.605 --> 00:00:22.590
We just learned about rest web service.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.085
Using rest, we can create different endpoints

00:00:26.085 --> 00:00:30.240
through which people can read or write data from our application.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.810
Using race to exchange data over HTTP protocol.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.220
You can specify what is the method type for your rest API.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.460
In this course, we'll learn about HTTP methods, GET and post.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.440
If we are using GET method,

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.035
the requested parameters will be sent in the URL,

00:00:48.035 --> 00:00:52.325
where it's what post method the parameters get sent in the request body,

00:00:52.325 --> 00:00:54.620
which makes it more secure.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.740
Let's dive in and build their HTPS.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.850
What are Python application?
