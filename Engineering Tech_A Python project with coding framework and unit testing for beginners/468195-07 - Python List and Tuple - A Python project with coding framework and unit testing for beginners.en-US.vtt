00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
We'll now look at another Python collection data type

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.345
called tuples and see how it is different from list.

00:00:06.345 --> 00:00:08.565
Let's create a new project.

00:00:08.565 --> 00:00:11.650
We'll call it python collections.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.430
Let's declare a list.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:20.470
Again. We'll have four elements and let's print the list.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:33.520
We can also print specific elements by giving the index number in square bracket.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.780
At index 2, we have three that got printed.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.995
Now let's declare a tuple.

00:00:41.995 --> 00:00:43.955
In Python, we have something called tuple,

00:00:43.955 --> 00:00:46.280
which can also store a sequence of elements.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.680
Those elements are captured within parenthesis.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.430
And let's print the tuple.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.810
Will also print one of the elements from the tuple.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.190
It works pretty much the same way as the list,

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.335
but there is one key difference.

00:01:09.335 --> 00:01:11.105
Tuples are immutable.

00:01:11.105 --> 00:01:13.505
We can add more elements to the list.

00:01:13.505 --> 00:01:18.900
For example, we can say my list append five.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.730
It got added at the end, printed.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.310
Now let's try to do the same thing to the tuple.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.060
There is no R-dot append method.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.205
We cannot modify a couple.

00:01:37.205 --> 00:01:39.290
So tuples are immutable.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.980
We can remove an element from a list by using the pop method.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:52.050
Let's simply do pop and it will remove the last element.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.095
We can also do pop and specify an illuminated a particular index.

00:02:00.095 --> 00:02:04.610
For example, let's delete the element which is at the second index, that is 2.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.830
Second index is one.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.680
Index number starts with 0.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.380
We can see that two Guard remote.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.750
We cannot remove an element from a couple.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.350
So tuples are immutable.
