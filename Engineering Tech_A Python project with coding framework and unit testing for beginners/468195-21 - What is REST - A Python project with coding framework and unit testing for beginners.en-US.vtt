00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.550
In the next few lab,

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.430
we'll be building rest web service using Python.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.930
So let's understand what is service or web service in the internet world?

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:17.140
Web service is a software that makes itself available over the Internet.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.730
A web service can be accessed over HTTP,

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.769
FTP, and many other protocols.

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.100
Typically digitizer extends in XML or JSON format.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.220
Now, in the real-world,

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.320
you'll see many examples of web service.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.870
For example, in the airline might exported stickers

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.875
availability status to a travel portal through web service.

00:00:37.875 --> 00:00:42.970
It doesn't need to give the travel portal direct taxes to its database.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.330
Race is a popular way of accessing web service,

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.695
restaurants per representative state transport using wrist,

00:00:51.695 --> 00:00:55.700
you can access the web service and access data in XML or JSON format.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.820
Json format is more widely used.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.445
There's some contents key-value pair.

00:01:01.445 --> 00:01:03.650
Any application which wants to extract data from

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.170
a web service can get a JSON response and

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.720
directly read that response or convert that to

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.480
a class and object and then read the response.
