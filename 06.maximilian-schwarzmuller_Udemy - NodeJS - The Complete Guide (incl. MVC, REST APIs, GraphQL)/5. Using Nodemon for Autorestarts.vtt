00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.220
So for now we got that nodemon package installed and it will just work because it automatically installed

2
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.480
all the dependencies

3
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.110
this package needs in turn.

4
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.260
So how can we now use it?

5
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:22.630
Nodemon is a utility tool and it allows us to run our application, our node application through this

6
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
package here which will run node apps.js

7
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:33.250
in the end but which will also watch our files for changes and restart the process for us if

8
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.700
we do change something. So we can simply change start here,

9
00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.520
so the node app.js command to nodemon app.js

10
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:49.060
and this will look for a nodemon tool which it will find in this project because we installed it

11
00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.690
here. As a side note

12
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.380
if you were to run nodemon app.js down there, you would get an error that this command is not found

13
00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.590
because it's only installed in this project and not globally on your machine but the terminal will try

14
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.020
to find this globally. Here

15
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.070
it will work because this will look globally.

16
00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:15.460
So if you now run npm start, this will simply start the node server and output some extra information

17
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.680
and if you now go to your routes.js file and edit something,

18
00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.210
let's just add an extra line and you save that file, you see it's restarting.

19
00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:31.660
And this of course is very convenient because now, we dont have to spend time on manually exiting and

20
00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:32.540
restarting,

21
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.630
now is this done for us.
