00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,760
So how does sending mails work?

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:09,680
Well we obviously get our node server with our code and we get our user and we want to send an email

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,010
to that user.

4
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:19,400
Now it's super important to understand and a common misconception that node and expressjs, these are

5
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:26,210
language or frameworks runtimes that we use for writing our server side logic but with nodejs,

6
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:32,870
you can't trivially create a mailing server. Handling mails

7
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:36,360
is totally different to handling incoming requests and responses,

8
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:41,690
it's a totally different technology, something totally different happens behind the scenes.

9
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:48,980
Therefore in reality, you will very likely never implement your own mail server because that is a very

10
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,210
complex task,

11
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:56,840
creating a mail server that is capable of handling thousands or one hundred thousands of e-mails

12
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:02,290
at the same time, sending them and so on, security, all that stuff is highly complex,

13
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:08,180
so in reality you typically use third party mail servers for that and that is exactly what we will

14
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,310
do in this module too

15
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:14,650
but I will show you how to interact with such a service to send that e-mail through that service.

16
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:21,440
And by the way all major web applications you might be interacting with including Udemy don't have

17
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:28,850
their own mail servers, they are using third party providers like AWS or whatever it is for sending

18
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:29,420
e-mails,

19
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,790
so that is exactly what we will do in this module too.
