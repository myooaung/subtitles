1
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,290
Now let me get rid of that existing code,

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:08,560
you find a snapshot of the code we wrote thus far attached to the last lecture and

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,220
let me write some new code.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:18,780
An important thing you work with or important data structure you work with in javascript are objects.

5
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:24,060
You could have something like the person object and you create an object typically with curly braces

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,270
and then in there, you have key value pairs.

7
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:33,110
You define the key by simply typing, well whichever key you want to use, let's say name

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,500
then you have a colon, you must have the colon and after the colon,

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,690
you have your value,

10
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:43,840
in my case a string Max and then with a comma, you can add another key value pair,

11
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,050
age 29.

12
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:55,280
Now this is an object and I can log person here, if I now execute play.js, we see that object being

13
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,490
printed here.

14
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,020
Now objects allow us to group data together,

15
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:06,900
you can also not just have variables in there so to say but you can also have functions in there,

16
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:14,700
for example a greet function and there you can simply have an anonymous arrow function or an arrow function

17
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,390
general as a value after the colon and then in there, you could have console log

18
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:24,200
Hi I am

19
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:30,270
and then the name and this would now be accessed with the this keyword, instead of an object you have

20
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,020
to use this to

21
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:37,240
typically and there is something special about this which I showed in that video I linked before

22
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,610
in an earlier lecture

23
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,340
but typically this refers to the surrounding object

24
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:45,050
and now we can use the dot notation,

25
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:48,870
so dot to access properties or methods,

26
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,630
so variables or functions inside of that object,

27
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,330
so we could now use this name.

28
00:01:54,520 --> 00:02:02,280
And now I can use that person and call greet with the dot notation and executing it as a function,

29
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:08,860
so the dot notation is important on this which refers to the object or on you, referring to that object

30
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:14,680
which is stored in this constant here. And now if I execute this again, I'm saying hey I'm undefined,

31
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,770
now why is that?

32
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:20,880
Well the reason for that indeed is what I talked here about arrow functions.

33
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:30,100
This now here refers to the global scope, to the global node runtime scope and not to this object, to

34
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,020
have it refer to that,

35
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:40,830
we either have to use the old school function, like this. Now if I repeat that, I'm saying Hey I'm Max or

36
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:46,550
we use a slightly different approach or syntax here in an object

37
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,000
and that is you don't use an arrow function but you use greet like that.

38
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:58,680
So you omit the colon, add the parentheses after the key name and then without a function keyword or

39
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,970
anything like that, you add your function body

40
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,950
and now this is a method of this object

41
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,770
and you see

42
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,480
Hi I'm Max too now.

43
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,320
So this is something important and this is the syntax you'll see me use throughout this course, without the colon

44
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:17,340
parentheses right after the key and then the function body.
