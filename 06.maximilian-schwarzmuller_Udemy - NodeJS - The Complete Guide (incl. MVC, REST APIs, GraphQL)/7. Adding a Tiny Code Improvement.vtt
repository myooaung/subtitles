One quick word about my current set up here by the way, since I return my redirect to signup here and

2
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.110
we do this in a then block, this will actually redirect, this is correct but it will still execute the

3
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.680
next then block, this is how promises work.

4
00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:20.330
So this code execution in this function does finish because I return but the overall code execution does

5
00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.560
not and therefore we reached the next then block even if we redirect

6
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:32.690
and that is why we get this password is required error when we use an existing email because we reached

7
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:38.590
this then block and the function in there but hashed password will be undefined here because since we return

8
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.890
after redirecting, we never execute the hash function

9
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.660
so we reach this function without the hashed password

10
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.520
and this is why we get this error. So the result is the same

11
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:55.370
but if you want to avoid this, what you can do is you can take that code and actually chain it in

12
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:56.200
here,

13
00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.100
so I have a nested promise instead of one promise chain with multiple then blocks,

14
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.450
we will end after this then block if we redirect, there only is the catch block here for catching errors

15
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.010
of which we don't have one

16
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:15.010
and then the server then blocks here are only executed if we make it into the hashing mode.

17
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.330
That is a tiny improvement that logically makes more sense here.
