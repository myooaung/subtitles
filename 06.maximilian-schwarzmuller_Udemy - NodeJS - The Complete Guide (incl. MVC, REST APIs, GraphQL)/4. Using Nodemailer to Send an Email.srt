00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:10,580
I added nodemailer and now I want to use nodemailer to send an email. For that in my auth.js file

2
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,080
which is the only file where I will interact with it,

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:18,330
I will import nodemailer and store it in a constant at the top,

4
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:25,000
so require nodemailer like this and I will also import sendgridTransport,

5
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:31,550
you can name these constants the way you want as always and this will inport nodemailer sendgridTransport.

6
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:33,770
With that imported,

7
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:39,680
I can initialise a couple of things here. For nodemailer, we need to initialize a so-called transporter,

8
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:44,590
so that is essentially some setup telling nodemailer how your e-mails will be delivered

9
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:48,350
because as I mentioned, nodejs won't do this on its own,

10
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,730
you need some third party service for that.

11
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:58,870
So here I will use nodemailer and then call the create transport method. In create transport,

12
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:05,210
we can now pass sendgridTransport and execute this as a function because this function will then

13
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:10,170
return a configuration that nodemailer can use to use sendgrid.

14
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:17,990
Now to that sendgridTransport function, we pass an object where we pass an auth object and this in turn

15
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:25,310
holds an object where we have to pass in an API user and an API key field.

16
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:29,480
Now both are values you get from inside your sendgrid account,

17
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:39,110
so if you head back to your sendgrid account, you can click on settings here and then API keys and

18
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,250
there, create a new API key.

19
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:47,830
You want to give that a name and I'll name it node shop, the name is totally up to you

20
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:52,510
and I'll take full access and create this.

21
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,910
Now take that key and you actually only need that key,

22
00:01:55,910 --> 00:02:01,010
tou could have used your username and password but I'll just use the API key.

23
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:06,020
So just that key which you copied here, of course use your own key not mine

24
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,810
and with that, you configured the transporter.

25
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:17,650
Now with the transporter configured, you can now use it to send an e-mail and I want to send an e-mail

26
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,190
after signing up let's say, so in post sign up once I'm done,

27
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:28,660
so here when I also redirect back to the login page, here I want to send my message

28
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,510
and I use the transporter for that

29
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:34,860
and then there is a send mail method we can execute. To that method,

30
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:39,800
you pass a javascript object where you configure the email you want to send,

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,740
for example the two fields, so to whom this should go,

32
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:51,000
well this should go to our e-mail address of course from, so which e-mail address will be displayed

33
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:56,570
and here I will have shop@nodecomplete.com

34
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:08,130
let's say, then a subject, sign up succeeded and then html content, so the content of your message.

35
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,500
Now you could have a complex html message,

36
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:13,110
I'll just add a h1 tag here,

37
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:18,060
you successfully signed up, like that.

38
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:25,040
So this is the message I want to send, now send mail then gives me a promise so I can use then and

39
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:31,580
catch or of course I simply return that and then I redirect in the next then block, so once the email

40
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:37,040
has been sent. However that is up to you, you could also redirect immediately and not wait for this to

41
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,360
be sent because you're not really relying on that being sent

42
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,660
and so this will send

43
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,640
and at the same time you redirect,

44
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:51,530
so whatever you want. What you should do though is if that is your plan, you might want to switch positions

45
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:59,110
here and still return that so that you can still catch any errors that are stemming from this

46
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:06,290
so that here we could still log any errors we might be getting or do something else with these errors

47
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:09,800
of course. With this set up added,

48
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,990
let's give it a try.

49
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,780
Let's head over and sign up

50
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:16,460
and now you should use a real e-mail address of course

51
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,880
otherwise it can't arrive,

52
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,570
click sign up here,

53
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,210
I am redirected

54
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:25,800
and now check your e-mail account

55
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:31,460
and in that e-mail account, you should have an e-mail from shop@nodecomplete.com with that message.

56
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:37,810
If you don't get it, verify you entered a correct e-mail and also feel free to verify your sendgrid

57
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:38,380
e-mail,

58
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:43,480
you should have gotten an e-mail from sendgrid when signing up verifying your e-mail address there.

59
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:49,780
But with that, this should work and you should be able to send e-mails like this.

60
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:55,780
Now dive into the official sendgrid docs and also in the nodemailer docs if you want to learn way more

61
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,670
about what you can do there,

62
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:03,250
also as I mentioned, google for nodemailer and your favorite e-mailing service if you want to use a

63
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,140
different one

64
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:07,510
but this is the general theme of how this works.
