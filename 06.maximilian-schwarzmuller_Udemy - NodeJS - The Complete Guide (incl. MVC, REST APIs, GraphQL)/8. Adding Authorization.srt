1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,130
So how can we add authorization?

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:10,720
I want to ensure that I can't delete or edit this book with or this product with the wrong account.

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,380
Now we do have important information stored on the product,

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,990
we know which user did create it,

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:22,780
so in the end we just want to check if the currently logged in user is the user who created that before

6
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,830
allowing any edits to that item.

7
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:33,550
And that means that on the admin controller where we render our admin list here, get products here,

8
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,790
I only want to render products that were created by the logged in user because there is no sense in

9
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:46,520
showing products on this page that were not created by the user because we're in the admin section,

10
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,720
you are not able to do anything with it if you weren't a creator.

11
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:56,080
So authorization simply means we restrict the permissions and we can do that by restricting the data

12
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,590
we return for example,

13
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:05,770
so here when I find product, I dont find all but I'll add a filter and I'll filter for products where the

14
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:13,480
user ID is equal to the user id of the currently logged in user, so user ID is equal to request user

15
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,720
id, whoops, ID

16
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:23,420
and keep in mind request user exists because we do extract that user in app.js in a separate middleware

17
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:25,030
here, there

18
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,130
I do store the user in request

19
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:38,070
user, so I know that only products which were created by that user should be retrieved. With that changed

20
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:47,760
if I reload this page, I find no products for test2 but if I do login with my other account with

21
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,960
test@test.com and I go to admin products, I do find that book,

22
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:54,920
so that is the first important step forward.

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,250
The problem is I could theoretically still issue requests behind the scenes where I do try to delete

24
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,070
a product which was not created by me,

25
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:04,200
so more protection is needed.

26
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:05,590
Let's add that next.
