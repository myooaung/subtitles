00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:07.790
So now that we had a very close look at that whole express middleware thing and how routing works in

2
00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.900
express and how we can use that to our advantage, how we can filter routes and so on,

3
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.930
let's actually start working on what we serve to the user.

4
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:23.540
Thus far it has always been some dummy html content but you're probably not in the course to just learn

5
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.430
how to build dummy html content,

6
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:32.690
so let's return some real html files to the user that also don't look like crap.

7
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.380
For this I'll create a new folder in my project and I'll name it views,

8
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.920
now that name is up to you,

9
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:46.160
you can also name that folder whatever you want but in that course, we will slowly go towards a MVC,

10
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:52.340
a model view controller structure and I will explain what this is a little bit later.

11
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.180
One part of it is that we manage our views,

12
00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:02.360
so what we serve to the user in one place of our application in the views folder here. Now the views

13
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.750
will just be a bunch of html files here though.

14
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.600
So I'll create a new file and that will be my shop.html file,

15
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:19.700
it's a file I want to serve for users visiting just slash and I also want to have my add product file here.

16
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:27.680
So I'll add add-product.html, later by the way in case you already know the concept of templating

17
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:34.620
engines, we'll use these two so that we can dynamically add content into the html files

18
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.780
but for now, let's just start with these files.

19
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.420
So let's start here in add-product.html and now here's one important note,

20
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:50.270
if you're not interested in writing that html code, you can skip this lecture now and find the finished

21
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.480
html code attached to this and the next lecture.

22
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.980
So if you want to skip,

23
00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.220
you can do that and just follow along in the next lecture where I will provide that finished html

24
00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.920
code

25
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.730
otherwise let's now create it together.

26
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.060
So in this add-product.html file,

27
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.910
I'll now create a new html5 skeleton and visual studio code helps you with that, 

28
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:20.660
as you saw if you just type html5, it should open this pop-up, if it doesn't you can force it by typing

29
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:27.200
or by hitting control and space and then navigate to html5 with the arrow keys and hit enter and

30
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.610
it gives you this nice skeleton which basically defines a basic, well html skeleton.

31
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.460
Now here I'll change the title to add product and in the body, there

32
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.720
I now want to have my form.

33
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.610
I don't just want to have the form in there though, I also want to have some navigation bar that allows

34
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.280
me to switch to my shop.html

35
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.570
page, to the slash route and the other way around.

36
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.740
So here I will

37
00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:02.010
first of all add a header and in that header, I'll add a nav bar and in that nav bar, I'll add an unordered

38
00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.640
list with list items which are links where I go to slash,

39
00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.690
so this is just my shop

40
00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:17.320
and then another list item, add product which will be /add product.

41
00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.390
This is the page we're on here but I always want to show both options,

42
00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.490
obviously you can write the html code that fits your needs.

43
00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:26.600
So this is the header,

44
00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.540
it will be pretty unstyled for now,

45
00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.270
we'll add styling too

46
00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.650
and now let's add a main section too,

47
00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:39.800
so this is also a normal html element which holds or which should hold the content of our page here. And

48
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.070
there

49
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.800
I want to have my form with the action that is also add product,

50
00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:56.060
remember here we're then targeting this post route and in there or there, I will add my post method and

51
00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:07.120
I will now also add my input here, the input of type text with a name of title and I will add my button

52
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:15.190
of type submit here which I'll label add product.

53
00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.940
Now we will add more to this form later because a product is obviously not just made up of a title

54
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.950
but for now, this will do.

55
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.400
We got our form in here,

56
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.720
let's now copy that entire html code and paste it into the shop.html

57
00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.080
file

58
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.520
and there of course in the main section, I don't want to have a form

59
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:41.410
instead a h1 tag my products and below that later in the course, we will render all the products.

60
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.540
So here we will have a list of all the products and

61
00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.020
right now we don't have that but we'll get there

62
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.060
once we learn how to manage data on the server and so on.

63
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.940
Now the rest of the page can stay the same for both pages

64
00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.760
and again as I mentioned, styling is missing.

65
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:05.470
Let's now move onto the next lecture where the goal will be to serve these html pages before we then

66
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:06.640
work on the styling.
