00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:03.770
So were you successful?

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:09.720
We added our flash message here when we used an email which we did not find,

3
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.870
now obviously if we have a password that does not match, here where we also redirect to login, I also want

4
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.570
to flash my invalid email or password message onto the session.

5
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.760
So this is another great place because if we now save this, on the login screen

6
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:33.210
I might have a valid email but an invalid password and I get this error message, with valid credentials,

7
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.700
it of course works fine though.

8
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:42.490
Now we can also do something when signing up because when signing up, I'm checking whether an email address

9
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.930
already exists,

10
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.260
well before redirecting here I can also output something there,

11
00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.350
email exists already,

12
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.270
please pick a different one,

13
00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:04.060
something like that. If we now save that and I enter the e-mail address which indeed does already exist,

14
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.710
well then I'm redirected without having any effect

15
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.350
and that makes sense because we flashed a message but I'm not outputting it,

16
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.080
so we need to go to the login page and copy that code for outputting an error message and then go to

17
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.060
sign up and there above the form,

18
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.540
let's also output the error message here

19
00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.020
but of course for this to work, we also need to extract it when loading the sign up page.

20
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:34.280
So that code which I'm using in get login to render my error message, I need that in get sign up

21
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.800
too

22
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:41.300
and then there I also need to pass this error message variable to the view which holds that message I'm

23
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.090
extracting

24
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.810
otherwise we can't display it even though we flash it into the session.

25
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:52.010
So now with that, let's try this again, let's reuse a password, an email that already exists

26
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.720
and now I get this error, if I do create a valid user with a valid email,

27
00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.730
this works however.

28
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.860
So now if we quickly check our users collection,

29
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.070
we see that was added.

30
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.220
So these are some messages

31
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.260
I can flash onto the screen, you could add more,

32
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.710
for example after logging out you could also output some confirmation for that but this should do it

33
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.620
for now. It was a nice practice and improves the user experience a little bit.
