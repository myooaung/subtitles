Now that we learned about objects and arrays,

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:10,540
there's one common misconception I sometimes see in the Q & A section.

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:16,540
Please check out that video I linked earlier in this article where I talk about primitive and reference

4
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:20,130
types in Javascript because that is a crucial concept.

5
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:26,680
Objects and arrays are so-called reference types and you'll learn all about that and what that is in

6
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,410
the linked video

7
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,520
so I'm not going to re-explain it here.

8
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:38,530
They are reference types and therefore when I store an array in a constant hobbies, I can still edit

9
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:46,070
this array without violating the restriction that the constants must not change,

10
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,820
let me prove that to you. If I comment

11
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:54,890
that out and I add a new line here and I use another method,

12
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:58,860
the push method which allows me to add a new element to the existing array.

13
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,110
So this will not return a new array,

14
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:03,140
it will add it to the existing array

15
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,420
and here, I will add programming.

16
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:17,110
Now if I console log hobbies after pushing and I run node play.js, you'll see that's the output and we

17
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:20,860
get no error about editing this constant.

18
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:30,220
The reason for that is that reference types only store an address pointing at the place in memory where

19
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:37,120
that array is stored and that pointer this address has not changed by us adding a new element,

20
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:44,290
so the thing stored in this constant is just this pointer, just this address and this has not changed,

21
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:50,600
therefore our constant value has not changed. The thing it's pointing at has changed

22
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,410
but that totally does not matter here.

23
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:58,470
And this is something you have to understand so that you don't wonder what's going on

24
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:03,390
when we do edit in quotation marks a constant value.

25
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,610
We're not really editing a thing that is stored in a constant,

26
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,540
we're only editing the thing

27
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,380
that constant thing is pointing at.
