00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:08,210
Now one thing we did in the last lectures is we used the express router and right now, we have a set

2
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:15,500
up where we also have some unhandled routes. If we enter some random string here, we get this error.

3
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:22,930
Now typically, we would want to see a 404 error page and we can do that. Back in the app.js file,

4
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:29,450
we can take advantage of the middlewares or the way express uses the middlewares and funnels the

5
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,290
request through them.

6
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,630
Remember that the request goes from top to bottom

7
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:41,310
so if it finds some middleware that handles it, it will go in there and then for example here for slash

8
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:44,000
with that get method on the router, we would actually

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,370
end here, we also get no next call here

10
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:52,970
so no other middleware would be executed. But if we got no fitting middleware and we don't have one here,

11
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:59,090
then we actually make it all the way to the bottom and eventually we don't handle that request.

12
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:07,200
So to send a 404 error page, we simply have to add a catch all middleware at the bottom where we don't

13
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,560
need a path filter but we could add slash but that's the default anyways 

14
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,190
and then simply handle request response next

15
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:23,110
since I use use here, this will also handle all http methods, not just get requests and there,

16
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:29,390
I can then also send some code like Page Not Found.

17
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:37,060
So little dummy html document and maybe we also want to set the 404 status code and you can do that

18
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:42,940
by chaining another method prior to send and that is the status method

19
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,180
and of course you cannot just use that here,

20
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,260
you could have used it here or in the admin.js file too.

21
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,930
So always before sending, you can call status to or set header,

22
00:01:54,010 --> 00:02:00,050
you can actually chain all these method calls, send just has to be the last one.

23
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:06,160
So here I'm calling status to set my status code, another convenience method added by expressjs

24
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:13,460
and I'll set it to 404 which is the common code for a page was not found. With this added,

25
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:24,230
if I save this and then I now reload my dummy path here, I get page not found whereas for add product, I still

26
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,180
get that form,

27
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,600
so this is still working,

28
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,340
the rest however changed.
