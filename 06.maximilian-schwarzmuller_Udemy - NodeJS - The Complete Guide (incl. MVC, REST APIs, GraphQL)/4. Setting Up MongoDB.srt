1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:08,520
Now that you had a brief introduction to what mongodb is and what NoSQL databases are, let's install

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:08,730
mongodb,

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:09,340
.

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:15,160
let's set it up and let's use it for our project here. Now to install mongodb,

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:21,090
you can either do that locally on mongodb.com, you can click on get mongodb, download the

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,880
installer or the tools when you click on community server here and follow the installation instructions

7
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,400
and this will all work and it will give you a locally running mongodb server.

8
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:36,140
Now I would go for a cloud solution here because it's the more realistic environment

9
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:40,760
we would use for deployment anyways and it's really easy to set up and it's free

10
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,580
and that will be Atlas, so mongodb Atlas.

11
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,260
So I got here by clicking on get mongodb and then choosing atlas.

12
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:48,320
Now again this is free,

13
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,570
you don't need a credit card or anything like that,

14
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,120
you just need to sign up and you can spin up your own in the cloud

15
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,520
best practice managed mongodb server which is a great environment for practicing because this

16
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,750
will follow all the best practices. So sign up here,

17
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,800
now once you did sign up you should end up on a page that looks something like this.

18
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:12,510
Maybe you need to create a new project first, give it any name you want and then you should be on that

19
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,850
page or you can build a new cluster,

20
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,540
you might also end up in that wizard right from the start.

21
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,960
Now here you configure a mongodb cloud cluster, so basically a mongodb server and therefore a

22
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:29,230
mongodb database or multiple databases, as many as you want running in the server.

23
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:32,060
You can generally leave all the default settings,

24
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:37,970
make sure that you choose a region where a free tier is available, behind the scenes mongodb uses

25
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:42,150
one of these cloud providers but you don't need to be signed up with them or anything like that,

26
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:48,600
so you can choose anything you want here, then you choose the cluster tier and there you should use the free

27
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,210
one and zero where it says free

28
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:56,590
and then this will not cost you anything. Under additional settings, you can well leave all the defaults,

29
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,970
you can't change them anyways in the free tier but that's fine.

30
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,010
You can change the cluster name if you want and then you can click create cluster and this will now create

31
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:05,920
a new cluster,

32
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:12,660
we'll take a couple of minutes which you then can connect to later and which you then can use as your

33
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:13,530
backend.

34
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:19,620
Now one important note, you might see that I have some cost here in this account and this is not coming

35
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,710
from the setup

36
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:21,720
I'm showing you here,

37
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,700
I was simply using this for some other set up in the past which did cost something,

38
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,070
this does not cost you anything.

39
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:34,020
Now whilst this is getting set up, you can already click on security here and there you will probably not have

40
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,560
as many users as I do.

41
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:41,600
Now make sure you add at least one new user and I already did this which

42
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,500
and that's important, which has read and write access to any database.

43
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:52,230
You can turn it into an atlas admin but more realistic is this here because this will later be the role

44
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:57,930
which our nodejs application assumes which should be able to read and write our databases but not

45
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:03,840
to administrate them because we'll not do database administration through nodejs, that would be something

46
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,830
our database admin does

47
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,670
and therefore not our app.

48
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,540
So make sure you create such a user,

49
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,240
you can also sign your own password or auto-generate a secure one,

50
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,980
make sure you do save that because you'll need it later

51
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,360
and then also make sure you have a look at IP whitelist.

52
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:27,490
There you see all the IP addresses that are allowed to connect to your mongodb server,

53
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:31,630
now I already got a bunch here that will probably be less for you.

54
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:38,470
Now one thing you should do here is you should add a new IP address and add your current IP address

55
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:44,760
since the node app runs locally on your machine, your node app will have this IP address. Later when you deploy

56
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:45,240
the node app

57
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,250
this should of course use the IP address of your server where you deployed it to

58
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,850
but here you can use your local one so that you can connect and your node app can connect to that server.

59
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:03,320
That's of course a good security feature because this makes sure that no unauthorised access can happen

60
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:09,280
to your database, so your database is now locked down both from a IP perspective but also from a

61
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,540
user perspective.

62
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:15,700
And now we can wait for it to set up to finish and I'll be back once it did finish.

63
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:21,780
Now the set up did complete and now we can connect to our mongodb server from inside our node

64
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:28,440
app and for this we can click on connect here and choose a connection method which in our case will be

65
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,170
an application.

66
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:36,160
Now here we can check I'm using this driver and we get this url which we'll need soon

67
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:41,260
but first of all we need to install the mongodb driver, in our case for nodejs.

68
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:45,840
You can click on an example down there but I will simply show it to you in our project.
