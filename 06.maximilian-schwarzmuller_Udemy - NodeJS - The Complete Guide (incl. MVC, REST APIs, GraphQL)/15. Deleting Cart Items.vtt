00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.710
Now that we're able to load the cart data,

2
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.250
let's of course make sure we can also delete cart items and for that, we have the post cart delete product action

3
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.710
in our shop controller.

4
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.070
Now in there, I use the delete item from cart method on the user object which we wrote on our own

5
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.500
in the last module and which of course is also not a default mongoose method.

6
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.910
So it's time to go back into the user model and have a look at the delete item from cart method and

7
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.200
see how we can recreate that functionality. There

8
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.630
what I do is essentially I create an updated cart items array by filtering out the items that should

9
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.400
survive,

10
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.160
so all the items except for the one I want to remove and then I update my model.

11
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.800
Well we can of course do that by copying,

12
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.690
well basically just that code here and adding another method just as we did it with Add to Cart,

13
00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:06.080
so I will use my user schema and there, the methods key again and then I'll add a remove from cart method

14
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.310
which will be a function

15
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:16.760
and in that function, I will add that code which I copied from the bottom. This code relies on being aware

16
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.710
of the product ID of the product we want to delete,

17
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.680
so Product ID is an argument I expect in this function here, in this method

18
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.310
and now we get the updated cart items

19
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:35.720
and now all we need to do is we need to set this cart items equal to the updated cart items and then

20
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.670
we return this save

21
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:45.630
and now we got a method that we should be able to call to remove an item from the cart, just like that.

22
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.180
So let's move over to the shop.js

23
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.250
file in the controller's folder and there in the post cart delete product route,

24
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.180
well I just renamed it a bit,

25
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.000
I named it remove from cart,

26
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.460
you could have kept the original name of course.

27
00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.130
Now I have remove from cart, I pass the product ID and I redirect here to the cart page

28
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.610
once we're done. That should work but it will only work if we enable the fitting route again,

29
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.770
so let's go to the routes folder, the shop.js file and let's comment in the cart delete item route

30
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:17.680
again.

31
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.690
And with that all changed, if we now go back and we click delete here,

32
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:25.610
that looks good,

33
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.520
we loaded the cart page and all the data is gone. Let's also verify this in compass by reloading our

34
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.850
users collection, there in the cart items is an empty array.

35
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.470
So we're now able to add items to the cart and remove items from the cart,

36
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.280
let's next work on the orders.
