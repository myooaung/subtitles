00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:08.000
Welcome onboard of this course, I'm extremely excited to have you as a student in this course.

2
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.550
This course is all about

3
00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:10.580
nodejs,

4
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.020
one of the most exciting server side technologies you can learn these days.

5
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.980
And in this course, we'll not just dive into its basics, though we will also do that but we'll dive into

6
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:28.390
exciting topics like handling file uploads, pagination, working with different databases, SQL and

7
00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:36.040
NoSQL databases for example, building an app where we render views, dynamic html on the server

8
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:43.720
and building restful and even graphQL APIs, working with real time data and web sockets and much

9
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.660
much more as you will see in the outline which will come later in this module.

10
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.040
There is a lot of content in this course and it definitely is no short course but it will take you from

11
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.630
zero to advanced

12
00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:01.750
nodejs developer and by the end of this course, you will have all the knowledge you need to dive deeper

13
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.860
into advanced topics and start building your own.

14
00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:10.030
nodejs projects and applications of course. And we'll not just learn all of that

15
00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.580
in theory, we will build real projects in this course.

16
00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.120
We will build an entire online shop including checkout and payment with stripejs,

17
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.680
so there's a lot of content to cover and I'm really excited to dive into it together with you.

18
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:25.930
Now who am I?

My name is Maximillian Schwarzmuller and I'm a freelance web developer as well as five star rated instructors

20

here on Udemy.

21
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.850
I've got multiple best-selling courses and nodejs is a topic that was missing thus far,

22
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.080
well it isn't anymore and I had a lot of fun creating this course,

23
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.480
I hope you have equally much fun and you'll learn a lot

24
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.110
whilst going through the course. So let's dive in and let's start with the most important question,

25
00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.470
what is nodejs?
