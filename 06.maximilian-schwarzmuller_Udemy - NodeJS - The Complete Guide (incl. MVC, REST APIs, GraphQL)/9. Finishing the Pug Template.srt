1
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:08,450
Let's make sure we do set this active class on the right link depending on which page we are. Now for

2
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:16,160
that, I will go to my routes and there since I'm working on the add product to the admin.js file where

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,910
I do have that add product route, this one.

4
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,440
Now I will return a new field here,

5
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:30,280
the path field and I will set this to admin add product. Now you can set this to whatever you want, it

6
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:34,680
doesn't have to match the path this route has, just a pattern I like.

7
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:40,690
So now I pass this path into my view so that the view can find out what is the path for which this was

8
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:41,680
loaded.

9
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,230
Now in main layout, we will get this path

10
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:48,390
and now I can do something interesting. In the main layout here,

11
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:52,160
I know that I want to add the active class to this add product

12
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:57,340
if the path and the path now simply is a variable i get passed into the page,

13
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:04,000
if the path simply is this one and that is something we define and therefore you could pick any path you

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,840
want.

15
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,840
So now I will add a check here.

16
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:10,750
Now a class can be added, a css class as an attribute here too,

17
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,000
you don't have to use that dot notation,

18
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,830
so class is equal to

19
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:20,020
and now I'll have some javascript code which we can enclose with brackets here and now here, I simply

20
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:28,480
check if path and path is simply just what I pass in here, so this key,

21
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:37,310
if path is equal to this value and that is why I meant you can use whatever path you want, you are defining

22
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,220
the condition here.

23
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:45,260
So if path is equal to this, then I know that add product is the page I'm on because only for the add product

24
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,160
route I do set this path.

25
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:54,000
So then if that is the case, I want to render active as a class here

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,050
otherwise an empty string,

27
00:01:55,050 --> 00:02:00,510
so otherwise I basically set no class. With this set up,

28
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:06,990
now if I reload this page, you'll see add product is yellow because now it is marked as active,

29
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,360
if I go to shop that's not the case but on shop, we also don't use the layout yet.

30
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,330
So let's continue

31
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:20,730
now. For the shop I also want to use the layout, so I will go to add-product.pug, copy my code here and

32
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,000
move it up over to shop.pug,

33
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,750
let's keep the original code for now,

34
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:30,340
extend the main layout therefore. Now I do need the product.css file here

35
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,340
but I don't need the forms so let's remove that from the styles block and for the content I will

36
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,020
need main

37
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,890
but we don't render a form here,

38
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:42,080
instead we render this if loop, so let's or this if block,

39
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,110
so let's copy that entire code and put it in here,

40
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,960
make sure indentation is correct that you don't mess this up

41
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:52,280
and now we can get rid of all the other code here.

42
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:02,990
Now again for the styling of the header, we would have a problem if I now reload because it's not marked

43
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:09,230
as active because I need to use that same approach I did for the add product route. I pass in an additional

44
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:16,220
key path and there, I pass slash like this or /shop,

45
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,620
again you don't have to use the real path that led to this route.

46
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,310
I'll use slash though to keep this matched

47
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:29,870
and now in main layout, I copy my code from down there where I dynamically add this class and add it here

48
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,130
for the shop too

49
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:36,490
but the part I'm checking for is just slash here and now I do add active here

50
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:44,380
if the path variable which gets injected into the template matches slash which is only the case for this route.

51
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:48,670
So now if I save this, I got an error here

52
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,400
yeah

53
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,900
this should not be an equal sign here,

54
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,670
this should be a colon in shop.js

55
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,340
.

56
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,690
because we're creating a javascript object

57
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:00,110
and now if I reload here, this is active,

58
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,530
this is active 

59
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,590
and if we try adding a book, this also works.

60
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,050
So this is now working.

61
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:11,320
Now there is one thing I saw that I forgot and that is the title for the page,

62
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,980
it's always page not found

63
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:15,380
and that should of course not be the case.

64
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:21,440
Now you could turn this title into a block which you then set from inside the template or you do

65
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:28,660
add a dynamic output here with hashtag curly braces and give this a name, page title maybe

66
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:35,270
and now you just need to make sure that every render function passes in a page title.

67
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:44,290
So for the 404 page, for the add product page and the shop page, we have to pass in that page title key.

68
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:52,890
So starting in admin.js, here we already got page title so we're fine, in shop.js here it's doc title

69
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:59,940
so let's rename this to page title to be in line with the other file and with our layout and in the app.js

70
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,680
file where we have our 404 route,

71
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,450
I'm not passing anything

72
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:09,960
so there let's also send some data into the view and let's also set

73
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:10,960
page title here,

74
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,800
page not found.

75
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:20,630
If we now go to our page and reload it, we see shop here as a title, for add product we see add product

76
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,110
and if we enter something random here, we see Page Not Found.

77
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,530
So now this is working

78
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,180
and now we're using pug.

79
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:32,600
Now you can do way more with pug and you can combine all these features and do crazy stuff,

80
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:35,140
I recommend diving into their official docs

81
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:39,990
if you plan on using that, I instead want to show you the alternatives too

82
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:46,220
now that we learned the basics of how templating engines work and how you can use them to output dynamic

83
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,110
content in your views.
