00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:09.100
Ok so now that we're able to relate data and store products that are related to a user, let's work on

2
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:16.180
that shopping cart and the orders again so that we can do more to just look at the products. Now previously,

3
00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:23.350
in our user model in the part which is now commented out, I had utility methods like add to cart to add

4
00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.450
products to the cart of that user

5
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:32.050
and actually it was really useful to have these because that allowed us to move logic from our controller

6
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.670
into the model which is typically where your data related logic should live.

7
00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.810
So therefore I will re-add it and mongoose makes this really simple,

8
00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.490
you can work on your schema so on my user schema here

9
00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.380
and then there you'll have a methods key.

10
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.570
The methods key is an object which allows you to add your own methods by simply well adding them, Add

11
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.660
to Cart

12
00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.610
and this should now be a function

13
00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:05.230
and the important part is it has to be a function written like this so that the this keyword in there still

14
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.200
refers to the schema and not to something else

15
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.640
and now in this function you can add your own logic and that is exactly what I want to do. In this function,

16
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:20.110
I want to add the logic I had in Add to Cart before and tweak it a little bit.

17
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.530
So let's grab all that code from Add to Cart,

18
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.660
let's add it here and comment it back in.

19
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.250
Now the function here should also receive the product which I want to add,

20
00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.570
that is something we required in the past as well,

21
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.470
so we still will get a product to that function, this is something we just need to assume because we are

22
00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.180
the one writing the code in the end.

23
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:54.560
And now in there, we should still be able to use these cart items because our schema has a cart and then

24
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.800
an items array,

25
00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.180
so this should still work

26
00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.810
and keep in mind this will be called on a real instance based on that schema,

27
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:08.380
so really on an object which will have a populated cart with either an empty array of items or an array

28
00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.340
of items with items in there.

29
00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.220
So this code should still work for getting the product index.

30
00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.770
I also still want to control my quantity as before and update my cart as before

31
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:26.230
by first of all copying it, then I will keep the logic of checking whether we already do have the product

32
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.850
in the cart in which case I'll calculate the new quantity based on the old quantity

33
00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:36.870
and then I'll update my array or if I will update my array by pushing a new object onto it.

34
00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.880
Now here the thing just is this will not work like that

35
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.020
but I can just store the product ID like this and mongoose should automatically wrap it in an object

36
00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.690
ID,

37
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:56.220
the quantity can be stored like this however and this should fit my schema of an item with product in

38
00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.020
the quantity,

39
00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.720
so make sure that the names you used up there in your schema are the names you use down there for creating

40
00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.370
new data.

41
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.870
So with that, I got my updated cart,

42
00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.650
now I don't need to get access to the database like this

43
00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:17.170
instead here, I will indeed return something but I will not manually update this

44
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:23.230
instead I will just call this save which should work, before I do that

45
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.350
I just need to set this cart equal to the updated cart.

46
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.660
Now this should be a utility method that saves itself so where the object saves itself by using

47
00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.460
the built-in save method where we update the cart,

48
00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:47.890
now let's see if that works as it should. Let's go to the shop.js file and there we have all our

49
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.900
post cart method.

50
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:57.060
Now I find my product by ID which still should work because mongoose gives us this function and then

51
00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:03.060
I do indeed call request user add to cart which should now also work because we just added this method

52
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.970
to the user object in our user model,

53
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.520
so this should work without any changes hopefully,

54
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:17.080
let's go to the routes therefore and comment that post cart route back in. If I now save everything,

55
00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:22.430
let's go to products and let's try add to cart,

56
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.260
I do get some output here

57
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:31.440
and let's now have a look at compass and looking into the users, there I have my cart, I got my items and

58
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:37.680
I got an ID in there. Now that was added by mongoose automatically, it adds IDs for sub-documents

59
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.550
as well

60
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:47.990
but most importantly I got my product ID and that product ID which ends with 3C6 should be the ID

61
00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:54.350
of that product and it is. And now let's confirm if that really works by going back again and adding that

62
00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.230
same product to the cart again,

63
00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.890
it still doesn't find the page it wants to load but that is

64
00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.540
alright. Let's update our users collection now,

65
00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.010
look into the cart,

66
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.030
we got one object with quantity 2.

67
00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.240
So this is working 

68
00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:13.760
and this shows us the power of mongoose, we get a bunch of nice built-in methods which we also leverage

69
00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:22.460
here in our own method which we can add and which we then can call on our objects and are based on our schema.
