00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:08.480
I added this throw new error in app.js and to show you what it does, let me go to another place,

2
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.650
to

3
00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.040
admin.js, to the controller and change some code there.

4
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:20.310
In there we of course have plenty of code to for example add a product and we do validate the user input

5
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.220
which is also a form of error prevention or error handling,

6
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.870
we do validate that input in admin.js in the routes folder, there we added all our validation logic.

7
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.430
Now in admin.js, I'm extracting my logic.

8
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:42.360
Now let me force an error by quickly looking into my database with compass, the graphical user interface

9
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.870
we used before for interacting with the database

10
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.070
and in there, in the shop database,

11
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.910
let's go to products and let me pick up product ID here.

12
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.210
Now when creating a new product, I

13
00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.910
will also add _id and I will temporarily import something from the mongoose package

14
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:15.590
because I want to create a new object id here and I can use mongoose types object id here, pass my object

15
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:22.230
id and add the new keyword and now I will basically create a new product with an ID that already exists

16
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.630
and therefore this should fail.

17
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:29.620
Now let me start my application and let's quickly log in with a user here

18
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.620
and add a product and here you can enter anything.

19
00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.490
Let's click add product here 

20
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.060
and now it will fail,

21
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.010
you've got this infinitely spinning refresh icon

22
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.630
and if you have a look at your code or at the terminal where you ran npm start, you will see that

23
00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:56.170
our server crashed because mongodb threw an error with a duplicate key problem which makes

24
00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.760
sense because we added a product with an existing ID and therefore everything crashed.

25
00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:06.130
Now of course this is a constructed scenario but just because I want to ensure that something goes wrong

26
00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.340
at this point because now I want to show you how you could handle such a problem.

27
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.060
Now we are logging that error and I can confirm that this catch block

28
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:26.590
is called by adding console log an error occured. So now if I save this, obviously our node server restarts,

29
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.630
let's add a product again or let's try this again,

30
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.890
it will fail again of course but if I click add product now and I go back to my code, we see an error

31
00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:36.660
occurred here,

32
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.940
so this proves that this catch block gets fired

33
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.580
but that's great because this means that we now have a chance of handling that error.

34
00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.340
Now what we could do here of course is we could return some 500 error page,

35
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.270
we could also redirect the user to any other page or we could render the add product page again,

36
00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:00.180
we could even keep the old input and that might make sense if we expect this to be a temporary issue.

37
00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:08.530
So of course we could take our code from validating, copy all that and output it here or 

38
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.520
use it here in the catch block, set a status code of 500

39
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:17.530
which is a code indicating that a server side issue occurred and then we want to return added product

40
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.570
with add product page title, add product in the path,

41
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.950
by the way it should be fixed up there too,

42
00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.700
minor thing but make sure that the navigation item is selected.

43
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.430
Editing set to false, has error

44
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.140
can be set to true, the error message we can put our own error message here,

45
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.520
something like database operation failed,

46
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.380
please try again.

47
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.260
Validation errors can be an empty array,

48
00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.320
we don't want to put a red border around anything and we want to keep the user input.

49
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.250
If we save this and everything restarts, let's try this another time.

50
00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.080
So let's add a new product here

51
00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.860
like this

52
00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.060
and if I click add product, indeed

53
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.260
now we have a better error handling because now I am returning that same page,

54
00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:14.330
I give the user some error message and the user can try again but of course this here will keep on failing

55
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.740
because we have a fundamental problem in the code.

56
00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.690
But if that was a temporary network issue, this might be a fine way of handling this.

57
00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:26.950
Sometimes you got bigger problems though and you don't want to use this solution,

58
00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.510
you don't want to return the same page again,

59
00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:34.520
instead you really want to show an error page to show the user something bigger is wrong,

60
00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.380
we're working on it but for now you'll probably not be able to continue.

61
00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.520
And for such scenarios, I'll add a new view next to my 404.ejs file,

62
00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.590
I'll add a 500.ejs file.

63
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.210
We actually already have a view for error handling, the 400 page, 404 page,

64
00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:55.780
now I'll add another page that will render error messages for bigger technical issues,

65
00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:57.540
not for not found routes.

66
00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:06.630
I'll copy the code from 404, include it in 500 and there I will say some error occurred and there may

67
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.510
be some paragraph, we're working on fixing this,

68
00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.430
sorry for the inconvenience,

69
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.890
something like that.

70
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.640
You could add anything you want here.

71
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:26.410
Now we have that 500.ejs route and that might be something you also want to do, in cases where you are

72
00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.320
not sure if you will be able to handle this otherwise.

73
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.980
Now to return this 500 page,

74
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.090
I'll go to my error.js

75
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:43.740
controller and I'll duplicate my get 400 route and add the get 500 action here, with status code 500 we

76
00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:52.870
render the 500.ejs file with a page title of error or whatever you want, path can be /500 and 

77
00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:53.860
isAuthenticated,

78
00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.410
yeah we use our session information for that.

79
00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:58.920
Now we have get 500,

80
00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.270
we just need to add a route for that now.

81
00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:10.930
So let's go to the app.js because in there, I use get 404 for every page, for every middleware that does

82
00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:12.940
not get handled ahead of time.

83
00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:19.060
Now there is one extra route I will add with app get/500,

84
00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:24.560
here I want to use error controller get 500.

85
00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:28.330
So now I define a route like this, /500,

86
00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.110
I now just have to make sure that we do redirect to that route

87
00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:36.900
when a 500 error occurs and we want to show that page and therefore in the admin.js in the controller, in the

88
00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:41.850
catch block, I will indeed redirect to /500.

89
00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:49.410
And now if we save that and I try submitting this again, I end up on my 500 error page and this can be

90
00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:52.540
a decent way of handling this for bigger problems.
