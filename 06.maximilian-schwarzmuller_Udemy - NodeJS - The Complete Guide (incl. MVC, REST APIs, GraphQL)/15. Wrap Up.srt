1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:09,140
Now in this module, we had a look at how we can have an easier time developing or building nodejs

2
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,470
applications I guess.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:17,420
And for this, we started with npm, the node package manager which allows us to manage our project and mostly

4
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:23,990
its dependencies but also which added this package.json and gave us the opportunity of adding

5
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:25,160
scripts there.

6
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:30,560
So with npm init, you can initialize a new project, you basically add a package.json

7
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:37,490
with that command and then you saw that you can use scripts to define shortcuts to commands you

8
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:39,530
run all the time anyways.

9
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:45,890
We also use npm to install third party packages though because node projects typically don't just use

10
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:52,040
the core modules for your own code but often you want to pull in third party packages. Utility packages

11
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:56,670
like nodemon as we did it here but also as you will see in the next section,

12
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:03,560
real big packages that we use in our production code, expressjs is what we'll install there.

13
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:08,570
You can install different kinds of dependencies which doesn't really make a difference, you could use

14
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:14,770
them all even without specifying any of these options but it helps you keep track of which dependency

15
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,200
you are using for what.

16
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:21,800
--save and --save-dev allow you to differentiate between production and development

17
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:28,470
dependencies and global dependencies with -g can be run from within the terminal without getting

18
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,850
a command not found error.

19
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:33,270
Speaking of errors, well

20
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:35,330
in your code you often have errors,

21
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:39,070
that is absolutely normal and there are different types of errors

22
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:45,200
you can have a look at. Syntax, runtime and logical errors are three categories of errors

23
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,950
I identified. Syntax and runtime errors

24
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,050
at least throw a hopefully helpful error message

25
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:56,150
and you should read these messages and look at the line numbers they give you because that often helps

26
00:01:56,150 --> 00:02:03,530
you find out what went wrong and how to fix this. Logical errors often are more difficult to fix

27
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:10,670
but you can fix them often with a lot of testing and possibly the help of the debugger which you learned

28
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,940
how to use with the help of Visual Studio code in this section.

29
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:22,430
Speaking of debugging, debugging can be a helpful process because you can use vs code or debuggers

30
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:29,580
of other IDEs that can be used with node to look into your code whilst it's running and step through it

31
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,140
step by step.

32
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:37,080
You can analyze the variable values at runtime and you cannot just look into them but you can also manipulate

33
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,990
them as you learned,

34
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:44,100
you do all that by setting breakpoints so that you define when your code execution should stop and give

35
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:49,920
you an opportunity to look into the code. You can find more than one breakpoint at a time and you should

36
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,500
manage them cleverly,

37
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:54,650
keep in mind how node code executes, that

38
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:01,140
it's not line after line but that it works with callbacks and is event driven and therefore if you want

39
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:07,770
to look into a callback, you have to add the breakpoint there and not right before it. With all that, you

40
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:12,300
hopefully get useful tools that help you build your nodejs applications.
