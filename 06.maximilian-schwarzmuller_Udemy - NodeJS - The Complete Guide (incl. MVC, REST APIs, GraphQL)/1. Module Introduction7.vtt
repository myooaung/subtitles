00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:08.330
Now that we learned what sessions and cookies are and we had our dummy authentication flow in place, let's dive

2
00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:14.360
into real authentication. This means that in this module, we'll add a functionality that allows users to

3
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:22.250
sign up, to sign in and we'll make sure that some resources can really only be accessed by users who

4
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:29.720
are signed in and that we're not just hiding the menu options but that we really lock down access,

5
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.760
I will also show you how to store passwords securely and so on.

6
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.330
So what exactly is inside of this module?

7
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:43.070
Well first of all, we'll have a look at what exactly authentication is, how it works in a node application

8
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:49.010
or in a web application in general because this is actually not limited to nodejs,

9
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:55.460
authentication would be implemented like this in a PHP app in the same way and in all the other languages

10
00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.350
too. We'll have a look at how we can store and use the credentials,

11
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.440
so the email and password with which the user signed up and I will dive into protecting routes,

12
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.830
that is what I meant with locking down access to make sure that users are only able to access the routes

13
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.830
they need to access and that we don't just hide the menu options but that we really check the permissions

14
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.420
on the server side.
