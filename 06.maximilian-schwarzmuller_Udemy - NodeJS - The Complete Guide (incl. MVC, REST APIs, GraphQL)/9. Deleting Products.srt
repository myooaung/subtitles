1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:07,330
Last but not least let's make sure we can also delete data so that you see that last part of the crud

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,670
operations with mongoose as well.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:17,820
For that, we got our post delete product action and I'm calling delete by ID here on my product model.

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:25,170
Now if I have a look at delete, you'll see this is not something offered by mongoose,

5
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:31,850
however we do have find by id and remove and that is exactly what we want here right,

6
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,900
so if we call that then we've got everything we need,

7
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:39,840
this is a built in method provided by mongoose that should remove a document

8
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:44,660
And now we can go to the admin routes again, comment in that last admin route again,

9
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:46,260
save that

10
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,180
and with that being saved, if I now click delete,

11
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:56,470
no products are found and we can of course also confirm this in compass if I refresh, there are no documents

12
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,390
in the products collection.

13
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:04,630
So this is how we can work with mongoose and do basic crud operations with it.

14
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:12,370
Now let's again add a user and see how we can relate different entities with mongoose, so how we can

15
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:13,730
manage relations

16
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:17,230
and let's then add that cart and orders thing again.
