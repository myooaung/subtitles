00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:05.990
Now what we learned how to add users to our application,

2
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:13.720
let's take a step backward and let's have a look at an important topic that is related to any visitor,

3
00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.810
no matter if he or she is authenticated or not, interacting with your website.

4
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:25.930
I'm talking about handling user input and most importantly, that will be the topic of this module, validating

5
00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.000
that user input.

6
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.020
Therefore in this module,

7
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.770
we'll have a look at why validation is important,

8
00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:38.180
so what do I mean with validating user input and why would we want to do that

9
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.680
and of course how can we validate user input.

10
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:49.330
These are the core things and I will show you how you can ensure that the data you work with is really

11
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.560
the data and in the format you expect to get it.

12
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.900
So this is what we'll dive into in this module,

13
00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.980
so let's see what exactly validation is and why we would want to add it.
