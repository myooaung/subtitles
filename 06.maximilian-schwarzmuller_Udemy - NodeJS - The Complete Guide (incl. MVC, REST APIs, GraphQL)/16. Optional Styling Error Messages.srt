1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:06,120
I'm outputting that error message, I just want to style it a little bit now

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:13,790
and for that I'll give it a css class and I'll simply name that user message and then maybe user

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,910
message --error using some BEM styling here,

4
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:25,250
that's a css styling convention or a convention of naming your classes. Doesn't matter too much,

5
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,790
you can name this whatever you want in the end,

6
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:32,430
I added these two classes, one to have a general message look and then one for errors because maybe we

7
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,850
also want to be able to output success messages later.

8
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:42,770
So with that, let me quickly add this to some css files and you can skip this lecture if you want,

9
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,400
in the next lecture you find the finished code attached which you can use. In the main css, I'll

10
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,320
quickly add this, let's say at the bottom of this file,

11
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,280
it's up to you right before the media query maybe, I have my user message, 

12
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:59,060
so this css class I just added here

13
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:09,400
and let's say such a user message should use a margin auto to be centered, get a width of 90%

14
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,600
by default,

15
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,720
I'll also set up some styling in case I'm on a bigger screen,

16
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:25,400
there user message will have a width of let's say 30rem and then here I'll give it a border of one

17
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:32,540
pixel solid and let's use maybe some bluish color here, maybe not that blue,

18
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:42,540
well basically which ever blue color you want, maybe this one and a background color,

19
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:49,580
I'll also use a blue here, also a different blue, so some light bluish color here

20
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:55,290
so the general info message should have maybe some neutral color, so some blue like this

21
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,000
and let's see how that looks like.

22
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:03,470
With it added, let me try entering an invalid email again,

23
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,210
looks like that,

24
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,280
well not too pretty,

25
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,150
that should be much lighter.

26
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:13,420
I also want to have some padding in here,

27
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:20,120
maybe 1rem and let's give it some rounded corners as well and

28
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:24,860
now with that, if we enter an invalid email that looks much better.

29
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,780
Ok so now this is my general info message, let's also maybe also center the text if we want to

30
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:38,490
and now let's give this an error version basically with --error, that's the other class I added to this specific

31
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:46,620
box in my login screen and there I will change the border color to be red and the background should

32
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,870
be a light red,

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,970
so let's start with red and then turn this into a light red

34
00:02:53,340 --> 00:03:02,460
and now if we try this again, now it looks like this. Ok so this could be the error message we're outputting

35
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:02,850
here,

36
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:08,310
you could also turn the text red if you want, so you could also say text color should be red here maybe

37
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:12,560
and reduce the padding maybe to .5, that could look a bit better,

38
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,160
so an invalid email or password,

39
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,150
that looks good.

40
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,580
Now I always have that stickaround

41
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,420
now, reason for that is if I go back,

42
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:29,240
error message seems to be set to something even if we're not having a message in there and that is something

43
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,620
I'll check in the next lecture.
