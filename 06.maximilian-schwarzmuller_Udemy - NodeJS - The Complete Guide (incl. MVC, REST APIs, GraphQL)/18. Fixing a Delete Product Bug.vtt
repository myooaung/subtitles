00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.720
Now I'm generally pretty happy with the state of this application

2
00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.570
but there is a minor issue in it.

3
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.000
If we have no products in a cart or at least not the product which we're trying to delete, let's say

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.320
the one on the right here,

5
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.930
we actually get an error

6
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:23.200
and we do get an error because we try to access the quantity of a product which we just don't have.

7
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:29.550
And the reason for that is that we simply use in our products.js file in the models folder,

8
00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.400
we use the cart model to delete the product from there,

9
00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:33.270
right.

10
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.200
The problem just is obviously not every product is in the cart,

11
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:45.880
so in the cart here where we have delete product, we first of all need to check if a given product is

12
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.310
part of the cart.

13
00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:54.520
So here when I parse the overall cart, here when I find the product in the cart, I should check if we

14
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.480
really have that product because if we don't have it,

15
00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.090
so if I add an exclamation mark in front of this,

16
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:07.860
so if this check here is true, that means we don't have a product then I simply need to return here,

17
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.430
I don't want to continue,

18
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:16.330
I don't want to try to edit it because it's not part of the cart. So therefore now if I reload my app

19
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:24.400
and I quickly add a new product here, whoops, with a price and a description like this and I then

20
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.760
click on admin products and delete this,

21
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:28.840
now this works.
