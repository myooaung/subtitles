That's it for this refresher module. Obviously this is no complete javascript module,

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,560
there are way more features which I didn't touch on

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:16,740
and the reason for that is simple, I do require very basic javascript knowledge at least. If you've got

4
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:17,330
none,

5
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:21,390
check out the resources linked in the second lecture of this module,

6
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:27,270
these resources allow you to dive into javascript for free or with paid courses, whatever you want.

7
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:35,790
And with that plus this refresher about next-gen javascript items or features as well, you are more than

8
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,140
prepared to continue with the course and now understand the code

9
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,080
we will write throughout the course.

10
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,290
I hope this was helpful,

11
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,450
let's now dive into nodejs and write exciting applications.
