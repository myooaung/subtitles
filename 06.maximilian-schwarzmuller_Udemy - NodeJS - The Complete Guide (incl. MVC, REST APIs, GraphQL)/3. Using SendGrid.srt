00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:03,980
So in this course, I will use sendgrid

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,540
you'll find it on sendgrid.com and I'll use it because they have a free entry tier which

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,840
stays free as long as you send less than 100 e-mails a day.

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:22,000
Now there are many alternatives, MailChimp, AWS, SCS and you can google for nodemailing and your favorite

5
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:25,590
mailing service to find tutorials on how to implement it,

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,440
now I will use this one because we can use it for free.

7
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:33,760
So let's click try for free and then we simply have to create an account there.

8
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:39,820
Now once you did sign up, you can quit that page here and go back to your node project and there we'll

9
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:46,560
now install a package. I'll install a package with npm install --save which is called node

10
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,350
mailer and to interact with sendgrid,

11
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:57,320
I'll also install another package in the same go, nodemailer-sendgrid-transport,

12
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:02,280
that is a package that will help us with integrating sendgrid and conveniently use that together with

13
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:09,380
nodemailer. Nodemailer is a package that as the name suggests, makes sending emails from inside

14
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:14,060
nodejs a breeze. With that all added,

15
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:19,190
we can move on to the next lecture and now start using nodemailer to send messages.

16
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:20,600
So let me start that server again and

17
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,190
let's continue in the next lecture.
