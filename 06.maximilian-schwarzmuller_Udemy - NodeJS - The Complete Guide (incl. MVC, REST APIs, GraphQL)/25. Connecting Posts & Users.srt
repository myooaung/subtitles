1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:07,160
Let's connect posts and users. For this in my backend code,

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,850
first of all I'll go to my post model and there we have that creator object,

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:12,450
right.

4
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:17,100
Well that was like an intermediate solution,

5
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:25,710
now that we know users in our application, creator will no longer be of type object type schema types

6
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:35,450
object ID because I will store a reference to a user, so this will now be a reference to a user here,

7
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,460
this will also be require true and

8
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:41,010
not required string, what I had before, this was a mistake of course.

9
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,610
So now we have a relation between posts and users,

10
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:50,630
we store the creator of a post in every post we create and on the user model, we add the post to the

11
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,450
list of posts for that user.

12
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,970
That of course means we now need to adjust our feed controller in the place where we do create new posts.

13
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,860
There in create post, the validation which we do at the beginning still is

14
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:13,120
all right but then before I create the post, I should get my user ID.

15
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:18,950
Now I remember in my isAuth middleware, I do actually store that in the request object,

16
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,950
I get it from the decoded token,

17
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:24,050
so we have that user ID available here.

18
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:32,520
Now with that information, I'll set creator equal to request user ID, that will be a string not an object

19
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:32,820
ID

20
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,790
but mongoose will take care about that and convert it,

21
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,350
so now we create a new post assigned to that user.

22
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,670
Now once I save the post, I'll not immediately send the response though,

23
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:50,500
instead I now also want to add that post to the list of posts for the given user.

24
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:55,490
Therefore I'll import my user model into that feed.js

25
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,030
.

26
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:00,470
file by requiring it from the models folder of course

27
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,510
and in create post

28
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:11,460
once we did save the post, I'll use that user model to find the user by ID for the request user ID,

29
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:19,030
so for that user id I extracted from the token. Then I'll return this and close this

30
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,750
then block and add a new then block

31
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:32,050
where I now get that user that was created. Now in this second then block here, I now have a user, so

32
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,300
not the user which was created but the user which was found,

33
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:43,080
I have that user which is the currently logged in user and now I can take that user object which is

34
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:47,820
a mongoose model here in the end and I can access the post of this user,

35
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:56,020
keep in mind the user model has a posts property. I can access this post and I can push the newly

36
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,630
created post,

37
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:04,630
so this post here, I can push that posts object to that user and mongoose will do all the heavy lifting

38
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:11,750
of pulling out the post ID and adding that to the user actually.

39
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:18,600
Now I'll also add a new variable at the top which I'll name creator which is uninitialized

40
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:23,820
and once I found a user, I'll store the user in that creator variable.

41
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,370
Now what do I need that for?

42
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,190
Well I do update my user here,

43
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:36,180
that means that here I will also call user save and I will return that and hence we need another

44
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:39,920
then block where I get the result of this operation.

45
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:46,770
Now in this next block, I'll send my response and there I will not just send the post but I also want

46
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:49,660
to send information about the creator,

47
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:56,430
so here I'll add a creator key and that will be let's say some object with an ID _id

48
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:03,610
of creator _id and name which is creator name.

49
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:06,670
So I'm just passing this extra information with the response

50
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,390
and if I want to do that, I have to do it through a variable.

51
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:18,650
So now posts get saved and get connected to users in both directions,

52
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:20,090
let's try that out.

53
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,160
Let's save this code, go back to the frontend and there

54
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,050
let's create a new post.

55
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,860
Good old duck again,

56
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:33,400
let's add a duck image, a duck,

57
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,110
how lovely,

58
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,470
click accept here

59
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,410
and I get an error.

60
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,340
Let's see what's going wrong,

61
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:44,160
I do get back a response with a post

62
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:51,200
and the problem is that post holds my user data actually which is a mistake

63
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:57,030
on my side of course. The post I am sending back here is not the result, the result here is the user which

64
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,910
I updated. Here post should be the post model,

65
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,470
the post object I created up there,

66
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,690
so that's my mistake.

67
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,220
I do create a post there, I store it in a constant,

68
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:12,580
I can reuse that constant down there to send data about that create post back to the client.

69
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,790
So let me save that, now

70
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:18,960
still what we'll see is in the database, if I go to the post collection,

71
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:24,450
it was created though because it only failed when it came to sending back the correct data

72
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:29,260
and there we see that it's also connected to a user which ends with ABC.

73
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:35,790
If you have a look at the users, this is this user and there in posts, we also find the ID of the post which

74
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,610
ends with 6E5,

75
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,800
yes that is correct.

76
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,110
So this worked, now

77
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,440
only a minor mistake here regarding the data I send back.

78
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,370
Let's simply give this a try again,

79
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,860
here's our post,

80
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:53,230
let's add a cup like this,

81
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,900
superhot and now this works without an error.

82
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:02,880
So now we are able to connect posts and users,

83
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:08,990
let's now take it a step further and make sure that editing and deleting is only possible for posts

84
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,210
that belong to the currently logged in user.
