00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:09.340
Let's make sure we can reach that edit product page through a route and for that on our products page here,

2
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:16.530
on the admin page this added link here, added product should also include the ID of the product

3
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.940
and again we can use ejs to simply inject that into our path by accessing Product ID.

4
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.370
That's all we need here,

5
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.050
if we now reload this page and click edit, we get redirected,

6
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:36.820
what could be the issue here? Well remember that we added our query parameter right and we're checking

7
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:44.620
this query parameter in our controller and if we don't find the added query parameter, added mode will be

8
00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.270
undefined and therefore we get redirected.

9
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.090
Now this is of course just a bonus but it's important for you to understand how query parameters work

10
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.080
and therefore we have to set this too when creating our link to this page.

11
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:04.830
So let's go back to products.ejs and don't just add this ID but also simply append that query parameter

12
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.330
where I set added equal to true.

13
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.190
With that if I now save this and I go back to admin products and click edit,

14
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.020
now we load this product for editing.

15
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.040
So this is looking good,

16
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.760
let's now make sure that clicking update product which does already reach the correct route does then also

17
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.940
do something. And for this first of all in admin js, we need to register this route.

18
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.540
So let's add a new post route which is at added product,

19
00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:40.190
this will not receive any dynamic segment because it's a post request so data can be enclosed in the

20
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.080
request we're sending,

21
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.830
so let's now work on the controller here

22
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:56.720
and add a new action, post edit product which of course receives the request object, the response object and

23
00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.160
the next function as all our middleware functions which our controllers just are

24
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.490
and in here, what do we have to do?

25
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:12.440
Well we basically want to construct a new product and replace the existing one with this product

26
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.270
This means that we have to do some work on the product model,

27
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.900
we'll do that in the next lecture.
