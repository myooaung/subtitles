1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:09,260
With the last module, we took a major step forward because whilst still a lot of useful things like working

2
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:14,960
with the database, authentication and so on are missing, we now have the general pattern set

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:21,830
and you should have a general understanding of how a node and node express application works, how the

4
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:29,670
flow is, how you connect your different pieces and which part of your code plays which role.

5
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:31,630
So therefore this was a crucial part

6
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,630
and now we're going to work a bit on the course project and therefore we'll practice what you learned.

7
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:41,450
We'll add a couple of new views and we'll try to move this a bit further

8
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:42,250
in the direction 

9
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,450
of a more realistic online shop.

10
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:50,810
Now one important note, this module is completely optional,

11
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:57,770
you can of course skip it and simply download the finished code which we'll add to this module at the end

12
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:01,480
of this module or in the first lecture of the next module.

13
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:07,140
So if you're not interested in practicing this and adding all these new views and controllers and you

14
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,550
simply want to learn the next concept, you can skip ahead,

15
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:14,850
you can skip this module or fast forward through it

16
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:15,470
otherwise

17
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,910
let's dive in and let's continue working on our course project.
