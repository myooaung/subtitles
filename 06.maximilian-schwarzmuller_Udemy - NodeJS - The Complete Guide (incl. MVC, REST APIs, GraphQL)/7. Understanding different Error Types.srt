00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:08,170
In the last lectures we worked a bit on the project setup and how we could use external packages which

2
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:11,430
is super important and which we'll do a lot throughout this course.

3
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:16,120
But now I want to have a look at something else which helps us during development and that is of course

4
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:17,430
fixing errors,

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:23,830
we need to understand how we can find and fix errors in our code because there always will be errors,

6
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:27,600
you will never write a program that just runs perfectly.

7
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:33,550
For this, we first of all have to understand that there are different types of errors so that you can

8
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:36,830
understand how each type can be tackled.

9
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:42,990
The first kind of error you often get or you sometimes getting your programs are a syntax error,

10
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:49,810
this is if you have a typo in your code or you forget like a closing curly brace or anything like

11
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:50,430
that,

12
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:56,490
so you have an error which should automatically be thrown when you try to run your project.

13
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:01,840
Most of the time, these are pretty easy to fix but we'll have a look at this and how we find and fix

14
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,670
them in a second.

15
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:09,330
The second category of errors are runtime errors, at least this is how I like to call them.

16
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:16,060
Now these are errors which are not typos but where you try to execute some code which will just break

17
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:23,700
when it runs and I'll show an example for this in a second too. The third kind of errors are logical errors.

18
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,970
Now these are the most difficult ones because there, you will never see an error message,

19
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:32,360
your app just doesn't work the way it should

20
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:39,660
and it can be hard to find these but I will also show you some tool which can help you with that in

21
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,630
this module.

22
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:47,210
So let's now start with syntax errors and let's see how we can find these and fix these.
