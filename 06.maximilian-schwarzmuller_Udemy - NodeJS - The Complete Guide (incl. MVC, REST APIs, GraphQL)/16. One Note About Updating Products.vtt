00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:09.240
Now one important note about the update video, what I did there is I actually passed an object id in admin.js

2
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.340
controller to my product constructor.

3
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:19.720
Now actually I could also just pass product id as a string and therefore remove my object id creation

4
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.140
up there in the mongodb import, all of that is happening in the controller

5
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:29.610
now and if I do that and I try editing this and change the price to 16,

6
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.660
you see now it fails.

7
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:40.060
Now if we go to the product model and we have a look at the save method, there I am actually looking

8
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:47.500
for the right object but I'll have a problem with updating it because there, I'll try to set

9
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:54.590
my object ID to a different object id to a string because here I'm just referring to this which will hold

10
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.690
the unmodified objectid.

11
00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:03.820
So what I should do is I should automatically convert the objectid, the ID here which is a string to

12
00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.500
an object and the object in the constructor

13
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.030
so that I can remove it down there because _id will now always be an object id field, no

14
00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.370
matter if I'm using it in a filter or if I'm using it for updating.

15
00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.520
So now with that if I edit this again and I change the price to 18, now this works again

16
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:30.240
because now I'm not trying an invalid update by trying to change the ID to some invalid value.

17
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.800
So this is just an important note I wanted to add,

18
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.310
you don't have to convert the ID in the controller file,

19
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.010
you can leave that untouched but you can do a general conversion in the product.js model file

20
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.610
which is the better approach of doing that.
