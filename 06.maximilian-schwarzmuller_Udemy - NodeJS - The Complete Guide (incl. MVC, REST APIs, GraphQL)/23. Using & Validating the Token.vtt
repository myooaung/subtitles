00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:06.460
Now that we're generating a token and we're passing it to the client,

2
00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:12.190
we need to make sure that the client can pass back the token to the backend, to the rest API

3
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:20.770
and we then check for the A, existence and B, validity of the token before we allow the request to continue.

4
00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.980
So for example on our feed routes, on all these routes, none of these routes should be public,

5
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:33.010
so if no token is attached to the incoming request, we should simply block access here and this is what

6
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.330
I'll work on now. For that I'll add a new middleware and

7
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.800
I'll create a new middleware folder for this,

8
00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.110
you could place it anywhere though and I'll name it isAuth.js,

9
00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.730
that is the name of my file. In there,

10
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:55.510
I will import my json web token package because we'll need that package to validate incoming tokens,

11
00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:03.280
then I'll export one function in that file and that will be a normal middleware function with request, response,

12
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.810
next so that I can use it as a middleware

13
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.940
and now I first of all need to extract the token from an incoming request.

14
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.880
Now currently we are not attaching the token to any requests,

15
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.040
how could we attach it? If we go back to our frontend let's say in feed.js

16
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.680
for loading posts we want to attach the token,

17
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.190
how could we do that and

18
00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:32.730
there are a couple of options. You could add a query parameter, something like token equals and then enter

19
00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.990
your token value there and then append other query parameters, that would be a valid option,

20
00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.220
nothing wrong with that.

21
00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.660
You could include it in the request body but that is not ideal because for example get requests have

22
00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:47.350
no body,

23
00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.220
so that is not a solution

24
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:58.940
you should use unless you never have authenticated get requests. A great solution is however that you

25
00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.860
use a header.

26
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:01.780
It keeps your urls

27
00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.400
beautiful,

28
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.260
of course that might not be the most important argument but still, it keeps your

29
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.180
urls beautiful and a header makes a lot of sense for meta information like

30
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.000
well the token which it is in the end.

31
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.520
So let's add a second argument in the load posts function in the feed.js

32
00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.330
file in the frontend,

33
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.260
a second argument there to the fetch method

34
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.050
and here I will add some headers to this request. Now I will not add the content type because I'm not

35
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:36.250
sending any data here but I will add the authorization header.

36
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.570
Theoretically you can add any header you want but this is an official header, a header you officially

37
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.650
use for passing authentication information to the backend

38
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:52.310
and please remember that on the backend in the app.js file where we added our course headers,

39
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.530
I did enable

40
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.680
the authorization header, you need to have that enabled for this to work.

41
00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.430
So now I'm setting my authorization header there and I'm setting it to a value which is not just the token

42
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:12.430
but actually bearer whitespace and then this props token allows you to get the token in the react app.

43
00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.440
Why bearer?

44
00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:21.500
Well this is just a convention to kind of identify that the type of token you have and the bearer token is simply

45
00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.730
an authentication token, you typically use bearer for json

46
00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:26.780
web tokens.

47
00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:27.710
It's not a must,

48
00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:34.170
you could actually work without that but it's a common convention and therefore I want to keep that convention.

49
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.000
So this is how I could add my token to that get posts request on the frontend,

50
00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:46.410
now on the backend to extract it in my isAuth middleware, I will create a new variable

51
00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:51.010
or a constant token and then access my request and with the get method,

52
00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.870
I can get some header value.

53
00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:03.560
The header is the authorization header of course and there, I will get this bearer whitespace token.

54
00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:09.620
Now I'm only interested in the token of course, so I will split on the whitespace which comes after bearer

55
00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.540
and I'll get the second value which is the token then,

56
00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.570
so this is the token,

57
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:22.490
now I will try to decode that. So I will actually use a try catch block because it could fail and I will

58
00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:33.860
create a new variable here, decoded token and decoded token will then be JWT and there, you have a verify

59
00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:34.460
method,

60
00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.150
this will both decode and verify your token.

61
00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:44.050
You also have a decode token but this will only decode it and not check if it's valid,

62
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:51.170
so definitely use verify here and then you pass in that token which you extracted from the header and then

63
00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:56.730
that secret and that has to be the same secret you used for signing the token of course,

64
00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.340
so the same secret you used in your auth controller, this one

65
00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.790
otherwise you'll not get a matching result.

66
00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.940
So this is the secret which we will use for validating the token.

67
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.310
Now this could fail,

68
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.230
so here I'll have a catch block

69
00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:21.420
and there, I want to add a status code to my error of 500 and then I will throw the error here.

70
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:31.820
Since I'm in a middleware, now the expressjs error handler would take over, otherwise we know that

71
00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:38.060
decoding worked and I'll check if it is undefined which would be the case if it didn't fail technically

72
00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.780
but it was unable to verify the token.

73
00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:51.450
In this case I'll create a new error, not authenticated,

74
00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:58.730
add a status code of 401 and throw this error.

75
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:06.440
If we make it past this if check, we know that we have a valid token however and that we were able to decode

76
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.020
it,

77
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:12.860
so now I'll just extract some information from the token, the user id and I will store it in the request

78
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:18.500
so that I can use it in other places where this request will go, like in my routes and there I'll just

79
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:23.530
access the decoded token which now simply well is basically the part on the right

80
00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.580
here, we can now access that data since we decoded it.

81
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:32.210
So there I can now access my user ID field which I stored in the token,

82
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.310
this will be useful for later,

83
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:40.390
authorizing access to for example deleting posts because now I know the user ID stored in the token

84
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:42.800
and that should match the user id of the post

85
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:48.250
we tried to delete later and then I can forward this request. So we'll either have an error

86
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:52.760
if we have no token attached or everything will be fine.

87
00:06:52.760 --> 00:07:01.540
Now we can add that middleware to our routes and I will add it to my get posts route. So here get posts

88
00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.450
should use that middleware, therefore I

89
00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:11.150
first of all need to import it by requiring it from the middleware folder, isAuth

90
00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:16.190
and I will add it like this here.

91
00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:20.090
Now I only can get posts if I do add a token.

92
00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:26.780
First of all, let me show you how this fails, if I remove this header,

93
00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:32.990
so this extra configuration on my get posts request in the frontend. If I remove that and I reload

94
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:38.390
the page, I get failed to fetch posts and in the console log, I also see that here

95
00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.200
because it fails to read split of undefined,

96
00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:49.510
we get a technical error because in my middleware, it can't get anything from that header because the

97
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:51.260
header is not defined.

98
00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:56.700
Therefore we could add an extra check here and first of all get the header, auth

99
00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:04.900
header would then be request get authorization

100
00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.740
and if this is undefined,

101
00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:13.150
so if we can't find the header, then I will already create an error here,

102
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:21.120
not authenticated because we don't even append the token so we certainly are not authenticated.

103
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:26.370
I can set my status code of 401 which is better than 500

104
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:30.420
and I can throw that error and then down there,

105
00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:32.740
we know that we do have the auth headers and

106
00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:36.430
we know we can split it, so that's an improved way of handling that.

107
00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:39.380
Now if we reload on the frontend, we still get that error

108
00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:43.550
but technically we now have a 401 error which is better.

109
00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:50.810
Now I can add that code back where I add the token but let's try adding some rubbish here which is not

110
00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:52.540
a valid token,

111
00:08:52.550 --> 00:09:01.210
now if that reloads it still fails and it fails because now the json web token package has a problem

112
00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:03.840
with the format of our token.

113
00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:12.910
So now let me revert this and add the valid token and now as this reloads, now our posts load because now we

114
00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:14.690
are validating this and

115
00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.870
we have a valid token indeed.

116
00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:25.210
So this is now how we can validate on the server side, how we can check whether the token is valid and

117
00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:26.690
then grant access

118
00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:32.440
and now we just have to do that for all our routes before we then also make sure that only users who

119
00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:36.430
created something can delete it because right now of course,

120
00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:40.650
well I can delete everything as you can see.
