00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:03.970
So let's make add product work again

2
00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.980
and for this we'll not use the user anymore

3
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.510
but instead here before we use then, we'll re-use that

4
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.400
so no need to delete it, before we do that

5
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:20.900
we'll use our product model. So I'll create a new product constant by initialising product again and here,

6
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:29.360
I will simply pass title, price, description and the image url, so we'll pass all that data into the

7
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.550
constructor of the product.

8
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:40.340
Then on this product, I can call save and then here to call then, I'll go into my model again and I will

9
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.300
return this here,

10
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:50.140
so I'll return my collection and then this entire command chain because that will allow me to well treat

11
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.640
this overall as a promise and chain then thereafter

12
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.950
and then therefore also redirect.

13
00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:02.690
So now with that if I save that and I go back to the form and resubmit that, I'm actually redirected

14
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.840
to a page which is not found because I commented out all the shop pages

15
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.390
but if we go back to our server side console, we see something interesting.

16
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:18.620
We see that this here has to be the output of this console log line in the product model where I print

17
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.820
the result of the insert operation and there, we see a lot of data about that operation

18
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.690
and for us important, if we scroll down to the bottom, we see one document was inserted.

19
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.990
It received an ID and such an ID is managed automatically by mongodb because every document

20
00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.510
needs to have such a _id,

21
00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.850
this is a must have and mongodb creates it on the fly automatically if the object you entered

22
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.040
does not have it,

23
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.410
so we'll use that auto-generated ID

24
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.770
and then you see the data which we entered also was stored.

25
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.940
So whilst we can't look into database yet because we're not fetching anything,

26
00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:03.830
we see that our insert one operation was successful and did successfully add a product into the collection

27
00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.650
which is of course amazing.
