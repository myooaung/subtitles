00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:08.320
Now that we're able to get all products, let's also make sure we can get a single product and for that,

2
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:15.140
I'll work on my get product action in the shop controller and there we extract the product ID which

3
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.800
is great,

4
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.950
I don't need this code here anymore

5
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:18.540
by the way

6
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:25.120
and the good thing is product is a mongoose model and mongoose indeed has a find by ID method,

7
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.790
so little convenience method that defines for us.

8
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:35.440
So again find by ID here is not our own method, it's defined by mongoose. And best of all, we can

9
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.440
even pass a string to find by id and mongoose will automatically convert this to an object ID,

10
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.750
so it will handle that for us as well,

11
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.990
so again getting a lot of that convenience by just using mongoose

12
00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.610
and then we should be able to get back a product and use that.

13
00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.010
So actually this should be everything we need to do,

14
00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.680
nothing

15
00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:56.870
basically I guess.

16
00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.380
One thing I have to do of course is I have to comment that route back, so this route for loading

17
00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:09.940
a single product. With that if you save everything and you click on details here, we indeed see the detail

18
00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.970
page for this product.

19
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.120
So this is now also working

20
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:22.060
and that of course is really great because well this allows us to easily adjust our code to use mongoose.
