00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:05.850
Now how do you validate user input?

2
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.210
Well obviously we got our user entering some data into a form, we got our server

3
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.470
where we want to handle that

4
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.110
and now we got a couple of places where we can add validation.

5
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.090
For example we can validate on the client side with the help of javascript,

6
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:27.420
so before any request is sent, we can write some javascript that for example watches the inputs for key

7
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.870
events,

8
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:33.990
so for the user typing and then checks the input whilst the user is working on the form and then you can

9
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.680
display an error because you can use javascript to change the dom at runtime,

10
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.840
you can display an error right in the browser before anything is sent to the server.

11
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.520
Now this can greatly enhance your user experience and it is something which I discuss in my dedicated

12
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.830
javascript and javascript framework 

13
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.750
courses like my react course, my angular course and it's totally optional,

14
00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.070
that is important.

15
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.990
It can definitely improve the user experience and therefore you might want to consider using it

16
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:12.690
but it is optional because since we use client side javascript, so javascript code that runs in the browser,

17
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:20.760
the user can see that code, the user could change that code and the user can of course disable javascript.

18
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:27.930
So this is not a protection that secures you against incorrect data being sent to your server,

19
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.330
this is not a secure solution,

20
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.570
it's only there to improve the user experience because of course there you can validate and you can

21
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.090
show a nice error message and keep the old input so that the user doesn't have to re-enter that email

22
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.780
address where the @ sign was forgotten

23
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.580
but it's only for a user experience thing,

24
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.550
it's not really secure.

25
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.680
So your next option is to validate on the server side.

26
00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.810
Now this is what we'll focus on in this module and in this course because this is of course what we do

27
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:01.570
with nodejs.

28
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:08.460
We have to do that because this code can't be seen or changed by the user,

29
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.330
the user can't disable us using that code because it happens on the server, not in the browser

30
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:21.480
and this is the crucial part where we have to add validation, where we really have to filter out invalid

31
00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:22.400
values,

32
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.140
so this is a must have, it's absolutely required and it is what we'll focus on. And this then ensures that

33
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.650
we only work with valid data in our node app and ultimately if we do plan on storing it, that we do store

34
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.050
correct data.

35
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.930
Now also important, for some database engines and for most database engines actually, like for example

36
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:43.800
mongodb,

37
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.040
there is also a built in validation which you can turn on,

38
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.430
I do cover that for the example in

39
00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.150
my mongodb course if you want to learn more about that.

40
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.630
It's also optional because this can be a last resort but if you have good server side validation in

41
00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:04.500
place as you should have, then this might not be required because there is not really a scenario where

42
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.280
invalid data could reach your database because you filter it out in that server side validation already ready.

43
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.390
No matter which approach you have if you validate on the server side and or in the database, though

44
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.000
or is not really an option

45
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.550
you should validate on the server side at all means but no matter what you choose, in the end

46
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.510
this can of course fail and then you should always return an error message,

47
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:35.130
a helpful error message if possible and never reload the page but always keep the data the user already

48
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:41.100
inserted because that of course is a horrible user experience which we all know that you enter something

49
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.750
incorrect and you get back

50
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.890
hey this password is not known or this e-mail address is unknown and you have to enter it all again.

51
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:55.430
So this is another part on which I'll focus in this module, that we provide a good user experience. And

52
00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.230
with that we know how to do validation at least in theory,

53
00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.090
time to turn that into practice.
