00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:07.300
So we worked on the product model to make the save method more flexible

2
00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:14.270
and now in the admin.js controller in post edit product, there we already have code where we find

3
00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:19.760
a product by id and this will work because find by ID is a method I created in my model,

4
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:27.390
so here we have the product or maybe we should name it product data because here, I will now create a

5
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:35.040
new product constant by using my product constructor, so my own product class and there, I will pass

6
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:47.770
my updated title, my updated price, my updated image url and my updated description and my ID.

7
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.660
Now actually, we don't even need find by ID then anymore,

8
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:59.510
we can just get rid of that and for now also of that and simply create a new product with all the updated

9
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:06.050
information and we now also need to pass the product ID, there you just need to make sure that you create

10
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.680
a new mongodb objectid object.

11
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:17.670
So make sure that at the top of the file, you do actually require mongodb and now you can of course

12
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.420
also create a new constant, name it object ID or whatever you want and extract that objectid constructor

13
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.240
out of mongodb like this

14
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.900
and then you could just write new objectid and reference this basically, so we can now go down to post

15
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:42.450
edit product and pass a new objectid here with new objectid and wrap that Prod ID you're extracting

16
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:49.310
from the url here and wrap that or from the body of the request and wrap that into object ID.

17
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.900
Now we have that new product and now we can simply call product save because we just modified the save

18
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.140
method to support both creation and updating.

19
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.620
So let me save all of that

20
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.100
and let's give this a try.

21
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:13.310
Let's reload that view here maybe, change the price to 19.99 and click update product,

22
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.490
now we get a page not found,

23
00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:23.670
let's ignore that for now and let's instead go back to mongodb compass and click that refresh

24
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.610
icon here. Now that doesn't look like it worked though right,

25
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.490
the price is unchanged but I also did not get an error,

26
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:33.970
so what's wrong here?

27
00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.720
Well you need to go to your admin.js routes again and uncomment this post edit product route

28
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.260
otherwise editing products will not be possible.

29
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:52.140
So now if we load that product to edit again and we change that price, now this looks much better or at least

30
00:02:52.180 --> 00:03:00.220
partly. If we have a look at mongodb compass, we see now it looks like I made a mistake with the

31
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:06.400
assignment of values, so my description and I can simply edit this here, my description

32
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.920
now simply was the url and the other way round,

33
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.050
so let me change both and click update here.

34
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.520
Now if we load this page again, it should work

35
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.870
but the most important thing is our method worked.

36
00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.230
Now what did I mess up?

37
00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.760
If I go to the admin controller, I'm assigning price, image url and description, well that is in

38
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.690
the wrong order,

39
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.790
it should first be the description and then the image url but that was only a little logical mistake

40
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:33.380
I made.

41
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:42.650
If I edit this again back to 12.99, you see now this is working and this also works,

42
00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.390
let's see how it works if I edit two fields at the same time and

43
00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:47.870
this also works.

44
00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:54.470
So this is how we can update a product with the help of mongodb and with the help of update one.
