00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,890
So now that we know for whom this module is,

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,030
let me summarize javascript briefly.

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,230
Javascript is a weakly typed programming language, 

4
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:14,210
it's an object oriented programming language

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,250
and it's very versatile

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,770
and what do you mean with that? Weakly type

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,570
means that we have no explicit type assignment,

8
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:28,950
javascript knows types like numbers or text which is called string or booleans which is true or false

9
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:35,470
but it doesn't force you to define which type you're using in a variable or in a function

10
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:41,070
and indeed, you can also have a variable where you store a number which you then suddenly change to a

11
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,180
text variable,

12
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:47,280
so you can switch types dynamically. In other languages this is differently

13
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:53,260
and whilst this gives you greater flexibility to be able to change it and to not have strict typing,

14
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,060
it also can lead to errors,

15
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,590
so it is just something you have to be aware of.

16
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:04,110
Object oriented simply means that data can be organized in logical objects and we'll see these objects

17
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,280
in this module.

18
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:12,840
And one important concept here is that you have to be aware about the difference of primitive and reference

19
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,380
types and attached to this lecture,

20
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:21,360
you'll find a link to an article and video I created for my free YouTube channel, Academind where I

21
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,350
do dive into primitive and reference types and where I do explain the difference and why they are important,

22
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,780
so definitely check that out if primitive and reference types don't tell you anything. Regarding the

23
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:34,720
versatility,

24
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,590
well we can see that in this course.

25
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:41,700
Javascript runs in the browser and this is actually where it comes from but you can also use it with

26
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,870
nodejs to run it on your PC

27
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,030
outside of a browser set up or also on a server

28
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:49,740
therefore and that is exactly what we'll do in this course.

29
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,380
We'll build a web server with nodejs,

30
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:58,920
so we got this broad versatility of being able to use javascript on different platforms. And you can

31
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,020
also perform a broad variety of tasks with javascript also depending on the platform you're running

32
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:04,440
on.

33
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:11,490
You can in the browser listen to user events, re-render the DOM and on the server or on a PC, you

34
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:14,080
can work with files, with databases,

35
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,900
lot of cool stuff.

36
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:20,980
So this is a summary of javascript and what makes up the language,

37
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:28,560
let's now dive into some core features, also some core next generation javascript features which are supported

38
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,810
by nodejs

39
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,800
and let's see some things we'll see throughout the course.
