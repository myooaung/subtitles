00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:11.160
Now one last adjustment I want to make is that I want to go into my views real quick and fix the placement

2
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.570
of my invoice link in the orders.ejs

3
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:19.360
file. There I have that invoice link next to every product and that is incorrect of course,

4
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.010
it should be next to the order

5
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:28.050
so next to the order ID, I will have my invoice link so that now if I reload that orders page, I have that

6
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.760
link up there which makes more sense logically but the behavior of course didn't change.
