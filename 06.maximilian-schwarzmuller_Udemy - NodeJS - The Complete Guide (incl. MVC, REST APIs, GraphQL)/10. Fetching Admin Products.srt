1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:08,710
Now let's work on the admin products page because there, I also want to display my products so that

2
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:10,440
we can interact with them.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,210
So in admin.js

4
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:12,350
again,

5
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,560
get product still uses fetch all, now

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,280
it's of course a good practice for you to make this work with sequelize.

7
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:26,110
So definitely pause the video at this point and try to change this code here such that it does retrieve

8
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:29,300
the products and render them on the admin page.

9
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,830
Were you successful?

10
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,030
Well the code to you is of course the same code we used in the shop.js,

11
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:41,030
instead of fetch all, we'll use find all

12
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:46,680
and we don't use the callback function approach here because we're not using a callback function with

13
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:47,800
sequelize,

14
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:52,200
instead we have then and catch since we're using promises.

15
00:00:52,200 --> 00:01:00,300
So let's console log our error in this case or pass our function we used as a callback before to then and

16
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:06,700
now here, we have our render function where we render the products. Therefore if I now reload this

17
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:12,480
admin page, I see my product here and I can now add it or delete it.

18
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:17,340
These however are two things that don't work, added doesn't work because I don't load the product

19
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,350
successfully and delete wouldn't work either.

20
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:23,310
So in the next lectures, we'll work on these two things.
