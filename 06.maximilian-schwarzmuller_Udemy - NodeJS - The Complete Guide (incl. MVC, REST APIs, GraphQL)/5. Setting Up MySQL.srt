1
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:04,140
Now to work with SQL,

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:10,640
we need a SQL based database and I'll go for MySQL because you can install and use that for free,

3
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:15,100
at least in the basic version which does suffice for this course.

4
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:19,870
You can visit MySQL.com to download and install it

5
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,430
and there simply click on downloads

6
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,070
and scroll down,

7
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,100
we don't need the enterprise edition here

8
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:32,010
instead we'll go for the community edition which is the free one, click on downloads there too

9
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:39,940
and now what we will need is the MySQL community server and we'll also need the workbench.

10
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:45,760
Now you can also download a combined installer, especially here for Windows you should choose the MySQL

11
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:51,690
on Windows Installer in tools which allows you to set up everything in one go

12
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:56,620
but you can also click on MySQL community server here simply and this should give you a download

13
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,940
which allows you to install all these things in one go

14
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,510
anyways. So let's choose the MySQL community server here,

15
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,060
always dive into the installation instructions

16
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:10,900
in case you're facing any problems on your system and then if you scroll down, select your operating

17
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,950
system here, the one you plan on using,

18
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:20,280
so for Windows you can then also download this general installer which allows you to pick the programs

19
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,270
you need, for MacOS

20
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:32,390
we simply can go for this first download, the DMG archive and then once you click there you don't have

21
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:33,010
to log in,

22
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:33,990
you can simply choose

23
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:34,650
no thanks

24
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,900
just start my download to well start the download.

25
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,010
Now this can take a while because it's quite a big file,

26
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:49,910
on Windows you have the choice between downloading a web-based installer which is smaller but downloads

27
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:55,100
what you need to during the installation or a complete installer which downloads everything in advance.

28
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:59,790
Once your download is done, simply execute the downloaded file

29
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,290
so the windows installer

30
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:05,700
or this Mac DMG archive. Here I'm asked

31
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:09,310
to well continue through the installation wizard and I will do that,

32
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,880
agree to the license,

33
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:18,620
leave the default installation path, click on customize here though to choose what to install and make

34
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,060
sure that you do install

35
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,870
the MySQL server here.

36
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,650
If you're running this installer on Windows, you should have a different installer where you can choose

37
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:33,480
to install the MySQL server but then also in one go, install the

38
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,360
MySQL workbench,

39
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:41,110
so make sure you select both for installation and click install here

40
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,800
and now on both operating systems,

41
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,040
this should install it. Now

42
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:55,940
once installation is done, a configuration process should start automatically. There

43
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:02,830
you should make sure that during this configuration process, you do choose the legacy password encryption

44
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:08,890
which sounds insecure but which is perfectly fine and the newer version simply is not supported

45
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,410
by the node SQL package we're using yet.

46
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:19,150
So choose the legacy password encryption and choose next, you also have to choose a password for your root

47
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:22,170
user and you can also leave

48
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,530
start MySQL server once installation is complete

49
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:27,580
checked or check it if it is unchecked and click finish.

50
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:31,620
On Windows,

51
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:37,880
simply leave all the other settings as they are and click through them and by the end, it should be done and

52
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:42,250
it should then also start a MySQL server for you

53
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:47,770
with the setup you chose here in the configuration steps.

54
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:55,830
Now once installation is complete, on Windows if you also installed the MySQL workbench, you're done, on Mac

55
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:56,920
or Linux,

56
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,380
you're not done yet,

57
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:05,520
instead you should go back to your previous page where you chose MySQL community server and there also install

58
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,990
the MySQL workbench.

59
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:13,550
The workbench basically is a client, a visual client we can use to connect to our database to inspect

60
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:18,930
it and play around with it outside of our node application which simply makes debugging and developing

61
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,670
a bit easier.

62
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:27,630
So choose the MySQL workbench here and there you also can choose your operating system,

63
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:35,820
now again on Windows if you used that general installer, you already have it. Download that file here, again

64
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:40,520
you don't need to log in, just start to download and wait for the download to finish

65
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,190
so that you can again execute the, well executable

66
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:49,540
once it is done. Finish the installation process as instructed

67
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:55,870
by the installer and once you're done with that, you should be all good.

68
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:03,980
You can now test your setup by starting the MySQL workbench you just installed and then there, you

69
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:07,000
should already see your MySQL instance running.

70
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,660
If that is not the case,

71
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:17,120
have a look at the attached document where I describe some common issues or in general give you some

72
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,610
links on how to make this work and how to bring this up,

73
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:28,640
you just need to make sure that your MySQL server is running and during installation, you had a choice

74
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:33,780
to check that it should always start with your system, on Mac

75
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:39,620
you can also open your system preferences and there you should have the MySQL option where you can

76
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:44,780
also stop and start the server. To connect to the database,

77
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:52,080
simply click on that instance and now enter that root password you assigned during the installation.

78
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:58,640
This should now allow you to connect to your SQL server instance like this,

79
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:04,130
then once you enter the password you should be connected to your database system. And right now this is

80
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,950
what you have, basically an empty window and we won't work too much in that, we'll of course work with

81
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,610
our database from inside our node application

82
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:18,350
but this will allow us to conveniently look into our database from time to time and see what is stored

83
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:24,140
and one thing we can do already is we can go down to schemas here which can be translated with database

84
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,500
here

85
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,730
you could say and there, we can define a new schema, so a new database with which we'll work and I'll name it

86
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:31,820
node complete,

87
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:37,070
you can name this whatever you want and you can also leave the other settings here and then on the bottom

88
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,530
right and I know it's small here,

89
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:41,970
unfortunately you't zoom in,

90
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,180
you can click apply. Now

91
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,360
this will create a new database

92
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,730
you can say with which we can interact later, you can leave all the default settings and simply click

93
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:57,130
apply here and now you should see that node complete thing which has a couple of tables or none right

94
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:03,980
now but where you can then later connect to and store your data in the tables that will be created here.

95
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:11,530
So with that, we can continue and we can now move on with our code and start interacting with MySQL

96
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,980
from inside our node application.
