00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:07,800
We're able to parse incoming request bodies with the help of the body parser package which is pretty

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,550
neat

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:14,640
but right now as I mentioned, this middleware always executes, not just for post requests but also for get

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,210
requests, what can we do regarding that?

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:25,440
Well instead of app use, we can also use app get. This is basically app use, it has the same syntax

6
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,480
as app use,

7
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:32,670
we can use a path or don't use a path but it only will fire for incoming get requests,

8
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:38,080
so this is another form of filtering besides filtering for the path, app get allows us to filter

9
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,750
for get requests

10
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:46,800
and on the same page, we also got app post to filter for incoming post requests and just by changing this

11
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:53,660
word, this middleware will now only trigger for incoming post requests with this path and not for get

12
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:54,650
requests.

13
00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:03,500
So if I save this and I go to /product, you see I get hello from express,

14
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,930
so I don't end up here even though I entered /product but it was a get request

15
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:18,300
but if I send a post request through that form I have on add product, if I do this here, book too, you

16
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:20,320
see we get this output,

17
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,850
so we clearly made it into this middleware due to our filtering.

18
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:30,710
So this is another way of using that middleware function, instead of use which will work with all http

19
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:31,410
methods,

20
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,870
we can also use get or post to filter for these.

21
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:41,790
And additionally you also have delete, patch and put which are other http works which we'll use later

22
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,350
in the course because we can't really use them from a normal html document.
