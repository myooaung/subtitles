1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:05,130
Now that we are able to sign up and sign in,

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,370
we have to work on route protection.

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:12,740
We already have a setup where we only show the menu options we should be able to interact with

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:22,020
but even when I logout and therefore my session is gone, even when I do that, I can still manually

5
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:28,200
enter admin add product and reach that page and I could even try to create a product here,

6
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:33,900
I would fail then because there would be no user object on the backend where I tried to get the logged

7
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:34,610
in user

8
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,360
but this is not the user experience

9
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,280
we want to offer,

10
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,130
we don't even want to be able to load this page if we're not logged in

11
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:44,480
and for that, we need to protect our routes.

12
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,490
Now how do we protect routes?

13
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:52,990
Well to protect routes, we want to check where the user is authenticated before we render back

14
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,260
let's say the add product page.

15
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:02,790
So in admin in the admin controller, in get add product which loads that page, before we render that

16
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:08,220
page, I want to check if in the request session is logged in is set

17
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:15,450
and to be precise, I want to check if it's not set because if this is not true, the user is not logged

18
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,180
in

19
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:21,490
and if the user is not logged in, then I want to redirect

20
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:24,470
let's say to the login page like this.

21
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:31,720
So then since I return here, this code will not execute and I won't load the added product page.

22
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,930
So now let me try to reload this page,

23
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:38,690
keep in mind I'm not logged in and I'm on the login page.

24
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:39,370
So this works,

25
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:43,350
I am redirected here because session logged in is not set.

26
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,910
On the other hand if I do login now,

27
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:52,310
so if I do enter my valid credentials here and I try to access add product,

28
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:56,570
this does work because now I make it past this if check.

29
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:02,740
Now this is a code we could add to every route which we want to protect but adding it like this is a

30
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,420
bit cumbersome,

31
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:10,800
so let me show you a better way of protecting our routes or a more scalable way in the next lecture.
