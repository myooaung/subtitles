00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.660
So we get a result and that's great,

2
00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:10.680
now first of all that result had some cryptic body which was a readable stream.

3
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:16.030
Now what we can do here in the then block is we can return result json which is a function that will

4
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.770
throw a new promise or return a new promise, so I can add another

5
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.150
then block and here I will have the data,

6
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.330
so the response body. I don't necessarily need that but I want to show you how you could get that data

7
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.990
that's getting returned by the server.

8
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.340
More importantly, I know that either here or here, does not matter,

9
00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.640
I have a response so the item was deleted on the server

10
00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.050
and now I want to delete it here in the dom as well.

11
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.640
Now how can we do that?

12
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:50.510
Well we got access to the button on which we clicked right and the button is in the end inside of the

13
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.510
whole dom element

14
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.400
we want to delete,

15
00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.600
so it is this article which I want to delete.

16
00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:02.350
So therefore what I have to do is I have to find this article based on this button and that's relatively

17
00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.630
straightforward to do.

18
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.990
My product element and you can name this constant however you want is basically my button

19
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.340
and then there is a closest method provided by javascript and you pass a selector to closest which

20
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.160
gives you the closest element with that selector and the closest ancestor element to be precise

21
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:29.220
and there, I will simply use article because I only have one article in my ancestor history here for

22
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.280
this button,

23
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.380
so if I select my closest article, that should be the element I want to delete.

24
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.700
So inside here

25
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:45.030
let's say, I can call product element remove and that is a function that will not be supported in Internet

26
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.830
Explorer,

27
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.620
there you would have to access the parent node and then remove a child

28
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.700
and that child would be the product element. So that is a code that works in every browser,

29
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.490
remove would work in all modern browsers.

30
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.200
Now with that in place,

31
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.150
we can reload this page here and now

32
00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.010
if I click on delete, it will eventually be gone

33
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.880
and here, we see our success message.

34
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.210
And now just to validate that it really only deletes one element and not all elements,

35
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.810
let me log in with my other user who also has two products I can delete,

36
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.560
these two products

37
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:32.200
and now let's go to admin product, delete the boat let's say and now only the duck is left.

38
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.300
So this is great

39
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.500
and indeed if I go to products, this data really is gone, I can't load it here.

40
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.650
So this is how you can use asynchronous requests.

41
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.480
Now of course there is more you can do on the client side but this is not a client side javascript course.

42
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:55.470
The important thing here is that you can send data to your backend with the help, with these asynchronous

43
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.520
requests and how you can include data and how you can handle that on the backend.
