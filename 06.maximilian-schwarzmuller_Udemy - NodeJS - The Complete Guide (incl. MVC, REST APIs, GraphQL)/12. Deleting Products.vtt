Updating was successful,

2
00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.280
now let's also make sure we can delete products.

3
00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.640
So in admin.js, I'm talking about the post delete product method here

4
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:17.380
now. We get the product ID which is good, now delete by ID does not exist in a sequelize

5
00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:27.400
world, instead on the product we can call destroy and destroy allows us to destroy any product we find

6
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.550
through our options here

7
00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.300
and these options allow us to for example add a where condition to narrow down which product to delete. We

8
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.040
can also use a different approach,

9
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:43.120
instead of calling destroy like this and adding a condition which product to find which is of course

10
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.940
fine,

11
00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.730
we can also use find by ID again to find a product by that ID

12
00:00:49.630 --> 00:01:00.220
and then again have our well known then and error, catch methods and in then, we know we got a product and

13
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.420
on that product,

14
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.760
we can now also call destroy

15
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.530
and now this will destroy the found product. We can return this because this will also yield a promise

16
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:17.990
and therefore add another then block which will execute once the destruction succeeded and there

17
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:28.500
we can if we want console log destroyed product and we can now also redirect thereafter.

18
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:35.240
We should redirect here to make sure we only redirect once the deletion succeeded. If we now go back

19
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:42.830
to our application and I add a new dummy product without any picture, just like this and we go to admin

20
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:43.600
products,

21
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.900
I got stuck on loading this automatically, I'll look into this a second

22
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.820
but if we go to admin products manually, we see it here if I click delete, this works.

23
00:01:52.820 --> 00:02:00.690
Now one thing I noticed is that if I added a product here, we get stuck and we don't redirect,

24
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:08.330
so for adding a product host add product here, we don't do anything in then block, there we should of

25
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.250
course also redirect to /admin/product,

26
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.850
so basically to the same we redirect when deleting.

27
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.110
So now if we go back

28
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:32.090
and we add a new product again, this is working and now we can also delete the products here.

29
00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.480
So this is now all working and now we can manage the products,

30
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.980
we can view them here,

31
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.670
now one thing we haven't touched at all are relations though because we don't just have products, we

32
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.230
all have a cart and eventually, we'll also have users.
