00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:09.140
That's it for this module. It was quite a lot, a lot about middleware I guess but it is the crucial basis

2
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.720
for the rest of the course where we will of course continue with nodejs

3
00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:20.050
but by using expressjs, a powerful framework and that is what expressjs is. It's a nodejs

4
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.800
framework,

5
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.690
so you still use nodejs,

6
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:29.810
we for example still use the path core module in this module but you build up on it and get a bunch of

7
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:36.770
utility functions and a clear set of rules on how you should structure your app and it's all about middleware

8
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:43.310
and understanding that flow of requests through all the middleware functions. Expressjs is very

9
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.630
popular because it's highly extensible

10
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:53.120
and as you already saw with the body parser in this module, you can easily plug some packages, a lot of

11
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.300
packages actually into an express app because they just expose such middleware functions and you can

12
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.910
therefore easily add them and the request gets funneled through them.

13
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:09.020
Now that concept of middleware is really important, middleware functions are these functions that took the

14
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:15.800
request object, a response object that helped you with sending a response and that next argument which turns

15
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.890
out to be a function you should call to forward a request to the next middleware in line and in line

16
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.970
means from top to bottom in your root file.

17
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:32.000
This is a crucial point you have to understand, that you should always call next unless you are sending

18
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.220
a response in which case you should never call next and that you can therefore cleverly structure

19
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:44.450
your middleware to transform a request, read something from it and send different responses depending

20
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.900
on the route you're accessing,

21
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:53.290
so depending on the path and method you're sending. You learned that you can filter request by path and

22
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:59.140
method easily with app use by adding a path or app get, app post

23
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:06.230
and that if you filter by method, like if you had app get, that the paths would then be matched exactly

24
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:12.610
otherwise with app use, the path you passed would only be matched with the beginning of the

25
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.060
url, the part after localhost.

26
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:23.270
You also can use the express router package instead of app use, app get because this allows you to elegantly

27
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:29.810
split your routes across multiple files since the router you export there can be added as a middleware

28
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.670
function into app use in your root file.

29
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:40.340
Last but not least, we also served some files and it's important to know that you're not limited to serving

30
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.500
dummy text or anything like that,

31
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:50.510
you can send files for example as we did it with html files and if a request is directly made for a file

32
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.750
like a css or javascript file but also images

33
00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:00.530
even though we didn't see that in this module, you can enable static serving for such files with the

34
00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:06.620
help of express static which is a crucial part of any web application you're building because you typically

35
00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:15.320
have such files that are dependencies of your html files for example and this is the core basic

36
00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.610
knowledge you should have about expressjs,

37
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:24.170
this is what we'll now build up on and this is where we will now dive deeper into to learn how to

38
00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:32.000
render dynamic content, how to access databases, enable authentication, manage data on the server and

39
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.170
so much more.

40
00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.160
So let's continue.
