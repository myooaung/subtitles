00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:09.970
So let's dive back into our project and make sure you are logged out and make sure you download the attached

2
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:16.410
snapshot because there I did add a sign up link to our navigation bar and if we click on that,

3
00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:21.610
we also load a sign up page where we should edit the caption of the button by the way.

4
00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:27.020
So if you download the attached code, what was added and you can also add this to your own project.

5
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:33.730
I did add the sign up.ejs file where I also should change this to sign up, so you can simply add that file

6
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.700
to your auth folder.

7
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:43.150
I did manipulate or change the navigation.ejs file, there what I did add is I simply added the sign

8
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.610
up navigation menu entry

9
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.130
after login, both for the normal menu and also for the mobile menu down there,

10
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.230
so basically one list item was added to each menu,

11
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.460
this is what I added in this file.

12
00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:02.980
And then I worked on my routes, there I added two new routes, posts sign up and get sign up where I use

13
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.610
my auth controller get sign up and post sign up actions

14
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.830
and in that controller, I worked on these actions.

15
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.300
I added posts sign up which is an empty placeholder, nothing in there,

16
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.370
so that is not that difficult, get sign up also is is a pretty simple route, there

17
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.010
I simply render the auth

18
00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:26.170
sign up view. So you can just add this to your existing project or use my attached snapshot and replace

19
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.210
my mongodb url with yours

20
00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:34.820
and once you got all that, you should be able to have a running application that looks like this with

21
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.950
a sign up page that looks like this because now we will use or we will need a way of signing up users.

22
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.530
So let's now start implementing the full authentication flow in this module

23
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:51.260
and for that, we'll first of all make sure that we can create new users, then that we can sign users in and

24
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:57.190
sign users out of course, that we can then use the information whether a user is signed

25
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.380
in or signed out in all our views and that we can protect our routes on the server side too because

26
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.650
right now even if I'm not signed in, what I can do is I can manually visit admin add product and this

27
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:10.310
works.

28
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.680
So I can't get there by menu because we hide the menu options but manually visiting this works

29
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.660
and this is also something we'll work on in this module.

30
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.620
So let's get there step by step and let's start by adding user sign up in the next lecture.
