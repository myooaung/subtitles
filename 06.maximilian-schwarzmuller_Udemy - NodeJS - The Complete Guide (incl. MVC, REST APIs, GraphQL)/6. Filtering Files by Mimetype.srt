00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:09,880
Now we added our multer configuration to rename our file and to control the storage place in detail,

2
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:14,320
now we can also add a filter to multer to only allow certain kinds of files

3
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:21,240
and for that 2D object where we configure multer, I can add the file filter function here.

4
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:29,520
Now I'll again create in a separate const up there to make it easier to read, file filter will simply be

5
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:31,380
a function,

6
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,180
I'll use an arrow function here where I get the request,

7
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:39,740
some file data and a callback which I have to call and in there, we should call the callback with

8
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:47,120
null as an error and true if we want to accept that file so if it should be stored or false if we

9
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,260
don't want to store that file.

10
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,860
Now how can we determine whether we want to store it?

11
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,120
Well we can write any logic we want here,

12
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:05,650
now I will check if the file mime type is equal to an image/png or if the file mime type is

13
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:14,860
equal to image/jpg or if the file mime type is equal to image/jpeg with an e.

14
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:21,460
If any of that is true, so if I have a file which is of that type, then I will accept that so I will call

15
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,690
the callback with true as a second value

16
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:29,790
otherwise I'll call the callback with false as a second value which means I'll not accept that file.

17
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:35,600
And now we can use that file filter and pass it as a value for file filter in our options here

18
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:36,860
and with that set up,

19
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,720
we got some logic here that should filter out invalid files.

20
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:50,660
So if I go back now and I submit a form here with let's say my boat.png, I succeed here, well I get

21
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,720
an error here but I succeed because it stores the file

22
00:01:54,230 --> 00:02:00,370
but if I try to submit a different value, let's say I'll pick a pdf here.

23
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:07,960
You can use any pdf, any non-image file, then you see I only get undefined here and that undefined

24
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:11,370
is stemming from my admin controller from this line,

25
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,380
so then multer did not store anything

26
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,060
and this is how we can filter out files.

27
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:21,520
Now I will remove all these files up there and I'll also clean up my database soon because right now

28
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,800
we're not really storing the data appropriately

29
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,240
and that is the next step we should do of course.
