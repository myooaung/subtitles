00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:09.450
Time to work on the last two pieces, the orders and again feel free to pause the video and try implementing

2
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.230
this on your own,

3
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.290
it's always a great practice even if you can't get the full result or full equivalence to my solution

4
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.480
or if you get stuck at one point, you can still then go back and watch the solution together with me

5
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.740
but you will still have a lot of practice by trying parts of that on your own.

6
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.060
So here's your chance to pause the video and we'll do it together thereafter.

7
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:39.120
So let's dive into that together and let's work on our orders now, creating orders and getting the orders,

8
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.500
that is what we want to do

9
00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.280
and let's first of all look into our controller for that, the shop controller.

10
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.050
There we have

11
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.240
post order,

12
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.530
now what are we doing there?

13
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.790
Well here first of all we got an unused variable which we can get rid of, there we call add order on

14
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.220
the user and that's essentially it, 

15
00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:03.540
so let's look into the user model and let's see what add order did. Add order simply took our cart,

16
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:10.320
so the products in our carts to be precise and created an order object which contains the product data

17
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.710
but also some data about the user

18
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.390
and then we inserted this into an order collection.

19
00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.210
Now since we worked with a collection there, we'll need a new model that's for sure

20
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:30.700
and the then is a result we just cleared the cart. So we get multiple steps we need to do here,

21
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:37.360
first I'll add an order.js file in the models folder because I'll need an order model to store

22
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.960
data in an orders collection.

23
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.390
First of all let's import mongoose here by requiring mongoose like that,

24
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.950
let's create the schema constant where we access mongoose schema like this

25
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.950
and let's then define our order schema and how that should look like

26
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.010
and of course here you can really also go with the schema that works for you

27
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.360
or that you want to use.

28
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:09.600
Now I will try to recreate the schema we used before where an order had the items and the user data

29
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:19.000
and that was it and the items were our products which in the past was all the product data and the quantity.

30
00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:26.720
So here in my schema, I will have my products let's say, I named it items in the past, here I'll name it

31
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:35.270
products. Products will be an array of documents and every document will let's say have the product data

32
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:48.230
which will be of type object because this will be a full other document you could say that is required

33
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.130
and besides the product data, I'll have to quantity for that product,

34
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.220
could also name this just product here by the way if you wanted to.

35
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:07.870
So here the quantity and that will be a type of number and this should also be required. Ok so this is how

36
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.550
my products will look like,

37
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.580
now I also will have a user and there I want to have a name

38
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:22.040
let's say where the type is a string and this is required and what else did we store about the user

39
00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.200
in the past,

40
00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:35.840
well just the ID so also have my user ID here which is of type schema types objectid and which is also

41
00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.940
required

42
00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:44.880
and this will also refer to the user model. Now type object by the way is a bit of a shortcut,

43
00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.860
of course we could define the full nested product with all the properties there,

44
00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.090
feel free to do that,

45
00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.970
I'll just say well this is any object.

46
00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.500
So this is my order schema,

47
00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:03.320
now I'll export a model based on that schema with mongoose model, name that order and hence the collection

48
00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.850
will be named orders

49
00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.140
and then I got my order schema there.

50
00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.820
Ok so

51
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.540
now I got my order model and that is new, we didn't use that before in the last module, we could have

52
00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.860
but now we well we implemented it differently there.

53
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:23.600
Now since we use a model based package again for interacting with the data, we have to be more strict about

54
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.050
that

55
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:30.110
and that is a good thing generally and therefore we have an order model again. Now with the order model

56
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.620
added

57
00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.670
the question is how do we interact between the order model and the user

58
00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:42.690
now? We had add order in the past and add order essentially just grabbed user data, products, created

59
00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.270
an order and stored it,

60
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.440
now I still want to do that but I'll do it in a controller now. In post order,

61
00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:59.360
I'll work a bit differently, I will first of all import my order model at the top from models order

62
00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:00.160
like this,

63
00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:01.670
so this import was added

64
00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:13.500
and then down there in post order, I will create a new order object by using that order model constructor.

65
00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.890
Now that order object needs to be initialized and it needs to be initialized in the way we defined it here,

66
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:23.480
so it needs to get products and it needs to get some user data.

67
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.390
Now the user data is a bit simpler,

68
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:27.220
we got our request user,

69
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:33.640
so here we have the name which is request user name because remember, request user is a full user object

70
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.720
fetched from the database

71
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:41.310
so there will be a name property and we also want to store the ID of that user in the order,

72
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.610
we also have like the user ID,

73
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.560
so we should store that as well,

74
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:53.940
so we'll add user ID here and that will simply be, well we can just use the entire request user object

75
00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.840
and as I mentioned mongoose will pick the ID from there.

76
00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:58.040
Ok

77
00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.620
so this is the easier part,

78
00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.310
now we also need to add the products for these users cart.

79
00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:11.100
However it's not that difficult because we already implemented something similar. For getting the cart,

80
00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:16.260
we use this approach for fetching all the products that are in the users cart.

81
00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:22.860
So in the end we can just copy this here, all the way up to the part where I extract the products and

82
00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.070
reuse that in post order at the beginning here,

83
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.550
just make sure to close that then function here

84
00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.740
and here we now got the products that are in the users cart.

85
00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.880
Now important is just products is not entirely correct,

86
00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:46.180
you should remember that here we have an array of elements were we have the quantity and then the real

87
00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.870
product data was nested in a product ID field

88
00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:51.740
but we can work with that of course.

89
00:06:51.880 --> 00:07:01.480
We can now create our order inside of this then block and here, we can now add products which should be

90
00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:06.170
an array of products and that should be an array of products which is a bit transformed,

91
00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:13.120
so not the structure of products we get back here but after some transformations, to be precise products

92
00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:19.130
for us need to have a product field with the product data and a quantity field, that is almost what we have

93
00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:25.630
but we have the product data in a product ID field here, not in a product field but that is easy to fix.

94
00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.610
I will simply not just extract items like this,

95
00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:37.870
I will also map the items so that I store the changed items in my products array and a mapped item should

96
00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:44.530
still have its quantity so I'll keep that, the i simply refers to the item since this function goes

97
00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:50.920
through all items in that array, so we'll have the quantity. And then we'll have a product field and the product

98
00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:57.760
field should have all the product data so that we'll store everything that I had in i product ID before

99
00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:00.310
because that was the old structure we had in there,

100
00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:03.060
now we have this structure,

101
00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:09.430
we have an array of products which just have a quantity and then the product detail data which is exactly

102
00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:12.240
the structure we expect to get in the order model

103
00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:17.280
and now we can simply store these products in the order.

104
00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:20.230
And with that we got everything we need

105
00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:28.700
almost, now we just need to call save on that order, so order save now saves that order to the database.

106
00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:33.790
And then we can chain then on that

107
00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:38.440
once we return order save so that we can also redirect and so on.

108
00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:45.650
Let's see if that works by going to our shop routes again and commenting the create order route back

109
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:49.280
in and now back in our project,

110
00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:54.860
let me first of all add a second product so that we get something to play around with and see that this

111
00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:59.030
does not get added, this is just a dummy product obviously.

112
00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.410
So now in our cart we got no products,

113
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:08.310
let's add a nice book to our cart, 

114
00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.310
maybe also from the details page

115
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:13.950
and let's not add the other product and let's click

116
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:14.890
order now.

117
00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.150
Now we don't find the page we want to redirect to,

118
00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:21.800
that's fine and the cart also was not cleared because we haven't added that logic yet

119
00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:27.510
but let's have a look into compass and let's see, if we refresh the entire setup,

120
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:33.730
we got the orders collection and in there I got an order with some user data, that looks pretty good,

121
00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.630
let's quickly confirm the user ID,

122
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:37.920
it ends with 8A8,

123
00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:42.180
that looks good and let's have a look at the products there too

124
00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:46.000
and there I got a quantity of two and I got my product ID.

125
00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:52.340
Well the product ID, is that what I wanted though? I wanted all the product data right,

126
00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:54.260
let's fix that in the next lecture.
