00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.310
We had a closer look at error handling,

2
00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:10.970
now let me remove that code here where I create a duplicate ID so that it works again.

3
00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.890
I hope you got an idea of how error handling can work and how we can use that central error handling

4
00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:21.500
function or our own logic which we have in place all the time where we check for the existence of a

5
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.320
product and redirect otherwise and so on.

6
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.290
So we get a bunch of code already in our application where we do handle a certain situations which we

7
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:31.760
want to avoid of course

8
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.770
and you can always be more creative and handle them in a better way.

9
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.790
For example here and get added product,

10
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.150
if I don't find a product, I redirect to the starting page.

11
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.880
Now you can of course enhance this and you could redirect back to the admin products page and flash

12
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.580
a message onto that page which you then output in the ejs template to give the user more information

13
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:53.720
on what went wrong,

14
00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:00.410
I'm not doing this here to not spend a lot of time on working on the UI only but these are all things

15
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:07.340
you can do. What I want you to takeaway here is that you have measures or that you have tools for

16
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.420
handling errors

17
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.900
and one of the most important tool is to at least handle all these catch blocks here correctly

18
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.080
and therefore I will do that and replace it with my catch block where I throw that error or where I

19
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.780
forward this error here because this allows me to at least centrally handle them with a 500 page, if

20
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.070
I do nothing else,

21
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.800
this is better than nothing.

22
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.790
So I'll use that on all my catch blocks here, also in auth.js,

23
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.210
there not for this one here

24
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:46.630
but for this one, I'll also add this catch block, the same for this one, basically for all the catch blocks

25
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.840
where I just log something to the console,

26
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:58.680
there I want to forward to the 500 page. Here as well and you can call that anywhere of course, not

27
00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.960
just inside the next block

28
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:06.090
whenever you create an error object and you next it and you avoid any code being executed

29
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.220
after this by returning next with the error, whenever you do that, you end up in your express error

30
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.510
handling function.

31
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.230
And just because it's really important, this is just one way of handling this,

32
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.170
you also have all the other if checks and so on which we added,

33
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.850
so this is just my last resort here that I always do at least that if everything else fails.

34
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:32.310
And now we should have an application which is a little bit more hardened or at least shows some message

35
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.030
to the user when something fails instead of just doing well

36
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:43.460
nothing basically as we did before because you want to avoid situations where the app just crashes and

37
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:49.820
you don't even tell the user, it's better to have some code in place that at least returns an error page.

38
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:56.300
And now with all these changes here, you should be able to still click around and use that application

39
00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:57.810
as you did before,

40
00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.070
you can also delete for example, so that all works.

41
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:07.530
But now we got proper error handling in place for scenarios where something does go wrong.
