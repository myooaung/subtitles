00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:08,950
So right now, our get products page is a bit broken because there we still use fetch all in a way that

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:14,810
well simply does not work, we don't have this callback approach anymore

3
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:19,680
so we have to remove that and instead we still want to render our view here in the end

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,200
but we can pretty much copy the code we have here on get index

5
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,990
and of course you could also therefore refactor this to use a shared function.

6
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:35,190
But there, I now also have my then block and catch block and I will simply replace the render function there

7
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:41,620
to not render the index page but the products page and use the rows as products. By the way,

8
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,710
you can of course get rid of that field data,

9
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,450
you don't need to extract that because we're not using it,

10
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,960
I just wanted to show you how you can extract the different elements of an array in the argument list

11
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,090
already.

12
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,910
With that if you save this, the products page will also work again.

13
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,830
Now that's all nice,

14
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,700
what about add product?

15
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,400
Let's tackle that next.
