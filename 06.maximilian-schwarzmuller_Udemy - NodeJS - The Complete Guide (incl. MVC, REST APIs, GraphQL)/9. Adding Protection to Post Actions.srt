1
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,540
We're restricting the amount of products we can see

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,270
and that is one great step forward

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:14,200
but it still doesn't mean we can't send requests somehow by creating our own pages where we still

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,490
try to delete another product.

5
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:24,960
So we should also add protections in our post actions, like in post edit and post delete product, there

6
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:30,700
we want to check that the product I try to delete is really created by the user who is currently logged

7
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:31,220
in.

8
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:36,300
So in post edit product, there I might want to add a check

9
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:42,400
once I found the product that should be edited where I see if I'm allowed to edit that product.

10
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:47,920
So here in the then block where I have that product fetched from the database, there I will quickly

11
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:59,050
check if product user ID is not equal to request user ID because if it's not equal, then this means the

12
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,800
wrong user is trying to edit this.

13
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:10,030
So here I then want to return and simply redirect back to the starting page let's say because we try

14
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:11,530
to do something fishy here,

15
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,830
we don't want to continue,

16
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:17,290
so all the other code will now not run.

17
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,650
We would still go into that

18
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:25,080
then block though as you learned because the next then block is still executed even if I do redirect

19
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,120
here,

20
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,400
so to circumvent this, I'll add

21
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,360
then right after save here

22
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:40,100
so a nested then block so to say and now we have protection in place that ensures that we can start editing

23
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:47,570
products that don't belong to us. To quickly check this, I'll temporarily remove my filter so that I can

24
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:51,380
see all the products again and I will log in with the wrong account,

25
00:01:51,830 --> 00:02:00,540
so with test2 and now what we should see is that when I edit this and add a couple of exclamation marks

26
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:09,900
and I click update, I'm redirected but the edit wasn't saved because I essentially ended up in my extra check

27
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:18,350
here and I was redirected back but without saving the changes because this code was never executed.

28
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:24,970
Now let's try the same for deleting before I re-add my filter here. For deleting

29
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:31,520
I also want to check if I'm really allowed to delete that product and we can easily implement this by

30
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:37,290
changing our deletion method here and use delete one

31
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:44,990
and there I want to delete the product where the ID is equal to the prod ID but also where the user

32
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:47,090
ID is equal to the request

33
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,500
user ID.

34
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,920
So both has to be true

35
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:56,900
now, the Product ID alone is not enough, the user id also has to match and therefore even if we have

36
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:01,730
a valid user id, it will not delete this product if the user ID does not match.

37
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:09,530
So if I save this and I go to admin products with the wrong account still and I click delete,

38
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,330
you see the product doesn't go anywhere,

39
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,550
still there.

40
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:19,940
Now let me add that filter in get products again so that we can't even see it

41
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:25,480
and now we have the best possible set up because now we can really only see it in that account where

42
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,420
we are able to interact with it.

43
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:34,420
So if I do login with that valid account, there I do see it and there I now also should be able

44
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:38,680
to edit it, though if I try that, it fails.

45
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:41,290
So let's explore what's wrong here in the next lecture.
