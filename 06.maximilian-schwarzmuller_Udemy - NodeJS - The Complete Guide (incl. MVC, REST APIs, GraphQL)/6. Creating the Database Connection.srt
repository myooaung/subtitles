1
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:10,080
We connected to mongodb and this is nice but it also means that we can't do anything else right now,

2
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:12,240
the rest of the app is not working anymore

3
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,060
and of course it should work.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:21,370
So let's get there step by step and let's start by re-adding the admin routes,

5
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:26,820
so let's add this middleware again and for this, I also need to import admin routes again

6
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:34,480
and if we now have a look into our admin controller, here we do of course use the product model, in the

7
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,880
product model if

8
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:42,580
we have a look into that does rely on sequelize of course because we define the product model with

9
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,140
the help of sequelize.

10
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:48,670
Now that is all something which we won't do anymore

11
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,170
instead we now want to use mongodb.

12
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:59,860
So to get there, I will remove these two imports up there and instead in here, I want to create a new

13
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,740
class again because I'll create my own model again

14
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:08,980
and this is something we did before already in the pure MySQL module. So I'll create a product class

15
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,770
here, like this

16
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:16,940
and of course I will also export this, so module exports will still be my class here.

17
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:25,690
Now in that class, I'll have a constructor and in that constructor here, I want to store the title, price,

18
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:29,170
image url and description of the product when it gets created.

19
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:38,560
So here I will simply get the title, the price, the description and the image url and then in the constructor

20
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:47,440
I'll say this title equals title, this price equals price, this description equals description, well and

21
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:47,830
so on,

22
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:48,830
you know the game,

23
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:52,820
so here image url equals image url.

24
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:59,290
Now we can create a new product in javascript, a new object which follows this form

25
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:04,350
and now to save it in the database, I will also add a save method here,

26
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:11,230
so a function which can be executed on this class and in here, I now want to connect to mongodb

27
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:13,810
and save my product.

28
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,870
Now to do that, to be able to connect,

29
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:20,600
I'll need to import mongodb or mongo connect,

30
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:27,840
so I'll import mongo connect from my utility folder and there from the database file.

31
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,260
So I will simply import that method,

32
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:37,860
the function I created here where you pass a callback to, where we do connect to mongodb inside

33
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:43,830
and then we basically execute the callback and return the connected client so that we can interact

34
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,850
with it.

35
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:51,620
However if we would do this, we would have to connect to mongodb for every operation we do

36
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,960
and we would not even disconnect thereafter,

37
00:02:53,970 --> 00:03:00,150
so this is not really a good way of connecting to mongodb since we will want to connect and

38
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,780
interact with it from different places in our app.

39
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:09,600
So it would be better if we could manage one connection in our database and then simply return access

40
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:15,960
to the client which we set up once from there or to the different place in our app that need access. And

41
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:23,040
to do that, I'll tune my set up here a bit. Let's tune it together in the next lecture.
