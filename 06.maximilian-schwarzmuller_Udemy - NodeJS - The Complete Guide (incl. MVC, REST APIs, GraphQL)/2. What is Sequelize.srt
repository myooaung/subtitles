00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:10,300
Now before we start using it, what is sequelize actually? Sequelize is a third party package, to be

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,320
precise

3
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:15,290
it's an object relational mapping library

4
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:23,440
and this is a pretty long name which simply means it does all the heavy lifting, all the SQL code

5
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:31,120
behind the scenes for us and maps it into javascript objects with convenience methods which we can call

6
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:37,650
to execute that behind the scenes SQL code so that we never have to write SQL code on our own.

7
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,490
It works like this,

8
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:45,410
we got our object let's say a user with a name, age, email and password but of course this can be anything,

9
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:53,110
could be a product, whatever you need and this is mapped to a database table by sequelize, so it automatically

10
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:58,660
creates that table for us even, it automatically sets up relations and tables even for us, it does all

11
00:00:58,660 --> 00:00:59,450
that

12
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:06,910
and when we create a new user for example, we simply call a method on that user javascript object and

13
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:12,880
sequelize executes the SQL query or the SQL command that is required.

14
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,720
So instead of writing this on our own, we simply create a javascript object and work with that

15
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:25,390
and here would be one example using sequelize to create a new user which would behind the scenes execute the SQL

16
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:28,490
code we don't have to write. Sequelize

17
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:32,770
offers us the models to work with our database

18
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:37,000
as I showed you on the last slide and it allows us to define such models,

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,350
so basically define which data makes up a model and therefore which data will be saved in the database.

20
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:50,590
We can then instantiate these models, so these classes so to say, we can execute the constructor functions

21
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:56,600
or use utility methods to create let's say a new user object based on that model

22
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:00,690
so we have a connection here and we can then run queries on that.

23
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:06,890
That could be that we save a new user but it could also be that we find all users as an example

24
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:12,730
and here again, this always relates back to our model which we define with sequelize. And we can also

25
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,410
associate our models,

26
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:18,620
for example we could associate our user model to a product model.

27
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,470
So this is what sequelize does

28
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:25,010
but of course we dont just want to learn that in theory, we want to see that in practice.

29
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:31,090
So let's add sequelize to our project and let's slowly integrate it to manage our products in our cart and so

30
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,680
on through sequelize.
