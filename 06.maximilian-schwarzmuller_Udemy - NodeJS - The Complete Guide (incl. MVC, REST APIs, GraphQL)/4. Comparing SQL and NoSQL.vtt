00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:04.820
So we learn about SQL and NoSQL,

2
00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:09.530
let's now compare them and let's start with horizontal and vertical scaling because as I mentioned at

3
00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:15.260
the end of the last lecture, we often need to scale our database to keep up with our growing application

4
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.490
with more and more users. Horizontal and vertical scaling

5
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.640
are the two approaches we can use to scale our database.

6
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.540
Now what do they mean? Well in horizontal scaling, we simply add more servers.

7
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.750
and the advantage here of course is that we can do this infinitely.

8
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:38.420
We can always buy new servers, be that on a cloud provider or in our own data center and connect

9
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.650
them to our database and split our data across all these servers,

10
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.630
of course this means that we also need some process that runs queries on all of them and merges them together

11
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:48.580
intelligently,

12
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:54.050
so this is generally something which is not that easy to do but this is of course a good way of scaling.

13
00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:03.020
Vertical scaling simply means that we make our existing server stronger by adding more CPU or memory

14
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.890
or with something like that, especially with cloud providers,

15
00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.800
this is typically very easy, you simply choose another option from the dropdown,

16
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.960
you pay more and you're done,

17
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.260
the problem here is that you have some limit, you can't fit infinitely much CPU power into a single

18
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.150
machine.

19
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.720
So these are the two ways we can scale,

20
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.790
how let's compare a SQL and NoSQL

21
00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:33.310
regarding that and in general. Now in general in SQL we use schemas, we also have relations,

22
00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.250
these are two core characteristics and data is typically distributed across many many tables which

23
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.850
are then connected through relations.

24
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:48.580
Now regarding the scaling, it's important that horizontal scaling often is very difficult or even impossible

25
00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.810
due to the way SQL works,

26
00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:57.030
you can of course add more servers but running them all on one shared data cloud

27
00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.160
so to say, one shared database is pretty difficult.

28
00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.400
Vertical scaling is easily possible,

29
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:09.500
you can simply make your server stronger but adding more servers can be very hard or even impossible,

30
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.960
so definitely not trivial.

31
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:18.790
So this is a problem possibly if we have multiple or thousands of read and write queries per second,

32
00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:26.920
then maybe our SQL database especially if we do very complex joins between related tables can reach

33
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.770
limits or can not be the best choice.

34
00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:39.250
NoSQL is schemaless and has only a few relations if at all, the data is typically not distributed

35
00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:45.800
across multiple collections but instead we work with merged or nested documents in an existing document,

36
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.610
though we of course also have a couple of collections for the different features of our application typically.

37
00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.410
With NoSQL, horizontal scaling is easier,

38
00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:01.000
still something where you have to know what you do but there are cloud providers which do that for us

39
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:07.090
so we don't have to know the ins and outs of that and in general, due to the way it works with less connections

40
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:13.630
and so on, this is possible. And therefore we also get great performance for mass read and write requests and

41
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:19.190
NoSQL can be very performant in an application with high throughput.

42
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:25.420
Now this makes SQL look very bad but the full truth is that it always depends on the kind of data

43
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.740
you are storing,

44
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.810
if you are storing where the relations are really important and where you want to have a split up across

45
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.310
tables and where you want to have strong schemas, SQL can be perfect,

46
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.610
also not every part of your data is accessed multiple times per second.

47
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.130
You can have parts of your application where you manage general data,

48
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.600
let's say user data which does not change that often and therefore, SQL might be very good

49
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:59.260
there. Other parts of the application, let's say orders or shopping carts that do change frequently could

50
00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:05.170
be stored with NoSQL and there, the relations might also not be that important because you can always put

51
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.420
all the information that belongs to a shopping cart or to an order in one single document

52
00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.310
and even if you do for example store some user data there, you might not need to touch that document

53
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:21.360
just because the user change his photo because you probably didn't store that along with the order anyways.

54
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:23.870
Now in this course, we will build both,

55
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.430
we will use both because I want to teach you both

56
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:32.190
and it's not so much about this course application but you should know how to use SQL with nodejs

57
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.900
because maybe you need to add in your application or you're working on a project where you don't decide which

58
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.460
database to use but you simply have to use it.

59
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:46.010
So we will use SQL first but then I will also show you how to use NoSQL of mongodb,

60
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:52.300
so we'll basically implement the course project or the current state of the course project with both

61
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.910
databases and you will see how to interact with both of them.

62
00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:01.630
And let's start with SQL in this module, let's install a MySQL database and learn how to interact

63
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.170
with it from inside our nodejs code.
