00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:10,120
That's it for this module. You learned about the important MVC pattern and there the model serves the purpose

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:17,320
of representing our data and of managing our data, saving it, fetching it, later also updating it and so

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:22,200
on. And it doesn't matter if you manage your data in memory, files or databases,

4
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,490
it is the model which is responsible for your data,

5
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,850
it contains all the data related logic.

6
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:33,940
The view on the other hand is responsible for presenting it to the user, is responsible for what the

7
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:39,790
user sees and it shouldn't contain too much logic which might remind you of the handlebars templating

8
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:46,470
engine which kind of forced you to not put too much logic into there. With ejs, the templating engine

9
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,540
I'm using here,

10
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:54,370
you can put more logic into the view and you should always well try to find your own personal balance.

11
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:59,830
Some people want to have a super pure approach, other people like me are fine with a little bit of logic

12
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:03,760
in the templates but you should definitely not put too much in there,

13
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:10,900
your logic should be in the model or partly in the controller because the controller should do everything

14
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,670
that needs to be done to connect your model and the view,

15
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:21,800
so to get the data from A to B and that can involve both directions. It can mean that through your view,

16
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:22,870
through a form,

17
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:29,500
some data was sent to your node express application and you now need to send that to the model to save it

18
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:30,070
there

19
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:36,520
or it can of course mean you're fetching data from the model or via the model and send that into a view

20
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,940
which is then returned to the user.

21
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:45,310
This is the MVC pattern and I will continue to work with that for the rest of this project here or for the

22
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:51,580
next modules put in other words and speaking of that, our module still can use some work right,

23
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:56,160
we're only working with a very limited set of features,

24
00:01:56,230 --> 00:02:00,980
even our product is just one field for now and we can certainly do better.

25
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:07,450
So the whole next module will be on working on our project and therefore practicing all the things we

26
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,480
learned thus far

27
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,760
and of course no worries,

28
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,070
we'll then also add databases and so on,

29
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,060
that is all coming.
