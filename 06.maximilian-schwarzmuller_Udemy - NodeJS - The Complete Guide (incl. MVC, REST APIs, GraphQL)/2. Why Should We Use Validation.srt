1
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:09,430
So why would we want to add some data or input validation to our application?

2
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:16,090
Well if we have a user interacting with our website, then we typically have a lot of forms on any

3
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:22,510
web application we build. In our example project for example, we have a form for signing up,

4
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:26,490
we got one for signing in and we got one for adding products

5
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:31,990
and the bigger your application is, the more data you will need from your users at some point of time.

6
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:37,840
So we have that form with which our user, our visitor of the website interacts with.

7
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,780
Now in the end when this form is submitted with a post request as we controlled it in our form, then

8
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,220
a request is sent to our backend and

9
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,430
by the way you could also configure it to send a get request

10
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:55,570
but the key thing here is a request with the form data is sent and we're already doing this in this

11
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:00,230
course because this is a crucial task in any web application.

12
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:08,500
Now on our backend so our nodejs code, we then typically interact with a database or maybe we write

13
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,380
the data into a normal file but in the end we take that data which we receive and we want to store

14
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:15,530
it.

15
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:22,360
Now this is exactly the part which can be dangerous or problematic though. Right now in the app we got no

16
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,850
kind of data validation,

17
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:31,960
so if a user in our current application would try to login with something that is not a valid email

18
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,960
address, we would allow that,

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,650
we're not preventing the user from entering something incorrect.

20
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:44,380
The same is true for adding a product, we don't care about what the user enters and this is what I want

21
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:51,990
to change in this module. We'll add some validation as an extra step right at the start of our nodejs

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,350
code so right at the start when we handled a request on the server, definitely before we store it in

23
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:06,040
a database. And this validation can then either succeed and allow the data to be written to the database

24
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:13,150
or to a file or allow it to be handled by the rest of our node code or we reject the input and then

25
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:19,030
basically return some information to the user prompting the user to correct the error.

26
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:24,670
So this is what we will work on in this module and I will show you how to validate and how to provide

27
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,240
a good user experience.
