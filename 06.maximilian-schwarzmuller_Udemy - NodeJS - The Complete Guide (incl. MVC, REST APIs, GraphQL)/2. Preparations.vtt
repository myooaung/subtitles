00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:08.330
Now before we dive into dynamic routes you need to adjust your project a bit, either because you skipped

2
00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:14.120
the last module altogether and therefore you should download the entire snapshot I attached to this

3
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.620
lecture which contains my latest state

4
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:24.050
but you should also download that snapshot or the adjustments zip file which contains the files you will

5
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.490
need to add to your project in case you don't want to use my snapshot

6
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.260
but if you skip the last module, always go with that snapshot. Now in the adjustments zip file and you

7
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.680
can ignore that if you download the snapshot, in the adjustments zip file you will find that javascript

8
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.380
file, the main.js file which you should move into a js folder in the public folder,

9
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:51.620
you will also find that main.css file and the product.css file in there and you should also

10
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:58.030
replace yours in the css folder with the ones you find attached because I fine tune some styles.

11
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:05.630
Additionally, make sure that you also replace all the views you find in that attached zip file and

12
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.720
you simply replace your existing files or their content with the attached files or the content of the attached

13
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.600
files.

14
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.700
And with that added

15
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.390
and in case you are facing any problems, simply take the snapshot. With all that added,

16
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.500
let's now start writing our dynamic route code.
