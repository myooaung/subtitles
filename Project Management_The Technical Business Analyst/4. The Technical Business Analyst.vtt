00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.098
Now that we have the groundwork laid for analysis,

2
00:00:03.098 --> 00:00:06.987
analyst, business analyst, and the activities they perform,

3
00:00:06.987 --> 00:00:11.237
along with the many designations of a business analyst and

4
00:00:11.237 --> 00:00:13.623
extraneous titles of roles people perform,

5
00:00:13.623 --> 00:00:21.108
let's take a shot at defining the technical business analyst.

6
00:00:21.108 --> 00:00:23.525
A technical business analyst is a business analyst who,

7
00:00:23.525 --> 00:00:26.671
in addition to typical business analyst skills we

8
00:00:26.671 --> 00:00:28.128
discussed earlier in this module,

9
00:00:28.128 --> 00:00:32.088
also employs more complex analysis and technical tools,

10
00:00:32.088 --> 00:00:36.358
possesses greater business and technical understanding of systems,

11
00:00:36.358 --> 00:00:40.991
and can communicate with a richer and deeper level to both

12
00:00:40.991 --> 00:00:46.108
the business and the technical communities.

13
00:00:46.108 --> 00:00:47.603
Let's not forget, though,

14
00:00:47.603 --> 00:00:50.242
a technical business analyst is no different than most

15
00:00:50.242 --> 00:00:53.355
business analysts in that they still need the basic skills

16
00:00:53.355 --> 00:00:57.158
that all analysts should have, such as oral and written communication skills,

17
00:00:57.158 --> 00:01:02.118
interpersonal, consultative, and facilitation skills,

18
00:01:02.118 --> 00:01:05.088
analytical thinking and problem solving,

19
00:01:05.088 --> 00:01:10.295
being detail oriented, and capable of delivering a high level of accuracy,

20
00:01:10.295 --> 00:01:12.451
organizational skills and, of course,

21
00:01:12.451 --> 00:01:18.128
knowledge of the business structure of where they work.

22
00:01:18.128 --> 00:01:20.088
And here are a few more items.

23
00:01:20.088 --> 00:01:20.674
Stakeholder analysis.

24
00:01:20.674 --> 00:01:25.098
What I mean by this is you need to identify your stakeholders,

25
00:01:25.098 --> 00:01:28.618
and this may be harder than you think, and analyze their needs,

26
00:01:28.618 --> 00:01:30.118
which could vary widely.

27
00:01:30.118 --> 00:01:33.995
You need to seek out the stakeholders who have a vested interest in the

28
00:01:33.995 --> 00:01:36.158
requirements with which the project is concerned.

29
00:01:36.158 --> 00:01:39.932
Requirements engineering refers to the process that defining,

30
00:01:39.932 --> 00:01:43.178
documenting, and maintaining requirements during the design process.

31
00:01:43.178 --> 00:01:47.603
This can be quite challenging and complex on larger projects,

32
00:01:47.603 --> 00:01:51.128
spanning multiple departments with competing in ever-changing needs.

33
00:01:51.128 --> 00:01:52.253
Cost benefit analysis.

34
00:01:52.253 --> 00:01:56.278
Now this is the systematic approach to estimating the strengths

35
00:01:56.278 --> 00:01:59.168
and weaknesses of alternatives used to determine options which

36
00:01:59.168 --> 00:02:03.569
provide the best approach to achieving the intended business

37
00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:06.158
outcomes in the most affordable way.

38
00:02:06.158 --> 00:02:06.903
Process modeling.

39
00:02:06.903 --> 00:02:10.618
This is the activity of representing processes of an enterprise

40
00:02:10.618 --> 00:02:13.269
so that the current process may be analyzed,

41
00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:14.148
improved, and automated.

42
00:02:14.148 --> 00:02:19.036
This also requires a high business acumen to capture the as is process,

43
00:02:19.036 --> 00:02:23.108
validate among the stakeholders, and design improvements,

44
00:02:23.108 --> 00:02:27.178
understanding of networks, databases, and other technologies.

45
00:02:27.178 --> 00:02:31.428
Now I will address this in much more detail in the module Bridging The Gap,

46
00:02:31.428 --> 00:02:35.088
as well as a little later in this module as well since much of the

47
00:02:35.088 --> 00:02:38.108
technical BA's job is in fact more technical in nature,

48
00:02:38.108 --> 00:02:40.108
and much, much more of course.

49
00:02:40.108 --> 00:02:49.000
This is just a partial list to give you the basic stuff, if you will, that the technical BA must also be expert in.
