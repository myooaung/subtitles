00:00:01,022 --> 00:00:04,402
Here is what I'm calling the magnificent seven of the technical BA's

2
00:00:04,402 --> 00:00:08,032
skill areas where you can best focus your energies.

3
00:00:08,032 --> 00:00:11,062
Design the user interface and user experience.

4
00:00:11,062 --> 00:00:13,112
You know the requirements and the users very well,

5
00:00:13,112 --> 00:00:17,689
so you can provide valuable insights here by utilizing the tools to

6
00:00:17,689 --> 00:00:20,082
develop the user interface and experience mock-ups.

7
00:00:20,082 --> 00:00:24,359
The method or technique known as prototyping is used to elicit

8
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:26,112
and validate stakeholder or user requirements.

9
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:30,042
Again, you can apply some great tools to perform this function.

10
00:00:30,042 --> 00:00:31,032
Data modeling.

11
00:00:31,032 --> 00:00:32,532
Today, data is everywhere,

12
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:36,883
and you better know where it is and how to get to it and how to

13
00:00:36,883 --> 00:00:40,042
reshape or model it to meet the customer's requirements.

14
00:00:40,042 --> 00:00:43,754
Business data analytics is the skill of analyzing raw data in

15
00:00:43,754 --> 00:00:46,082
order to make decisions about that information.

16
00:00:46,082 --> 00:00:51,102
This will include data mining, SQL, and visualization as well.

17
00:00:51,102 --> 00:00:54,745
Here are the other three technical BA's skill areas where you should focus

18
00:00:54,745 --> 00:00:58,092
your time in learning and applying them in your daily work.

19
00:00:58,092 --> 00:01:02,385
Interface analysis is a connection between two entities,

20
00:01:02,385 --> 00:01:05,032
people, systems, applications, etc.

21
00:01:05,032 --> 00:01:08,022
No person, system or application is an island.

22
00:01:08,022 --> 00:01:10,072
Everything is connecting to everything.

23
00:01:10,072 --> 00:01:13,022
Quality assurance test plan and test cases.

24
00:01:13,022 --> 00:01:16,692
Developing the test plan and the individual test cases will help you

25
00:01:16,692 --> 00:01:20,052
validate that the software engineers built the system to spec.

26
00:01:20,052 --> 00:01:24,042
Off-the-shelf solutions, cloud services, and other building blocks.

27
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,092
Not every problem should be solved by custom solutions.

28
00:01:26,092 --> 00:01:31,072
If you can find the perfect off-the-shelf, pre-built solution, well, use it.

29
00:01:31,072 --> 00:01:35,072
Typically, though, you may need to integrate a couple of off-the-shelf solutions.

30
00:01:35,072 --> 00:01:39,022
I could have just used the term off-the-shelf solutions and left it at that,

31
00:01:39,022 --> 00:01:42,062
but by far, the largest off-the-shelf solution,

32
00:01:42,062 --> 00:01:45,052
if you will, on the planet is cloud computing,

33
00:01:45,052 --> 00:01:49,042
and then all the other thousands of other cloud-based building blocks.

34
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:52,494
There is no way I can cover all the tools you may need to know since the

35
00:01:52,494 --> 00:01:56,072
technical BA's domain is broad and varies by organization,

36
00:01:56,072 --> 00:01:58,112
so I have curated the list down to a handful,

37
00:01:58,112 --> 00:02:04,062
these seven, that I believe may provide the biggest bang for the buck.

38
00:02:04,062 --> 00:02:08,112
Before we dive in, I want to tell you about my approach for each skill area.

39
00:02:08,112 --> 00:02:14,072
I will first tell you what it is, then why the skill area or tool is important,

40
00:02:14,072 --> 00:02:16,102
and when you might apply the skill area,

41
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:16,605
and lastly,

42
00:02:16,605 --> 00:02:20,671
we will take a closer look with an example or two of the tools in the

43
00:02:20,671 --> 00:02:23,072
market that would be representative of the area.

44
00:02:23,072 --> 00:02:26,052
I will never promote any tool in particular,

45
00:02:26,052 --> 00:02:31,000
but point out tools in that area to give you a start on where to research further.
