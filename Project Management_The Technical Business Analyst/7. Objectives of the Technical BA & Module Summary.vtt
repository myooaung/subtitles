00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.085
Let's not lose sight of the basic high-level goals and objectives,

2
00:00:04.085 --> 00:00:09.020
so let's summarize what the technical BA needs to accomplish their job.

3
00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.662
Be an excellent business analyst transforming business needs into requirements,

4
00:00:12.662 --> 00:00:14.100
that's number one to me.

5
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.100
You will determine why you need the new system and what it will do.

6
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.030
Next, the technical BA is responsible for communicating requirements to IT.

7
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:24.833
Heads up, this can be very challenging,

8
00:00:24.833 --> 00:00:28.020
so brush up on your communication skills as well.

9
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.717
Leveraging and using the necessary technical tools to

10
00:00:31.717 --> 00:00:33.050
better convey the requirements.

11
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.110
Now we'll cover several of them in the module Tools of the Trade.

12
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.602
Lastly,

13
00:00:36.602 --> 00:00:41.676
to have a good knowledge of the technology solutions to enable better

14
00:00:41.676 --> 00:00:45.070
communication without determining how the system will be developed.

15
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.070
That's important.

16
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.739
That typically will be the domain and responsibility of the IT department,

17
00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.020
the application architect or other highly technical positions.

18
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.100
Now, you will have to figure out what depth of technology you need to know,

19
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.080
either based on your passion to learn or the nature or

20
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.060
expectation of your organization,

21
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:09.040
or the depth of technical knowledge in your IT department.

22
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.090
Let's summarize this module.

23
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.733
We defined the business analyst as a liaison among business

24
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:17.627
stakeholders in order to understand the structure,

25
00:01:17.627 --> 00:01:18.050
policies,

26
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.080
and operations of an organization and to recommend solutions that

27
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.090
enable the organization to achieve its business goals.

28
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.330
We learned that there are many designations or labels of the title analyst,

29
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.050
such as business analyst, business architect,

30
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.060
business process analyst, business systems analyst,

31
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.070
and technical business analyst.

32
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.100
We also revealed other roles in a company may be doing analysis work as well,

33
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.050
such as the product owner, developers, project managers or leaders,

34
00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.070
product managers or subject matter expert,

35
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.050
so analysts do not have a corner on the market of analysis.

36
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.080
Then we moved on to provide more clarity as to just what a technical

37
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.100
business analyst is and why they do what they do.

38
00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.289
Now, a technical business analyst is a business analyst who,

39
00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:02.370
in addition to typical business analysis skills,

40
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.430
employs more complex analysis tools and possesses greater business

41
00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.570
knowledge and technical understanding of systems and can

42
00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.150
communicate with a richer and deeper level to both the business

43
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.060
and the technical IT communities.

44
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.394
Also,

45
00:02:17.394 --> 00:02:21.408
it is important that the technical business analyst can have a key

46
00:02:21.408 --> 00:02:25.053
role working with and communicating with the IT teams and should

47
00:02:25.053 --> 00:02:28.073
be experts in user interface design, prototyping,

48
00:02:28.073 --> 00:02:31.097
data modeling, data analytics, interface analysis,

49
00:02:31.097 --> 00:02:35.080
quality assurance, and off-the-shelf solutions.

50
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.707
In the next module, Bridging the Gap Between Business and IT,

51
00:02:38.707 --> 00:02:41.087
we will dive into just how the technical business

52
00:02:41.087 --> 00:02:46.000
analyst can best bridge the gap. See you there!
