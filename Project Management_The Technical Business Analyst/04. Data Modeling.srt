1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
Another important skill is data modeling.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:07,360
Your business use cases in your UI/UX prototype will begin to

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,040
provide some of the necessary information by which you can

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,890
begin creating your data model.

5
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,860
Now for a little humor.

6
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:19,023
Data modeling is the process of designing a complex

7
00:00:19,023 --> 00:00:21,830
set of interrelated data structures,

8
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:25,337
allowing data to be lost while retaining a complete record of the

9
00:00:25,337 --> 00:00:27,880
logical relations between the missing items.

10
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,880
Okay, in all seriousness,

11
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,880
data is the new raw material of the business world today.

12
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,880
Don't ever forget that.

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,830
Let's define data modeling.

14
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,890
First, a data model is an abstract representation of data.

15
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:46,621
Data models include data structures, like fields or elements,

16
00:00:46,621 --> 00:00:47,920
and their relationships.

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,860
How does that data model get created?

18
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,830
Well, by data modeling.

19
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:56,421
Data modeling is the analysis of data objects and their

20
00:00:56,421 --> 00:00:57,900
relationships to other data objects.

21
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,240
Typically, the data model is depicted as an ER diagram,

22
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,850
known as an entity relationship diagram.

23
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:07,850
This is a conceptual model of the business data.

24
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:11,837
Data modeling is often the first step in database design in

25
00:01:11,837 --> 00:01:14,652
object-oriented programming as the designers first create a conceptual

26
00:01:14,652 --> 00:01:19,880
model of how the data items relate to each other.

27
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,870
So why use data modeling?

28
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,830
Today, data is everything.

29
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:28,372
Data modeling provides an enormous amount of business knowledge that you need

30
00:01:28,372 --> 00:01:31,860
to know to enhance your understanding of the requirements.

31
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,870
The outcome of the data modeling process,

32
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:37,537
the model, relationships, constraints, issues,

33
00:01:37,537 --> 00:01:38,203
challenges,

34
00:01:38,203 --> 00:01:42,751
etc., then become artifacts of the business architecture and are added

35
00:01:42,751 --> 00:01:45,830
to the requirements portfolio for the IT project.

36
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:48,860
Formal data modeling of the information held by the

37
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,360
business may expose new requirements,

38
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,910
and inconsistencies will be identified as well.

39
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:56,910
Designing new data and discovering old data.

40
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:00,427
With new requirements will come new forms of data,

41
00:02:00,427 --> 00:02:03,646
but also you will discover old or existing data that must be

42
00:02:03,646 --> 00:02:05,890
part of the new system and data model.

43
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:08,360
So another benefit of data modeling is identifying

44
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,573
all of the other data sources, databases,

45
00:02:10,573 --> 00:02:13,840
spreadsheets, APIs, and the like.

46
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,510
It is a very valuable process of eliciting and validating

47
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:22,920
requirements much beyond data alone, so get good at it.

48
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,910
When to use data modeling.

49
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,920
Well, pretty much always.

50
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,880
It is very hard for me to imagine an application not needing data.

51
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,920
Applications are more data rich than ever today.

52
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,890
To enhance your understanding of the requirements, as I mentioned before.

53
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:41,993
To provide the data model to the IT team as a starting point for

54
00:02:41,993 --> 00:02:44,850
them to build out the new physical data stores,

55
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:47,830
such as SQL databases or other implementations,

56
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:52,021
or design the technical connections to existing data via APIs,

57
00:02:52,021 --> 00:02:55,880
database links or using extract, transform and load tools,

58
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,840
also known as ETLs, for example.

59
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,478
Also you can use data modeling if your organization has

60
00:03:01,478 --> 00:03:03,830
embraced using data dictionaries.

61
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,731
Your data modeling process will rely heavily on the dictionary,

62
00:03:06,731 --> 00:03:10,338
as well as contribute and populate the data dictionary

63
00:03:10,338 --> 00:03:13,910
further from your analysis outcomes.

64
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:18,890
Again, there are a ton of data modeling tools, and here is just a sampling.

65
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:24,860
ER/Studio, Sparx Enterprise Architect, Oracle SQL Developer Data Modeler,

66
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:28,840
CA ERwin, IBM InfoSphere Data Architect,

67
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,890
many others of course.

68
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:36,830
This is just a representative list to get you started in the right direction.

69
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,840
Please don't try and read this slide.

70
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,895
The purpose of this slide is to point out the visualization of

71
00:03:41,895 --> 00:03:50,000
a database schema and its relationships. As usual, I will always emphasize visual tools.
