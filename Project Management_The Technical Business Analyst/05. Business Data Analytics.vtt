00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.882
Sometimes before a system or project ever gets launched and is just

2
00:00:03.882 --> 00:00:06.644
a gleam in the eye of an executive of a company,

3
00:00:06.644 --> 00:00:10.614
they will ask you for information to help them make that decision.

4
00:00:10.614 --> 00:00:14.674
Using business data analytics may be your path to answering those questions.

5
00:00:14.674 --> 00:00:19.624
Let business data analytics be your friend.

6
00:00:19.624 --> 00:00:20.634
Here's a quote.

7
00:00:20.634 --> 00:00:25.248
"We're entering a new world in which data may be more important than software.

8
00:00:25.248 --> 00:00:28.654
" That's a quote from Tim O'Reilly, founder of O'Reilly Media.

9
00:00:28.654 --> 00:00:30.644
Well, I think we're already there.

10
00:00:30.644 --> 00:00:32.684
It seems like today we are awash in data,

11
00:00:32.684 --> 00:00:36.858
so having good technical and analytical skills and tools to

12
00:00:36.858 --> 00:00:39.654
make sense of all this data is critical.

13
00:00:39.654 --> 00:00:43.694
Business data analytics will help you get there.

14
00:00:43.694 --> 00:00:46.664
So what is business data analytics?

15
00:00:46.664 --> 00:00:50.818
Data analytics is the science of analyzing raw data in order

16
00:00:50.818 --> 00:00:53.624
to make decisions about that information.

17
00:00:53.624 --> 00:00:56.169
Data is extracted and tagged to identify and

18
00:00:56.169 --> 00:00:58.644
analyze behavioral data and patterns.

19
00:00:58.644 --> 00:01:02.007
As a technical BA, you are looking for underlying patterns,

20
00:01:02.007 --> 00:01:05.614
relationships, trends, and other characteristics.

21
00:01:05.614 --> 00:01:06.664
With business data analytics,

22
00:01:06.664 --> 00:01:11.674
businesses can augment decision making through visual dashboards and reports.

23
00:01:11.674 --> 00:01:13.654
This is a very large and broad field,

24
00:01:13.654 --> 00:01:18.604
ranging from using a SQL statement all the way to artificial intelligence.

25
00:01:18.604 --> 00:01:20.604
So, maybe you've heard of data mining.

26
00:01:20.604 --> 00:01:22.684
What's the difference between data analytics and data mining?

27
00:01:22.684 --> 00:01:25.684
Well, let's find out.

28
00:01:25.684 --> 00:01:29.604
So let's look at data mining versus data analytics.

29
00:01:29.604 --> 00:01:32.432
Data mining is the processes to search for,

30
00:01:32.432 --> 00:01:33.604
collect, convert,

31
00:01:33.604 --> 00:01:36.771
and/or prepare raw data structures into reasonable

32
00:01:36.771 --> 00:01:39.614
and coalesced repositories of data,

33
00:01:39.614 --> 00:01:43.424
whereas data analytics is a systematic method of discovering,

34
00:01:43.424 --> 00:01:47.684
analyzing, and interpreting that data to make better data-driven decisions.

35
00:01:47.684 --> 00:01:50.667
So data mining collects and aggregates the data,

36
00:01:50.667 --> 00:01:55.684
while data analytics interprets and reports on that data.

37
00:01:55.684 --> 00:01:58.634
Why use business data analytics?

38
00:01:58.634 --> 00:01:58.892
Well,

39
00:01:58.892 --> 00:02:03.144
many times it is important for companies to understand their business data

40
00:02:03.144 --> 00:02:06.654
first before making any sort of investment either in equipment,

41
00:02:06.654 --> 00:02:07.674
labor or technology.

42
00:02:07.674 --> 00:02:11.639
Data analytics technologies and techniques are widely used

43
00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:14.426
in business today to enable organizations to make more

44
00:02:14.426 --> 00:02:16.624
informed business decisions,

45
00:02:16.624 --> 00:02:19.452
and by scientists and researchers to verify or

46
00:02:19.452 --> 00:02:23.604
disprove scientific or business models, theories or hypotheses.

47
00:02:23.604 --> 00:02:28.654
Also, to help reveal hidden patterns and create useful insight during analyses.

48
00:02:28.654 --> 00:02:32.674
Also to help determine what data might be useful to capture going forward,

49
00:02:32.674 --> 00:02:34.258
or how many employees,

50
00:02:34.258 --> 00:02:39.654
customers or systems may be impacted by the data requirements.

51
00:02:39.654 --> 00:02:42.614
When to use business data analytics.

52
00:02:42.614 --> 00:02:44.624
Well, pretty much always.

53
00:02:44.624 --> 00:02:48.644
There should always be a technical BA constantly looking at the company's data,

54
00:02:48.644 --> 00:02:51.694
where they spend too much in costs, determining the customer profile,

55
00:02:51.694 --> 00:02:56.624
who buys the most from the company, to determine why sales are going up or down.

56
00:02:56.624 --> 00:02:57.634
You get the idea.

57
00:02:57.634 --> 00:03:00.652
That said, there is such a wide variety of tools,

58
00:03:00.652 --> 00:03:03.614
some simple and some extremely complex.

59
00:03:03.614 --> 00:03:06.654
Initially use your current in-house tools first, if possible.

60
00:03:06.654 --> 00:03:10.129
Many cloud-based systems today come with their own

61
00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:11.614
reporting or analytical tools.

62
00:03:11.614 --> 00:03:11.920
That's great,

63
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.306
but you will likely have many systems and data sources

64
00:03:14.306 --> 00:03:16.013
that will help you run your company,

65
00:03:16.013 --> 00:03:19.872
so you must first use business data analytic techniques and tools to

66
00:03:19.872 --> 00:03:22.674
integrate and interpret from across all those sources.

67
00:03:22.674 --> 00:03:24.694
Business data analytics is used by companies

68
00:03:24.694 --> 00:03:27.674
committed to data-driven decision making.

69
00:03:27.674 --> 00:03:30.804
Data-driven companies treat their data as a corporate asset

70
00:03:30.804 --> 00:03:33.654
and leverage it for competitive advantage.

71
00:03:33.654 --> 00:03:38.624
You can be right there helping them do that with your skills.

72
00:03:38.624 --> 00:03:42.604
Here's how you might approach business data analytics for the first time.

73
00:03:42.604 --> 00:03:45.614
Let's assume your manager asks you to do some data research,

74
00:03:45.614 --> 00:03:47.604
so you will do some data mining first,

75
00:03:47.604 --> 00:03:49.679
document the outcome or requirement provided by management,

76
00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:52.634
have a good requirement statement laid out.

77
00:03:52.634 --> 00:03:54.644
Next, perform interface analysis.

78
00:03:54.644 --> 00:03:56.684
That is, determine your domain of systems,

79
00:03:56.684 --> 00:03:58.159
datastores and endpoints,

80
00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:01.674
that may contain the information or data you need to research.

81
00:04:01.674 --> 00:04:05.674
We will talk more about the interface analysis skill in the very next section.

82
00:04:05.674 --> 00:04:09.634
Access the data and/or data models in each system or datastore.

83
00:04:09.634 --> 00:04:12.654
Determine real-time access or repository access.

84
00:04:12.654 --> 00:04:15.659
You might be able to use your data analytics tools directly against the

85
00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:18.644
real-time live system if it does not affect performance.

86
00:04:18.644 --> 00:04:20.614
But many times you may have to grab,

87
00:04:20.614 --> 00:04:24.954
export or migrate the data into a repository using an ETL,

88
00:04:24.954 --> 00:04:27.614
or extract, transform, and load tool.

89
00:04:27.614 --> 00:04:30.684
Use visual, if possible, tools to perform your analyses.

90
00:04:30.684 --> 00:04:33.639
In this case, you might have needed an ETL tool,

91
00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:37.664
maybe SQL Server, and let's say Power BI or Looker as your visual tool.

92
00:04:37.664 --> 00:04:40.604
Refine, tweak, and readjust.

93
00:04:40.604 --> 00:04:42.154
Since you will find that your results may seem

94
00:04:42.154 --> 00:04:43.684
suspicious at times in the beginning,

95
00:04:43.684 --> 00:04:47.639
and many times you will find data errors in the source systems,

96
00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:51.440
so you may need to adjust your data mining procedures to collect better data,

97
00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.644
or in the way in which you use your data analytical tools as well.

98
00:04:55.644 --> 00:05:00.644
Now, it is an iterative and incremental process for sure between your sponsor,

99
00:05:00.644 --> 00:05:03.614
the data, and even your data sources may change.

100
00:05:03.614 --> 00:05:06.644
How you access it may change, how you aggregate may change.

101
00:05:06.644 --> 00:05:08.674
These are just to name a few ways things may change.

102
00:05:08.674 --> 00:05:11.614
And the tools, not all tools may work for you,

103
00:05:11.614 --> 00:05:14.604
but please choose sparingly so you're not spending more time

104
00:05:14.604 --> 00:05:18.644
learning the tool than actually using the tools.

105
00:05:18.644 --> 00:05:21.362
Here are some examples of the many business data

106
00:05:21.362 --> 00:05:23.604
analytics tools in the market today,

107
00:05:23.604 --> 00:05:25.614
and you can even recognize Excel's in the list.

108
00:05:25.614 --> 00:05:28.378
Why not start with that if that's something you already have and it's low

109
00:05:28.378 --> 00:05:31.614
cost and it's a pretty good data aggregator as well?

110
00:05:31.614 --> 00:05:34.604
But many of the other tools are what I would consider very high end.

111
00:05:34.604 --> 00:05:39.684
This is just a representative list to get you started in the right direction.

112
00:05:39.684 --> 00:05:43.694
Here's an example of one of those tools, Power BI's Dashboard.

113
00:05:43.694 --> 00:05:45.684
Please don't try to read this slide.

114
00:05:45.684 --> 00:05:54.000
The value of this slide is to point out how visual these tools can be. I will always emphasize visual tools.
