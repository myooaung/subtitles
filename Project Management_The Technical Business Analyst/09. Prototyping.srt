1
00:00:00,259 --> 00:00:03,088
Now let's say you have a pretty good idea of the

2
00:00:03,088 --> 00:00:06,929
requirements with documented use cases, or a product backlog,

3
00:00:06,929 --> 00:00:09,035
or more traditional requirements documents,

4
00:00:09,035 --> 00:00:12,209
you might consider prototyping your system.

5
00:00:12,209 --> 00:00:15,249
Prototyping is one of the most important skills of this module.

6
00:00:15,249 --> 00:00:18,239
Let's see why.

7
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:20,239
Let's define prototyping.

8
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:27,239
Another term for prototyping you've likely heard of is proof of concept, or PoC.

9
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:31,898
The method or technique known as prototyping is primarily used to

10
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:35,259
elicit and validate stakeholder or users' requirements.

11
00:00:35,259 --> 00:00:38,199
The prototyping process is iterative,

12
00:00:38,199 --> 00:00:43,103
which means a repeated cycle of refined prototypes coming closer to the

13
00:00:43,103 --> 00:00:46,269
desired result as the number of cycles increases.

14
00:00:46,269 --> 00:00:50,811
Prototyping produces an early model of the potential ultimate

15
00:00:50,811 --> 00:00:53,269
solution based on the known requirements.

16
00:00:53,269 --> 00:00:58,239
Also, prototyping identifies missing or poorly specified requirements.

17
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,269
The interaction with the customer and the process of refinement

18
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:04,259
always brings to light overlooked requirements,

19
00:01:04,259 --> 00:01:07,259
or further refinement of your requirements.

20
00:01:07,259 --> 00:01:10,363
Prototyping demonstrates what the product may visually look

21
00:01:10,363 --> 00:01:13,232
like and how it interacts with other actors,

22
00:01:13,232 --> 00:01:15,259
be it people or other systems.

23
00:01:15,259 --> 00:01:17,206
Now the user interface,

24
00:01:17,206 --> 00:01:21,256
user experience design elements we talked about earlier may be a

25
00:01:21,256 --> 00:01:23,269
major portion of the prototyping outcomes,

26
00:01:23,269 --> 00:01:31,189
but the process of prototyping is much broader and a more encompassing activity.

27
00:01:31,189 --> 00:01:34,209
Let's see why you might want to use the prototyping method.

28
00:01:34,209 --> 00:01:37,043
It allows you to experiment and try things before making

29
00:01:37,043 --> 00:01:40,199
any major investment in time and money.

30
00:01:40,199 --> 00:01:42,779
It provides a visual and/or structural

31
00:01:42,779 --> 00:01:45,219
representation of a product's future state.

32
00:01:45,219 --> 00:01:49,007
Prototyping allows for stakeholders or users to provide input

33
00:01:49,007 --> 00:01:52,219
and feedback early in the design process.

34
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:56,204
Prototyping also builds a strong relationship and trust between

35
00:01:56,204 --> 00:01:59,239
the technical BA and the product owner or users.

36
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:02,787
This is very important and it helps you better bridge the gap

37
00:02:02,787 --> 00:02:05,249
between the requirements and the IT team.

38
00:02:05,249 --> 00:02:09,756
Prototyping also encourages constructive feedback since the

39
00:02:09,756 --> 00:02:12,714
users can feel more comfortable critiquing the throwaway

40
00:02:12,714 --> 00:02:15,219
design rather than the final product.

41
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:18,269
Prototyping also applies to non-visual elements.

42
00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:18,929
For example,

43
00:02:18,929 --> 00:02:23,234
you want to experiment and try out accessing a transactional

44
00:02:23,234 --> 00:02:26,209
banking API to see if it can address your needs.

45
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:32,179
There's no UI in this case, and therefore it is a non-visual prototype.

46
00:02:32,179 --> 00:02:34,209
When to use prototyping tools.

47
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:36,259
Any requirement that is complex,

48
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:39,749
whether it is with or without a user interface element,

49
00:02:39,749 --> 00:02:41,259
would be highly recommended.

50
00:02:41,259 --> 00:02:45,490
Any design that you need more information or analysis to

51
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,239
further understand the requirements.

52
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:47,731
Remember,

53
00:02:47,731 --> 00:02:53,189
prototyping gives you great feedback that you can use to refine your approach.

54
00:02:53,189 --> 00:02:56,372
Prototyping should be used in conjunction with business use cases

55
00:02:56,372 --> 00:03:00,891
or user stories to be the most successful so the requirements are

56
00:03:00,891 --> 00:03:04,199
closely driving the prototype outcomes.

57
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:07,179
Prototyping helps sustain end-user involvement.

58
00:03:07,179 --> 00:03:07,697
That is,

59
00:03:07,697 --> 00:03:11,256
prototyping ensures that the end users are constantly involved and

60
00:03:11,256 --> 00:03:14,269
providing feedback which is incorporated in the prototype,

61
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:18,249
which will result in a more usable and acceptable system.

62
00:03:18,249 --> 00:03:22,239
The users will feel more connected and this process builds trust,

63
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,249
and trust is very important.

64
00:03:24,249 --> 00:03:27,219
Lastly, prove it can be done.

65
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:30,516
That is, can you prove that what you envision can be achieved,

66
00:03:30,516 --> 00:03:34,229
or at least have a good possibility it can be achieved,

67
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:37,209
technically speaking?

68
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:39,589
Your prototyping tools of the trade are,

69
00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:43,259
in fact, most of the very things we talked about in this module.

70
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:46,236
All of the following tools and methods are commonly

71
00:03:46,236 --> 00:03:51,179
used in developing prototypes, by themselves or mix and match.

72
00:03:51,179 --> 00:03:53,209
User interface and user experience.

73
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:54,229
Data modeling.

74
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:56,189
Business data analytics.

75
00:03:56,189 --> 00:03:57,239
Interface analysis.

76
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:59,189
Off-the-shelf solutions.

77
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:03,622
The technical BA role is a very exciting place to be as you design

78
00:04:03,622 --> 00:04:09,000
and prototype the future systems of your company, so get good at it.
