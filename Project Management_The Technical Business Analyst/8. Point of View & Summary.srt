1
00:00:00,747 --> 00:00:02,115
Here's my point of view.

2
00:00:02,115 --> 00:00:05,757
Always ensure what you are doing is aligned with the business objectives

3
00:00:05,757 --> 00:00:09,727
and the agile development team's skills and capabilities.

4
00:00:09,727 --> 00:00:11,807
Agile/Scrum is a software development methodology,

5
00:00:11,807 --> 00:00:14,817
not a project management process or approach.

6
00:00:14,817 --> 00:00:18,200
The developers and technical team will be focused on the software,

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:18,817
as they should be,

8
00:00:18,817 --> 00:00:22,955
and you could provide the organization's big picture in what the

9
00:00:22,955 --> 00:00:26,737
enterprise management is thinking from a business perspective.

10
00:00:26,737 --> 00:00:30,767
The technical BA as a member of the agile/Scrum team is essential,

11
00:00:30,767 --> 00:00:33,710
and by reinforcing the product owner's vision to the team,

12
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:35,817
this will greatly help bridge the gap.

13
00:00:35,817 --> 00:00:39,063
Since the technical BAs or just business analysts are

14
00:00:39,063 --> 00:00:40,543
typically in the IT department,

15
00:00:40,543 --> 00:00:45,762
it is up to the IT leadership to be proactive and approach the product owner,

16
00:00:45,762 --> 00:00:47,737
or his or her management,

17
00:00:47,737 --> 00:00:51,351
and discuss how best to provide support to the product owner,

18
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:53,727
either as a partner or proxy.

19
00:00:53,727 --> 00:00:55,777
And as I mentioned, both are very good options,

20
00:00:55,777 --> 00:00:57,817
but I think the partnership works the best.

21
00:00:57,817 --> 00:01:02,797
The technical BA with the right skills, you could do all three of these roles.

22
00:01:02,797 --> 00:01:06,787
The technical BA, the Scrum Master, and the project manager,

23
00:01:06,787 --> 00:01:10,777
what a fantastic combination of skills and career opportunities.

24
00:01:10,777 --> 00:01:13,787
Remember, life is not perfect in the agile/Scrum world.

25
00:01:13,787 --> 00:01:20,757
Set your expectations accordingly, and adapt and be flexible.

26
00:01:20,757 --> 00:01:21,807
Let's summarize this module.

27
00:01:21,807 --> 00:01:27,240
We discussed the agile foundation, which includes four process groups: projects,

28
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,807
releases, iterations, and daily work.

29
00:01:29,807 --> 00:01:34,787
And the typical participants: product owner, the dev team, and the Scrum Master.

30
00:01:34,787 --> 00:01:36,767
Then we drilled into the dev team,

31
00:01:36,767 --> 00:01:38,777
which could be made up of developers of course,

32
00:01:38,777 --> 00:01:41,787
but also other professionals such as QA engineers,

33
00:01:41,787 --> 00:01:44,757
database engineers, and many, many others.

34
00:01:44,757 --> 00:01:47,797
Be an advocate for the agile technical BA role.

35
00:01:47,797 --> 00:01:51,747
In my observations of agile teams, the technical BA,

36
00:01:51,747 --> 00:01:54,787
or any BA for that matter, is missing from the dev team.

37
00:01:54,787 --> 00:01:57,880
Since business people are great at business and technical

38
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,018
people are great at technical activities,

39
00:02:00,018 --> 00:02:03,787
it allows an opportunity for the technical BA to bridge that gap.

40
00:02:03,787 --> 00:02:08,767
I strongly recommend technical BAs participating on the agile dev teams.

41
00:02:08,767 --> 00:02:10,817
Use INVEST and SMART techniques.

42
00:02:10,817 --> 00:02:15,797
They help keep stories and tasks well-structured and easy to understand.

43
00:02:15,797 --> 00:02:18,787
We discussed the relationship options the technical BA

44
00:02:18,787 --> 00:02:20,757
can have with the product owner,

45
00:02:20,757 --> 00:02:24,486
either as a proxy that is taking the place of the true product

46
00:02:24,486 --> 00:02:26,517
owner and representing the product owner,

47
00:02:26,517 --> 00:02:30,777
or as a partner performing all of the behind the scenes heavy lifting.

48
00:02:30,777 --> 00:02:34,817
Yet, the product owner is still personally participating with the agile team.

49
00:02:34,817 --> 00:02:36,272
This is important,

50
00:02:36,272 --> 00:02:40,772
people will engender more trust to the product owner than a proxy technical BA,

51
00:02:40,772 --> 00:02:42,747
so keep that in mind.

52
00:02:42,747 --> 00:02:44,807
Regarding the technical BA and the agile dev team,

53
00:02:44,807 --> 00:02:48,919
we discussed that the technical BA can be on the team as a regular

54
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,807
member performing business analyst activities,

55
00:02:50,807 --> 00:02:53,817
or doing both analysis and Scrum Master activities,

56
00:02:53,817 --> 00:02:56,777
or analysis and project manager activities.

57
00:02:56,777 --> 00:03:00,762
Lastly, maybe the super technical BA could do all three.

58
00:03:00,762 --> 00:03:02,727
What a powerful combination.

59
00:03:02,727 --> 00:03:04,797
Do you have an organizational IQ?

60
00:03:04,797 --> 00:03:09,737
Be aware of organizational crosswinds that might affect the team's productivity.

61
00:03:09,737 --> 00:03:12,747
Be aware of the organizational issues, personalities,

62
00:03:12,747 --> 00:03:16,757
politics, and budgets since it is you, the technical BA,

63
00:03:16,757 --> 00:03:20,502
who is the most qualified to communicate and educate

64
00:03:20,502 --> 00:03:22,797
senior leaders on the project's progress.

65
00:03:22,797 --> 00:03:25,757
Avoid self-perceived limits.

66
00:03:25,757 --> 00:03:30,185
Your attitude and your ability to push through self-perceived

67
00:03:30,185 --> 00:03:33,747
limitations will play a key role in how successful you will be

68
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:35,787
as a technical BA in the agile world.

69
00:03:35,787 --> 00:03:37,767
No two agile teams are alike.

70
00:03:37,767 --> 00:03:38,425
In fact,

71
00:03:38,425 --> 00:03:41,645
they are typically quite different and unique based on the

72
00:03:41,645 --> 00:03:43,787
talents and resources available in the company.

73
00:03:43,787 --> 00:03:47,737
Remember, Agile means adaptability and flexibility.

74
00:03:47,737 --> 00:03:52,797
So don't be shy, lean in, and make a difference by being the super technical BA.

75
00:03:52,797 --> 00:03:54,262
In the next module,

76
00:03:54,262 --> 00:03:57,817
we'll not only summarize the entire course reviewing the key takeaways,

77
00:03:57,817 --> 00:04:02,066
but also list a few other Pluralsight-related courses you might like,

78
00:04:02,066 --> 00:04:08,000
discuss certifications that apply to the technical BA, and other training resources.
