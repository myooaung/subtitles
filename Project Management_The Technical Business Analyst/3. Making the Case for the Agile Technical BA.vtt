00:00:00.655 --> 00:00:03.635
Making the case for the agile technical BA.

2
00:00:03.635 --> 00:00:04.252
In fact,

3
00:00:04.252 --> 00:00:08.552
in my opinion I am a big believer in technical BAs as an

4
00:00:08.552 --> 00:00:11.725
integral part of the development agile team.

5
00:00:11.725 --> 00:00:15.517
Now I will illustrate how I see the level of effort of the

6
00:00:15.517 --> 00:00:18.725
technical BA map to the agile process groups.

7
00:00:18.725 --> 00:00:21.675
With the product owner, ideas, concepts,

8
00:00:21.675 --> 00:00:22.948
very chunky epics,

9
00:00:22.948 --> 00:00:26.695
and loosely defined features and requirements are usually in business terms.

10
00:00:26.695 --> 00:00:29.930
The technical BA is helping the product owner convey and

11
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:31.715
relate this information to the dev team.

12
00:00:31.715 --> 00:00:33.553
When designing the agile project,

13
00:00:33.553 --> 00:00:37.933
the technical BA will be able to describe the idea or concept with

14
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:40.715
some detail at the epic level and in business terms.

15
00:00:40.715 --> 00:00:42.584
When designing the agile releases,

16
00:00:42.584 --> 00:00:46.372
the technical BA will be able to describe and explain user

17
00:00:46.372 --> 00:00:49.645
stories with conciseness in business terms.

18
00:00:49.645 --> 00:00:51.705
When designing the agile iteration or sprint,

19
00:00:51.705 --> 00:00:55.682
they need to be able to describe and explain user stories with conciseness,

20
00:00:55.682 --> 00:00:57.675
again, in business terms.

21
00:00:57.675 --> 00:00:58.879
And with daily work,

22
00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.877
be able to answer detailed questions or issues that the

23
00:01:01.877 --> 00:01:03.665
development team may have of them.

24
00:01:03.665 --> 00:01:06.981
The brightness of the orange from left to right represents

25
00:01:06.981 --> 00:01:09.665
the level of effort of the technical BA,

26
00:01:09.665 --> 00:01:12.725
brighter on the left and less so as you move to the right.

27
00:01:12.725 --> 00:01:16.645
It is likely that the TBA, the technical business analyst,

28
00:01:16.645 --> 00:01:20.581
will spend more time in project and release planning on the left moving right,

29
00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:24.665
and likely less in iteration or sprint and daily work planning.

30
00:01:24.665 --> 00:01:28.715
On the left we have pure business, and on the right, pure technology.

31
00:01:28.715 --> 00:01:29.047
Hence,

32
00:01:29.047 --> 00:01:32.970
the technical BA is supporting and enhancing the translation of those

33
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.210
business requirements into technical requirements.

34
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.435
Since business people are great at business and technical

35
00:01:38.435 --> 00:01:40.930
people are great at highly technical activities,

36
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.685
it allows an opportunity for the technical BA to bridge the gap.

37
00:01:44.685 --> 00:01:49.005
A technical BA has the technical chops to better decompose the

38
00:01:49.005 --> 00:01:51.806
business requirements compared to epics and stories,

39
00:01:51.806 --> 00:01:56.685
and communicate with the dev team to produce better results.

40
00:01:56.685 --> 00:01:59.979
Let's see where the technical BA may fit into writing epics,

41
00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:01.705
user stories, and tasks.

42
00:02:01.705 --> 00:02:04.675
At the higher level we have epics and chunky features.

43
00:02:04.675 --> 00:02:07.655
Then we break these epics down into user stories.

44
00:02:07.655 --> 00:02:11.635
Both are written in business and user-oriented terms.

45
00:02:11.635 --> 00:02:13.825
Both of these are likely candidates where a technical

46
00:02:13.825 --> 00:02:15.675
BA could contribute very nicely.

47
00:02:15.675 --> 00:02:20.685
Developers now take the user story and break it down into technical tasks.

48
00:02:20.685 --> 00:02:23.836
The writing of these tasks is not in the domain of the technical BA,

49
00:02:23.836 --> 00:02:27.655
and are written by software engineers and not analysts.

50
00:02:27.655 --> 00:02:30.705
The technical tasks are written in the vernacular of developers,

51
00:02:30.705 --> 00:02:32.705
typically following the SMART techniques,

52
00:02:32.705 --> 00:02:34.705
which I'll also go over soon.

53
00:02:34.705 --> 00:02:36.940
The more technical the TBA is,

54
00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.521
the more they might possibly participate in these discussions and further

55
00:02:41.521 --> 00:02:44.675
bridge the gap between the business and the technical solutions.

56
00:02:44.675 --> 00:02:48.715
But I'm my opinion, the technical BA has other more important things to focus on,

57
00:02:48.715 --> 00:02:51.655
such as the epics and the user stories.

58
00:02:51.655 --> 00:02:58.000
Now let's take a look at how better to write user stories and better tasks with some ideas by Bill Wake.
