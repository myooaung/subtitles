00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,540
For completeness, let's talk about the technical BA's basic tools.

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,610
There is, of course, the all-famous Microsoft Office Suite.

3
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:13,590
MS Word can be used for preparing requirement specification documents.

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:18,067
You can create new templates using Microsoft Word or use existing

5
00:00:18,067 --> 00:00:20,630
templates for the documentation of software requirements.

6
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:24,021
Microsoft Excel or other spreadsheet tools are great,

7
00:00:24,021 --> 00:00:24,472
as well,

8
00:00:24,472 --> 00:00:26,600
and even use the macros if you need some additional

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,590
data manipulation and analysis.

10
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,580
Excel allows you to aggregate data from all kinds of data resources,

11
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,540
and create nifty charts and graphs as well.

12
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:36,570
Microsoft PowerPoint.

13
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,570
You must get good at preparing and delivering formal presentations.

14
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,540
As a technical business analyst,

15
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,950
you'll be faced with situations where you need to

16
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:48,147
communicate ideas to project stakeholders on the business

17
00:00:48,147 --> 00:00:50,620
side and also to the IT technical side.

18
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:53,610
Even Access is still around and used widely.

19
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:59,550
Also, there is the Google complement of Docs, Sheets, Slides, Gmail, and more.

20
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,540
And there are other platforms that provide the same functionality.

21
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,540
Now, you should also be pretty good at a few drawing and workflow tools as well.

22
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,590
That never hurts.

23
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,540
And lastly, if you are really bold and you want to get your hands dirty,

24
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,540
then maybe take a programming class or two.

25
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,600
Maybe .NET or Java or some scripting language.

26
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,070
But again, there are tons of programming languages out there,

27
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:21,180
so find out what your company mostly uses,

28
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,293
and then learn that one or two languages that would fit

29
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:26,580
in quite nicely into your toolkit.

30
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,570
Okay, this should be your basic toolkit or something like it,

31
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:34,610
no matter what kind of technical BA you are or where you work.

32
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:39,610
My magnificent seven are the core comprehensive TBA skills for sure,

33
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:43,540
but there are a lot of other tools that could come in very handy.

34
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,600
Here is a short list for your reference and further discovery.

35
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,540
Activity diagram, business process diagram,

36
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:55,085
business use cases, dataflow diagram, data dictionary,

37
00:01:55,085 --> 00:01:58,890
entity-relationship diagram, role map, state diagram,

38
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,600
and SWAT analyses.

39
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,080
There are many other tools like this in the same genre,

40
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:10,000
so check these out, pick the ones that might work for you, learn them, and apply them.
