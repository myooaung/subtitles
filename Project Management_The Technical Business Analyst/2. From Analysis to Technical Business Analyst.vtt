In this section,

2
00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:05.916
we will journey from the term analysis to the role

3
00:00:05.916 --> 00:00:08.921
of technical business analyst.

4
00:00:08.921 --> 00:00:10.921
Let's define analysis.

5
00:00:10.921 --> 00:00:14.944
Analysis is the process of breaking a complex topic or substance into

6
00:00:14.944 --> 00:00:18.951
smaller parts in order to gain a better understanding of it.

7
00:00:18.951 --> 00:00:21.951
Pretty straightforward, but complexities can vary.

8
00:00:21.951 --> 00:00:26.200
Doing the analysis on which widescreen TV will be wildly

9
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.891
different than the analysis to define a new jetliner.

10
00:00:30.891 --> 00:00:36.911
There are likely as many definitions of business analysis as there are analysts,

11
00:00:36.911 --> 00:00:41.384
but here is a basic definition: Business analysis is the practice

12
00:00:41.384 --> 00:00:44.795
of enabling change in an organizational context,

13
00:00:44.795 --> 00:00:45.921
a business,

14
00:00:45.921 --> 00:00:51.911
by defining needs and recommending solutions that deliver value to stakeholders.

15
00:00:51.911 --> 00:00:55.891
Here's another cut: Business analysis is the business process

16
00:00:55.891 --> 00:00:57.951
of assessing an organization's structure,

17
00:00:57.951 --> 00:00:59.278
processes, technology,

18
00:00:59.278 --> 00:01:05.951
and capabilities to identify and define solutions that meet a company's goals.

19
00:01:05.951 --> 00:01:07.951
Okay, I think you get the idea.

20
00:01:07.951 --> 00:01:12.921
Now let's check out the definition of a business analyst.

21
00:01:12.921 --> 00:01:17.911
Let's take a basic attempt at the definition of a business analyst.

22
00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:20.981
A business analyst is a liaison, or a link among stakeholders,

23
00:01:20.981 --> 00:01:24.961
in order to understand the structure, policies,

24
00:01:24.961 --> 00:01:29.370
and operations of an organization and to recommend solutions that

25
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.951
enable the organization to achieve its goals.

26
00:01:32.951 --> 00:01:39.000
Now this seems pretty good and lines up with our definition of a business analysis as well.
