Hello, and welcome.

2
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,540
I'm Michael Krasowski from Pluralsight.

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,590
I will be presenting the Introduction to the course,

4
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:09,570
The Technical Business Analyst.

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:14,530
Contrary to popular belief, technical business analysts are not boring.

6
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:15,200
In fact,

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,540
the technical business analyst is in a very unique organizational position

8
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,510
to have one of the most exciting jobs in the company.

9
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:26,510
You are situated at the juncture of business and technology.

10
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:28,560
I love business and technology very much.

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,540
Early in my career, I was all about technology,

12
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:35,809
but realized that the application of technology in fulfilling a

13
00:00:35,809 --> 00:00:39,124
business need and contributing to accomplishing those business

14
00:00:39,124 --> 00:00:41,540
requirements is what really turns me on professionally.

15
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:47,000
I hope you can join in the fun. Let's see what's in store for you in this course.
