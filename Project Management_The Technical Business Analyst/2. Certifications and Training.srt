00:00:00,855 --> 00:00:05,875
Now, here are a few ideas regarding certification and training.

2
00:00:05,875 --> 00:00:08,925
IIBA, the International Institute of Business Analysis,

3
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:12,365
has a few certifications that might interest you: Entry

4
00:00:12,365 --> 00:00:14,365
Certificate in Business Analysis,

5
00:00:14,365 --> 00:00:18,276
ECBA; Certification of Competency in Business Analysis,

6
00:00:18,276 --> 00:00:21,253
CCBA; Certified Business Analyst Professional,

7
00:00:21,253 --> 00:00:24,865
CBAP; and Agile Analysis Certification, AAC.

8
00:00:24,865 --> 00:00:25,279
Also,

9
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:31,014
IQBBA has a Certified Foundation Level Analyst Certification; IREB has

10
00:00:31,014 --> 00:00:35,374
Certified Professional for Requirements Engineering; and the PMI,

11
00:00:35,374 --> 00:00:37,855
Professional in Business Analysis, PBA.

12
00:00:37,855 --> 00:00:38,193
Now,

13
00:00:38,193 --> 00:00:41,788
all of these are more generic analyst certifications and are

14
00:00:41,788 --> 00:00:44,915
not just targeted for the technical BA.

15
00:00:44,915 --> 00:00:48,935
Unlike certifications, which are designed to prove the skills you already have,

16
00:00:48,935 --> 00:00:53,885
bootcamps are designed to teach you new skills or improve your current skillset.

17
00:00:53,885 --> 00:00:57,118
Bootcamps can be anything from traditional workshops held over

18
00:00:57,118 --> 00:00:58,932
the course of a few days or full-fledged,

19
00:00:58,932 --> 00:01:08,000
instructor-led courses that run much longer. Here are a few bootcamps for business analysts for your future reference.
