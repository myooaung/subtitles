1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,060
Here is my point of view.

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:05,010
Now those technologies on the previous slide are hot now,

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:09,050
and may remain so for a while, but this list will continually evolve,

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,080
so I recommend staying abreast of the latest technology trends.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,030
With the internet you can learn a lot about what's hot

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,050
and what's not very hot very quickly.

7
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,100
Learn new technology capabilities.

8
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:23,280
You can take a few Pluralsight courses and get a deeper understanding of

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,010
those technologies and how they may help the business.

10
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,050
Involve and seek support from IT.

11
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,825
So run your technology ideas past your IT team to see what

12
00:00:31,825 --> 00:00:34,090
they think of it and how it might work.

13
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,726
With those ideas and technologies and opportunities,

14
00:00:36,726 --> 00:00:41,010
be proactive and present to the business with business cases

15
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,684
and how your technical recommendations are in alignment with

16
00:00:43,684 --> 00:00:46,020
the organization's business goals.

17
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,040
Don't ever forget that.

18
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,161
Just because a new technology is trending,

19
00:00:49,161 --> 00:00:51,276
it doesn't mean to go out and deploy it,

20
00:00:51,276 --> 00:00:55,070
but it may mean to read about it, understand the business implications,

21
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:58,369
maybe develop a proof of concept with your IT colleagues,

22
00:00:58,369 --> 00:01:05,030
and then present your ideas and recommendations to management.

23
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,010
Okay, let's summarize this module.

24
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:10,353
We learned that the role of a technical BA is to serve as or

25
00:01:10,353 --> 00:01:13,100
create a connection between the business and IT.

26
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:13,424
Therefore,

27
00:01:13,424 --> 00:01:17,387
the key job of the technical BA is to ensure the technology

28
00:01:17,387 --> 00:01:20,060
successfully meets the business needs.

29
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:25,196
We discussed that all business activities can fall into one of three categories,

30
00:01:25,196 --> 00:01:28,876
operations, projects, and initiatives, and in each of these categories,

31
00:01:28,876 --> 00:01:30,030
the gap is different.

32
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,050
We learned that the level of effort to bridge the gap is smaller in operations,

33
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:38,010
about medium with projects, and quite large with initiatives.

34
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,043
We also learned that the business and technical

35
00:01:40,043 --> 00:01:42,697
knowledge required is smaller in operations,

36
00:01:42,697 --> 00:01:46,080
about medium with projects, and quite large again with initiatives.

37
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,040
We discussed the required skills to bridge the gap,

38
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,090
which are leadership and communication, which is critical to your success,

39
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,974
ensuring that you are always aligning the IT outcomes to the business,

40
00:01:56,974 --> 00:02:01,050
and that you have a good grasp on the tool areas we discussed

41
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:04,060
that comprise the technical BA's skillset.

42
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:09,010
Lastly, the technical BA's priority, business or IT.

43
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:13,020
I generally lean towards the technical BA's priority is the business,

44
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,420
yet be proactive and recommend new and exciting technologies that

45
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:19,080
can potentially change and reshape your company.

46
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,382
In the next module,

47
00:02:20,382 --> 00:02:23,618
we will dive into some of these analysis tools you will need to

48
00:02:23,618 --> 00:02:28,000
help you become the best technical BA you can be. See you there.
