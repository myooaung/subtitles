1
00:00:00,777 --> 00:00:03,777
You may not be able to ever completely close the gap.

2
00:00:03,777 --> 00:00:06,767
That's a natural circumstance of any organization.

3
00:00:06,767 --> 00:00:10,974
But you can certainly narrow the gap.

4
00:00:10,974 --> 00:00:12,777
Let's see how.

5
00:00:12,777 --> 00:00:16,130
I strongly recommend that you need three key skill areas and

6
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:19,380
expertise to becoming the most successful at bridging the gap

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,837
as a technical business analyst.

8
00:00:20,837 --> 00:00:24,757
The first, leadership and communication skills.

9
00:00:24,757 --> 00:00:27,767
Next, business knowledge and alignment.

10
00:00:27,767 --> 00:00:30,797
And lastly, the technical business analyst skillset.

11
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:33,847
Now let's touch on each one of those.

12
00:00:33,847 --> 00:00:37,772
Remember we defined bridging the gap as creating a connection

13
00:00:37,772 --> 00:00:40,757
between two disconnected or disparate things.

14
00:00:40,757 --> 00:00:41,837
How do you think you create that connection?

15
00:00:41,837 --> 00:00:44,767
Well, not just with 1s and 0s.

16
00:00:44,767 --> 00:00:46,107
Before I go over this list,

17
00:00:46,107 --> 00:00:49,912
I want you to think about each item and rate yourself on each item,

18
00:00:49,912 --> 00:00:53,307
say 1, for not that much, 2 medium, and three for,

19
00:00:53,307 --> 00:00:53,837
well, pretty good.

20
00:00:53,837 --> 00:00:55,797
For those items you rate low,

21
00:00:55,797 --> 00:00:58,847
that only means that that's an area to think about and improve on.

22
00:00:58,847 --> 00:01:02,787
Okay, for the first one, embrace and champion change.

23
00:01:02,787 --> 00:01:05,787
Leaders drive change and are change agents.

24
00:01:05,787 --> 00:01:06,807
Do you like change?

25
00:01:06,807 --> 00:01:09,817
Change is typically not a natural attribute of most people.

26
00:01:09,817 --> 00:01:12,767
Earn credibility across an organization.

27
00:01:12,767 --> 00:01:15,954
In order for you to be successful, work hard to earn credibility.

28
00:01:15,954 --> 00:01:18,494
That is, you are honest, have integrity,

29
00:01:18,494 --> 00:01:21,817
and always follow through with what you say and do.

30
00:01:21,817 --> 00:01:25,307
This will enable you to be more productive in your organization and

31
00:01:25,307 --> 00:01:28,080
enable broader career opportunities within your company.

32
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,777
Ability to build trust.

33
00:01:29,777 --> 00:01:32,777
This is a critical leadership quality that you must master.

34
00:01:32,777 --> 00:01:34,777
Strong negotiation skills.

35
00:01:34,777 --> 00:01:38,817
Most business interactions entail discussions in arriving at consensus.

36
00:01:38,817 --> 00:01:39,040
Therefore,

37
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,513
you must have the ability to communicate clearly and effectively to others

38
00:01:42,513 --> 00:01:46,787
during the discussions and negotiations as a technical BA.

39
00:01:46,787 --> 00:01:48,757
Strategic planning skills.

40
00:01:48,757 --> 00:01:51,282
This is important as people want to know where are we

41
00:01:51,282 --> 00:01:52,827
going and how are we going to get there?

42
00:01:52,827 --> 00:01:55,757
Project and team management skills.

43
00:01:55,757 --> 00:01:57,817
Yes, leadership is paramount and essential,

44
00:01:57,817 --> 00:02:01,905
but you will still need basic and practical project and team management

45
00:02:01,905 --> 00:02:04,807
skills in performing your duties as a technical BA.

46
00:02:04,807 --> 00:02:07,777
Strong communications and marketing skills.

47
00:02:07,777 --> 00:02:09,847
Certainly verbal and written skills are essential,

48
00:02:09,847 --> 00:02:13,609
but what I mean by marketing is that you will need to ensure that the

49
00:02:13,609 --> 00:02:17,817
business and IT know what you are doing clearly and succinctly,

50
00:02:17,817 --> 00:02:21,047
and this typically means getting out PowerPoint and putting together

51
00:02:21,047 --> 00:02:23,837
regular presentations to communicate effectively.

52
00:02:23,837 --> 00:02:27,093
This will result in you receiving better projects to work on,

53
00:02:27,093 --> 00:02:30,767
maybe even more resources, and better career opportunities.

54
00:02:30,767 --> 00:02:32,282
Strong interpersonal skills.

55
00:02:32,282 --> 00:02:35,876
You want coworkers to feel that they can approach you,

56
00:02:35,876 --> 00:02:38,807
talk to you, and share important information.

57
00:02:38,807 --> 00:02:42,439
The use of these skills with your business and technical IT teams will

58
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:45,817
greatly enhance your ability to bridge the gap by helping you elicit

59
00:02:45,817 --> 00:02:49,675
and capture business requirements and then bring forward and

60
00:02:49,675 --> 00:02:53,817
communicate those requirements to IT.

61
00:02:53,817 --> 00:02:56,767
Required business knowledge and alignment.

62
00:02:56,767 --> 00:02:58,837
Aligning the IT outcomes to the business.

63
00:02:58,837 --> 00:03:01,837
It's the activities of formulating, integrating,

64
00:03:01,837 --> 00:03:05,797
and implementing decisions between the business and IT.

65
00:03:05,797 --> 00:03:09,133
You will need to rely on your soft skills heavily such as speaking,

66
00:03:09,133 --> 00:03:12,847
writing, presenting, and leadership that we talked about in the previous slide.

67
00:03:12,847 --> 00:03:15,767
Working on the right priorities.

68
00:03:15,767 --> 00:03:18,318
You want to ensure that IT is staying the course,

69
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:22,240
working on the right work at the right time and not chasing the shiniest,

70
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,817
new object.

71
00:03:22,817 --> 00:03:25,797
Using IT to achieve business objectives.

72
00:03:25,797 --> 00:03:29,633
It is when a business organization is able to use information

73
00:03:29,633 --> 00:03:32,817
technology effectively to achieve its business objectives.

74
00:03:32,817 --> 00:03:35,013
That is your job.

75
00:03:35,013 --> 00:03:39,777
Resulting in improved business outcomes such as improved financial performance,

76
00:03:39,777 --> 00:03:43,757
better products and services or marketplace competitiveness.

77
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:47,312
The bottom line is the ability of IT to produce business value.

78
00:03:47,312 --> 00:03:48,837
Do not forget that.

79
00:03:48,837 --> 00:03:52,536
Your value to the organization will be measured by

80
00:03:52,536 --> 00:03:56,787
your capabilities to do just that.

81
00:03:56,787 --> 00:03:58,817
The technical business analyst skillset.

82
00:03:58,817 --> 00:04:01,837
Remember all those technical skills we discussed in the last module?

83
00:04:01,837 --> 00:04:05,757
Well collectively, their use will help you bridge the gap.

84
00:04:05,757 --> 00:04:08,426
They are user interface and user experience,

85
00:04:08,426 --> 00:04:11,657
prototyping, data modeling, business data analytics,

86
00:04:11,657 --> 00:04:14,827
interface analysis, quality assurance test plan and test cases,

87
00:04:14,827 --> 00:04:16,837
off-the-shelf solutions, cloud services,

88
00:04:16,837 --> 00:04:18,797
and other building blocks.

89
00:04:18,797 --> 00:04:21,797
Again, I won't go into all the detail because we already did that before,

90
00:04:21,797 --> 00:04:24,212
as well as, in the modules, Tools of the Trade,

91
00:04:24,212 --> 00:04:28,807
I will drill into each one of these in detail.

92
00:04:28,807 --> 00:04:31,837
Here is what I found to be a secret weapon to my success.

93
00:04:31,837 --> 00:04:36,837
By becoming a trusted advisor, you will be more successful at bridging the gap.

94
00:04:36,837 --> 00:04:40,373
Here are a few guidelines to think about so you can plan and implement

95
00:04:40,373 --> 00:04:43,817
building trust with your business and IT colleagues.

96
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:47,822
As you begin each engagement or encounter with your customers and IT,

97
00:04:47,822 --> 00:04:49,827
have clear and consistent goals.

98
00:04:49,827 --> 00:04:52,777
Always know where you are going, the big vision,

99
00:04:52,777 --> 00:04:54,797
the projects, and the daily tasks.

100
00:04:54,797 --> 00:04:58,302
This will help your coworkers have a better understanding of what you are

101
00:04:58,302 --> 00:05:02,683
proposing or aiming for and what the end game may look like and how the teams

102
00:05:02,683 --> 00:05:06,797
will know when they arrive at a conclusion or a solution.

103
00:05:06,797 --> 00:05:08,417
Be open and listen.

104
00:05:08,417 --> 00:05:10,847
This builds trust and shows compassion.

105
00:05:10,847 --> 00:05:15,547
Your business and IT coworkers will come to believe that they are

106
00:05:15,547 --> 00:05:17,797
understood and feel they are being listened to.

107
00:05:17,797 --> 00:05:19,847
Not only is this respectful in all encounters,

108
00:05:19,847 --> 00:05:24,767
you will actually get more honest input to do your job better.

109
00:05:24,767 --> 00:05:25,358
Be decisive.

110
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:27,716
Wishy-washy is a weak quality in your position.

111
00:05:27,716 --> 00:05:31,807
Would you want to see the CEO of your company in a various situation say,

112
00:05:31,807 --> 00:05:33,837
gee, I don't know what we should do?

113
00:05:33,837 --> 00:05:36,797
This does not mean that you will have all the answers,

114
00:05:36,797 --> 00:05:38,817
but it does mean if you don't know something,

115
00:05:38,817 --> 00:05:40,837
you will take action to find out.

116
00:05:40,837 --> 00:05:45,777
The world and you are not perfect, so admit mistakes.

117
00:05:45,777 --> 00:05:48,327
This shows that you are human, and even if it's not you,

118
00:05:48,327 --> 00:05:48,827
per se,

119
00:05:48,827 --> 00:05:52,787
who made the mistake take one on the chin and show that you're responsible.

120
00:05:52,787 --> 00:05:54,787
This will also build trust.

121
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:57,807
Respect the opinions of others, always listen.

122
00:05:57,807 --> 00:06:00,787
Now, it does not mean you have to agree,

123
00:06:00,787 --> 00:06:02,160
but you do have to listen,

124
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,330
then be decisive and make appropriate recommendations or

125
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,797
decisions and explain your reasons.

126
00:06:07,797 --> 00:06:08,557
Manage expectations.

127
00:06:08,557 --> 00:06:10,837
This is a biggie to me.

128
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:14,374
You will likely spend more time managing the business

129
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,777
side than the IT side of the house.

130
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:20,206
Every single customer interaction is an opportunity to

131
00:06:20,206 --> 00:06:22,777
manage expectations such as meetings, emails,

132
00:06:22,777 --> 00:06:24,906
phone calls, status reports, presentations,

133
00:06:24,906 --> 00:06:25,757
and more.

134
00:06:25,757 --> 00:06:29,139
Never pass up this opportunity to further connect and

135
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,847
communicate with your business customers.

136
00:06:30,847 --> 00:06:39,000
Now, you can't just be robotic and stiff to go through this checklist. You need to be sincere and it should come naturally.
