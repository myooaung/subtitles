00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.630
Welcome to Module five,

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:09.080
The exercise in this module.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.450
We will be going over the importance of exercise and play time.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:19.480
Best practices for playing with your cat and then a couple of do it yourself.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.950
Playtime is all right,

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.150
so the importance of play time for your cat.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.490
So if you knew someone who had a dog and never walked that dog,

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:32.220
you would think,

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.960
ma'am,

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.310
what is that person doing?

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.160
And they need to exercise their dog.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.410
So it's kind of the same thing for a cat.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.510
You need to play with your cat to get some exercise.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.580
If your cat doesn't get stimulation that they need and exercise they need.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.010
This can contribute to weight gain,

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.760
boredom,

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.370
destructive behavior,

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.730
misdirected aggression.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.210
So that begs the next question.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.940
Which is,

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.170
How do you exercise your cat playtime?

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:09.680
This is a serious question because a lot of people you might not know how to play with

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.230
their cat,

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.470
they might think,

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:11.900
Oh,

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.750
like I tried in The cat just doesn't like anything that I try.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.630
But maybe that might be because the cat is not interested in how you're playing with them.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:28.050
So there's sequence that cats go through when they're hunting or playing as we call it,

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.680
It's hunt,

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.600
catch,

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.730
kill and eat.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.050
I'm going to go through an example of the hunt.

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.040
Catch killed,

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.100
eat sequence with a want white now hunt.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.800
So move.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.750
Move the one toy around to get your cat interested.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.900
Don't just bounce it in front of their face.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.210
That might work for a kitten,

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.100
but it probably won't work for your cat.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.610
Adult cats like to stock their prey first,

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.850
so if you move the one toy around but out of the reach,

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.650
making the toy behave is something they would normally chase in the wild.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.640
Second step is catch.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.770
If the cat looks interested but is unwilling to get up and move around and get the toy,

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.980
you can try moving the toy behind a barrier,

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:17.800
for instance,

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.460
a box or something for around a corner.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.670
Um,

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.450
some cats also like something under something else.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.560
If you have a towel that you don't care about or some tissue paper,

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.360
you can put the toy under that,

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.630
Um,

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.730
that way the cat can't see it any more.

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.600
And if they were watching and interested,

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:43.440
they'll get up and come over to investigate they will eventually pounds to catch their prey

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.330
or the want toy.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.230
In this case,

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.860
Step three is the kill sequence for them.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.960
So after they catch their prey of the cat,

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.010
will then try to kill the prey.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.410
Right.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:55.390
Um,

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.650
this may book like vigorously attacking the toy.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.920
Now I am to let you know that they have conquered or zooming around victoriously.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.510
Or maybe all three,

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:06.350
if you're lucky.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.110
So the last step is eat in the wild.

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.830
Your cat would typically then eat their prey.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.950
Whoever Since this is a want toy,

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.910
we don't actually want them to eat it.

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.830
Although some cats do try and eat,

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.090
want toys or other toys that we have,

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.830
you might want to take some of the food that you would be giving them for their meal and

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.550
give it to them after a place session.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:35.030
This will better simulated and actual hunt in the wild and will also reward them for

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.260
playing appropriate thing.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.850
Some follow up on how to play with your cat.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.600
If your cat is overweight,

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.450
the goal here is just to get them moving around as much as possible.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.630
Um,

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:47.280
however,

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.230
don't be too discouraged if this does not work out that well initially,

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.630
as of these cats have a really hard time.

00:03:53.630 --> 00:04:00.220
Getting around can be difficult for them to be as active as a healthy weight cat because

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.710
it's hard for them to move around.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.460
Also,

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.840
if your cat has been morbidly obese for years,

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.060
ticket slow and treat any movement as a victory.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.500
In fact,

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.150
for some cats,

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:19.470
the workout can actually be all in just tracking the toy with their eyes as long as they're

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.950
being older while they're watching the toy.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.430
This may count as exercise for an Avi's cat.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.050
Also,

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.980
each cat will be a little bit different in their plate preferences.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.860
So where one cat would prefer to stock their prey from undercover,

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:35.530
say,

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:36.400
under a chair,

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.010
something another cat may prefer pouncing.

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.050
As soon as their prey pops out from hiding.

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.310
Make sure to try a few different ways to play with your cat until you find what works for

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.760
them.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.860
Some cats will also be willing to play as soon as you get out of toy,

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.750
where others may take a while to warm up
