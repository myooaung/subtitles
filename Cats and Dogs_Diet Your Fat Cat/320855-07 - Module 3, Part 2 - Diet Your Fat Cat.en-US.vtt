00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
a few other questions to go over.

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.470
Can you still feed your cat treats?

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.220
Short answer is yes,

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.020
definitely.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.350
You can totally still feed your cat treats.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:12.790
However,

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.060
you will want to keep in mind the calorie count.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.310
So if you started the diet already,

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:24.450
you might want to set aside a certain amount of treats that you've already measured out and

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.560
know how many calories are in that portion.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.230
That way,

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.670
you'll know exactly how much you're feeding your cat in calories.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.880
Also mentioned,

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.170
one of my favorite types of treats for my cat is freeze dried treats.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.530
Usually it's freeze dried salmon or chicken or turkey.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.470
Something like that.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.790
This is something that is actually very healthy for them,

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.750
cause it's really just one ingredient and freeze dried.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.040
This is also something that's much closer to what they would typically be eating in the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.700
wild.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.540
So hopefully your cat will love.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.870
Um,

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.650
another question you might have is,

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.250
Do you need to feed your cat wet food?

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.750
Short answer.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:10.550
No,

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.840
however,

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.240
what food is much closer to what your cat will be eating in the wild,

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:24.060
paying attention Teoh the ingredients and and the nutritional breakdown you can find some

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.650
really awesome wet food options out there.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:34.230
A favorite of mine is nature's variety instinct as you confined some of their products that

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.950
have 95% animal products in it.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.400
You may also be wondering how you could possibly split up the cans so that your cat will be

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.850
getting the correct calories per day.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.990
You can use tap to in the cat weight loss hoper spreadsheet download below.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.910
That will help you determine how best to break up the can so that your cat will be getting

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.950
the correct amount of calories per day.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.140
Also mentioned.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.610
If you do end up splitting up,

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.090
can you might be wondering,

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.910
How am I gonna save the rest of the camp for later?

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.370
I've found some really great products that are just these little kitty cap lids that you

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.240
can put on top of them.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:22.350
They have different sizes inside of it that are perfect for cat scans.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.060
Another question you might have is.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.940
Can you feed your cat people food?

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:27.950
No,

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.490
I would just say,

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:30.250
uh,

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.250
don't do it,

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.870
especially if you are trying to get your cat on a diet.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.950
How do you know how many calories you're feeding him if you're feeding in people food,

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.900
typically the calorie count for people.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.550
Food doesn't equate down Teoh what a cat would need.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.490
However,

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.080
if your cat does accidentally get some people food,

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.700
just try and guess at how many calories that is to factor into his diet.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.960
Another question you might have is Can I still feed my cat?

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.670
And you might not like what you're about two years.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.350
Maybe just cover your ears because it's gonna be hard to free.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.950
Feed your cat if they don't know how to self regulate already.

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.180
That's probably why they're overweight.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.850
Right now.

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:23.450
You will need to switch to a scheduled feeding time with portioned amounts for your cat,

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.930
and you're probably thinking now,

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:26.130
Oh,

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.730
man,

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.290
my cat's gonna murder me.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.170
Stop thinking that we'll go over how to deal with this.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.850
Don't worry.

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.220
Also,

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.770
some people foods are poisonous to cats or just don't agree with their stomachs.

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.320
For example,

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:47.140
dark chocolate or milk or dairy products and just want to let you know the cat has now

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.950
moved.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:04:02.850
Moving on.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.690
How often should you feed your cat?

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:16.630
You want to shoot for feeding your cat small portions throughout the day around 4 to 6

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.440
times during the day to start out on the weight loss plan.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:26.950
Being fed multiple times a day helps with getting your cat to be a little bit more active

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:27.790
throughout the day,

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.950
and then we'll also help contribute to weight loss.

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.320
You can also try playing with your cat right before feeding him.

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.770
This will simulate what would actually happen in the wild,

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.110
where your cat would have to hunt for food.

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.370
So since your cat is domesticated,

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.210
hunting for them equates to playing,

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.940
even if you can Onley feed your cat twice day.

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.950
What's most important is that you pick a schedule and stick to it.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.150
Cats can get pretty picky about their schedules.

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.390
One note on changing food.

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.550
If you do decide to change the food,

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:07.680
uh,

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:13.150
cats get a little particular about how or what they'll be eating.

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.560
So if you're going to switch it out,

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.850
do it gradually.

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.170
For instance,

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:20.820
maybe for one week you would feed your cat.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:27.450
75% of old food mixed in with 25% of the new food the second week,

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:34.850
50% 50% and then the third week you would be down to 25% of the old food.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:40.890
75% of the new food until finally and before you can try 100% of the new food.

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:48.310
Please note some cats will actually pick out the kibbles that they like and may end up with

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.140
all of the,

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.050
uh,

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.450
new food left over.

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:56.000
So you're gonna have to work with you cat,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.430
see what they'll put up with or what they won't on that.

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.600
No,

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.030
you definitely want to make sure that your cat is still eating throughout the diet process

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.890
because if cats aren't eating,

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:10.780
they'll develop something called hepatic lipid deuces.

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:11.910
Uh,

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:16.430
that's a severe liver disease that cats can develop if they stop eating.

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:24.510
If your cat does stop eating than their body will send fat their liver to be converted into

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.450
defoe proteins for energy,

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:29.850
a cat's body is not very well suited to doing this.

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:33.300
If your cat's body does go into this mode,

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.390
he is at risk of developing hepatic lipid.

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.510
Oh,

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:37.040
sis,

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.750
A starvation diet is never a good idea for your cab.

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:41.690
Uh,

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:44.410
you will want to make sure that your tests eating,

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:47.450
even if you think a different food is better for him.

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:52.020
If you notice that your cat hasn't eaten in 24 hours,

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.750
take him to the vet immediately.

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:57.250
So last question.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:01.050
What if your cat actually get snacks from being outside?

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:06.140
So this course is mostly for indoor cats.

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:13.410
So hopefully the only time your cat is outdoors will be while you're supervising it on,

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:15.460
he does happen to find like,

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:17.300
a grasshopper or something.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.310
Do you try and take it away from him?

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:23.950
Because this is not usually factored into the diet.

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:25.380
However,

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:28.360
if he happens to eat something that is not on the meal plan,

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.590
which might happen,

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:34.160
just gets it how much that calorie count is and then,

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:34.580
ah,

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:35.570
factor that in.

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:36.730
All right,

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:39.550
let's get the homework's by it up here to show you.

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:45.300
Let's take a look at the food that you're presently feeding your cat in particular.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:49.470
Please take note of the calorie content protein,

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:53.600
fat and carbohydrate breakdown and the fiber content.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.020
Then what?

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:56.400
You have this information together.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:02.840
You can share on your project in Scotia to get some feedback and see how your food compares

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:03.840
to others.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.250
Lastly,

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:09.540
determine if the current food you are using is still a good choice.

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:13.830
If not find a different food that will work for you and your cat on his diet.
