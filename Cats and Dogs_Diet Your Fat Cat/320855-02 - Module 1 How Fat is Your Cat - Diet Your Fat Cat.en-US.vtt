00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.750
Okay.

00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:01.280
Welcome,

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:01.840
Teoh.

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.580
Weight loss with your fat cat.

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:09.620
Everything you need to know to help your cat achieve a healthy weight In case you're

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.510
wondering where my formerly fat cat is hanging out right here,

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:33.180
one of the perks of having a cat rate a little overview for you that would go over who this

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.860
courses for who it's not for how to use the course.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.550
How to know if your cat is overweight and how overweight it is.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.170
And then why your cat is overweight and benefits Teoh.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.960
Keeping your cat at a healthy week.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.780
So,

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.160
basically this for people who are trying to diet there.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.450
Overweight cat down to a healthy weight.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:06.520
This course is not for people who are trying Teoh get their underweight cat to gain weight

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.520
.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:13.660
It is not for people who have cats that have any underlying health conditions.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:14.230
For instance,

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.570
if your cat were pregnant,

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.850
there's a reason that she's fat.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.310
And then also,

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.930
if you're not willing to put in the effort to diet your cat,

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.940
this course is not for you a little bit on how to use the course.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:28.990
Obviously,

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.490
you can go through your own pace like,

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.440
however,

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.350
out recommend doing about one module per week for the homework at least cause that's how

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.060
long it could possibly take for each section.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.820
And there's about six modules.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.250
So let's say about a month and 1/2 Teoh,

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.000
complete all of this project next.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.150
For information on how to figure out what the ideal way is for your cat or how to tell how

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.910
overweight your cat is when you look up ideal weight online.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.750
You don't get one specific answer.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.540
It can be pretty overwhelming and confusing.

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.260
And if you look up your cat breed,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.040
you might get a weight range.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.020
But your cat might be at the low or the high end.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.150
So how did you know?

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.080
And then most of us don't even really know what cat read we own.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.250
It's usually just a domestic short hair,

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.350
so that brings us to you.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:35.130
The only way you can really know how over what your cat is is by your own observations,

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:41.680
and the best way that I've found to do this is through what I'm going to call a cat weight

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.180
chart.

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:48.130
I've made a cat weight chart for you that you can download below in the resource is section

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.050
going to show you what that looks like now.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.510
So a couple of things to keep in mind.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.500
You may just want to use the pictures to determine how overweight your cat is.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.490
For sometimes the words company,

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.540
each picture can be easier.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.870
One thing to remember if you can see the ribs,

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.290
your cat is approaching too thin territory.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.150
If you cannot find the ribs,

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.790
your cat is likely overweight.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:20.050
The ideal weight corresponds to ribs being easily felt with a slight fat cover.

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:25.330
Also bear in mind if you have a cat with long for this will be a little different as you

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.070
will not be able to see the ribs the same way as you would for a short haired cat.

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.990
Also your cat.

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.840
Maybe off the chart literally.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.790
Don't be deterred as this can and will be gravity.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.810
Just continue to use this chart as a reference.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.150
As you go through the program of dieting your cat.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.370
You should be able to slowly see your cat come closer and closer to the ideal of body

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.610
weight.

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.810
You should also keep this chart in mind to make sure your cat doesn't dip too low and wit
