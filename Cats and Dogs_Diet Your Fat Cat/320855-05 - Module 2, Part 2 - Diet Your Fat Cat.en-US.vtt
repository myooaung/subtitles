00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.610
So the next couple sides I'm going to show you are from the observation sheet.

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:08.070
Download that you can get below on.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:13.380
This will help you keep track of what you're doing for a week with your cat.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.080
In terms of diet and exercise,

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.670
this is an example of how to fill out the observation phase.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.990
Download for the food section featured on the left here,

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.550
filling the columns for what time?

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.190
What type food,

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:37.150
amount of food and the equivalent calorie count for the exercise section secured on right

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.780
here,

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.220
right down when,

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.150
what toy and how long the exercise lasted.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.650
For measurements.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.730
If you haven't already,

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.970
please download the Cat Week Boss Hopers spreadsheet.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.550
Once downloaded,

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.770
you will notice the conversion table shown it right on tap to food calories.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.790
It is useful to know the conversion between tables.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.620
Minister Cops When determining calories for your cat,

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:03.870
remember,

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.270
a cup of food for most cats is almost certainly more than the recommended serving size per

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.710
day.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.670
This table may come in handy.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:11.260
Leader.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.250
When you are modifying the amounts of food for your cat and his diet,

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.210
please note that four tablespoons equals fourth of a cup.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.260
A tip tablespoons is 1/2 of a cup and 12 tablespoons is 3/4 of a cup.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.730
Throughout this course,

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:33.470
we will be referring to calories in the related form as cow on your cat food cans were bags

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:33.470
,

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.470
you may see K cow per kilogram cake,

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.360
helper cup or cake helper can.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.820
It is important to note that capital cow is equal to K cow,

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:52.410
and you will only need the cake helper cop or cake out her can values and can ignore K cal

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:53.250
per kilogram.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.080
Some treat bags will also mention cake help her treat,

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.550
which only shows they do not understand how their customers use the product.

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:10.330
You may be wondering how you will figure out the calorie count for your observation phase.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.170
For that,

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.610
take a look.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.750
A tab to your cat Wheat Loss Helper spreadsheet.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.200
An example is shown to the right care.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.190
Please remember that the values shown in the spiritually you download our for example on

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.500
Lee.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.550
You will be filling out the spreadsheet with your own values.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.450
For the two columns under daily feeding,

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.270
you'll only need to fill out the column for the amount of food you feed your cat the total

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.680
calories will be automatically calculated shown at the end of the call.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.690
You can then copy this information on to your observation sheet for an accurate calorie

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:46.170
count.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.160
This will be an easy and fun way to figure out the cow account for your cat without having

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.890
to you the extra math every time.

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.420
A note on free feeding if you normally feed it,

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.180
is still important to capture the calorie data during this observation phase.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.640
And here's how to do it.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.040
You can at same time every day,

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.610
put down a certain amount in your food bowl that you would normally give your cat SE three

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.750
cups raped and then at the same time,

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.580
the next day you would pick up the bowl and you would measure how much is left,

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:20.450
say,

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:27.850
two cups air left so you can tell that your cat 81 cup that day and then repeat each day so

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.460
that you'll know how much your cat ate during that week.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:35.850
A few notes just on wrapping up this section.

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.540
Please don't be overly concerned with getting the calories exactly correct.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.690
Um,

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.060
if you have to guess the value,

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.140
just go ahead and do that right down to the best of your knowledge and move on.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.710
At this days,

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.630
you are merely just observing your cat care routine,

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.080
and you can deal with more details later.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:02.510
Documentation will also count as a benchmark against which to measure progress in the

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:03.120
future.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.130
For example,

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.670
if your cat won't get up for anything except the food bowl,

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.490
getting him to play for even just a few seconds will be a huge win.

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:15.790
So I'm gonna put up a slide here for your homework for week two.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.270
So the hallmark do nothing.

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:21.610
Step one,

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:22.350
the weight.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.270
Decide on how you will keep track of your cats week.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.530
Get a scale for weighing your cat or make a plan for visiting your bets office.

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.050
Wait your cat.

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.950
This will give you an accurate baseline week for your cat.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.310
You can share your cat starting weight in your project as well.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:44.440

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.890
Project Description section.

Share this in your project as well.

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:49.120
To get some feedback,

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.990
step three.

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.410
Print out the observation phase.

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:53.450
Download below.

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.130
I feel it out for one week.

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:59.900
You can use the calories that you calculated and step to above during the observation phase

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.900
.
