00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060
all right.

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.080
Moving on to module to do nothing.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:11.110
So what is this crazy person talking about?

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:11.920
Do nothing.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:12.570
All right,

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.300
let's explain.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.750
You want to observe what you are presently doing with your overweight cat?

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.680
If you don't know where you start,

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.220
you don't know where you're going to go there to things we will go over in this module,

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:30.450
one is weighing your cat and the other is observing present food and exercise patents.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:37.100
So I'd really like to impress upon you guys the importance of getting an accurate weight

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.750
measurement.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.130
Um,

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.150
so five or 10 extra pounds on a human doesn't really sound that bad.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:49.050
But for a cat who's typically £10 if you had five extra pounds to that,

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.130
that's 50% overweight.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.450
So that's why having an accurate wait for your cat is very important.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:01.060
To get an accurate wheat union accurate scale,

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.450
step one will be weighing your cat.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:10.850
This is important to get a baseline measurement against which to measure progress.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.050
Additionally,

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.930
periodic weigh ins will tell you whether you should adjust feeding amounts.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.880
This is an important part of process,

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.010
as you won't be able to tell easily if you are over war under feeding your cat without

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.650
weighing it.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.670
There are two main methods for weighing your cat.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:37.650
One would be Teoh get accurate scale that you can use to weigh your cat for at home.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.850
Um,

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.350
this could be a specialized pet or baby scale,

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.750
which could go down to the ounce or a scale for a human that is very accurate.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:48.060
So,

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.580
for instance,

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:49.850
if you could find the scale,

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.980
it goes down to the £0.1.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.030
That would be great.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.160
The second option would be taking your cat to the vet toe.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.040
Have that we it for you.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:07.360
And typically they'll even have a scale hanging out in the outer office area so you

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.790
wouldn't even need to make an appointment.

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.440
If in doubt,

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.050
just call and ask if you go for the at home scale method.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.800
There are a couple ways that you can do this toe.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.460
Wait your cat.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.920
The easiest would be to weigh yourself and then weigh yourself holding your cat.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.760
And then the difference between that is your cats week.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:37.290
You can also try weighing your cat in the carrier itself.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.340
You would need the weight of the carrier should do that you could try just weighing

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.960
yourself holding carrier and then weigh yourself holding the carrier with the cat in it.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:54.010
So some of you might be thinking Maquette hates carriers to,

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.810
um,

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.740
so you can try a couple things to try and get them to be okay with the carrier.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.570
You could leave it out all the time,

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.540
or just a couple days before you're planning on using it.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:06.170
That way,

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.550
the cat will get desensitized to the carrier,

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.430
and if you notice it going around the carrier,

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.710
maybe even hanging out in the carrier,

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.180
you could try giving it some positive attention,

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.840
or maybe even giving it a treat.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.500
You can also try putting ah,

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.820
blanket or an item of clothing the cat likes in there.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.450
They like a certain sense to be around them.

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:34.720
You could also try taking your cat places that is not the vet's office in the carrier.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.540
So if you want on a drive around the block,

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:38.380
for instance,

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.400
that would teach your cat that sometimes three carrier isn't that bad.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.260
They don't always get taken to the vet
