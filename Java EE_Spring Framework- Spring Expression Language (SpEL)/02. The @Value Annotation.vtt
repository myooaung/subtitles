00:00:01.687 --> 00:00:04.842
Let's have a look at the @Value annotation.

2
00:00:04.842 --> 00:00:08.581
The @Value annotation is an annotation available in Spring

3
00:00:08.581 --> 00:00:12.050
for specifying default values or injecting values into

4
00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.198
fields of Spring managed beans.

5
00:00:15.198 --> 00:00:17.792
It can be placed in fields, methods,

6
00:00:17.792 --> 00:00:21.571
and constructor parameters to specify default values.

7
00:00:21.571 --> 00:00:24.179
In an annotation-based Spring configuration,

8
00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:27.667
we can write SpEL expressions inside of @Value

9
00:00:27.667 --> 00:00:30.346
annotation for dynamic bean wiring.

10
00:00:30.346 --> 00:00:32.840
Let's look at a few examples.

11
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.489
You can see here how a string field, name,

12
00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.273
and an int field, age, have been set with two literal values,

13
00:00:39.273 --> 00:00:44.570
a string and an integer respectively using the @Value annotation.

14
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.471
If you can remember in module 1,

15
00:00:46.471 --> 00:00:50.046
I told you that when using SpEL with annotations,

16
00:00:50.046 --> 00:00:54.169
the syntax is to use a has symbol followed by a pair of curly

17
00:00:54.169 --> 00:00:56.578
braces within which we write our expression.

18
00:00:56.578 --> 00:00:59.067
So that's exactly what we've done here.

19
00:00:59.067 --> 00:01:04.254
This is how we use the @Value annotation on a method with SpEL to set a

20
00:01:04.254 --> 00:01:07.505
default value to the timeZone property of our User bean.

21
00:01:07.505 --> 00:01:12.090
Remember, you saw how this was done using plain Java code in module 1.

22
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.435
In this, we are using the @Value annotation in constructor parameters,

23
00:01:16.435 --> 00:01:17.060
country,

24
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.685
and language once again with SpEL expressions to

25
00:01:20.685 --> 00:01:22.957
initialize them with default values.

26
00:01:22.957 --> 00:01:25.904
Well, these are just a few of the examples.

27
00:01:25.904 --> 00:01:33.000
There are more usages of the @Value annotation with SpEL, which you will see in the upcoming demos.
