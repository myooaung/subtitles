00:00:02,154 --> 00:00:02,886
In this demo,

2
00:00:02,886 --> 00:00:05,976
we will look at how the systemProperties predefined variable

3
00:00:05,976 --> 00:00:09,512
can be used to access the user's country,

4
00:00:09,512 --> 00:00:13,111
language, and time zone, and set them to our User bean.

5
00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:18,312
Our aim here is to be able to render the order details depending on the locale

6
00:00:18,312 --> 00:00:23,333
of the user at runtime using dynamic dependency injection.

7
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:24,486
Here are the steps.

8
00:00:24,486 --> 00:00:27,760
Add code to the ExpressionParser class to be able to

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,196
access systemProperties in SpEL expression.

10
00:00:31,196 --> 00:00:34,517
And then wire the User bean properties dynamically at runtime

11
00:00:34,517 --> 00:00:39,829
based on the user's locale-specific information.

12
00:00:39,829 --> 00:00:41,259
Getting back to our parser class,

13
00:00:41,259 --> 00:00:45,350
we create a StandardEvaluationContext to be able to use the

14
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:49,545
systemProperties variable in the evaluation of our expressions.

15
00:00:49,545 --> 00:00:52,834
Then set the systemProperties as a variable in this context,

16
00:00:52,834 --> 00:00:55,978
and then we'll be able to parse expressions that access

17
00:00:55,978 --> 00:00:59,863
values from the system properties.

18
00:00:59,863 --> 00:01:04,686
Then wire our User bean properties with those values,

19
00:01:04,686 --> 00:01:14,820
the country, language, and time zone, like this.

20
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,720
Prior to running this,

21
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,222
you should go to Edit Configurations in IntelliJ and set the

22
00:01:19,222 --> 00:01:23,461
VM options for the parser class like this.

23
00:01:23,461 --> 00:01:24,139
From here,

24
00:01:24,139 --> 00:01:28,294
you can simply simulate running with different values for user.language,

25
00:01:28,294 --> 00:01:37,000
user.country, and user.timezone system properties. Run it and you can see the values being set accordingly.
