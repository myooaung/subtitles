Before winding up this module,

2
00:00:03,053 --> 00:00:09,458
I would like to discuss a few typical scenarios where SpEL can come in handy.

3
00:00:09,458 --> 00:00:13,484
You can choose to use SpEL when your application needs to dependency inject

4
00:00:13,484 --> 00:00:16,850
an existing bean or its properties into another object,

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:21,550
as we saw in a few instances of our E-Commerce application.

6
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:25,945
You can also use SpEL when you want to dependency inject a bean or set

7
00:00:25,945 --> 00:00:29,953
bean properties based on some environmental situation or condition such

8
00:00:29,953 --> 00:00:34,585
as the scenario we saw in our E-Commerce application to render the order

9
00:00:34,585 --> 00:00:36,744
details based on the user's locale.

10
00:00:36,744 --> 00:00:38,290
And in general,

11
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:45,000
whenever you need to access and manipulate object graphs at runtime, you can choose to use SpEL.
