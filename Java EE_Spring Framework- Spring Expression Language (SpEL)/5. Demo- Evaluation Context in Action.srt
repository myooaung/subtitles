1
00:00:02,452 --> 00:00:06,301
Now let's see the evaluation context in action.

2
00:00:06,301 --> 00:00:11,179
Here, we will be creating a StandardEvaluationContext in our parser class,

3
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:15,282
add code to resolve a field using the evaluation context,

4
00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:17,442
create a bean named User,

5
00:00:17,442 --> 00:00:22,059
set it as the root object in a StandardEvaluationContext for

6
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:26,883
demonstrating resolving of bean properties.

7
00:00:26,883 --> 00:00:28,856
We are back again in our Spring Boot application,

8
00:00:28,856 --> 00:00:34,692
and now we will create a StandardEvaluationContext in our parser class.

9
00:00:34,692 --> 00:00:37,283
Let's set a variable called greeting to this evaluation

10
00:00:37,283 --> 00:00:39,936
context with a value of Hello USA.

11
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:44,371
Now we write our SpEL expression to access and do some simple

12
00:00:44,371 --> 00:00:52,102
processing to its value and parse the expression.

13
00:00:52,102 --> 00:00:57,010
And now we can print out the value that we get in return like this.

14
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:00,970
Run it and you'll see the output as USA.

15
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,925
Let's add a second StandardEvaluationContext and set a

16
00:01:03,925 --> 00:01:07,301
variable with the exact same name, greeting,

17
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:16,982
to this evaluation context, this time with a value of Hello UK.

18
00:01:16,982 --> 00:01:21,295
Repeat the same steps as before and run the class.

19
00:01:21,295 --> 00:01:26,377
You'll get the output as UK this time.

20
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:30,199
The evaluation context resolved the field when

21
00:01:30,199 --> 00:01:35,014
evaluating the expressions respectively.

22
00:01:35,014 --> 00:01:41,823
Now let's go ahead and add a bean called User.

23
00:01:41,823 --> 00:01:48,953
Add a few properties to it, along with getters and setters.

24
00:01:48,953 --> 00:01:52,514
Then create a new User object in our class and set it as the

25
00:01:52,514 --> 00:01:55,575
root object of our StandardEvaluationContext by passing it

26
00:01:55,575 --> 00:02:02,482
to the constructor like this.

27
00:02:02,482 --> 00:02:09,697
We can use an SpEL expression to wire the country property with a value.

28
00:02:09,697 --> 00:02:14,657
When doing this, we pass our evaluation context like this.

29
00:02:14,657 --> 00:02:25,886
Similarly, we can set other properties of the User bean.

30
00:02:25,886 --> 00:02:28,500
Now when you check out the values of the User bean's properties,

31
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,266
you can see that the values have been correctly wired to them.

32
00:02:33,266 --> 00:02:42,000
So once the root object is specified, SpEL knows how to resolve its properties when evaluating expressions.
