[Autogenerated] in this module.

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:05,550
We talked about the importance off testing the data access.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,970
There you learned that database integration tests

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,940
should be down for complex queries.

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,710
Life second events and wrappings.

6
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:18,540
Milton methods on repo stories or mongo template should not be tested.

7
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:22,720
Should always try to keep your test stable and always populate

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,570
and cleared the database after each test.

9
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:30,160
After all, you want predictability in your death.

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,080
The last journalist she strived to start with an embedded at the base and

11
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,740
progress to stand around one just before we ship into production.

12
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:42,440
As you saw, it only takes 30 seconds to make this transition.

13
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,300
Bravo.

14
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:48,840
You reach the end of this course and it has bean Amazing journey.

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,940
You learned how to get started with spring and Mongo.

16
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:58,440
You discovered how spring mongo annotations and crawl operations work.

17
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,540
We talked about it boy stories and how they can help you to create dinner code.

18
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,010
We also looked at docking references and left second events,

19
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,370
which helps us to implement cascading.

20
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:13,940
We took a look at that immigrations and how to implement them properly.

21
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,270
And finally, who discussed about integration,

22
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:21,490
testing and how we can increase the quality of your applications.

23
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:25,570
You now have all the skills needed to start creating enterprise

24
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:28,830
applications with spring and nobody and I mean it.

25
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:32,920
Go to work and find out if there are any projects involving mongo to be,

26
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,730
because you'll be able to tackle any challenges not coming your way.

27
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,350
If you want to take your skills to a new level,

28
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,350
if it also invest in learning more about Mom will be.

29
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:47,820
There are two great courses here on Parasite that can help with

30
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,100
that introduction to Mongo To Be and Munger to be

31
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:55,920
administration both by Nouri Halperin and no,

32
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,450
forget it.

33
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,700
I'm a social guy.

34
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:03,130
If we want to get in touch, you can find me on Twitter or Arlington,

35
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:06,710
and we can also check out my other parasite course salad.

36
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:14,000
Softer design principles in Java, but the next time, have a great day and write Amazing coat
