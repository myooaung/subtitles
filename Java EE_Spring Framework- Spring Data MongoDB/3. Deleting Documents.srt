00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,560
[Autogenerated] as sad as it may be,

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:07,600
sometimes we need to remove documents altogether from our collection.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,090
Delish in also has many facets.

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:12,220
We can read a single document.

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,640
We can delete multiple documents.

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,990
All we can delete the entire collection again.

7
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:20,650
I think the best way to understand Edition is to look at

8
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:26,160
some examples we have free airports in or database to for

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,980
France and one from Turkey.

10
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,720
Let's see you want to delete the stubble airport.

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,370
We're grabbing it from the database and then we can use the remove

12
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:37,540
method on the Monga Temple class to remove it.

13
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:42,130
After executives method, we will have just two airports in our collection.

14
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:46,100
We can also remove multiple documents or perform a batch.

15
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:46,970
Did it?

16
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:49,210
The recipe should be very clear by now.

17
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:50,290
We define a query.

18
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:54,350
We're adding a criteria were filter or the airport where the country

19
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:59,570
is France and then we can use the fight old and remove method passing

20
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:03,030
the query and the airport class type.

21
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,940
The outcome off this execution is going to be this.

22
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:12,540
All the airports in France will be deleted and we're left with a single airport.

23
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,240
But what if you want to remove all the airports from this

24
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,280
collection we have multiple ways to achieve is,

25
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,820
for example, we can create an empty query,

26
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,620
acquitted without criteria.

27
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:27,940
This will effectively select all airport in that collection,

28
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:32,420
and then we can use, find all and remove to execute this dish in.

29
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,940
And of course, we'll be left with an empty collection.

30
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,600
However, I think it's much more efficient.

31
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,060
Just drop the collection all together.

32
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:43,320
You can do that using the Mongol Template ____ collection and

33
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,140
then pass in the type off the document.

34
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,520
Congratulations.

35
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:53,280
At this point, you're able to perform the basic crowd operations on a monk,

36
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,970
a database in a spring application, you learned how to query,

37
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:08,000
how to create out a bit and how to delete documents. But the discussion here is not over until we take a look at Mongo converters.
