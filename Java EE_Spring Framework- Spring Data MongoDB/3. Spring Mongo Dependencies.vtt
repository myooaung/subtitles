00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:04.310
[Autogenerated] Let's talk about the dependencies that you need to

2
00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.650
connect a spring application from Mongo Database,

3
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.760
and I have good news for you.

4
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.170
I want to share the easiest approach that I found to

5
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.740
get started with Spring and Mongo.

6
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.920
The first thing that you should do is start with an

7
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.340
empty spring boot application.

8
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.900
Now this will bring in the basic springboard dependencies,

9
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.740
the most important of which, being the spring boot starter.

10
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.570
Not that you have a spring the starter.

11
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.050
You can go ahead and bring in the spring Data Mongo debate

12
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.530
dependency and it's called Springwood Starter Data.

13
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:40.930
Mongol Baby.

14
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:41.800
And that's it.

15
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.010
Once you have destroyed dependencies in your palm dot XML file,

16
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:51.330
you're good to go can now write code that connect to a Mongo D B database.

17
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.540
But wait a minute.

18
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.000
Let's look more closely at the Springwood Starter date among Gotta be because,

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.570
in fact, this dependency is what you call Anambra dependency,

20
00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.770
meaning it brings in more dependencies behind the scenes.

21
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.730
So when you bring in spring boots, starter date among,

22
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.040
would he be in your point of XML file?

23
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.410
It will also bring in the Mongol to be driver

24
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.210
dependency and this will bring in the monk.

25
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.250
Would he be driver but San dependency?

26
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.000
And among what?

27
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.940
Baby driver Core dependency.

28
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.160
You also get access with spring date among body be,

29
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.920
which in turn will bring in a spin.

30
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.010
Get the Commons and the story goes on.

31
00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.210
What I want to emphasize is that he can bring in these dependencies manually,

32
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.240
but that's a lot of work.

33
00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.910
Instead,

34
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:43.000
you can go in with the Springwood starter datum uncle to be and you'll be good to go.
