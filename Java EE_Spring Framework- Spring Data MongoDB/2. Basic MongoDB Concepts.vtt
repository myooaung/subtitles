00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:02.860
[Autogenerated] I want to take a minute to recaps are

2
00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.590
fundamental mongo D B concepts, and I want to oppose them.

3
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.840
Tow traditional relational database concepts.

4
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:11.820
For example.

5
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.140
In the relations at the base, we have tables date I stored in a tabular format.

6
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.400
Entities No, I represented by rows.

7
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.740
Each row in a table.

8
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.540
You neatly represents an entity.

9
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:31.340
Each entity has properties, and those properties are stored in columns.

10
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.670
And, of course, we have some special columns which are unique,

11
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.690
that we call primary keys, and they have a special name.

12
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.530
Everybody's used working with immigration databases,

13
00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.340
so these concepts are pretty straightforward.

14
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.620
However, when we're dealing in no sequel and mongo fix change little bit,

15
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.310
we no longer have a tab Larry presentation off data.

16
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.360
In fact, human body be data is stored like this.

17
00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.370
If you look closely at it, you'll not.

18
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.500
Is that it kind of resembles Jason and in fact, Mongo.

19
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.640
Bebe stores documents in a format called Binary Jason.

20
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.240
So let's put them side by side and see the difference in criminology.

21
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.570
We should have databases both in Mongo and in relational databases.

22
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:24.190
However, no sequel databases and mongo as well don't store information tables,

23
00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.060
the store information in collections entities are not starting rose.

24
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.520
Instead, entities are stored in documents.

25
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.840
And, of course, that means don't have comes documents have feels.

26
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.920
We also have a special purpose field Know that which we can call I D,

27
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.190
which acts kind like a primary key.

28
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.670
So these concepts are kind of similar, So drink up.

29
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.640
Mongol databases can contain collections.

30
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.370
Collections can contain zero or more documents that

31
00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.910
means can contain one or more fields.

32
00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.470
And, of course, documents should have an i.

33
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.230
D field,

34
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:08.000
which is the primary Ki tae come a month and let these terms sinking because you lose them a lot in the upcoming modules.
