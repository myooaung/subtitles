<v ->Hey guys, welcome back to Deep Learning A to Z</v>
3

3

00:00:06.470  -->  00:00:08.290 line:15% 
This is Kirill and today,
4

4

00:00:08.290  -->  00:00:10.730
we're going on a walk through Africa.
5

5

00:00:10.730  -->  00:00:11.965
Now right away, I wanna show you something cool.
6

6

00:00:11.965  -->  00:00:15.280 line:15% 
On my right, you can see a blue box.
7

7

00:00:15.280  -->  00:00:17.630 line:15% 
And on my left, you can see like
8

8

00:00:17.630  -->  00:00:19.700
a seating area where people sit.
9

9

00:00:19.700  -->  00:00:23.500
So my question to you is, what do you think that is?
10

10

00:00:23.500  -->  00:00:25.960
Have a random guess.
11

11

00:00:25.960  -->  00:00:28.540
Now if you guess that, that is the village TV
12

12

00:00:28.540  -->  00:00:31.189
and that is where people sit to watch soccer matches
13

13

00:00:31.189  -->  00:00:34.800
and movies and TV shows, then you guessed right.
14

14

00:00:34.800  -->  00:00:35.633
Howw cool is that?
15

15

00:00:35.633  -->  00:00:38.670
When there is a soccer match on, they all get together.
16

16

00:00:38.670  -->  00:00:40.210
Of course, that is a great solution for people
17

17

00:00:40.210  -->  00:00:41.330
who don't have a TV.
18

18

00:00:41.330  -->  00:00:44.090
But also, they get together to watch these things like
19

19

00:00:44.090  -->  00:00:45.250
as a whole village.
20

20

00:00:45.250  -->  00:00:47.680
That's one of the two village TVs.
21

21

00:00:47.680  -->  00:00:48.790
So while we're on this walk,
22

22

00:00:48.790  -->  00:00:51.446
hopefully you'll see a few other cool things.
23

23

00:00:51.446  -->  00:00:54.452
And I also wanted to use this opportunity
24

24

00:00:54.452  -->  00:00:56.599
to give you a quick heads up.
25

25

00:00:56.599  -->  00:00:59.830
And what this is all about is that very soon,
26

26

00:00:59.830  -->  00:01:03.040 line:15% 
Udemy is going to ask you to leave a review for this course.
27

27

00:01:03.040  -->  00:01:05.210 line:15% 
Now I know this course has just started
28

28

00:01:05.210  -->  00:01:07.270
and it's very early to judge the quality
29

29

00:01:07.270  -->  00:01:09.830
and value of the course, however the Udemy Review System
30

30

00:01:09.830  -->  00:01:12.840
has simply changed and they are asking you to leave a review
31

31

00:01:12.840  -->  00:01:15.040
earlier and earlier on in the course.
32

32

00:01:15.040  -->  00:01:16.410
Now with that in mind, we are not going to ask you
33

33

00:01:16.410  -->  00:01:19.023
to leave a 5-star review, but what I would like to ask
34

34

00:01:19.023  -->  00:01:23.100
is that, if you don't feel that you know the course
35

35

00:01:23.100  -->  00:01:25.230
well-enough yet to rate it a 5-star course,
36

36

00:01:25.230  -->  00:01:26.740
then please scroll through the tutorials.
37

37

00:01:26.740  -->  00:01:28.813
Please have a look at all the different topics
38

38

00:01:28.813  -->  00:01:30.249
that we cover here.
39

39

00:01:30.249  -->  00:01:32.103
You will see that we cover 6 different
40

40

00:01:32.103  -->  00:01:33.860
Deep Learning algorithms.
41

41

00:01:33.860  -->  00:01:36.069
We cover them in depth from both the practical
42

42

00:01:36.069  -->  00:01:37.960
and the intuition side of things.
43

43

00:01:37.960  -->  00:01:40.046
We've got, I think over a dozen hours of content
44

44

00:01:40.046  -->  00:01:45.046
and over 100 tutorials and hopefully once you see all that,
45

45

00:01:45.140  -->  00:01:47.220 line:15% 
it will give you the confidence to rate this course
46

46

00:01:47.220  -->  00:01:48.100 line:15% 
a 5-star course.
47

47

00:01:48.100  -->  00:01:51.003 line:15% 
If on the other hand, you have some concerns.
48

48

00:01:51.003  -->  00:01:54.560
You feel that something is wrong with the course,
49

49

00:01:54.560  -->  00:01:57.090
you feel unsatisfied, then please do let us know
50

50

00:01:57.090  -->  00:01:58.760
before you write the course.
51

51

00:01:58.760  -->  00:02:01.350
You can contact the SuperDataScience support team directly
52

52

00:02:01.350  -->  00:02:05.010 line:15% 
or you can leave us a short message on the course Q and A.
53

53

00:02:05.010  -->  00:02:07.229 line:15% 
We will get back to you or we fill fix up
54

54

00:02:07.229  -->  00:02:09.776
whatever the issue is and then get back to you.
55

55

00:02:09.776  -->  00:02:11.974
And hopefully that will give you the confidence
56

56

00:02:11.974  -->  00:02:13.652
to rate the course a 5-star course.
57

57

00:02:13.652  -->  00:02:16.660
Now on that note, if something is wrong,
58

58

00:02:16.660  -->  00:02:17.493
please do let us know.
59

59

00:02:17.493  -->  00:02:19.070
But if you're satisfied with everything.
60

60

00:02:19.070  -->  00:02:20.940
If you're happy about the course,
61

61

00:02:20.940  -->  00:02:22.770
if you're excited about the journey ahead
62

62

00:02:22.770  -->  00:02:24.350
and about learning Deep Learning
63

63

00:02:24.350  -->  00:02:26.810
and you feel that this is a 5-star course,
64

64

00:02:26.810  -->  00:02:28.500
then please do rate it appropriately
65

65

00:02:28.500  -->  00:02:30.460
so other people in the world will also know
66

66

00:02:30.460  -->  00:02:32.610
that this is a 5-star Deep Learning course
67

67

00:02:32.610  -->  00:02:36.650
and they can learn this topic here confidently.
68

68

00:02:36.650  -->  00:02:38.720
On that note guys, thanks so much for being part
69

69

00:02:38.720  -->  00:02:39.832
of Deep Learning A to Z.
70

70

00:02:39.832  -->  00:02:43.151
Hope you enjoyed our short little walk through Africa
71

71

00:02:43.151  -->  00:02:45.461
and I look forward to seeing you throughout the tutorials.
72

72

00:02:45.461  -->  00:02:48.213
Until next time, enjoy Deep Learning.
