<v Instructor>Hello, and welcome back</v>
2

2

00:00:01,313  -->  00:00:02,870
to the course on deep learning.
3

3

00:00:02,870  -->  00:00:03,970
I hope you're tracking along
4

4

00:00:03,970  -->  00:00:06,520
with these intuition tutorials just fine,
5

5

00:00:06,520  -->  00:00:09,080
and that you had a chance to play around with everything
6

6

00:00:09,080  -->  00:00:10,560
we've learnt so far.
7

7

00:00:10,560  -->  00:00:12,020
And today we're talking about flattening
8

8

00:00:12,020  -->  00:00:14,840
and the good news is that this is a very simple step.
9

9

00:00:14,840  -->  00:00:17,880
And this tutorial's going to be very quick
10

10

00:00:17,880  -->  00:00:19,310
and then we'll be able to move on to
11

11

00:00:19,310  -->  00:00:21,790
the next interesting things.
12

12

00:00:21,790  -->  00:00:23,440
Alright, so far we've got
13

13

00:00:23,440  -->  00:00:25,410
the pooled layer, pooled feature map.
14

14

00:00:25,410  -->  00:00:29,830
And that is after we apply the convolution operation
15

15

00:00:29,830  -->  00:00:33,040
to our image and then we apply pooling to the results
16

16

00:00:33,040  -->  00:00:35,020
of the convolution which is the convolved image.
17

17

00:00:35,020  -->  00:00:36,140
And so, what are we going to do
18

18

00:00:36,140  -->  00:00:37,470
with this pooled feature map?
19

19

00:00:37,470  -->  00:00:38,480
Well, we're going to take it
20

20

00:00:38,480  -->  00:00:41,570
and we're going to flatten it into a column.
21

21

00:00:41,570  -->  00:00:44,350
So, basically just take the numbers row by row,
22

22

00:00:44,350  -->  00:00:47,060
and put them into this one long column.
23

23

00:00:47,060  -->  00:00:48,180
And the reason for that is
24

24

00:00:48,180  -->  00:00:51,080
because we want to later input this into
25

25

00:00:51,080  -->  00:00:55,200
an artificial neural network for further processing.
26

26

00:00:55,200  -->  00:00:56,650
So, this is what it looks like
27

27

00:00:56,650  -->  00:00:58,590
when you have many pooling layers,
28

28

00:00:58,590  -->  00:01:02,690
or you have the pooling layers with many pooled feature maps
29

29

00:01:02,690  -->  00:01:04,140
and then you flatten them.
30

30

00:01:04,140  -->  00:01:07,190
So, you put them into this one long column
31

31

00:01:07,190  -->  00:01:08,950
sequentially one after the other.
32

32

00:01:08,950  -->  00:01:12,840
And you get one huge vector of inputs
33

33

00:01:12,840  -->  00:01:15,300
for an artificial neural network.
34

34

00:01:15,300  -->  00:01:19,270
And so, to sum all this up, we've got an input image,
35

35

00:01:19,270  -->  00:01:23,490
we apply a convolution layer, and let's not forget the ReLu
36

36

00:01:23,490  -->  00:01:27,981
or rectified linear units function that we apply
37

37

00:01:27,981  -->  00:01:29,940
after the convolution layer as well.
38

38

00:01:29,940  -->  00:01:33,780
And then we apply pooling, and then we flatten everything
39

39

00:01:33,780  -->  00:01:38,780
into a long vector which will be our input layer
40

40

00:01:40,070  -->  00:01:42,890
for an artificial neural network.
41

41

00:01:42,890  -->  00:01:44,500
And exactly how that works we'll
42

42

00:01:44,500  -->  00:01:47,090
find out in the next tutorial.
43

43

00:01:47,090  -->  00:01:49,120
Hope you enjoyed today's session, and I look forward
44

44

00:01:49,120  -->  00:01:49,953
to seeing you next time.
45

45

00:01:49,953  -->  00:01:51,803
Until then, enjoy deep learning.
