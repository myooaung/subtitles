<v Narrator>Hello and welcome actually</v>

2

00:00:01,470  -->  00:00:02,570
course on deep learning.

3

00:00:02,570  -->  00:00:04,470
I hope you're enjoying our encounters
4

4

00:00:04,470  -->  00:00:07,260
and this is quick tutorial on biases.
5

5

00:00:07,260  -->  00:00:09,410
So, let's start straight into it.
6

6

00:00:09,410  -->  00:00:11,260
We've got an Auto Encoder here.
7

7

00:00:11,260  -->  00:00:13,420
Again our simplified version that we work with.
8

8

00:00:13,420  -->  00:00:16,410
And I just wanna to point out that sometimes
9

9

00:00:16,410  -->  00:00:19,200
you'll see a bit of a different representation.
10

10

00:00:19,200  -->  00:00:21,610
It might includes something like this
11

11

00:00:21,610  -->  00:00:23,450
and these are just biases.
12

12

00:00:23,450  -->  00:00:26,080
So, biases mean you might an actually might say
13

13

00:00:26,080  -->  00:00:29,170
plus one inside each one of them and usually it does.
14

14

00:00:29,170  -->  00:00:32,780
And bias just basically means that in your activation,
15

15

00:00:32,780  -->  00:00:34,407
a function in your
16

16

00:00:35,453  -->  00:00:38,090
In your activation function you've got that b over there.
17

17

00:00:38,090  -->  00:00:40,800
So, it's just weights times x it's plus b
18

18

00:00:40,800  -->  00:00:43,160
and probably the more correct representation
19

19

00:00:43,160  -->  00:00:46,040
which you'll more often see than this one
20

20

00:00:46,040  -->  00:00:47,350
is actually like this.
21

21

00:00:47,350  -->  00:00:49,260
This is how it should be represented
22

22

00:00:49,260  -->  00:00:51,710
if people are showing biases.
23

23

00:00:51,710  -->  00:00:55,070
Then, they're just added there because bias affects
24

24

00:00:55,070  -->  00:00:58,530
the layer ahead, the layer that's in front.
25

25

00:00:58,530  -->  00:01:01,090
So, just be aware of that and if you see that
26

26

00:01:01,090  -->  00:01:03,330
just remember it's just basically a bias in it.
27

27

00:01:03,330  -->  00:01:04,480
That's all, all it is.
28

28

00:01:04,480  -->  00:01:07,240
It's just a constant in that equation.
29

29

00:01:07,240  -->  00:01:08,990
Nothing more to it than that.
30

30

00:01:08,990  -->  00:01:10,520
And that's pretty much of it.
31

31

00:01:10,520  -->  00:01:11,353
Just look out for that
32

32

00:01:11,353  -->  00:01:13,690
and I will see you on the next tutorial.
33

33

00:01:13,690  -->  00:01:15,363
Until then, enjoy deep learning.
