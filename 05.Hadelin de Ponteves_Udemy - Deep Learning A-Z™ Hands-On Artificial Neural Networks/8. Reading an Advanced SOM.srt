<v Instructor>Hello, and welcome back to the course</v>
2

2

00:00:01,810  -->  00:00:03,170
on deep learning.
3

3

00:00:03,170  -->  00:00:05,560
In today's tutorial, we're going to go through an
4

4

00:00:05,560  -->  00:00:07,070
advanced self organizing map,
5

5

00:00:07,070  -->  00:00:10,690
we're going to have a look at how to actually read them.
6

6

00:00:10,690  -->  00:00:12,030
So let's get started.
7

7

00:00:12,030  -->  00:00:14,600
You might come across a self organizing map
8

8

00:00:14,600  -->  00:00:15,480
that looks like this.
9

9

00:00:15,480  -->  00:00:19,600
Well, there's actually a lot of self organizing maps inside
10

10

00:00:19,600  -->  00:00:21,820
or a lot of representations inside this
11

11

00:00:21,820  -->  00:00:23,730
one self organizing map.
12

12

00:00:23,730  -->  00:00:25,980
And even though you might not always
13

13

00:00:25,980  -->  00:00:28,370
have these in your projects,
14

14

00:00:28,370  -->  00:00:31,340
or in the results that you're trying to interpret
15

15

00:00:31,340  -->  00:00:32,660
sometimes you might come across them
16

16

00:00:32,660  -->  00:00:34,950
and it's useful to know what's going on.
17

17

00:00:34,950  -->  00:00:37,130
So this is an example from Wikipedia,
18

18

00:00:37,130  -->  00:00:42,130
this is a self organizing map of voting results
19

19

00:00:42,190  -->  00:00:44,410
or voting patterns in the US Congress
20

20

00:00:44,410  -->  00:00:48,700
and basically the input data for this map
21

21

00:00:48,700  -->  00:00:52,520
was like a data sets where you had Members of Congress
22

22

00:00:52,520  -->  00:00:56,480
and in the US Congress I looked it up it's like over 500
23

23

00:00:56,480  -->  00:01:01,400
and something members 535 Members, or something like that.
24

24

00:01:01,400  -->  00:01:05,750
And I think like out of them 100 are Senators,
25

25

00:01:05,750  -->  00:01:08,430
but basically you had inputs as the Members,
26

26

00:01:08,430  -->  00:01:12,420
and then you had information on did each,
27

27

00:01:12,420  -->  00:01:14,720
what did each Member say about a certain question
28

28

00:01:14,720  -->  00:01:15,740
that they were voting on.
29

29

00:01:15,740  -->  00:01:17,160
Did they say yes, did they say no,
30

30

00:01:17,160  -->  00:01:19,220
or did they abstain from voting.
31

31

00:01:19,220  -->  00:01:22,220
And based on that information, the self organizing map
32

32

00:01:22,220  -->  00:01:26,330
was able to in an unsupervised manner, as they, as they do,
33

33

00:01:26,330  -->  00:01:31,290
was able to understand which Members of Congress are close
34

34

00:01:31,290  -->  00:01:34,780
are similar to each other, which are dissimilar,
35

35

00:01:34,780  -->  00:01:37,650
and place them onto a map.
36

36

00:01:37,650  -->  00:01:39,810
And so this is the results that we have.
37

37

00:01:39,810  -->  00:01:41,790
So we're going to start one by one,
38

38

00:01:41,790  -->  00:01:45,540
and slowly will start to make more and more sense.
39

39

00:01:45,540  -->  00:01:49,840
So here we've got a map of the Members of Congress,
40

40

00:01:49,840  -->  00:01:54,690
how the self organizing map splits the data set
41

41

00:01:54,690  -->  00:01:57,550
or split the Members into two classes.
42

42

00:01:57,550  -->  00:01:59,682
And this is very interesting actually, because
43

43

00:01:59,682  -->  00:02:03,320
the actual split between the parties is modeled over here.
44

44

00:02:03,320  -->  00:02:06,250
So when you ask the SOM which Member belongs to which
45

45

00:02:06,250  -->  00:02:07,531
party, the answer is like this,
46

46

00:02:07,531  -->  00:02:12,531
so red here is Republican and blue is Democratic Party.
47

47

00:02:12,960  -->  00:02:14,440
And at the same time,
48

48

00:02:14,440  -->  00:02:16,480
the overall clusters are a bit different.
49

49

00:02:16,480  -->  00:02:19,600
So this is how the self organizing map,
50

50

00:02:19,600  -->  00:02:22,090
splits the Members of Parliament,
51

51

00:02:22,090  -->  00:02:24,530
just based on all of the things that they voted on,
52

52

00:02:24,530  -->  00:02:26,760
on all of the different questions.
53

53

00:02:26,760  -->  00:02:28,410
So you can see that it is a bit different.
54

54

00:02:28,410  -->  00:02:30,970
So over here, specifically, there's a bit of a,
55

55

00:02:30,970  -->  00:02:32,290
like the red goes a bit to the right,
56

56

00:02:32,290  -->  00:02:34,970
and here not necessarily red means Republican,
57

57

00:02:34,970  -->  00:02:36,480
blue means Democratic here,
58

58

00:02:36,480  -->  00:02:38,084
just red and blue other two colors that are used
59

59

00:02:38,084  -->  00:02:40,530
to identify the two clusters.
60

60

00:02:40,530  -->  00:02:43,241
So when you tell the SOM is you can only have two clusters.
61

61

00:02:43,241  -->  00:02:46,130
It will identify the clusters in this way.
62

62

00:02:46,130  -->  00:02:50,640
So that's what this first representation shows us.
63

63

00:02:50,640  -->  00:02:52,870
Then in the second representation,
64

64

00:02:52,870  -->  00:02:55,880
we see the unified district distance matrix,
65

65

00:02:55,880  -->  00:02:57,740
is also called the you matrix
66

66

00:02:57,740  -->  00:03:02,740
and what it shows is the distance between points
67

67

00:03:02,790  -->  00:03:05,000
on the self organizing map, so between nodes,
68

68

00:03:05,000  -->  00:03:07,240
and and as you can see here, it's darker,
69

69

00:03:07,240  -->  00:03:10,630
and what that means is that these points are further apart
70

70

00:03:10,630  -->  00:03:12,370
from each other, and when it's lighter,
71

71

00:03:12,370  -->  00:03:13,870
it means that points are close together.
72

72

00:03:13,870  -->  00:03:16,750
It makes sense over here, because the darker points
73

73

00:03:16,750  -->  00:03:19,270
are exactly on that ridge on this ridge over here.
74

74

00:03:19,270  -->  00:03:21,200
And that means that they're further apart
75

75

00:03:21,200  -->  00:03:22,790
that there's a lot of dissimilarity here
76

76

00:03:22,790  -->  00:03:25,720
while there's actually a lot of similarity here.
77

77

00:03:25,720  -->  00:03:28,340
And now, like we've already talked about this one,
78

78

00:03:28,340  -->  00:03:31,660
this is there belonging to either Democratic Party
79

79

00:03:31,660  -->  00:03:32,975
or the Republican Party.
80

80

00:03:32,975  -->  00:03:35,140
And here are actually the votes,
81

81

00:03:35,140  -->  00:03:37,300
so red means that they voted yes,
82

82

00:03:37,300  -->  00:03:39,200
blue means that they voted no.
83

83

00:03:39,200  -->  00:03:42,000
And this is the result that you get when you
84

84

00:03:42,000  -->  00:03:44,720
apply the self organizing map to the input data.
85

85

00:03:44,720  -->  00:03:46,640
So this is how the self organizing map
86

86

00:03:46,640  -->  00:03:51,640
votes more models those votes models those results.
87

87

00:03:51,750  -->  00:03:54,200
So I can't read the full label here
88

88

00:03:54,200  -->  00:03:56,170
and this is the all information I have,
89

89

00:03:56,170  -->  00:03:59,370
and I think it here it says bankruptcy abuse prevention,
90

90

00:03:59,370  -->  00:04:01,200
I'm not sure if it has more text after that.
91

91

00:04:01,200  -->  00:04:05,770
But as you can see, in this case Republicans voted yes
92

92

00:04:05,770  -->  00:04:08,490
and maybe that is a corporate bankruptcy,
93

93

00:04:08,490  -->  00:04:11,500
rather than an individual purpose bankruptcy.
94

94

00:04:11,500  -->  00:04:14,420
So basically, you can see that all these people voted yes
95

95

00:04:14,420  -->  00:04:17,210
and this is the key to today's tutorial
96

96

00:04:17,210  -->  00:04:18,820
reading and advanced self organizing map.
97

97

00:04:18,820  -->  00:04:22,600
So you have the results here and then you need to remember
98

98

00:04:22,600  -->  00:04:25,310
to overlay it visually with your cluster.
99

99

00:04:25,310  -->  00:04:27,419
And sometimes in these maps you'll actually see
100

100

00:04:27,419  -->  00:04:31,110
this line will be represented as a black line
101

101

00:04:31,110  -->  00:04:33,870
like just a black border here,
102

102

00:04:33,870  -->  00:04:35,660
which will show you the separate cluster,
103

103

00:04:35,660  -->  00:04:36,670
it'll show you this cluster
104

104

00:04:36,670  -->  00:04:38,290
and it will show you this cluster.
105

105

00:04:38,290  -->  00:04:40,110
And but in here, we don't have the border,
106

106

00:04:40,110  -->  00:04:41,360
just imagine it visually,
107

107

00:04:41,360  -->  00:04:43,370
and it's good it goes through about the center
108

108

00:04:43,370  -->  00:04:46,050
so if you imagine the border here visually,
109

109

00:04:46,050  -->  00:04:49,180
it goes like this and then goes here,
110

110

00:04:49,180  -->  00:04:51,880
so you can see that most of the Republicans
111

111

00:04:51,880  -->  00:04:53,720
or all the Republicans according to the
112

112

00:04:53,720  -->  00:04:55,830
self organizing map voted yes.
113

113

00:04:55,830  -->  00:04:58,130
And then even some of the Democrats voted yes.
114

114

00:04:58,130  -->  00:05:00,370
And then they were Democratic voters who voted no.
115

115

00:05:00,370  -->  00:05:02,080
Let's look at another one.
116

116

00:05:02,080  -->  00:05:06,000
Border Protection, anti terrorism as I understand,
117

117

00:05:06,000  -->  00:05:08,070
something else, maybe a law or something.
118

118

00:05:08,070  -->  00:05:10,580
So here you can see a very interesting split.
119

119

00:05:10,580  -->  00:05:14,487
So again, remember that you have your split between the
120

120

00:05:14,487  -->  00:05:17,610
clusters so Democratic so all of this is the main plot
121

121

00:05:17,610  -->  00:05:19,120
that you always have to keep in mind.
122

122

00:05:19,120  -->  00:05:21,340
You've got the Democrat the Republican and Democratics
123

123

00:05:21,340  -->  00:05:25,490
so this is the Republics over here, Democrats over here,
124

124

00:05:25,490  -->  00:05:28,530
you can see that some Democrats voted no over here,
125

125

00:05:28,530  -->  00:05:30,270
but most Democrats voted yes,
126

126

00:05:30,270  -->  00:05:33,593
and then some even Republicans voted yes.
127

127

00:05:34,560  -->  00:05:37,700
Broadcast decency enforcement.
128

128

00:05:37,700  -->  00:05:40,990
Looks like there's a lot of consensus on this question.
129

129

00:05:40,990  -->  00:05:43,870
And like over here, you can see a bit of yellow
130

130

00:05:43,870  -->  00:05:45,710
so we'll get to this in a second.
131

131

00:05:45,710  -->  00:05:48,150
So basically, first of all, you can see a lot of red
132

132

00:05:48,150  -->  00:05:50,680
that means or red is a one meaning that
133

133

00:05:50,680  -->  00:05:51,890
a lot of people voted yes.
134

134

00:05:51,890  -->  00:05:54,710
And if you look at the splits, remember the split visually
135

135

00:05:54,710  -->  00:05:57,440
transitioned over here, you can see that it goes
136

136

00:05:57,440  -->  00:06:00,400
like around there goes over here, so
137

137

00:06:00,400  -->  00:06:03,210
all of the Republicans definitely be voted yes.
138

138

00:06:03,210  -->  00:06:05,300
Most of the Democrats voted yes.
139

139

00:06:05,300  -->  00:06:06,470
Some people voted no.
140

140

00:06:06,470  -->  00:06:08,660
So there's a couple of people over here.
141

141

00:06:08,660  -->  00:06:12,950
But generally speaking, most Democrats also voted yes.
142

142

00:06:12,950  -->  00:06:16,260
So why do we have these yellow nodes over here
143

143

00:06:16,260  -->  00:06:17,420
and over here?
144

144

00:06:17,420  -->  00:06:20,250
Well, the reason for this most likely,
145

145

00:06:20,250  -->  00:06:24,320
is that here we've got 15 by 15 nodes.
146

146

00:06:24,320  -->  00:06:28,920
So that means we have about 225 or so nodes
147

147

00:06:28,920  -->  00:06:31,020
in our self organizing map,
148

148

00:06:31,020  -->  00:06:35,260
whereas in the US Congress, you have over 500 Members.
149

149

00:06:35,260  -->  00:06:38,890
So meaning that the way this map has been overlaid
150

150

00:06:38,890  -->  00:06:41,770
over our data, is not a one to one relationship.
151

151

00:06:41,770  -->  00:06:44,780
They in every point they can be several Members of Congress
152

152

00:06:44,780  -->  00:06:46,120
represented within every node
153

153

00:06:46,120  -->  00:06:49,310
or some nodes might be one, some nodes might be more,
154

154

00:06:49,310  -->  00:06:52,510
it might be three people represented by every node.
155

155

00:06:52,510  -->  00:06:56,870
Maybe two and so, this yellow basically means that
156

156

00:06:56,870  -->  00:07:00,410
maybe overall there was everybody in this area was voting
157

157

00:07:00,410  -->  00:07:03,370
has a yes, but then there was like one or two people
158

158

00:07:03,370  -->  00:07:05,480
who voted no, and same thing over here,
159

159

00:07:05,480  -->  00:07:07,530
so that means there's kind of some sort of
160

160

00:07:07,530  -->  00:07:09,150
inconsistency there.
161

161

00:07:09,150  -->  00:07:11,870
All right, through this ridge,
162

162

00:07:11,870  -->  00:07:14,390
through this border that we have,
163

163

00:07:14,390  -->  00:07:17,750
you can see that most likely it was on the Democratic side.
164

164

00:07:17,750  -->  00:07:20,080
Class Action Fairness Act.
165

165

00:07:20,080  -->  00:07:23,220
So here Republicans mostly yes, Democrats no.
166

166

00:07:23,220  -->  00:07:26,180
Continuity in representation, something about that.
167

167

00:07:26,180  -->  00:07:28,210
So here you've got some here but also you can see
168

168

00:07:28,210  -->  00:07:31,120
a bit of inconsistency here as well.
169

169

00:07:31,120  -->  00:07:34,810
Personal Responsibility, Private Property Rights.
170

170

00:07:34,810  -->  00:07:37,520
Interesting stem cell research enhancement,
171

171

00:07:37,520  -->  00:07:39,340
look at this, it flipped over here,
172

172

00:07:39,340  -->  00:07:42,540
so usually Republicans on all these questions
173

173

00:07:42,540  -->  00:07:44,830
that maybe the questions were picked out in such a way,
174

174

00:07:44,830  -->  00:07:47,450
but usually in all of these questions,
175

175

00:07:47,450  -->  00:07:49,490
Republicans were voting yes
176

176

00:07:49,490  -->  00:07:53,310
and Democrats were either voting yes or sometimes no,
177

177

00:07:53,310  -->  00:07:54,510
but here is other way around,
178

178

00:07:54,510  -->  00:07:58,960
so here you've got the Democrats voting yes.
179

179

00:07:58,960  -->  00:08:00,710
And then you've got Republicans,
180

180

00:08:00,710  -->  00:08:02,420
some of the Republicans voting no.
181

181

00:08:02,420  -->  00:08:04,560
So again remember this a split
182

182

00:08:04,560  -->  00:08:07,580
well remember the split and clusters
183

183

00:08:07,580  -->  00:08:12,580
again this is most of the in like this is very similar
184

184

00:08:13,020  -->  00:08:15,250
to this why are we using this main class,
185

185

00:08:15,250  -->  00:08:19,750
we probably not the best way to say Democrats Republicans
186

186

00:08:19,750  -->  00:08:21,930
because actual split is like this,
187

187

00:08:21,930  -->  00:08:23,680
is more like this and like this,
188

188

00:08:23,680  -->  00:08:26,130
but at the same time, we can see that these are similar.
189

189

00:08:26,130  -->  00:08:28,870
So that's why we've been saying Republicans Democrats,
190

190

00:08:28,870  -->  00:08:31,690
even though the splits like this in reality,
191

191

00:08:31,690  -->  00:08:36,280
but in the best way to say it is cluster A, cluster B,
192

192

00:08:36,280  -->  00:08:38,080
or red cluster, blue cluster.
193

193

00:08:38,080  -->  00:08:40,508
So, you know, in this case, the red cluster,
194

194

00:08:40,508  -->  00:08:43,580
they had a bit of some people voting no,
195

195

00:08:43,580  -->  00:08:45,230
some people voting no, some people voting yes.
196

196

00:08:45,230  -->  00:08:48,440
And the blue cluster had a lot of people voting yes,
197

197

00:08:48,440  -->  00:08:49,920
most of the people voting yes so,
198

198

00:08:49,920  -->  00:08:52,582
cluster one and closer two, so or called left cluster,
199

199

00:08:52,582  -->  00:08:55,480
right cluster and that's what you're normally going to
200

200

00:08:55,480  -->  00:08:56,930
have your datas, but in our case,
201

201

00:08:56,930  -->  00:08:58,318
because we can see that the clusters
202

202

00:08:58,318  -->  00:09:01,620
and the split between parties is so similar,
203

203

00:09:01,620  -->  00:09:05,520
it is a subdivision or it's a good enough approximation
204

204

00:09:05,520  -->  00:09:08,670
to call these cluster Republicans and Democrats,
205

205

00:09:08,670  -->  00:09:10,360
even though that's not how the cluster organize
206

206

00:09:10,360  -->  00:09:13,460
these clusters are identified by the self organizing map,
207

207

00:09:13,460  -->  00:09:17,720
and it, it doesn't just blatantly use a Republican Democrat
208

208

00:09:17,720  -->  00:09:20,645
identify these clusters, it uses all of this information,
209

209

00:09:20,645  -->  00:09:24,080
all of the voting results to identify these clusters,
210

210

00:09:24,080  -->  00:09:26,790
all the information that it has access to.
211

211

00:09:26,790  -->  00:09:28,960
Tax relief, extension, and so on.
212

212

00:09:28,960  -->  00:09:31,210
So you can go through these on your own,
213

213

00:09:31,210  -->  00:09:33,910
just to practice and see how this works.
214

214

00:09:33,910  -->  00:09:37,530
And while we're on this point, what I wanted also to mention
215

215

00:09:37,530  -->  00:09:42,110
is that, because of the simplicity of self organizing maps,
216

216

00:09:42,110  -->  00:09:45,850
you will find that there are lots and lots of different
217

217

00:09:45,850  -->  00:09:49,230
versions and variations of implementations
218

218

00:09:49,230  -->  00:09:50,270
of self organizing map.
219

219

00:09:50,270  -->  00:09:51,690
So let's have a look at this.
220

220

00:09:51,690  -->  00:09:54,810
So let's kind of zoom out of that one.
221

221

00:09:54,810  -->  00:09:57,340
And that's one example from Wikipedia.
222

222

00:09:57,340  -->  00:09:59,090
That's, that's available there.
223

223

00:09:59,090  -->  00:10:01,360
Here's another example from another website,
224

224

00:10:01,360  -->  00:10:04,140
and the sources are outlined at the bottom
225

225

00:10:04,140  -->  00:10:05,840
in order of appearance.
226

226

00:10:05,840  -->  00:10:07,410
So this one is from R-bloggers,
227

227

00:10:07,410  -->  00:10:09,590
so you can create a self organizing map in R
228

228

00:10:09,590  -->  00:10:11,009
which will look like this.
229

229

00:10:11,009  -->  00:10:13,910
This is a self organizing map which we'll use in this
230

230

00:10:13,910  -->  00:10:17,172
course, and the source we'll identify the source
231

231

00:10:17,172  -->  00:10:19,700
when we're going through that through the tutorials
232

232

00:10:19,700  -->  00:10:21,810
in the practical side of the course.
233

233

00:10:21,810  -->  00:10:25,510
Here's a self organizing map from Stack Overflow.
234

234

00:10:25,510  -->  00:10:29,160
Here's a self organizing map from Discovery which is a great
235

235

00:10:29,160  -->  00:10:32,480
tool specifically designed to create self organizing maps.
236

236

00:10:32,480  -->  00:10:35,960
Here's the self organizing map from a Visual Cinnamon
237

237

00:10:35,960  -->  00:10:38,090
and the website, the blog.
238

238

00:10:38,090  -->  00:10:39,850
And so here you can actually see those lines
239

239

00:10:39,850  -->  00:10:40,780
which I was talking about,
240

240

00:10:40,780  -->  00:10:43,050
these highlights and identify the clusters
241

241

00:10:43,050  -->  00:10:46,850
and then as you go through those separate features of your
242

242

00:10:46,850  -->  00:10:49,760
visualization or of features of your data set,
243

243

00:10:49,760  -->  00:10:52,540
you still keep these clusters in mind.
244

244

00:10:52,540  -->  00:10:53,670
But then you go through the features
245

245

00:10:53,670  -->  00:10:54,940
and actually same thing over here.
246

246

00:10:54,940  -->  00:10:56,820
So you can see these are the clusters that have been
247

247

00:10:56,820  -->  00:11:00,180
identified and then you have separate maps
248

248

00:11:00,180  -->  00:11:01,670
for each one of your features,
249

249

00:11:01,670  -->  00:11:04,370
it's showing you that's what we were doing there
250

250

00:11:04,370  -->  00:11:07,000
we were practicing reading the software using map.
251

251

00:11:07,000  -->  00:11:10,270
And actually on this one I wanted to reference that because
252

252

00:11:10,270  -->  00:11:13,150
it's actually quite a cool representation.
253

253

00:11:13,150  -->  00:11:18,150
This one is coded in D3.js, so it's a Java JavaScript
254

254

00:11:18,890  -->  00:11:22,010
library D3, really cool, cool library I've played
255

255

00:11:22,010  -->  00:11:26,000
around with D3 myself and very interesting.
256

256

00:11:26,000  -->  00:11:27,890
So this is not Java, this is JavaScript,
257

257

00:11:27,890  -->  00:11:30,760
this is the web based programming language.
258

258

00:11:30,760  -->  00:11:33,700
So you can actually program in it and in a text editor
259

259

00:11:33,700  -->  00:11:35,410
and then run it in your browser.
260

260

00:11:35,410  -->  00:11:37,810
And I wanted to show you this because it's a cool,
261

261

00:11:37,810  -->  00:11:41,530
great implementation and at the same time, well,
262

262

00:11:41,530  -->  00:11:44,143
let's look at it for first where did I put it,
263

263

00:11:45,080  -->  00:11:46,460
there is Visual Cinnamon.
264

264

00:11:46,460  -->  00:11:49,470
So if you scroll down here, this is the link
265

265

00:11:49,470  -->  00:11:50,880
that was referenced over there
266

266

00:11:50,880  -->  00:11:52,920
and you can get it from the course materials.
267

267

00:11:52,920  -->  00:11:54,940
So if you scroll down here.
268

268

00:11:54,940  -->  00:11:59,940
So this is by Nadieh Bremer from Netherlands Amsterdam
269

269

00:12:00,916  -->  00:12:04,890
and she was kind enough to actually explain how she created
270

270

00:12:04,890  -->  00:12:07,270
this visualization and all the hexagons
271

271

00:12:07,270  -->  00:12:09,060
and you've got the codes here.
272

272

00:12:09,060  -->  00:12:10,740
And if you've done any web coding,
273

273

00:12:10,740  -->  00:12:13,260
then you'll find this pretty straightforward.
274

274

00:12:13,260  -->  00:12:16,480
It's very interesting library to look into d3.js,
275

275

00:12:16,480  -->  00:12:19,951
very beautiful things can be created with it.
276

276

00:12:19,951  -->  00:12:22,120
So there's an example.
277

277

00:12:22,120  -->  00:12:23,970
So again, you can see this is a good example
278

278

00:12:23,970  -->  00:12:26,700
that you can see that you've got
279

279

00:12:26,700  -->  00:12:30,010
the clusters identified with the borders,
280

280

00:12:30,010  -->  00:12:31,500
with the black borders,
281

281

00:12:31,500  -->  00:12:34,380
and then you've got the different images
282

282

00:12:34,380  -->  00:12:37,230
or different features displayed in the background.
283

283

00:12:37,230  -->  00:12:39,300
So here you've got one, here you got another one
284

284

00:12:39,300  -->  00:12:42,000
or in different conditions so you can see that
285

285

00:12:42,000  -->  00:12:44,090
she's changing, she's in this case she's just changing
286

286

00:12:44,090  -->  00:12:46,700
the color range, but that's what it would look like
287

287

00:12:46,700  -->  00:12:49,100
if you're looking at different features as well
288

288

00:12:49,100  -->  00:12:52,920
and where you can get is you can get the actual code
289

289

00:12:54,515  -->  00:12:57,180
on bl.ocks.org
290

290

00:12:57,180  -->  00:13:00,330
and so you can actually get the code for this here
291

291

00:13:00,330  -->  00:13:03,670
if you wanna code in D3.
292

292

00:13:03,670  -->  00:13:05,360
And by the way, if you're while you're here,
293

293

00:13:05,360  -->  00:13:10,040
you should definitely have a look at popular stuff
294

294

00:13:10,040  -->  00:13:11,120
on bl.ocks.org.
295

295

00:13:11,120  -->  00:13:14,820
So all of these visualizations are done in d3.js,
296

296

00:13:14,820  -->  00:13:17,820
a really powerful language for programming things.
297

297

00:13:17,820  -->  00:13:19,010
And a lot of them are interactive.
298

298

00:13:19,010  -->  00:13:21,300
So if you're here, definitely check it out.
299

299

00:13:21,300  -->  00:13:24,630
But other than that, this is an implementation in
300

300

00:13:24,630  -->  00:13:28,040
JavaScript, and the thing about self organizing maps
301

301

00:13:28,040  -->  00:13:31,520
are so simple compared to all other neural networks
302

302

00:13:31,520  -->  00:13:35,740
that you will find implementations as we just saw in
303

303

00:13:35,740  -->  00:13:39,050
R, in Python, in JavaScript, in Java.
304

304

00:13:39,050  -->  00:13:42,683
You can pretty much code this yourself in any language.
305

305

00:13:42,683  -->  00:13:44,530
It's not that difficult.
306

306

00:13:44,530  -->  00:13:47,020
Just in this case using hexagons, you can use circles,
307

307

00:13:47,020  -->  00:13:49,540
you can use squares, you can use whatever you like
308

308

00:13:49,540  -->  00:13:51,610
the mathematics behind it is so simple
309

309

00:13:51,610  -->  00:13:55,390
that it is very straightforward to implement
310

310

00:13:55,390  -->  00:13:56,610
in any language.
311

311

00:13:56,610  -->  00:13:58,960
So if you have a preferred language yourself,
312

312

00:13:58,960  -->  00:14:00,600
that you're comfortable with,
313

313

00:14:00,600  -->  00:14:04,350
that you're used to programming in,
314

314

00:14:04,350  -->  00:14:06,380
then this could be a good challenge for you
315

315

00:14:06,380  -->  00:14:09,150
to implement self organizing maps in that language
316

316

00:14:09,150  -->  00:14:11,670
or at least find a library online somewhere
317

317

00:14:11,670  -->  00:14:14,820
that already has some starring elements
318

318

00:14:14,820  -->  00:14:17,370
or has that that core of SOMs for you
319

319

00:14:17,370  -->  00:14:18,910
and explore it further.
320

320

00:14:18,910  -->  00:14:19,743
So there we go.
321

321

00:14:19,743  -->  00:14:21,180
I hope you enjoyed today's tutorial
322

322

00:14:21,180  -->  00:14:24,130
and I look forward to seeing you next time.
323

323

00:14:24,130  -->  00:14:25,973
Until then, enjoy deep learning.
