00:00:00,720  -->  00:00:01,553
<v Instructor>Hello and welcome back</v>
2

2

00:00:01,553  -->  00:00:03,100
to the course on deep Learning.
3

3

00:00:03,100  -->  00:00:05,500
Today we're starting a brand new deep Learning
4

4

00:00:05,500  -->  00:00:07,250
model; the Boltzmann Machine.
5

5

00:00:07,250  -->  00:00:09,620
And it's going to be a very exciting section.
6

6

00:00:09,620  -->  00:00:11,120
For one reason at least.
7

7

00:00:11,120  -->  00:00:12,930
The fact that a lot of this information
8

8

00:00:12,930  -->  00:00:15,960
is not that easily available online.
9

9

00:00:15,960  -->  00:00:19,230
You can't just find lots and lots of tutorials.
10

10

00:00:19,230  -->  00:00:21,440
This is very advanced stuff,
11

11

00:00:21,440  -->  00:00:24,670
and simplified intuitive tutorials
12

12

00:00:24,670  -->  00:00:26,210
are just not that readily available.
13

13

00:00:26,210  -->  00:00:28,860
So we're very excited to bring you these
14

14

00:00:28,860  -->  00:00:31,790
and help you get ahead in the space
15

15

00:00:31,790  -->  00:00:34,040
of deep Learning and advancing your skills.
16

16

00:00:34,040  -->  00:00:35,660
So let's get started.
17

17

00:00:35,660  -->  00:00:38,350
So here we've got a list of items
18

18

00:00:38,350  -->  00:00:39,390
that we will discuss.
19

19

00:00:39,390  -->  00:00:41,340
List of models, deep Learning models
20

20

00:00:41,340  -->  00:00:42,500
which we've already looked into
21

21

00:00:42,500  -->  00:00:43,333
in this course.
22

22

00:00:43,333  -->  00:00:45,270
We've talked about artificial neural networks,
23

23

00:00:45,270  -->  00:00:46,700
convolutional neural networks
24

24

00:00:46,700  -->  00:00:48,380
and recurrent neural networks
25

25

00:00:48,380  -->  00:00:50,580
and that's summarized this supervised side
26

26

00:00:50,580  -->  00:00:51,700
of deep Learning.
27

27

00:00:51,700  -->  00:00:54,640
Then we also spoke about self organizing maps,
28

28

00:00:54,640  -->  00:00:56,910
which was our first step into unsupervised
29

29

00:00:56,910  -->  00:00:57,890
deep Learning.
30

30

00:00:57,890  -->  00:00:59,640
And today we're talking about Boltzmann machines.
31

31

00:00:59,640  -->  00:01:02,870
So let's have a look at all of these
32

32

00:01:02,870  -->  00:01:05,050
in a diagrammatical representation.
33

33

00:01:05,050  -->  00:01:07,430
So here we've got an artificial neural network.
34

34

00:01:07,430  -->  00:01:09,090
With the input layer,
35

35

00:01:09,090  -->  00:01:11,710
possibly multiple hidden layers and an output layer.
36

36

00:01:11,710  -->  00:01:13,590
And then we've got a convolutional neural network
37

37

00:01:13,590  -->  00:01:16,170
with the convolution layer,
38

38

00:01:16,170  -->  00:01:17,740
the pooling layer,
39

39

00:01:17,740  -->  00:01:19,050
the flattening layer
40

40

00:01:19,050  -->  00:01:21,900
and then an ANN sitting on the end.
41

41

00:01:21,900  -->  00:01:24,640
Then we've got the recurrent neural network where
42

42

00:01:24,640  -->  00:01:27,770
the hidden layer feeds back into itself,
43

43

00:01:27,770  -->  00:01:32,050
and therefore facilitates analysis of temporal data
44

44

00:01:32,050  -->  00:01:35,788
and finally we've got the self organizing map,
45

45

00:01:35,788  -->  00:01:38,500
which helps you reduce your dimensionality
46

46

00:01:38,500  -->  00:01:40,110
and represents something,
47

47

00:01:40,110  -->  00:01:43,130
it represents your data in a more understandable way.
48

48

00:01:43,130  -->  00:01:47,160
So, even though the self organizing map is a
49

49

00:01:47,160  -->  00:01:50,570
unsupervised type of deep learning model,
50

50

00:01:50,570  -->  00:01:53,550
there is something that unites all of these four together,
51

51

00:01:53,550  -->  00:01:56,420
and that is that all these four are actually directed models
52

52

00:01:56,420  -->  00:02:00,910
so there is a direction in which the model operates.
53

53

00:02:00,910  -->  00:02:03,510
As you can see these arrows are in the case of a sum.
54

54

00:02:03,510  -->  00:02:07,760
You've got the data and then the data connects,
55

55

00:02:07,760  -->  00:02:09,560
the information from the data goes to the nodes
56

56

00:02:09,560  -->  00:02:12,310
on your map, on your output map.
57

57

00:02:12,310  -->  00:02:14,770
So there's always a direction in them,
58

58

00:02:14,770  -->  00:02:18,200
and that is where Boltzmann machines really stand out.
59

59

00:02:18,200  -->  00:02:20,590
Boltzmann machines are undirected models.
60

60

00:02:20,590  -->  00:02:21,750
They don't have a direction,
61

61

00:02:21,750  -->  00:02:23,530
so you can see that there are connections here
62

62

00:02:23,530  -->  00:02:26,630
but there are actually no arrows in these connections,
63

63

00:02:26,630  -->  00:02:29,840
all these connections go both ways.
64

64

00:02:29,840  -->  00:02:34,840
So that is a very very fundamental and fascinating
65

65

00:02:35,150  -->  00:02:36,420
thing about Boltzmann machines
66

66

00:02:36,420  -->  00:02:39,040
and that is going to radically change
67

67

00:02:39,040  -->  00:02:41,840
how we're going to be talking about them
68

68

00:02:41,840  -->  00:02:43,410
compared to other models.
69

69

00:02:43,410  -->  00:02:44,840
So, I hope you're excited about this.
70

70

00:02:44,840  -->  00:02:48,499
Lets have a look a bit closer at a Boltzmann machine
71

71

00:02:48,499  -->  00:02:50,560
and understand what's going on.
72

72

00:02:50,560  -->  00:02:52,350
So heres a Boltzmann machine,
73

73

00:02:52,350  -->  00:02:55,260
and right away you can see that we've got hidden nodes
74

74

00:02:55,260  -->  00:02:57,970
in red and we've got visible nodes here in blue,
75

75

00:02:57,970  -->  00:03:00,990
and by the way we specifically used other colors here
76

76

00:03:00,990  -->  00:03:04,610
simply because we wanted to help you
77

77

00:03:04,610  -->  00:03:07,300
visually remember that these models,
78

78

00:03:07,300  -->  00:03:08,133
the Boltzmann machines,
79

79

00:03:08,133  -->  00:03:10,190
are different to other models so.
80

80

00:03:10,190  -->  00:03:11,860
Hence a bit different colors
81

81

00:03:11,860  -->  00:03:13,900
than what you're used to probably.
82

82

00:03:13,900  -->  00:03:17,970
So here, we've got the visible nodes at the bottom, three,
83

83

00:03:17,970  -->  00:03:19,730
and we've got seven hidden nodes
84

84

00:03:19,730  -->  00:03:22,360
just for simplicity's sake and
85

85

00:03:22,360  -->  00:03:24,200
the thing here you'll notice,
86

86

00:03:24,200  -->  00:03:25,770
probably the first thing that stands out
87

87

00:03:25,770  -->  00:03:28,500
in comparison to other neural networks,
88

88

00:03:28,500  -->  00:03:29,900
which we already talked about,
89

89

00:03:29,900  -->  00:03:33,820
this model doesn't have an output layer right?
90

90

00:03:33,820  -->  00:03:35,200
So there's an input layer,
91

91

00:03:35,200  -->  00:03:36,960
there's a hidden layer,
92

92

00:03:36,960  -->  00:03:39,290
and there's no output layer.
93

93

00:03:39,290  -->  00:03:41,800
That's number one, probably the biggest thing right.
94

94

00:03:41,800  -->  00:03:43,540
Why would you even have a neural network
95

95

00:03:43,540  -->  00:03:45,300
if there's no output layer.
96

96

00:03:45,300  -->  00:03:46,990
The second thing is that of course everything
97

97

00:03:46,990  -->  00:03:47,840
is connected to everything,
98

98

00:03:47,840  -->  00:03:50,330
there's no specific layering per say.
99

99

00:03:50,330  -->  00:03:53,020
Everything is just hyper connected to everything,
100

100

00:03:53,020  -->  00:03:54,620
and number three, as we said,
101

101

00:03:54,620  -->  00:03:57,900
there is no direction in these connections.
102

102

00:03:57,900  -->  00:04:00,400
They're all bi-directional so they,
103

103

00:04:00,400  -->  00:04:02,340
the connection happens both ways.
104

104

00:04:02,340  -->  00:04:05,490
So those three things really make Boltzmann machines
105

105

00:04:05,490  -->  00:04:08,320
look different and a bit weird compared to
106

106

00:04:08,320  -->  00:04:10,430
everything else we've discussed before,
107

107

00:04:10,430  -->  00:04:14,080
and so how do we go about understanding Boltzmann machines.
108

108

00:04:14,080  -->  00:04:15,920
I just wanted also to point out that
109

109

00:04:15,920  -->  00:04:18,660
in a lot of the tutorials that you'll find online,
110

110

00:04:18,660  -->  00:04:22,140
they often jump straight to restricted Boltzmann machines,
111

111

00:04:22,140  -->  00:04:24,420
so RBM's because they're simpler,
112

112

00:04:24,420  -->  00:04:25,710
they're more practical,
113

113

00:04:25,710  -->  00:04:27,560
they're actually used in practice
114

114

00:04:27,560  -->  00:04:29,510
rather than Boltzmann machines which are more with
115

115

00:04:29,510  -->  00:04:30,620
theoretical things,
116

116

00:04:30,620  -->  00:04:34,080
but personally for me understanding Boltzmann machines
117

117

00:04:34,080  -->  00:04:37,410
was the key to understanding everything else
118

118

00:04:37,410  -->  00:04:39,250
that we're going to be discussing in this section.
119

119

00:04:39,250  -->  00:04:41,010
As soon as you understand Boltzmann machines
120

120

00:04:41,010  -->  00:04:42,450
and you're getting your head around them,
121

121

00:04:42,450  -->  00:04:44,990
everything else just falls into place
122

122

00:04:44,990  -->  00:04:47,630
and it's kind of a shame that usually people
123

123

00:04:47,630  -->  00:04:50,880
miss out on this, but we wanted to make sure that
124

124

00:04:50,880  -->  00:04:53,000
we're going to cover this off and
125

125

00:04:53,000  -->  00:04:55,070
my goal to that by the end of this tutorial
126

126

00:04:55,070  -->  00:04:57,400
you're going to walk away understanding
127

127

00:04:57,400  -->  00:04:59,710
the intuition behind Boltzmann machines
128

128

00:04:59,710  -->  00:05:01,440
and exactly what's going on.
129

129

00:05:01,440  -->  00:05:03,420
So, let's dive straight into it.
130

130

00:05:03,420  -->  00:05:06,950
How do we understand these Boltzmann machines?
131

131

00:05:06,950  -->  00:05:07,783
So where do we start,
132

132

00:05:07,783  -->  00:05:10,410
do we start with the lack of the output layer,
133

133

00:05:10,410  -->  00:05:13,370
do we start with the hyper connectivity,
134

134

00:05:13,370  -->  00:05:15,690
or do we start with the bi-direction?
135

135

00:05:15,690  -->  00:05:17,120
Well actually none of those.
136

136

00:05:17,120  -->  00:05:20,053
We're going to start by looking at one little tip
137

137

00:05:20,053  -->  00:05:21,440
that I'm going to give you,
138

138

00:05:21,440  -->  00:05:23,650
that really helped me understand everything
139

139

00:05:23,650  -->  00:05:25,060
and made it click for me
140

140

00:05:25,060  -->  00:05:28,750
and that little tip is, look at the visible nodes.
141

141

00:05:28,750  -->  00:05:30,580
Right, look at these visible nodes
142

142

00:05:30,580  -->  00:05:33,360
and you can see that they are all connected
143

143

00:05:33,360  -->  00:05:34,550
between each other,
144

144

00:05:34,550  -->  00:05:36,120
and when I saw that
145

145

00:05:36,120  -->  00:05:38,380
I was trying to understand from myself
146

146

00:05:38,380  -->  00:05:39,730
why are they connected?
147

147

00:05:39,730  -->  00:05:43,460
What's the point of connecting visible nodes?
148

148

00:05:43,460  -->  00:05:45,036
Once you input data,
149

149

00:05:45,036  -->  00:05:46,740
it's fixed, right?
150

150

00:05:46,740  -->  00:05:51,120
You have a row of data and you just input it and
151

151

00:05:51,120  -->  00:05:53,610
there's no point in these connections
152

152

00:05:53,610  -->  00:05:54,850
between these visible nodes,
153

153

00:05:54,850  -->  00:05:57,470
you're not going to be adjusting the weights or training,
154

154

00:05:57,470  -->  00:06:00,040
because that data is fixed. It's a given.
155

155

00:06:00,040  -->  00:06:03,270
Well, that is where the flaw lies.
156

156

00:06:03,270  -->  00:06:05,380
That's where the assumption isn't correct.
157

157

00:06:05,380  -->  00:06:08,360
Boltzmann machines are different,
158

158

00:06:08,360  -->  00:06:12,590
are fundamentally different to all other algorithms
159

159

00:06:12,590  -->  00:06:17,460
and for them they don't just expect input data.
160

160

00:06:17,460  -->  00:06:20,010
What they do is they generate data.
161

161

00:06:20,010  -->  00:06:23,100
They generate information in all of these nodes,
162

162

00:06:23,100  -->  00:06:25,350
regardless of whether there's and input node
163

163

00:06:25,350  -->  00:06:26,550
or a hidden node.
164

164

00:06:26,550  -->  00:06:29,100
For a Boltzmann machine all of these nodes are the same.
165

165

00:06:29,100  -->  00:06:32,340
It doesn't distinguish or doesn't discriminate
166

166

00:06:32,340  -->  00:06:33,890
between these nodes, and these nodes.
167

167

00:06:33,890  -->  00:06:35,050
That's just for us.
168

168

00:06:35,050  -->  00:06:37,620
For a Boltzmann machine this whole thing
169

169

00:06:37,620  -->  00:06:40,530
is working with it's a system,
170

170

00:06:40,530  -->  00:06:44,900
it's generating states of this system,
171

171

00:06:44,900  -->  00:06:46,970
and the best way to think about it is
172

172

00:06:46,970  -->  00:06:50,040
through an example that Geoffrey Hinton once gave
173

173

00:06:50,040  -->  00:06:52,830
of a nuclear power plant.
174

174

00:06:52,830  -->  00:06:55,650
So here we've got a diagram of a nuclear power plant,
175

175

00:06:55,650  -->  00:06:58,820
and as you can see it's quite a simplified diagram
176

176

00:06:58,820  -->  00:07:01,050
and normally there's lots and lots more
177

177

00:07:01,050  -->  00:07:03,130
moving parts to this facility
178

178

00:07:03,130  -->  00:07:04,640
but at the same time,
179

179

00:07:04,640  -->  00:07:06,940
we can already see that there's a lot going on.
180

180

00:07:06,940  -->  00:07:09,610
Let's say that there are certain things that we can measure
181

181

00:07:09,610  -->  00:07:11,700
and we do measure about the nuclear power plant,
182

182

00:07:11,700  -->  00:07:14,300
about the status of the nuclear power plant.
183

183

00:07:14,300  -->  00:07:16,500
So for instance, and important parameter that
184

184

00:07:16,500  -->  00:07:18,580
we should be measuring is the
185

185

00:07:18,580  -->  00:07:20,603
temperature inside the containment unit.
186

186

00:07:21,460  -->  00:07:22,710
Then, for example,
187

187

00:07:22,710  -->  00:07:26,530
we could be measuring how quickly this turbine is spinning.
188

188

00:07:26,530  -->  00:07:28,210
Another thing we could be measuring, for instance,
189

189

00:07:28,210  -->  00:07:32,610
not as important but still crucial to the operation of the
190

190

00:07:32,610  -->  00:07:36,040
power plant is, for instance, the pressure inside this pump.
191

191

00:07:36,040  -->  00:07:37,500
Because, if it's too high or it's too low
192

192

00:07:37,500  -->  00:07:39,430
that could mean a problem.
193

193

00:07:39,430  -->  00:07:40,560
Then we could be measuring how much
194

194

00:07:40,560  -->  00:07:41,570
electricity it is outputting.
195

195

00:07:41,570  -->  00:07:44,460
So lot's of different things that we're measuring about
196

196

00:07:44,460  -->  00:07:45,440
the power plant,
197

197

00:07:45,440  -->  00:07:47,210
but at the same time there could be a lot of
198

198

00:07:47,210  -->  00:07:48,400
odd things that we're not measuring.
199

199

00:07:48,400  -->  00:07:50,860
For example, the speed of the wind.
200

200

00:07:50,860  -->  00:07:52,940
Or even if we are measuring the speed of the wind,
201

201

00:07:52,940  -->  00:07:56,060
we might not be measuring the moisture of the soil
202

202

00:07:56,060  -->  00:07:59,270
in this specific location, or this specific location.
203

203

00:07:59,270  -->  00:08:01,610
Or we might not be measuring the
204

204

00:08:01,610  -->  00:08:04,600
thickness of the cooling tower wall
205

205

00:08:04,600  -->  00:08:09,390
at a height 20 meters at this specific
206

206

00:08:09,390  -->  00:08:10,720
radial location.
207

207

00:08:10,720  -->  00:08:12,440
So there can be lots of different parameters
208

208

00:08:12,440  -->  00:08:14,860
of the nuclear power plant that we're not measuring,
209

209

00:08:14,860  -->  00:08:17,820
but at the same time all these parameters all together,
210

210

00:08:17,820  -->  00:08:22,310
they all form one system and they all work together,
211

211

00:08:22,310  -->  00:08:25,030
and that is what the Boltzmann machine represents.
212

212

00:08:25,030  -->  00:08:28,370
The Boltzmann machine is a representation
213

213

00:08:28,370  -->  00:08:29,220
of a certain system.
214

214

00:08:29,220  -->  00:08:31,170
In our case, a nuclear power plant,
215

215

00:08:31,170  -->  00:08:33,090
and the visible nodes are just merely things
216

216

00:08:33,090  -->  00:08:34,700
that we can and do measure,
217

217

00:08:34,700  -->  00:08:35,960
and the hidden nodes are things
218

218

00:08:35,960  -->  00:08:38,163
that we can't or don't measure.
219

219

00:08:39,270  -->  00:08:43,140
The way this whole model works is that,
220

220

00:08:43,140  -->  00:08:45,880
instead of just waiting for us to input values
221

221

00:08:45,880  -->  00:08:47,920
for it to model the states,
222

222

00:08:47,920  -->  00:08:50,650
what it does is the Boltzmann machine is capable
223

223

00:08:50,650  -->  00:08:53,310
of generating all of the values.
224

224

00:08:53,310  -->  00:08:55,280
All of the nodes, on it's own.
225

225

00:08:55,280  -->  00:08:58,080
It doesn't need any inputs it just generates
226

226

00:08:58,080  -->  00:09:00,650
parameters on its own and for,
227

227

00:09:00,650  -->  00:09:02,580
in our case what does that mean?
228

228

00:09:02,580  -->  00:09:05,270
It just generates different states of our system
229

229

00:09:05,270  -->  00:09:08,200
It looks at a state where temperature is
230

230

00:09:08,200  -->  00:09:09,800
a certain temperature,
231

231

00:09:09,800  -->  00:09:12,380
the speed of the wind is a certain speed of the wind,
232

232

00:09:12,380  -->  00:09:14,650
and the moisture or the pressure in the pump
233

233

00:09:14,650  -->  00:09:16,110
is a certain pressure in the pump.
234

234

00:09:16,110  -->  00:09:17,580
So basically it looks at one state,
235

235

00:09:17,580  -->  00:09:18,560
and then it looks at another state
236

236

00:09:18,560  -->  00:09:21,510
and then it says, okay what if the temperatures higher,
237

237

00:09:21,510  -->  00:09:23,080
the wind is faster,
238

238

00:09:23,080  -->  00:09:24,530
the pressure in the pump is lower,
239

239

00:09:24,530  -->  00:09:27,230
the moisture of the earth is lower or higher
240

240

00:09:27,230  -->  00:09:28,063
it doesn't matter.
241

241

00:09:28,063  -->  00:09:30,410
So it just keeps generating all these different states,
242

242

00:09:30,410  -->  00:09:31,813
it's capable of doing that.
243

243

00:09:32,870  -->  00:09:34,670
That is how the Boltzmann machine works
244

244

00:09:34,670  -->  00:09:39,330
and that is the essence of why it's not a
245

245

00:09:39,330  -->  00:09:41,460
deterministic deep learning model,
246

246

00:09:41,460  -->  00:09:44,280
it's a stochastic deep learning model or also,
247

247

00:09:44,280  -->  00:09:45,680
a better way to call it is
248

248

00:09:45,680  -->  00:09:47,500
a generative deep learning model
249

249

00:09:47,500  -->  00:09:49,400
because it generates these states.
250

250

00:09:49,400  -->  00:09:50,420
So how does it learn?
251

251

00:09:50,420  -->  00:09:53,172
How does it learn on an intuitive level for us?
252

252

00:09:53,172  -->  00:09:55,680
How do we understand it on an intuitive level?
253

253

00:09:55,680  -->  00:09:58,039
Well, the way a Boltzmann machine works is
254

254

00:09:58,039  -->  00:10:00,690
we've got this system or this machine that
255

255

00:10:00,690  -->  00:10:04,270
describes our different states of our system.
256

256

00:10:04,270  -->  00:10:07,400
What we want, is we want to use our training data.
257

257

00:10:07,400  -->  00:10:09,840
The hundred, or thousand, or tens of thousands
258

258

00:10:09,840  -->  00:10:11,130
of rows that we have.
259

259

00:10:11,130  -->  00:10:15,600
We want to feed it into this Boltzmann machine as the inputs
260

260

00:10:15,600  -->  00:10:20,600
to help it adjust the weights of this system accordingly,
261

261

00:10:20,990  -->  00:10:24,390
so that it actually resembles our system.
262

262

00:10:24,390  -->  00:10:26,000
So it doesn't resemble any
263

263

00:10:26,000  -->  00:10:28,220
nuclear power plant in the world,
264

264

00:10:28,220  -->  00:10:30,920
any possible or impossible nuclear power plant,
265

265

00:10:30,920  -->  00:10:33,880
it actually learns from what we feed it in.
266

266

00:10:33,880  -->  00:10:38,020
It learns how, what are the possible connections
267

267

00:10:38,020  -->  00:10:40,070
between all of these parameters.
268

268

00:10:40,070  -->  00:10:42,213
How do they influence each other and therefore,
269

269

00:10:42,213  -->  00:10:46,310
it becomes a system, a machine that represents our system.
270

270

00:10:46,310  -->  00:10:49,487
It is specific to our nuclear power plant.
271

271

00:10:49,487  -->  00:10:51,450
So what's the benefit of that?
272

272

00:10:51,450  -->  00:10:52,360
Well the benefit of that is,
273

273

00:10:52,360  -->  00:10:54,350
once we've done the learning,
274

274

00:10:54,350  -->  00:10:55,890
once all of these weights are adjusted
275

275

00:10:55,890  -->  00:10:58,380
and the Boltzmann machine understands
276

276

00:10:58,380  -->  00:11:01,670
how all of these parameters interact with each other
277

277

00:11:01,670  -->  00:11:04,730
and how they, what kind of constraints should exist
278

278

00:11:04,730  -->  00:11:08,220
between them in order for this system to be
279

279

00:11:08,220  -->  00:11:09,970
the system that we're modeling.
280

280

00:11:09,970  -->  00:11:14,360
Once that's all done we can use the Boltzmann machine to,
281

281

00:11:14,360  -->  00:11:16,330
for example, in the case of a nuclear plant,
282

282

00:11:16,330  -->  00:11:18,723
to monitor our nuclear power plant.
283

283

00:11:18,723  -->  00:11:21,930
Because we've modeled it using good behavior,
284

284

00:11:21,930  -->  00:11:26,350
we've modeled it, behavior that hasn't led to any
285

285

00:11:26,350  -->  00:11:28,940
meltdown or any explosions,
286

286

00:11:28,940  -->  00:11:32,370
we know what is normal for the nuclear power plant.
287

287

00:11:32,370  -->  00:11:34,820
Then the Boltzmann machine will help us understand
288

288

00:11:34,820  -->  00:11:36,740
what is abnormal behavior.
289

289

00:11:36,740  -->  00:11:40,870
This is a great example of when unsupervised learning
290

290

00:11:40,870  -->  00:11:41,830
is the way to go.
291

291

00:11:41,830  -->  00:11:46,460
You cannot really model a nuclear meltdown
292

292

00:11:46,460  -->  00:11:48,250
through supervised learning
293

293

00:11:48,250  -->  00:11:49,730
because you'd have to have an example
294

294

00:11:49,730  -->  00:11:53,530
of a nuclear meltdown on that power plant,
295

295

00:11:53,530  -->  00:11:56,270
or multiple nuclear meltdowns across the world
296

296

00:11:56,270  -->  00:11:59,840
and you don't really have that luxury of
297

297

00:11:59,840  -->  00:12:01,640
having all of this training data
298

298

00:12:01,640  -->  00:12:03,110
with actual nuclear meltdowns.
299

299

00:12:03,110  -->  00:12:05,850
You have to model it in an unsupervised manor,
300

300

00:12:05,850  -->  00:12:09,092
and that's exactly what a Boltzmann machine does.
301

301

00:12:09,092  -->  00:12:10,330
Learning through good examples,
302

302

00:12:10,330  -->  00:12:14,500
it understands how the system works in it's normal state,
303

303

00:12:14,500  -->  00:12:18,130
in acceptable state and through that it helps us
304

304

00:12:18,130  -->  00:12:20,480
model what the system would look like,
305

305

00:12:20,480  -->  00:12:21,720
or what looks like,
306

306

00:12:21,720  -->  00:12:25,970
or what is an abnormal state and model those scenarios
307

307

00:12:25,970  -->  00:12:27,570
and recognize those scenarios,
308

308

00:12:27,570  -->  00:12:29,930
and therefore monitor the nuclear power plant.
309

309

00:12:29,930  -->  00:12:33,070
So that's just an example of a nuclear power plant.
310

310

00:12:33,070  -->  00:12:36,170
You can probably think of lots more examples
311

311

00:12:36,170  -->  00:12:39,670
when unsupervised learning would come in handy,
312

312

00:12:39,670  -->  00:12:41,755
as opposed to supervised learning.
313

313

00:12:41,755  -->  00:12:44,830
Hopefully that now explains the
314

314

00:12:44,830  -->  00:12:47,370
design of these Boltzmann machines that why,
315

315

00:12:47,370  -->  00:12:48,850
first of all, we don't have an output layer
316

316

00:12:48,850  -->  00:12:50,860
because we're not outputting any value.
317

317

00:12:50,860  -->  00:12:54,220
We are creating a model that describes our system.
318

318

00:12:54,220  -->  00:12:58,160
At the same time, why all of these nodes are interconnected
319

319

00:12:58,160  -->  00:13:02,350
because as we kind of could sense from the diagram,
320

320

00:13:02,350  -->  00:13:04,750
all of these parameters are possibly
321

321

00:13:04,750  -->  00:13:05,810
interconnected with each other.
322

322

00:13:05,810  -->  00:13:08,800
We cannot deprive the system of being able to
323

323

00:13:08,800  -->  00:13:11,010
connect the speed of the turbine with,
324

324

00:13:11,010  -->  00:13:14,410
for instance, the moisture in the air on that day.
325

325

00:13:14,410  -->  00:13:18,270
So, it will decide for itself if there's a connection
326

326

00:13:18,270  -->  00:13:19,550
and how strong that connection is.
327

327

00:13:19,550  -->  00:13:22,540
We have to give it the opportunity to connect everything
328

328

00:13:22,540  -->  00:13:25,810
and also, the directionality that the
329

329

00:13:25,810  -->  00:13:28,190
important thing to understand there is that
330

330

00:13:28,190  -->  00:13:31,420
for us, these are visible nodes and these are hidden nodes.
331

331

00:13:31,420  -->  00:13:34,120
For a Boltzmann machine, all of the nodes are equal.
332

332

00:13:34,120  -->  00:13:36,080
It does not discriminate between
333

333

00:13:36,080  -->  00:13:37,900
these nodes or these nodes.
334

334

00:13:37,900  -->  00:13:40,922
For a Boltzmann machine doesn't see these colors,
335

335

00:13:40,922  -->  00:13:42,270
all of these parameters are interconnected
336

336

00:13:42,270  -->  00:13:45,290
and therefore it had to be undirected.
337

337

00:13:45,290  -->  00:13:47,770
It cannot have just direction going one way because
338

338

00:13:47,770  -->  00:13:50,450
Boltzmann and machine does not understand what's invisible
339

339

00:13:50,450  -->  00:13:51,283
it's a hidden parameter.
340

340

00:13:51,283  -->  00:13:52,770
These are all parameters of the system
341

341

00:13:52,770  -->  00:13:53,920
for the Boltzmann machine
342

342

00:13:53,920  -->  00:13:55,540
and it has to be able to have
343

343

00:13:55,540  -->  00:13:57,760
all the connections going both ways.
344

344

00:13:57,760  -->  00:13:58,593
So there we go.
345

345

00:13:58,593  -->  00:14:00,920
That explains those three things about the Boltzmann machine
346

346

00:14:00,920  -->  00:14:04,470
that are so different to the standard neural networks
347

347

00:14:04,470  -->  00:14:07,190
that we've, we're used to working with now
348

348

00:14:07,190  -->  00:14:10,580
and hopefully this gives you an intuitive understanding
349

349

00:14:10,580  -->  00:14:13,490
of how Boltzmann machines work and
350

350

00:14:13,490  -->  00:14:14,870
what exactly they do.
351

351

00:14:14,870  -->  00:14:16,500
In the further tutorials in this section,
352

352

00:14:16,500  -->  00:14:18,940
we will dive deeper into Boltzmann machines.
353

353

00:14:18,940  -->  00:14:20,140
Can't wait to see you next time
354

354

00:14:20,140  -->  00:14:21,940
and until then, enjoy deep learning.
