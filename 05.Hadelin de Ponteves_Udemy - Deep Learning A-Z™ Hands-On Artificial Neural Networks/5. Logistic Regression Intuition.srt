00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:01,910
<v Narrator>All right, let's do this.</v>
2

2

00:00:01,910  -->  00:00:04,290
Logistic regression intuition.
3

3

00:00:04,290  -->  00:00:06,010
And you can probably already tell by my voice
4

4

00:00:06,010  -->  00:00:07,360
that I'm pretty excited.
5

5

00:00:07,360  -->  00:00:09,390
There's some very interesting slides coming up
6

6

00:00:09,390  -->  00:00:11,780
and this is quite an important topic,
7

7

00:00:11,780  -->  00:00:14,280
but at the same time it is quite challenging.
8

8

00:00:14,280  -->  00:00:15,113
So a quick heads-up,
9

9

00:00:15,113  -->  00:00:18,510
there will be some math and I've done a few
10

10

00:00:18,510  -->  00:00:20,659
run-throughs of this presentation already
11

11

00:00:20,659  -->  00:00:22,770
and I really,
12

12

00:00:22,770  -->  00:00:24,900
I will try my best to convey everything
13

13

00:00:24,900  -->  00:00:26,670
in the simplest way possible.
14

14

00:00:26,670  -->  00:00:27,803
So let's get into it.
15

15

00:00:28,740  -->  00:00:30,870
We already know about the linear regression.
16

16

00:00:30,870  -->  00:00:32,870
We know that there's a simple linear regression
17

17

00:00:32,870  -->  00:00:34,850
and it has this very short formula
18

18

00:00:34,850  -->  00:00:36,430
of one independent variable.
19

19

00:00:36,430  -->  00:00:37,870
And we also have looked
20

20

00:00:37,870  -->  00:00:40,090
into the multiple linear regression
21

21

00:00:40,090  -->  00:00:42,560
which has many independent variables.
22

22

00:00:42,560  -->  00:00:45,112
So we already know how to deal
23

23

00:00:45,112  -->  00:00:48,200
with this type of challenge.
24

24

00:00:48,200  -->  00:00:50,150
So when we have a scale put like that
25

25

00:00:50,150  -->  00:00:51,900
where on the horizontal axis
26

26

00:00:51,900  -->  00:00:53,460
we've got the independent variable
27

27

00:00:53,460  -->  00:00:55,900
on the vertical axis we've got the dependent variable
28

28

00:00:55,900  -->  00:00:57,100
and this is an example, we've looked
29

29

00:00:57,100  -->  00:01:00,223
at salary versus experience.
30

30

00:01:01,150  -->  00:01:03,290
How do we create a model here?
31

31

00:01:03,290  -->  00:01:06,100
So we use a simple linear regression.
32

32

00:01:06,100  -->  00:01:07,850
It puts a line through our data
33

33

00:01:07,850  -->  00:01:11,860
and that line is modeling our observations
34

34

00:01:11,860  -->  00:01:14,390
so we can basically forecast things
35

35

00:01:14,390  -->  00:01:18,860
and compare our actual observations to our model and so on
36

36

00:01:18,860  -->  00:01:20,670
but so we know how to deal
37

37

00:01:20,670  -->  00:01:23,181
with challenges like that or problems like that
38

38

00:01:23,181  -->  00:01:26,890
but your company had hired you as a data scientist,
39

39

00:01:26,890  -->  00:01:30,580
what they do is they send out email of first two customers
40

40

00:01:30,580  -->  00:01:33,966
with like a proposal to buy certain products
41

41

00:01:33,966  -->  00:01:38,420
it might be a clothing store or it might be a grocery store
42

42

00:01:38,420  -->  00:01:39,253
or something like that.
43

43

00:01:39,253  -->  00:01:43,468
So, what they do is basically they send out a offer
44

44

00:01:43,468  -->  00:01:48,468
in email to a lot of customers to purchase some product
45

45

00:01:49,280  -->  00:01:51,050
and here you've got a sample of those customers
46

46

00:01:51,050  -->  00:01:53,520
that they contacted recently, you've got their age
47

47

00:01:53,520  -->  00:01:56,820
and also you have a variable
48

48

00:01:56,820  -->  00:01:58,500
whether (mumbles) not they took action.
49

49

00:01:58,500  -->  00:02:01,730
So did the person take up an action, perform an action
50

50

00:02:01,730  -->  00:02:04,140
did they take up an offer, did they buy a product,
51

51

00:02:04,140  -->  00:02:07,060
did they open up an email respond to our email and so on.
52

52

00:02:07,060  -->  00:02:08,450
So was action taken or not?
53

53

00:02:08,450  -->  00:02:11,890
And the very black and white, very different
54

54

00:02:11,890  -->  00:02:14,210
but at the same time like even though we don't know
55

55

00:02:14,210  -->  00:02:16,000
what to do, we don't know what's going on here,
56

56

00:02:16,000  -->  00:02:17,210
it's not what we're expecting
57

57

00:02:17,210  -->  00:02:20,000
but at the same time intuitively we can see
58

58

00:02:20,000  -->  00:02:22,300
that there's some sort of correlation.
59

59

00:02:22,300  -->  00:02:25,940
We can see that the observations on the bottom,
60

60

00:02:25,940  -->  00:02:27,090
they're a bit more to the left,
61

61

00:02:27,090  -->  00:02:28,470
observations on the top are a bit more
62

62

00:02:28,470  -->  00:02:30,450
to the right implying kind of
63

63

00:02:30,450  -->  00:02:35,200
that probably older people are more likely to take action
64

64

00:02:36,060  -->  00:02:38,920
based on this offer and younger people are more likely
65

65

00:02:38,920  -->  00:02:40,410
to ignore it.
66

66

00:02:40,410  -->  00:02:43,080
So, can we somehow model this?
67

67

00:02:43,080  -->  00:02:46,890
How about we try the existing method in our toolkit
68

68

00:02:46,890  -->  00:02:49,780
which is the linear regression.
69

69

00:02:49,780  -->  00:02:52,450
Let's run a linear regression and that's what it looks like
70

70

00:02:52,450  -->  00:02:55,660
as you can tell, it doesn't look like the best approach.
71

71

00:02:55,660  -->  00:03:00,310
It doesn't look like the best method to solve this problem.
72

72

00:03:00,310  -->  00:03:03,213
So, let's look into this in a bit more detail.
73

73

00:03:06,120  -->  00:03:10,003
We're going to draw the other horizontal line over here.
74

74

00:03:11,120  -->  00:03:14,810
Instead of trying to predict exactly what's going to happen
75

75

00:03:14,810  -->  00:03:17,180
for any given person, let's imagine a person
76

76

00:03:17,180  -->  00:03:19,080
and let's say we want to predict
77

77

00:03:19,080  -->  00:03:21,720
for that person knowing their age
78

78

00:03:21,720  -->  00:03:23,483
we want to predict whether they will
79

79

00:03:23,483  -->  00:03:25,400
take up the offer or not
80

80

00:03:25,400  -->  00:03:28,190
but instead of predicting exactly whether they're going
81

81

00:03:28,190  -->  00:03:29,998
to take it up or not, how about
82

82

00:03:29,998  -->  00:03:34,610
instead we will predict the probability,
83

83

00:03:34,610  -->  00:03:37,680
we will stage a probability or a likelihood
84

84

00:03:37,680  -->  00:03:40,200
of that person taking up that offer
85

85

00:03:40,200  -->  00:03:42,380
and if you think of it in that way,
86

86

00:03:42,380  -->  00:03:44,730
right away things start becoming clear.
87

87

00:03:44,730  -->  00:03:48,370
Right away you can see that okay, so this chart is actually
88

88

00:03:48,370  -->  00:03:49,790
from zero to one.
89

89

00:03:49,790  -->  00:03:52,540
And I also know that probabilities are from zero to one.
90

90

00:03:52,540  -->  00:03:53,930
Ooh, that's interesting.
91

91

00:03:53,930  -->  00:03:56,450
So basically I could feed in probabilities
92

92

00:03:56,450  -->  00:03:57,320
between zero and one.
93

93

00:03:57,320  -->  00:03:59,690
The fact that the red dots, the red observations
94

94

00:03:59,690  -->  00:04:02,970
are already either zero or one and nowhere in between.
95

95

00:04:02,970  -->  00:04:05,100
Well that's simply because we already know the result.
96

96

00:04:05,100  -->  00:04:07,160
We already know that they're either there or there
97

97

00:04:07,160  -->  00:04:09,130
but for something we're predicting,
98

98

00:04:09,130  -->  00:04:14,130
it kinda makes sense to say well, I don't know for sure,
99

99

00:04:14,480  -->  00:04:16,360
I don't know 100% he will take it up or not
100

100

00:04:16,360  -->  00:04:19,970
but I know maybe of an 80% chance he will take it up or not.
101

101

00:04:19,970  -->  00:04:20,803
Right?
102

102

00:04:20,803  -->  00:04:22,300
And when you think of it that way,
103

103

00:04:22,300  -->  00:04:24,460
the linear regression line or at least
104

104

00:04:24,460  -->  00:04:27,020
that part that's in the middle between zero and one.
105

105

00:04:27,020  -->  00:04:28,260
It makes sense, right?
106

106

00:04:28,260  -->  00:04:29,750
Or it makes some sense,
107

107

00:04:29,750  -->  00:04:33,470
because that is basically it's telling you
108

108

00:04:33,470  -->  00:04:36,920
that anybody between those ages of for instance,
109

109

00:04:36,920  -->  00:04:38,470
where it's crossing the horizontal line
110

110

00:04:38,470  -->  00:04:39,370
for the first time
111

111

00:04:40,410  -->  00:04:42,310
or where it's crossing the horizontal axis,
112

112

00:04:42,310  -->  00:04:45,420
it might be like 25 or let's say 35
113

113

00:04:45,420  -->  00:04:49,510
and where it's crossing the horizontal axis for one
114

114

00:04:49,510  -->  00:04:51,610
it might be let's say 55.
115

115

00:04:51,610  -->  00:04:54,253
So those people between 35 and 55,
116

116

00:04:58,010  -->  00:04:59,980
any person that falls in between that age,
117

117

00:04:59,980  -->  00:05:03,730
there's a probability of them taking up this offer
118

118

00:05:03,730  -->  00:05:07,920
and that probability is increasing as we move to the right
119

119

00:05:07,920  -->  00:05:09,790
as we take more and more older people
120

120

00:05:09,790  -->  00:05:11,020
that probability is increasing.
121

121

00:05:11,020  -->  00:05:13,600
So the part of the linear regression in the middle
122

122

00:05:13,600  -->  00:05:16,740
kind of makes sense and we can do something with it
123

123

00:05:16,740  -->  00:05:19,242
but the parts that don't make sense at all are the ones
124

124

00:05:19,242  -->  00:05:20,710
at the top or at the bottom
125

125

00:05:20,710  -->  00:05:23,950
because probability can never be less than zero
126

126

00:05:23,950  -->  00:05:25,370
or it can never be above one.
127

127

00:05:25,370  -->  00:05:27,490
So what's the linear regression trying
128

128

00:05:27,490  -->  00:05:28,982
to give us a hint about here?
129

129

00:05:28,982  -->  00:05:32,800
Well, what it's probably saying, what we could interpret
130

130

00:05:32,800  -->  00:05:35,606
as is that people above that age,
131

131

00:05:35,606  -->  00:05:39,493
that nominal age we said 55, above that age,
132

132

00:05:40,580  -->  00:05:42,400
they're very very likely
133

133

00:05:42,400  -->  00:05:45,280
to take offer actually more than 100%.
134

134

00:05:45,280  -->  00:05:47,740
So basically, they're definitely taking it up.
135

135

00:05:47,740  -->  00:05:50,700
Anybody below 35 on the other side
136

136

00:05:50,700  -->  00:05:53,580
on the left they're definitely not taking it.
137

137

00:05:53,580  -->  00:05:56,440
So essentially what we're saying is
138

138

00:05:56,440  -->  00:05:57,630
if we ever take that approach
139

139

00:05:57,630  -->  00:06:00,060
then we would have to replace this linear regression line
140

140

00:06:00,060  -->  00:06:01,460
for a line that looks like that.
141

141

00:06:01,460  -->  00:06:02,900
So let's just cut those bits off
142

142

00:06:02,900  -->  00:06:05,490
and replace them with horizontal parts.
143

143

00:06:05,490  -->  00:06:10,490
And that would be a very basic
144

144

00:06:10,800  -->  00:06:12,020
but it still would be an attempt
145

145

00:06:12,020  -->  00:06:14,870
at creating a model for this situation.
146

146

00:06:14,870  -->  00:06:16,940
So we would still be able to use this
147

147

00:06:16,940  -->  00:06:20,130
to make some sort of predictions and assumptions
148

148

00:06:20,130  -->  00:06:23,880
that talk about the correlation between the action
149

149

00:06:23,880  -->  00:06:25,510
and the age of a person.
150

150

00:06:25,510  -->  00:06:28,630
So, that's a very basic understanding
151

151

00:06:28,630  -->  00:06:32,520
and that's kind of the start of our understanding
152

152

00:06:32,520  -->  00:06:35,070
of intuition behind logistic regression.
153

153

00:06:35,070  -->  00:06:39,220
So let's see what the actual scientific approach is.
154

154

00:06:39,220  -->  00:06:42,700
So here we've got the line that we looked at
155

155

00:06:42,700  -->  00:06:45,750
and it's described by this equation.
156

156

00:06:45,750  -->  00:06:48,180
Now this part is gonna be, this is the most fun part
157

157

00:06:48,180  -->  00:06:49,550
so bear with me.
158

158

00:06:49,550  -->  00:06:52,850
If you apply to this equation a sigmoid function,
159

159

00:06:52,850  -->  00:06:56,190
which looks like that, so you put the y
160

160

00:06:56,190  -->  00:06:58,430
into the sigmoid function in purple
161

161

00:06:59,290  -->  00:07:03,710
and then you solve for y from the purple box
162

162

00:07:03,710  -->  00:07:06,360
and you put y back into the blue box,
163

163

00:07:06,360  -->  00:07:07,960
then you will get the green box.
164

164

00:07:07,960  -->  00:07:11,460
So basically, your linear regression
165

165

00:07:11,460  -->  00:07:12,500
will start to look like this
166

166

00:07:12,500  -->  00:07:16,330
and this is the formula for logistic regression
167

167

00:07:16,330  -->  00:07:17,430
and what that will do
168

168

00:07:17,430  -->  00:07:19,830
to your chart which is most importantly
169

169

00:07:19,830  -->  00:07:24,830
this visual part, it will convert it from the chart
170

170

00:07:25,057  -->  00:07:27,930
that we see at the top to this new chart
171

171

00:07:27,930  -->  00:07:31,203
which is actually the logistic regression function.
172

172

00:07:32,040  -->  00:07:37,040
So, if at this stage you're asking yourself,
173

173

00:07:37,200  -->  00:07:38,930
what just happened?
174

174

00:07:38,930  -->  00:07:40,548
Then you're not alone.
175

175

00:07:40,548  -->  00:07:41,381
(laughs)
176

176

00:07:41,381  -->  00:07:44,780
the first time I saw this or I learned this,
177

177

00:07:44,780  -->  00:07:46,530
this was the expression on my face.
178

178

00:07:47,440  -->  00:07:49,820
If you're totally comfortable for all that,
179

179

00:07:49,820  -->  00:07:50,720
that's super great.
180

180

00:07:50,720  -->  00:07:52,870
That means you'll thrive through this section
181

181

00:07:52,870  -->  00:07:55,200
but if you're confused right now, not a problem,
182

182

00:07:55,200  -->  00:07:57,620
I was the same when I was in your shoes.
183

183

00:07:57,620  -->  00:08:00,420
So let's take this step by step.
184

184

00:08:00,420  -->  00:08:03,327
Let's look at it step by step or exactly what happened.
185

185

00:08:03,327  -->  00:08:05,143
So there's our graph.
186

186

00:08:06,050  -->  00:08:08,770
There's our independent variable.
187

187

00:08:08,770  -->  00:08:12,100
There's our outcome yes or no.
188

188

00:08:12,100  -->  00:08:15,500
So that's the y, the dependent variable
189

189

00:08:15,500  -->  00:08:18,610
and there are our observations in our data set.
190

190

00:08:18,610  -->  00:08:23,490
Based on these observations and plus using this formula
191

191

00:08:23,490  -->  00:08:25,150
which we're going to take as given.
192

192

00:08:25,150  -->  00:08:27,870
This is the logistic regression formula.
193

193

00:08:27,870  -->  00:08:31,450
Using this formula and these observations,
194

194

00:08:31,450  -->  00:08:35,090
we come up with this line and what's important
195

195

00:08:35,090  -->  00:08:37,970
to understand here it's not a magical line.
196

196

00:08:37,970  -->  00:08:40,610
This line for the logistic regression is the same
197

197

00:08:40,610  -->  00:08:45,610
as a slope or a trend line for a linear regression.
198

198

00:08:45,750  -->  00:08:48,460
So basically what this line is doing
199

199

00:08:48,460  -->  00:08:52,360
is it is using the formula, it's following the formula
200

200

00:08:52,360  -->  00:08:56,900
and it's the best fitting line that can fit these data sets.
201

201

00:08:56,900  -->  00:08:59,280
So basically we're doing exactly the same thing as of
202

202

00:08:59,280  -->  00:09:03,020
for linear regression but it just looks different,
203

203

00:09:03,020  -->  00:09:03,853
that's all.
204

204

00:09:03,853  -->  00:09:05,210
So there are heaps of these lines
205

205

00:09:05,210  -->  00:09:07,450
that you can draw that look like that
206

206

00:09:07,450  -->  00:09:09,930
but only one of them is the best fitting line.
207

207

00:09:09,930  -->  00:09:12,340
So the point of the logistic regression is
208

208

00:09:12,340  -->  00:09:15,490
to find that best fitting line and this is it.
209

209

00:09:15,490  -->  00:09:18,940
So we found the best fitting line that follows
210

210

00:09:18,940  -->  00:09:23,940
that equation and fits these variables or these observations
211

211

00:09:25,200  -->  00:09:26,570
that we had in our data set.
212

212

00:09:26,570  -->  00:09:29,740
After that, we can forget about the equation,
213

213

00:09:29,740  -->  00:09:31,670
we forget about the variables, we've got our line.
214

214

00:09:31,670  -->  00:09:35,420
So this is our logistic regression function.
215

215

00:09:35,420  -->  00:09:37,580
We've found the same thing as of for linear regression.
216

216

00:09:37,580  -->  00:09:38,570
We've created the model.
217

217

00:09:38,570  -->  00:09:39,403
We've built the model.
218

218

00:09:39,403  -->  00:09:40,236
You can see it.
219

219

00:09:40,236  -->  00:09:42,453
This is the model in front of you right there.
220

220

00:09:43,460  -->  00:09:46,260
Now what can we do with this logistic regression?
221

221

00:09:46,260  -->  00:09:49,840
Well, we can use it to predict probabilities
222

222

00:09:49,840  -->  00:09:52,090
and we've already touched on probabilities
223

223

00:09:52,090  -->  00:09:54,140
that they lie between zero and one
224

224

00:09:54,140  -->  00:09:56,660
and that instead of predicting for sure
225

225

00:09:56,660  -->  00:09:58,020
that something will or will not happen,
226

226

00:09:58,020  -->  00:09:59,670
how about we predict the probability.
227

227

00:09:59,670  -->  00:10:02,380
So, let's look at...
228

228

00:10:02,380  -->  00:10:06,050
Oh by the way probability here is called p_hat
229

229

00:10:06,050  -->  00:10:10,780
so that that little sign above the p gives us the name p_hat
230

230

00:10:10,780  -->  00:10:12,412
and anything you see
231

231

00:10:12,412  -->  00:10:14,600
with the hat in this section just basically means
232

232

00:10:14,600  -->  00:10:17,070
that it's something we're predicting
233

233

00:10:17,070  -->  00:10:21,790
so that's a way to remember it, that picture p_hat
234

234

00:10:21,790  -->  00:10:23,893
so we're predicting this probability.
235

235

00:10:25,120  -->  00:10:28,980
Okay, so let's take four random values
236

236

00:10:28,980  -->  00:10:30,620
for the independent variable.
237

237

00:10:30,620  -->  00:10:33,140
For x, we're going to say 20, 30, 40, 50.
238

238

00:10:33,140  -->  00:10:35,010
Let's see what happens to these variables.
239

239

00:10:35,010  -->  00:10:37,620
So let's put them on the x line.
240

240

00:10:37,620  -->  00:10:40,410
Those are the dots and I specifically put dots
241

241

00:10:40,410  -->  00:10:43,768
not x's or crosses because it doesn't mean
242

242

00:10:43,768  -->  00:10:46,470
that they're on the horizontal bottom line doesn't mean
243

243

00:10:46,470  -->  00:10:48,450
that their probability is zero
244

244

00:10:48,450  -->  00:10:51,500
or that their dependent variable is zero.
245

245

00:10:51,500  -->  00:10:54,960
No, they're just there because they're on the x-axis.
246

246

00:10:54,960  -->  00:10:55,930
We just plotted them there.
247

247

00:10:55,930  -->  00:10:59,440
It has nothing to do with vertical axis.
248

248

00:10:59,440  -->  00:11:02,500
Now, what you need to do to find the probabilities
249

249

00:11:02,500  -->  00:11:05,800
is you need to project these values onto your curve.
250

250

00:11:05,800  -->  00:11:06,633
Once you project them,
251

251

00:11:06,633  -->  00:11:07,466
you get these
252

252

00:11:10,027  -->  00:11:13,270
blue dots or blue observations
253

253

00:11:13,270  -->  00:11:16,280
which plotted basically so these are the fitted values
254

254

00:11:16,280  -->  00:11:19,140
as you remember in red you have the actual
255

255

00:11:19,140  -->  00:11:21,060
and in blue you have the fitted values.
256

256

00:11:21,060  -->  00:11:23,320
So these are your fitted values
257

257

00:11:23,320  -->  00:11:27,270
and now if you project them, if you want the probabilities,
258

258

00:11:27,270  -->  00:11:30,270
you need to project them to the left like that.
259

259

00:11:30,270  -->  00:11:31,630
And let's have a look at these probabilities.
260

260

00:11:31,630  -->  00:11:34,020
So the person who is 20 years old,
261

261

00:11:34,020  -->  00:11:36,420
the probability of taking this offer is very low,
262

262

00:11:36,420  -->  00:11:40,110
perhaps 0.7% so less than one percentage
263

263

00:11:40,110  -->  00:11:42,060
to take up this offer.
264

264

00:11:42,060  -->  00:11:45,550
The person who is 30 years old, the probability is higher.
265

265

00:11:45,550  -->  00:11:48,210
It's about 23% to take up this offer.
266

266

00:11:48,210  -->  00:11:50,490
The person who is 40 years old,
267

267

00:11:50,490  -->  00:11:52,840
their probability to take up this offer is 85%
268

268

00:11:52,840  -->  00:11:54,660
according to this model
269

269

00:11:54,660  -->  00:11:56,060
and the person who is 50 years old,
270

270

00:11:56,060  -->  00:11:59,070
their probability is 99.4%.
271

271

00:11:59,070  -->  00:12:01,690
So that's the first thing that you can get
272

272

00:12:01,690  -->  00:12:03,370
out of a logistic regression.
273

273

00:12:03,370  -->  00:12:04,850
That's what we're going to be using
274

274

00:12:06,000  -->  00:12:08,220
we're gonna be using it very actively
275

275

00:12:08,220  -->  00:12:09,053
when we're talking
276

276

00:12:09,053  -->  00:12:11,760
about building geo-demographic segmentations
277

277

00:12:11,760  -->  00:12:14,150
because you use this probability as a score
278

278

00:12:14,150  -->  00:12:16,350
and we'll talk about this more.
279

279

00:12:16,350  -->  00:12:18,210
So you can actually rank people,
280

280

00:12:18,210  -->  00:12:20,590
who is the most likeliest to take up your offer
281

281

00:12:20,590  -->  00:12:22,920
and who is the least likeliest to take your offer up.
282

282

00:12:22,920  -->  00:12:24,410
So it's actually even better
283

283

00:12:24,410  -->  00:12:26,240
than just having a one or a zero.
284

284

00:12:26,240  -->  00:12:29,860
You have a probability so you can order people
285

285

00:12:29,860  -->  00:12:31,090
by this probability.
286

286

00:12:31,090  -->  00:12:33,473
Anyway, you might want to say
287

287

00:12:33,473  -->  00:12:35,380
well, I don't want the probability,
288

288

00:12:35,380  -->  00:12:36,901
I want a prediction as
289

289

00:12:36,901  -->  00:12:37,734
(laughs)
290

290

00:12:37,734  -->  00:12:41,090
because this is a regression, I want a prediction
291

291

00:12:41,090  -->  00:12:43,720
for the y value.
292

292

00:12:43,720  -->  00:12:45,733
So, okay, we can do that.
293

293

00:12:47,530  -->  00:12:50,110
Let's get rid of those probabilities.
294

294

00:12:50,110  -->  00:12:52,200
Now can we get y the actual.
295

295

00:12:52,200  -->  00:12:53,940
Obviously we can't get the actual
296

296

00:12:53,940  -->  00:12:56,860
because the actual is something we can only observe
297

297

00:12:56,860  -->  00:12:59,160
in our data set or in real life.
298

298

00:12:59,160  -->  00:13:01,440
We can only get a prediction for the actual.
299

299

00:13:01,440  -->  00:13:06,180
So y_hat as the hat suggests is the predicted value
300

300

00:13:06,180  -->  00:13:08,890
for the dependent variable.
301

301

00:13:08,890  -->  00:13:10,070
How do you get y_hat?
302

302

00:13:10,070  -->  00:13:12,690
Well, the approach is very arbitrary.
303

303

00:13:12,690  -->  00:13:14,103
You have to select a line.
304

304

00:13:15,240  -->  00:13:16,073
Let's wait for that.
305

305

00:13:16,073  -->  00:13:16,906
Okay.
306

306

00:13:16,906  -->  00:13:17,739
So you have to select a line.
307

307

00:13:17,739  -->  00:13:19,915
In this case we're going to select 50%.
308

308

00:13:19,915  -->  00:13:22,630
You can select it anywhere but 50% is usually selected
309

309

00:13:22,630  -->  00:13:26,750
because it's in the middle and therefore you have symmetry
310

310

00:13:26,750  -->  00:13:29,490
and anything below this line, so anything that falls
311

311

00:13:29,490  -->  00:13:32,340
on the curve below this line will be projected
312

312

00:13:32,340  -->  00:13:34,050
downwards onto the zero line
313

313

00:13:35,040  -->  00:13:36,030
which makes sense.
314

314

00:13:36,030  -->  00:13:39,070
So it's basically saying if your probability,
315

315

00:13:39,070  -->  00:13:40,890
your predicted probability of taking
316

316

00:13:40,890  -->  00:13:44,219
up this offer is less than 50%, let's say it's 40% or 20%
317

317

00:13:44,219  -->  00:13:45,370
then we're just gonna say
318

318

00:13:45,370  -->  00:13:48,870
that you're probably not gonna take up this offer
319

319

00:13:48,870  -->  00:13:50,530
and so that's what's happening.
320

320

00:13:50,530  -->  00:13:52,780
The person with 0.7%, the person
321

321

00:13:52,780  -->  00:13:57,557
with whatever it was 27%, 23%,
322

322

00:13:58,610  -->  00:14:02,040
their probabilities are not zero but they're below 50 so
323

323

00:14:04,760  -->  00:14:08,590
if you do require a y_hat so a predicted value,
324

324

00:14:08,590  -->  00:14:11,460
a yes/no value then makes sense
325

325

00:14:11,460  -->  00:14:12,880
that if something is below 50%,
326

326

00:14:12,880  -->  00:14:13,713
you're probably gonna say
327

327

00:14:13,713  -->  00:14:15,733
that they're not gonna take up the offer.
328

328

00:14:17,980  -->  00:14:21,060
so there you go both of them y_hats are zero.
329

329

00:14:21,060  -->  00:14:23,680
Now, anything above the horizontal line
330

330

00:14:23,680  -->  00:14:25,520
that we selected, the 50% line
331

331

00:14:27,650  -->  00:14:31,840
is agreed that all of those values that fall
332

332

00:14:31,840  -->  00:14:34,430
onto the curve above that line are projected upwards,
333

333

00:14:34,430  -->  00:14:38,470
they're projected onto the yes line, the one line
334

334

00:14:38,470  -->  00:14:40,680
so the person that had a probability
335

335

00:14:40,680  -->  00:14:44,120
of 85% is projected outwards and the person
336

336

00:14:44,120  -->  00:14:47,200
that had the probability of 99.7% is projected upwards.
337

337

00:14:47,200  -->  00:14:48,100
Also makes sense right?
338

338

00:14:48,100  -->  00:14:48,933
So if
339

339

00:14:51,910  -->  00:14:53,510
you're predicting that somebody's probability
340

340

00:14:53,510  -->  00:14:56,070
of taking up an offer is 85%, then if you have
341

341

00:14:56,070  -->  00:14:58,670
to say yes or no, then you're probably gonna say yes.
342

342

00:14:58,670  -->  00:15:01,770
You're gonna say yes this person would take up the offer
343

343

00:15:01,770  -->  00:15:03,653
if you have to choose one of the two.
344

344

00:15:04,490  -->  00:15:09,490
So those are our predicted y_hat values
345

345

00:15:09,590  -->  00:15:13,560
if in this case, they're both one for those two variables
346

346

00:15:13,560  -->  00:15:16,977
and those are the two things you can get out of
347

347

00:15:16,977  -->  00:15:18,900
the logistic regression so you get
348

348

00:15:18,900  -->  00:15:22,080
the probabilities which are important.
349

349

00:15:22,080  -->  00:15:24,270
Also, you can get the y_hats, the predicted values
350

350

00:15:24,270  -->  00:15:25,460
for the dependent variables.
351

351

00:15:25,460  -->  00:15:27,070
Once again, it's important to think of it
352

352

00:15:27,070  -->  00:15:30,832
as it's doing exactly the same thing as a linear regression.
353

353

00:15:30,832  -->  00:15:35,832
It's fitting this line even though it's not a straight line
354

354

00:15:36,979  -->  00:15:41,013
and the values are not scattered,
355

355

00:15:41,013  -->  00:15:45,120
everything looks bizarre in its uniformity
356

356

00:15:45,120  -->  00:15:48,860
or in its structure makes it look bizarre
357

357

00:15:48,860  -->  00:15:53,210
but still, it's a pretty much the same way.
358

358

00:15:53,210  -->  00:15:57,130
We've agreed on the line or a formula for the curve
359

359

00:15:57,130  -->  00:16:00,060
and we're trying to fit the best curve to our data.
360

360

00:16:00,060  -->  00:16:02,180
Once we've done that, we've got a model,
361

361

00:16:02,180  -->  00:16:05,510
we've got the coefficients which will talk about later
362

362

00:16:05,510  -->  00:16:08,340
and we can start drawing conclusions
363

363

00:16:08,340  -->  00:16:13,120
or insights from this model and some of the insights are
364

364

00:16:13,120  -->  00:16:16,090
we can get a probability of somebody taking action
365

365

00:16:16,090  -->  00:16:20,030
or of the event occurring or basically
366

366

00:16:20,030  -->  00:16:22,900
of the answer being yes, so it's not a yes/no,
367

367

00:16:22,900  -->  00:16:26,040
it's a probability so 85% or 20% or whatever.
368

368

00:16:26,040  -->  00:16:29,540
So that's when we project it to the left onto the y-axis
369

369

00:16:29,540  -->  00:16:32,080
and also we can get a predicted value
370

370

00:16:32,080  -->  00:16:33,770
for the dependent variable based
371

371

00:16:33,770  -->  00:16:36,023
on where we select this arbitrary line 50%.
372

372

00:16:36,023  -->  00:16:37,980
You can select it anywhere you like.
373

373

00:16:37,980  -->  00:16:42,170
You can select it higher, lower, depends on your knowledge
374

374

00:16:42,170  -->  00:16:45,900
about the problem at hand and as you understand.
375

375

00:16:45,900  -->  00:16:47,100
Depending on where you selected,
376

376

00:16:47,100  -->  00:16:50,390
that will significantly affect your variables.
377

377

00:16:50,390  -->  00:16:54,700
So I really hope this explanation was trivial enough
378

378

00:16:56,770  -->  00:16:58,560
and yet insightful enough for you
379

379

00:16:58,560  -->  00:17:02,660
to gain an intuitive understanding of logistic regression.
380

380

00:17:02,660  -->  00:17:03,930
I look forward to seeing you then
381

381

00:17:03,930  -->  00:17:06,083
and until next time, happy analyzing.
