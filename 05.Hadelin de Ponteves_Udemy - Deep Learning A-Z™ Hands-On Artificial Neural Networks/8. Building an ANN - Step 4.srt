00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:02,600
<v Narrator>Hello and welcome to this Python tutorial.</v>
2

2

00:00:02,600  -->  00:00:05,030
So now we have everything ready, we have our data
3

3

00:00:05,030  -->  00:00:08,450
well preprocessed and the keras libraries and packages
4

4

00:00:08,450  -->  00:00:11,600
well imported, so now we're ready to start with first step
5

5

00:00:11,600  -->  00:00:14,620
of creating our very first artificial neural network
6

6

00:00:14,620  -->  00:00:17,850
and that's step consists of initializing the the ANN,
7

7

00:00:17,850  -->  00:00:21,120
that is defining it as a sequence of layers.
8

8

00:00:21,120  -->  00:00:24,010
They're actually two ways of initializing a
9

9

00:00:24,010  -->  00:00:26,670
deep learning model, it's either by defining the
10

10

00:00:26,670  -->  00:00:30,890
sequence of layers or the other way, defining a graph.
11

11

00:00:30,890  -->  00:00:34,130
So here, since we'll make an artificial neural network with
12

12

00:00:34,130  -->  00:00:37,640
successive layers as you saw in Kirill's intuition tutorial,
13

13

00:00:37,640  -->  00:00:40,160
well, we will initialize our deep learning model by
14

14

00:00:40,160  -->  00:00:42,770
defining it as a sequence of layers.
15

15

00:00:42,770  -->  00:00:44,730
So, let's do that, it's actually very simple.
16

16

00:00:44,730  -->  00:00:48,170
We just need to create a nubject of the sequential class,
17

17

00:00:48,170  -->  00:00:50,270
a class that we, of course, take from the
18

18

00:00:50,270  -->  00:00:52,360
sequential module here.
19

19

00:00:52,360  -->  00:00:53,690
Alright, so let's do it.
20

20

00:00:53,690  -->  00:00:56,560
This object that we're going to create is nothing else
21

21

00:00:56,560  -->  00:00:59,320
than the model itself, that is the neural network
22

22

00:00:59,320  -->  00:01:02,020
that will have a role of classifier here because
23

23

00:01:02,020  -->  00:01:04,920
our problem is a classification problem where we have to
24

24

00:01:04,920  -->  00:01:08,330
predict a class, so this neural network model is going
25

25

00:01:08,330  -->  00:01:11,800
to be a classifier and since after we're going to predict
26

26

00:01:11,800  -->  00:01:15,560
the tested results using this classifier name here,
27

27

00:01:15,560  -->  00:01:18,110
well, we will call our model, the neural network that
28

28

00:01:18,110  -->  00:01:20,710
we're gonna build, classifier.
29

29

00:01:20,710  -->  00:01:23,960
Here we go, so this classifier object is nothing else
30

30

00:01:23,960  -->  00:01:25,860
than the future artificial neural network
31

31

00:01:25,860  -->  00:01:27,220
that we're gonna build.
32

32

00:01:27,220  -->  00:01:32,050
So, equals and then we use the sequential class
33

33

00:01:32,050  -->  00:01:34,980
because this classifier object is actually a nubject
34

34

00:01:34,980  -->  00:01:36,260
of the sequential class.
35

35

00:01:36,260  -->  00:01:38,720
So, we know how to do that, we just need to take
36

36

00:01:38,720  -->  00:01:42,810
the class here and add some parenthesis and we don't need
37

37

00:01:42,810  -->  00:01:45,820
to input any argument because we will define the layers
38

38

00:01:45,820  -->  00:01:50,090
step by step afterwards, we will start with the input layer
39

39

00:01:50,090  -->  00:01:53,150
and the first hidden layer and then we'll add some more
40

40

00:01:53,150  -->  00:01:56,680
hidden layers and the finally we'll add the output layer.
41

41

00:01:56,680  -->  00:01:58,130
So, that's all for the first step.
42

42

00:01:58,130  -->  00:02:03,010
We are ready to select this line and execute to initialize
43

43

00:02:03,010  -->  00:02:06,020
our artificial neural network classifier.
44

44

00:02:06,020  -->  00:02:07,590
Alright, so that's done.
45

45

00:02:07,590  -->  00:02:11,210
We are now ready to add the different layers in this ANN
46

46

00:02:11,210  -->  00:02:13,180
and we will start with the input layer
47

47

00:02:13,180  -->  00:02:15,110
and the first hidden layer.
48

48

00:02:15,110  -->  00:02:17,810
So, that's exactly our next step which we will do
49

49

00:02:17,810  -->  00:02:19,230
in the next tutorial.
50

50

00:02:19,230  -->  00:02:20,953
Until then, enjoy deep learning.
