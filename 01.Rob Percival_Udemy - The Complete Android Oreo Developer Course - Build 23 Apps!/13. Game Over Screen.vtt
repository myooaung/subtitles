1
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.170
All right we're nearly there now.

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.060
We've got a scoring system.

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.260
I'm actually doing really well on this game.

4
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.040
And we've got our pipes display as we want them going on forever and ever.

5
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.860
And we've also got the bud moving and the collision detection working as well.

6
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:23.580
So what we need is for the game to actually respond when the user hits one of the pipes or indeed the

7
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.420
bottom of the screen them.

8
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.690
And for the game to be over and for the user to be able to tap the screen and start again.

9
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.060
So first off I'm going to quickly download a game over a graphic

10
00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.260
so I'm just on Google Images.

11
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:54.910
And if I scroll down here I'm there we get to work brilliantly.

12
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.330
So we'll go for that one.

13
00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:03.450
Obviously when you're using creating your own games you need to create your own graphics but

14
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:07.790
this will do it for us.

15
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.080
For now I'll just call this game

16
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.390
and here it is in Preview.

17
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:21.410
I'm just going to do a resize.

18
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.960
So it's currently two thousand pixels that's plenty.

19
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.770
Five hundred should be more than enough.

20
00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.710
And I'm also going to give it a transparent background which is really easy to do on a Mac.

21
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:42.580
You just in Preview click the instant Alpher magic one there and then just select the part that you

22
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.580
want to be clear.

23
00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:51.040
And then I'm just going to press delete to get rid of that and convert it to P N G because J pegs are

24
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.100
not transparent.

25
00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:00.270
And I'm also just going to make it a little bit smaller just by cropping that there as well.

26
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.990
OK.

27
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.980
So if you want to avoid those steps then you can just download the projects from the link in the next

28
00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:12.650
lecture and it will have the game over image in it.

29
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.570
But we're now going to add this to.

30
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:28.230
So let's go back over to Android studio and open up the assets folder in find up and then I'm going

31
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.500
to take my game either

32
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:43.510
g file and just drag it into the assets folder that.

33
00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.410
OK so let's create a new text texture for that

34
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.570
great hint text.

35
00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.970
Game over.

36
00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.530
And then we'll set it up here.

37
00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.280
Game over is a new texture.

38
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.860
Using game the PMG.

39
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:15.330
All right.

40
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.840
Let's just remind ourselves how we want this to work.

41
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.500
We want when we get a collision detected we want the game to stop.

42
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.420
And for the game over.

43
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.280
Don't be angry.

44
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.790
Texture to be displayed on the screen.

45
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:39.210
We also want the option for the user to then tap on the screen and start the game again.

46
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.430
So let's make that happen.

47
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.880
So the way I'm going to make that happen is by bringing in a new game state.

48
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:56.290
So so far we've got two game states 0 8 which is the very beginning and one which is playing the game.

49
00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.860
So we're now going to have a game state of two.

50
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:10.790
So that means that the game is over and we want to do that here as well.

51
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:19.930
So I'm now going to remove the ability to move the bird after it's got to the bottom and

52
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:31.500
we're just going to have an L statement here to say that if the bird is not above the bottom of the

53
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:40.920
screen then game state is to say what we want to happen when game state is to where we want all of this

54
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:47.060
to stop happening which it actually will which is great.

55
00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.490
So

56
00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:56.470
this is now only going to happen when game state is equal to 1.

57
00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.770
So we're going to have all of that.

58
00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:06.760
First we'll add this if game States is equal to zero.

59
00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.240
Let's put the brackets in the right place.

60
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:23.230
And our final option is if game state is equal to 2.

61
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:29.510
We don't really need an if that is the only other option but it makes it clear what's going on I think.

62
00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:34.340
So just by the virtue of game state not being won.

63
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:39.780
All of this stuff is not going to happen so that tubes are going to stop moving which is great.

64
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:48.250
We'll still have the background which is good and we'll still have the bird which is also good but we

65
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.110
won't have the tubes moving.

66
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.100
So that's great.

67
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.510
The only thing we actually want is our game over message.

68
00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:57.430
So let's draw that

69
00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.630
batched draw and we want Game over.

70
00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:21.230
And we want to in the center of the screen say X is going to be GDX graphics don't get with over t minus.

71
00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:22.730
Game over.

72
00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:27.360
Don't get with over two.

73
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:33.380
And then the same for the y coordinates.

74
00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:44.750
Well almost the same anyway just with get height.

75
00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:48.790
OK so we'll just run that and check.

76
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:56.620
We should now have a proper game over system that will do everything except restart the game.

77
00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:03.970
So when the game stops the cheaps will start moving the Scoble stop increasing but the bird will keep

78
00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:05.590
flapping which is fine.

79
00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:12.300
And then we're just going to need to add the facility to tap to restart the game.

80
00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:13.640
Here we go.

81
00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:14.870
So let's die.

82
00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:16.370
Fantastic.

83
00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:17.570
There we go.

84
00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:18.170
It's game over.

85
00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:22.880
Possibly a little bit small but I'll leave you to play with that and resize it if you want to.

86
00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:27.150
Notice that we can interact with the screen at all at the moment.

87
00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.370
That's absolutely fine.

88
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:36.570
All we need to do is to copy this code down.

89
00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:39.110
And now we're going to have some interaction.

90
00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:40.410
So what do we want to happen.

91
00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:44.690
Well we definitely want the game state to be equal to one to stop playing the game again.

92
00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.340
We want to put the bird back in the middle of the screen.

93
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:55.270
So we want to do a fair bit of the set up that we did over in the create method up here.

94
00:07:55.930 --> 00:08:03.580
So we want to set bird y back again we don't need to reset the textures or the phones or anything like

95
00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:09.240
that so they can remain as they were.

96
00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:12.530
We do want to set up the tubes again.

97
00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:21.930
But we don't need to do any of this set up again because they're all fixed anyway so this code is what

98
00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:23.330
needs to happen twice.

99
00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:24.990
So let's put it in a separate method

100
00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.750
of call it start game

101
00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:41.760
every game and then we'll call it here.

102
00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:51.180
And also at start going into that as well.

103
00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:53.780
And I think there's a couple of other things that we need to change here.

104
00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:57.530
We need to set the score back to zero.

105
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.800
And we also need to set the scoring Choop back to zero.

106
00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:04.560
So we're checking for the first one again.

107
00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:10.220
I have a quick look at the other variables and see if any of these oversetting the velocity back to

108
00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:12.220
zero would be a good idea as well.

109
00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:21.940
Otherwise they might start falling down rather quickly.

110
00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:28.680
The score and scoring cheap done game state with setting gravity's not changing anyway.

111
00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:32.700
And these ones here all the tubes we're going to reset.

112
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:33.600
Great.

113
00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:40.670
So with any luck now we should find that we get the game over screen and then when we tap the game over

114
00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:47.050
screen we're back to the beginning of the game again and everything has been reset.

115
00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.090
Let's give it a go.

116
00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:51.010
OK let's check it out.

117
00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:52.720
So I'll just die down there first.

118
00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:54.560
Yep that looks fine.

119
00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:55.680
And then restart.

120
00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:56.960
OK wonderful.

121
00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.290
And let's see if I can actually get myself a point.

122
00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:01.070
There we go.

123
00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:09.900
So we've got our one point and then it goes back to zero again when we restart wonderful.

124
00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:13.730
So there's definitely a few improvements that can be made.

125
00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.530
We've got they and they came over screen.

126
00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:20.660
You might want to make the game over image a lot bigger as I said you might want to bring the score

127
00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:21.590
to the fore.

128
00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:25.800
You might want to give them a high score and you might want to stop the bird sort of floating slightly

129
00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:33.540
strangely as it does there and make it fall to the ground regardless of where the bird was when it died.

130
00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:38.090
But I'll leave all of that as as minor tweaks that you can make it to make the best flappy bird game

131
00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:39.450
that you can imagine.

132
00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:44.480
But I hope you've enjoyed the process and I hope you're now having some ideas about games that you could

133
00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.630
make using these ideas.

134
00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:51.110
One of the great thing about making games for fans is that they don't need to be big and complicated

135
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:54.740
just small little apps like flappy bird can be hugely popular.

136
00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:59.990
So I hope you have some great ideas and use the skills that you've learned in the last few lectures

137
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:01.580
to put them into practice.

138
00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:02.320
Best of luck.
