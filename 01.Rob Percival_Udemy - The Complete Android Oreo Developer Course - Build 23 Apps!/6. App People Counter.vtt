00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:06.270
Hello and welcome to another lecture here in our little mini Android where of course I'm really excited

2
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.080
for this lecture because we're going to be building a very simple yet also very useful app.

3
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.080
I'm going to call it the people counter but basically the idea is you're someone that needs to count

4
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.210
people whether you're seen how many people are coming into museum or you're like a teacher and need

5
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.100
to know how many kids went out to recess whatever it is it's going to be a simple Watch app that you

6
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.350
can put on your wrist and in the middle is going to be a big text view.

7
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.000
It's going to start as the number zero.

8
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.770
But as the count increments it it's going to go up to 1 2 3 4.

9
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.900
So below that text view is going to be a button that allows you to increment the count and on the top

10
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.130
is going to have a reset button that takes that text you back to zero.

11
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.440
So a very straightforward app right.

12
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.910
We have one text view and two buttons.

13
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.670
But again this is an android where someone wants you to kind of get used to that whole layout.

14
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.820
And I want to do it as a challenge because I think you have what it takes in order to do this.

15
00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.710
So go ahead and hit pause now and go tackle it.

16
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.680
All right.

17
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.330
Hopefully that went well.

18
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.640
Let's go ahead and make a new Android studio project.

19
00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.230
I'm going to call mine the people counter.

20
00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.180
Everything looks good.

21
00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.350
I'll hit next.

22
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.360
I want this to be an android where so uncheck that.

23
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.640
And I really liked building for API 26 so I think I'll do that again.

24
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.520
That was fun.

25
00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.690
And we'll go do it main activity and hit finish here.

26
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.700
All right.

27
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:36.430
So as this opens up again we've got to have two buttons and a text view in order to get this thing working.

28
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:43.120
And then we're going to write the code here in order to increment the count or reset it whatever is

29
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.510
necessary there.

30
00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.900
So because the visual side of this layout stuff is taking a minute here maybe let's go ahead and start

31
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.220
writing some of the code for this.

32
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.900
I think we know everything that we need to do.

33
00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.380
The first thing that's going to be required here is we need to have some way to track that count.

34
00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.720
And so I'm going to make a new and that I'm going to call count.

35
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.380
It will just initially set that equal to zero.

36
00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.230
So we have a new count.

37
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.240
It's equal to zero.

38
00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.520
A good starting place.

39
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.870
And then remember there's two buttons which means we need to have two methods so one of these is going

40
00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.820
to be public void and we'll go ahead and call this plus one.

41
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.930
This is going to pass in a view.

42
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.100
Let me make sure I properly get that important.

43
00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.940
And we're also going to have another method.

44
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.640
Let's go ahead and copy and paste this one and we're going to call this one.

45
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.110
Just simply reset.

46
00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.360
Right.

47
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.060
This is if they want to reset the counter.

48
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.750
So as far as the code goes this is extremely straightforward right.

49
00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.680
If someone hits the plus but one plus one we just take our count.

50
00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.510
We do plus plus that's it.

51
00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.910
That ad one adds one onto the count and once we've done that then we want to update the text view.

52
00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.650
So we already have access to this text view here right.

53
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.950
It has everything set up for us it's kind of interesting that there's that example set up code here

54
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.810
when you do a blank project with Android Wear but we'll take it and we're going to say this M.Tech view

55
00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.660
does set text and we are going to set this to take our count.

56
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:16.040
We're going to have to convert it into a string so we'll say cap a capital integer to string.

57
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.870
And this is we're going to we're going to pass in the count.

58
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:19.710
OK.

59
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.560
So we'll go ahead and throw that in there so that's going to update it.

60
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.390
And if you think about the reset it's going to be almost the same as this except instead of count plus

61
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.310
plus we'll just take our count and set that equal to zero.

62
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.200
And then we'll do the exact same code here where we go ahead and update the text for you.

63
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.690
So like I said pretty straightforward.

64
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.350
Let's go ahead and do the lay out part of this.

65
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:50.180
Now I went and researched a little bit between this video and we can in fact use a constraint lay out

66
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.660
if you'd like so we can delete this frame layout and if we go to our layouts and pull in a constraint

67
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.940
layout it is going to ask us to say hey are you going to.

68
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.050
Are you going to be able to add this from your library will hit.

69
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.230
OK.

70
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.750
Now note this isn't available with all API options so you got to make sure that you have one that can

71
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:08.790
support it.

72
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.840
But with this constraint layout we can add the three items that we need so we need two buttons.

73
00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.000
Let's go ahead and put one button here.

74
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.330
Kind of up near the top and there comes our button.

75
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.390
So let's maybe say that's going to be a certain distance from the top and we're going to right click

76
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.930
and make makes sure that this gets centered horizontally.

77
00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.370
Next we need to have a button that's more down towards the bottom.

78
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:38.110
So kind of put that down towards the bottom and that will give the lay out a second here.

79
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.590
Maybe the button didn't come through.

80
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.740
Oh no.

81
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.200
There goes it's just extremely laggy.

82
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:50.650
So we'll select this button and we'll say you need to be connected to the bottom and let's make it the

83
00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.180
same distance to the bottom so eight of the top eight the bottom here and we'll right click and say

84
00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.120
you need to be centered horizontally then we are going to add in the text view.

85
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:06.160
So we're going to go grab a text for you bring it into the middle and all right click this guy and say

86
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.670
you should be centered horizontally and you should be centered vertically.

87
00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.080
So that should get us set up in both situations.

88
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:20.210
Now as far as this text view goes initially we want it to you know just have the text of zero.

89
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.360
So go ahead and put that in.

90
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.370
And that's really hard to read.

91
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.400
So I'm going to go ahead and view all attributes here and I'm going to increase the size of that.

92
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.270
So I'm going to go to tech size here.

93
00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.580
Let's maybe see what 30 looks like.

94
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:33.480
That's pretty big.

95
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.510
Let's maybe see what like 50 looks like.

96
00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.210
Now we're talking I think I think that's the right size.

97
00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:46.060
Now up here the top we want this to be a reset button so I'll just type in the name reset and down here

98
00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.680
at the bottom.

99
00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:51.470
This is going to be your plus one so I'm just going to do the plus side and the number one.

100
00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.340
Now the last thing that we need to do is connect up those methods.

101
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.610
So for plus one I'm going to copy this name of the method.

102
00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:04.330
Bring it back here and put that into the unclick and also get the name of research here and we'll go

103
00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.930
to our reset button and we'll change it on click method.

104
00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:09.590
OK.

105
00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.150
So with that in place let's go ahead and test this out see what it looks like.

106
00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:17.710
We'll start first on the round emulator here.

107
00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:21.700
We'll go ahead and get our emulators up and running here.

108
00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:28.650
Previous student of mine this was the app that got them interested in programming.

109
00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:37.240
He was actually a soccer referee and he needed a way to keep track of the time in the soccer match and

110
00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.750
he also needed to keep it a way to keep track of the score.

111
00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:44.890
So a little bit more of a complex app than this but that's what really got him interested and ultimately

112
00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.790
went on to making more and more apps beyond that.

113
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:53.020
But it just kind of reminiscent as we were making this app I thought yeah this reminds me of a previous

114
00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:54.020
student of mine.

115
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.760
So this here comes the app.

116
00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.500
Let's hit that plus one button.

117
00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.910
Oh and we have encountered an error.

118
00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.470
Let's go ahead and see what that's about.

119
00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:11.410
That was for a round so we'll make sure we have round selected and could not execute the on click scene.

120
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:13.920
It did not execute a method.

121
00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:17.830
OK.

122
00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:28.540
My guess here is that it couldn't find the proper are on clicks or maybe have bad names or something.

123
00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.570
So we have all lowercase reset here.

124
00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:34.870
But it was the plus one button that we were working with so let's go and see what that looks like.

125
00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:43.450
So we have on set as Plus one will go back and we have the name plus one there and let's see if we have

126
00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:44.970
the proper view coming through.

127
00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:47.690
I'm not sure what the issue is here.

128
00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:50.170
So this had nothing to do with our on click method.

129
00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:56.620
It was all about that we didn't give the proper ID to this text for you remember we had one set up for

130
00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:02.170
us and it had an ID down here of just simply text so we need to copy that idea of text.

131
00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:05.740
And for the text you there we'll go ahead and put that in.

132
00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:10.140
That should fix things for us so let's go ahead and try this one more time.

133
00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:14.040
We're going to run this for our round emulator here.

134
00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:17.470
We'll go ahead and wait for that to pop up.

135
00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:20.920
And here we go.

136
00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.680
Fingers crossed this doesn't die on us.

137
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:24.820
And look at that we can keep upping the score.

138
00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:27.430
We can reset it back to zero and keep upping that.

139
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:30.340
And just for kicks let's go ahead and stop this one.

140
00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:34.340
Let's go ahead and run it on our Square see what that looks like.

141
00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:39.310
So we'll go ahead and hit run on that.

142
00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:39.770
Look at that.

143
00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:44.810
This one's came up much faster than before we get our plus button boom.

144
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:45.870
It's excellent.
