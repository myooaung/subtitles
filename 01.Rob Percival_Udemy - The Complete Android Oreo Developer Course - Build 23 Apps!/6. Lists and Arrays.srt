1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,520
So I misspoke in the last lecture I said that this was going to be about four loops it's actually going

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,380
to be about lists and arrays so listen arrays in cotland pretty straightforward.

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:16,190
The most simple simple way to make them let's say I want to make a variable of my lucky numbers and

4
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:22,540
say var lucky numbers is going to be equal to you just type list of.

5
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:31,610
And you don't have to specify the type inside those angle brackets you could just say like 1 6 7 8 3.

6
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,940
You just have to separate the items by commas and then all of sudden you have a list.

7
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:42,240
Same thing if you want to do an array you just have to say array of like that.

8
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,650
And all of a sudden now you have an array of ints.

9
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,930
Now if you want to make an empty array and not specify the type you can say array of.

10
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,690
And then inside of the angle brackets you just have to say what's going to be in there for example I

11
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:59,130
might say you know this is going to be an array of ints if you want to see that.

12
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,700
Now with both arrays and lists you can't grow or shrink them.

13
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,970
So if you want to be able to do something like that you need a mutable list so you can say for example

14
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:16,020
mutable list of and provide something like a set of numbers here I'll just go ahead and put some in.

15
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:22,620
Then if you want to add onto these you can you can say lucky numbers add and specify.

16
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:26,460
You know that one you want it to go at a specific position.

17
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:32,550
So if I had like the number five I can say that this should go in at position zero or something like

18
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,130
that.

19
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,240
That's totally fine.

20
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:41,310
Or if you just want to straight up provide something in there you could just say I want to add the number

21
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:41,790
four.

22
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:42,370
That's it.

23
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,490
That's valid code.

24
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:45,860
Other functions that come with here.

25
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,790
Really if you just hit the dot you're going to see you can remove at.

26
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,020
You can replace things you can turn things into a set.

27
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,210
All sorts of stuff.

28
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:59,400
But again if you want to grab something out of an array or a list you just do square brackets after

29
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:04,820
the name of your list or array and then say you know I want something from position zero and if you

30
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:09,780
know we go ahead and do a print line of this let's go ahead and do this.

31
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:16,550
You should see us get back to the very first value which is a 1 and so we'll wait for that look there

32
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:23,040
is it is there and if I give it a position of 3 for example that should give us the very last item in

33
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,670
the list so the number 6 we'll see if that works.

34
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,230
And look there it is.

35
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:33,780
Now if you want to get the size of a list you just do dot size and it's going to give you back an int

36
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:34,780
shall we.

37
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:38,460
So we should see the number four come through here and look.

38
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,140
There it is.

39
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,470
So really that's the lowdown on lists an array.

40
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,240
Pretty straightforward.

41
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,240
Again there are some differences between lists in array.

42
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:53,740
If you really want to get technical into it but honestly in most cases it's not going to be a huge deal.

43
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,010
So you can use those almost interchangeably.

44
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:01,210
But again if you really want to be able to grow and shrink the size of the list you've got to have a

45
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,330
mutable list in order to do that.

46
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:06,910
OK so let me go ahead and give you a quick challenge here.

47
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,180
It's going to be really straightforward.

48
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:15,090
Make a list of your favorite movies.

49
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,200
That's it Jane.

50
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,770
So go ahead hip hop on the video and do that now.

51
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,160
OK.

52
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:26,960
So hopefully that went well should be pretty straightforward.

53
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:31,270
I'm mostly interested to see what your favorite movies are so please leave it as a comment it'd be interesting

54
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,090
to see.

55
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,480
So I'm going to make a variable.

56
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:44,260
Fav movies and in mine listing is a list of and I might put inside of here or something like sandlot.

57
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:50,200
And another one of my favorite movies is Emperor's New Groove.

58
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,650
I'm sure I didn't spell that correctly.

59
00:03:52,660 --> 00:04:01,330
And another favorite of mine is probably fast and the Furious.

60
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,790
And again I'm going to spell that wrong.

61
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:09,880
But anyways there are some of my favorite movies hopefully your spelling is a little bit better than

62
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,290
mine.

63
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:16,340
One thing that I did want to mention really quickly is that if you want to specify the type of A-list

64
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:24,010
or an array you can do that by saying Here you do do for example Capitol list and then in the angle

65
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,020
brackets you say what's going to be inside of there.

66
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,030
So in this case it would be a string.

67
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:34,060
Say OK this is going to be a list of string objects if you ever need to specify the type of a list you

68
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,320
can do that by doing this.
