1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:07,380
Now it's time to build the final activity in our whatsapp clone the chat activity and this is actually

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,340
going to be fairly straightforward.

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:21,370
We're going to bring in a simple plain text field which will go the bottom of the screen and we'll be

4
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:24,460
full with and that will be where the user can post

5
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:27,800
their chat

6
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:40,850
so I'll call this chat at a text and then we're going to use a list view to display past chats.

7
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:47,760
So let's try again how list we want to align the list view with the chat edit text.

8
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,080
So I'm going to bring that in.

9
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,240
Like that's.

10
00:00:53,730 --> 00:01:03,610
And then look at our list view just above our chat edit text and we'll call this jet stream.

11
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:05,640
There we go.

12
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,790
All right so we've got two jobs here.

13
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:13,640
We want the user to be able to send a chat and we want to be able to view all the past chats in the

14
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,980
last few.

15
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,190
So I come to think of it will also need a button

16
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,930
which you put in the bottom right them

17
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:31,660
which will be a send chat button.

18
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:41,970
Right.

19
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:46,080
So let's do the send chat part first.

20
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:53,910
And we'll do that with a public method called Send chat

21
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,030
and we're going to need to know the active user here.

22
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:08,160
So I'm going to define my active user

23
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,000
initially just as an empty string.

24
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:27,830
And now to get the chat content I'm going to need to know the content of the chat at it.

25
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,320
TEXT

26
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:42,190
So let's get that text or call it chat edit text.

27
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:51,350
That's going to be an edit text found by Thaiday resources dot ID dot chat text.

28
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:54,770
Then we can create a pause object

29
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:06,740
called message and this is going to be a new parse object with a class of message.

30
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:13,120
And for our messages are we going to need to keep track of is the sender the recipient and the message

31
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,660
itself.

32
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:24,710
So let's say there is say message don't put will have senda and that could be our current user so pass

33
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:29,930
user get current user to get username.

34
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,860
We're going to need the recipient

35
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,440
which is going to be the active user

36
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,520
and then we'll need the message

37
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,220
which will be added text.

38
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:59,040
Don't get text don't to strain.

39
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,100
And then we'll take a message.

40
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:08,370
Save it in the background with a new safe callback.

41
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,440
And then as long as there's no error

42
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:18,030
we'll just let the user know that that's been successful.

43
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:30,650
OK so far so simple let's give it a go.

44
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:40,380
So try and send Keston a message tap send and it's looking good.

45
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:47,270
Just make sure I that in Firefox will refresh the past dashboard.

46
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,350
And now we can see that message that

47
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:55,400
prelim send up Rob recipient Keston.

48
00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:00,150
Well with that let's just add a quick response.

49
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:15,380
Say hi how's it going from Caston to rap.

50
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,510
Right.

51
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,540
So now we're going to need to display all of these messages.

52
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:30,540
We'll do that in the on create method.

53
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:31,860
So we'll need

54
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:43,250
an array list of strings to keep track of the messages.

55
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,520
I will also need an array adapter.

56
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,770
What Without list view.

57
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,070
So let's find the chat.

58
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:11,130
List v..

59
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:18,340
It's going to be LSV which we find by its id our ID chat list we

60
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,200
Melosa set up the Araya adapter.

61
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,680
Going it be a new array adapter.

62
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:41,700
Using this as the context Android are taught lay out dot simple list item one has they lay out and then

63
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,050
messages as the linked list.

64
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:53,190
Then because I'm feeling confident I'm going to go straight into the parse query

65
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:02,600
can be equal Pasch query on past objects this time which I'll call query

66
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:13,870
and then this is going to be a new parse query and querying the message class.

67
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:18,680
We created Ophir.

68
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,140
Now we want to do something very slightly different to what we've done before.

69
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:29,160
We want to do a double query because we're going to be looking for messages that are sent and received

70
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,710
by our user.

71
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:38,960
So we're looking for where the sender is equal to rob or the recipient is equal to rob and of course

72
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,040
the other way round.

73
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:47,150
If the sender is Rob we want to make sure the recipient is Keston So we're going to need two queries

74
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,600
to do that.

75
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:57,790
So I'm actually going to rename that query one and then we can see set query one

76
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:13,170
where the sender is equal to our current user so pass user get current user to get username

77
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:19,750
and we want the recipient

78
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:29,590
to be the active user the person that we're currently communicating with.

79
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,930
I've been going to create a second pass query

80
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:40,230
on Pozzo objects which I'll call query to which will be a new POS query.

81
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:52,290
Again on the message class and this time we want it the other way around so when the recipient

82
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:55,850
is equal to a

83
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:00,440
the current use of

84
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,760
and all say they send the

85
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,200
must be equal to the active user.

86
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,480
OK then we take these two queries and combine them into a single query.

87
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:29,880
When we do that by putting them into a list.

88
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:40,240
So this is going to be a list of pass queries and both the past queries I pass objects

89
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,400
Huckle this queries

90
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:50,140
and this is going to be a new list

91
00:09:53,540 --> 00:10:06,750
on past queries containing POS objects you know just get in the wrong place that they're.

92
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:12,650
So then we take our queries and we add query 1 to it.

93
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,060
And then we add query to

94
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:29,110
and then finally we create our main query

95
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,130
in the usual way.

96
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,250
But this time we use past query

97
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:47,070
and you can see at the bottom that we've got dot all.

98
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:57,810
And then we put out a list of queries in and that's how in past you run or queries i.e. when we want

99
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:02,270
to check for one set of things being true or another set of things being true.

100
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:05,740
It's a little bit based but hopefully that makes sense.

101
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:18,220
And we want to order those by date so we'll take our query and order by descending.

102
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:23,930
And the thing we want to check for is they created out of date

103
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,490
that we gave.

104
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,060
So now we've got to have Querrey will find it in the background

105
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,440
with of course a new find Colback

106
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,860
then will check to make sure there's no error

107
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,750
and that we have some objects

108
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,350
and if that's the case we'll get through the

109
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,400
each of these is going to be pass objects which are core message

110
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:16,410
in objects and then we want to add them to our messages.

111
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,750
Frailest which recreates it up here.

112
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:20,690
There it is

113
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:32,370
and I'll actually start by clearing messages just in case.

114
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:39,180
And then we want to add them to messages but we do want a way to make it clear which ones are from us

115
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:42,180
and which ones are from the other user.

116
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,490
So obviously lots of ways you can do that.

117
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:50,370
I'm going to use a very simple way and just append a greater than sign at the beginning if it's from

118
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:53,970
the other use of.

119
00:12:54,170 --> 00:13:06,410
So let's create a string not a string tokenizer just a string called message content and this will initially

120
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:16,700
be message don't get string and it's the message string where the message is contained

121
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:27,240
and then we'll just check to see if the sender I message get string

122
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:34,080
sender is not the current user.

123
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:38,550
So pass user get current user

124
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,480
get username

125
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:52,010
when in fact we should use as their strings equals

126
00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:00,960
rather than the equal t.

127
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,760
There we go.

128
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,700
But we do want that not to be the case.

129
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,790
We'll put you on the front.

130
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:12,960
So if the senda is not our user then we'll add the greater than sign to the beginning of the story.

131
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:16,870
So I will just use message content equals

132
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:22,890
greater than sign and then message content.

133
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:26,910
There we go.

134
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,080
Then we'll append that to messages

135
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:43,250
and then when we're done so just message content.

136
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:51,560
I want to append and then when we finished we'll take our array adapter and notify that the data set

137
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,880
has changed

138
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:57,040
and there we go.

139
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:04,010
There's just one thing I think I've forgotten to add and that is I haven't actually applied the array

140
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:07,430
adapter to the checklist view.

141
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:14,570
So let's do that then we get.

142
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,350
All right.

143
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:19,870
So that's one of the more complex queries that we've done on paths.

144
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:23,180
But it's the only way to do or queries here.

145
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:29,980
You set up to individual queries and then combine them as a list.

146
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:36,640
And now we should be able to tap on Keston and see the messages that have been sent both ways.

147
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,110
Let's take a look.

148
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,350
And there we go.

149
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:45,000
So we can see both of those messages.

150
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:55,080
And probably worth noting that we've got the newest at the top there is generally considered best in

151
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,870
chat apps today the newest at the bottom.

152
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:01,330
So let's just change that the order by ascending.

153
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,480
All right.

154
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,070
So we're pretty much done.

155
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:09,270
The only thing I want to change is that when the user sends the message currently it's not added to

156
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:12,450
their chat so let's fix that.

157
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:23,230
Well save it for the save Colback if you want to make your app appear even faster.

158
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:28,420
You can always do it straight away there perhaps have some kind of symbol which updates when it's actually

159
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:29,170
been sent.

160
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:31,940
Just put it in the safe in background callback.

161
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:35,340
And all we need to do is add it to messages

162
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:53,940
and again we want to chat and text to get text got to straight and then update the array adapter to

163
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,800
notify it that it's been changed.

164
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,370
All right so let's check that out.

165
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:11,180
We should now find that when we send a message it appears almost immediately on the chat left.

166
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,870
And here we go.

167
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:15,660
So few that chat again.

168
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:18,430
There it is.

169
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,240
Reply.

170
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,350
Great thanks.

171
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:22,560
How are you.

172
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:30,240
Send and then it appears there when it's been successfully sent.

173
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,170
All right.

174
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:35,760
So pretty much they're the only slight thing is that we don't really want the message to still be there

175
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,250
in the box after we sent it.

176
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,480
So let's make it disappear

177
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,180
straight after we have sent it here.

178
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:52,430
So would just use jet and it takes a set text to empty.

179
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:59,780
And of course if we're going to do that we need to store the content of it before we use it down there.

180
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:02,390
So that's create a string

181
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:11,880
message content which reach out at it text don't get text

182
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:15,770
talk to string

183
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:21,670
and in fact we can make that up slightly more efficient.

184
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,960
By using message content there as well

185
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:31,440
and then here

186
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:37,570
we use message content again.

187
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:45,420
All right so a final check we should now find that our chat added text content disappears ready for

188
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,740
a new message.

189
00:18:50,840 --> 00:19:01,460
When we've sent our message I can say once again over to this chat and let's ask her if she wants some

190
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,550
coffee.

191
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:03,950
And there we go.

192
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:07,500
So that's deleted content ready for a new message.

193
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:09,680
Terrific.

194
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:17,050
So we now have our what's at play with the basic functionality replicated.

195
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:21,630
Of course there's a huge amount we could add to this including sending things like images and videos

196
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:24,300
including Read receipts and a lot more.

197
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:27,860
But I'll leave that to you and I'll end my whatsapp clone here.

198
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:33,100
Congratulations on making it to the end of the developer part of this course.

199
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:38,370
Now we're going to move straight on and see how you can market those fantastic apps that you're going

200
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:41,850
to build using the skills that you've learned in this course.
