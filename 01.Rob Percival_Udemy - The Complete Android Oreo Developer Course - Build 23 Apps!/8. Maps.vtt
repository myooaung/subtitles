00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.170
In this lecture we're going to be learning about maps and and other programming language.

2
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.530
You've probably heard them referred to as dictionaries.

3
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:13.350
The basic concept here is that it's a key value pairing storage so the idea is you know you put something

4
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:18.620
in like you might have strings for your keys for your values and if you provide a certain key then you'll

5
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.840
get back a certain value.

6
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.620
So to kind of go through an example with this a classic example that I always do is if you're going

7
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.960
to create a map or a dictionary about some dogs where you want to look up a dog's age.

8
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.030
So what we're going to do is we're going to make a new variable called dogs.

9
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.130
And this is going to be a map about dogs.

10
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.350
So to create a new map you type map of just like we kind of did for a list of array.

11
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:49.860
And it's going to ask you for the type if you specify here you don't have to do that but basically like

12
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.320
I said for with dogs if I was going to give you know names for the keys and age for the value I would

13
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.990
do something like Fido for my key space too.

14
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.190
And then I would give some sort of you know value here which I want to be in it because I want to say

15
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:11.640
you know Fido is eight years old and this is one of the entries inside of the map.

16
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.320
So if I do another one maybe I have another dog named Sarah Sarah too.

17
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.460
And let's say Sarah is 17 years old.

18
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.910
Boom.

19
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.260
We have another entry in there.

20
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.480
Let's do one more.

21
00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.700
So let's have a dog named Shawn.

22
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.190
Shawn to six and all sudden with this map now we have three entries in there and if we ever want to

23
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.870
get something out of this map we can just say dogs do the square bracket and then you have to provide

24
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.790
a key that's important here right.

25
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:45.750
Like we've got to do one of these strings and so if I do capital Feydeau that should give me the age

26
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:46.090
of eight.

27
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.880
So let's go ahead and do a print line.

28
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.790
Make sure that this is everything we thought it was OK.

29
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.970
We'll go ahead and run this and look at that.

30
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.440
We get the number 8 printed out.

31
00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:58.790
OK.

32
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.470
So the one thing that I'm going to I mean really that's it for maps if you ever want to know anything

33
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:05.020
more about it.

34
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.320
I guess one more thing that I should point into right like if you want to add an extra entry on to here

35
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.330
right like you're saying OK I'm going to add a completely new dog.

36
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.210
The name's going to be Jeremy and I'm going to set this equal to something like 52.

37
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.130
Man this is like a really old dog.

38
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.250
The issue that you're going to have here is that the map is not mutable so in order to do that you have

39
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:36.120
to say mutable map of and just keep everything like it was.

40
00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.610
Now you're able to add new things on to your map if you'd like to.

41
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.220
OK.

42
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:48.330
So my challenge for you is to make a map that holds

43
00:02:50.670 --> 00:03:00.630
three words and three definitions of slang you use so kind and the idea for this comes from like Urban

44
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.460
Dictionary so think of some word that you use or you could just even make it up on the fly.

45
00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:12.600
So if I say something like programming cheese maybe this is my slang for whenever I eat mac and cheese

46
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.120
while I'm programming that's probably Philemon's example in the world but I want you to make a map where

47
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.170
you have strings for key strings for values.

48
00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.350
But the idea is you could look up some sort of word in this map to find the definition.

49
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.580
So go ahead hit pause in the video and do this now.

50
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:37.320
All right hopefully that went well for you if you have any especially funny or odd definitions and words

51
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:42.210
I would love to hear them let me go ahead and make the best that I can here so I'm going to say something

52
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:53.430
like I'm going to do all this time sort of are going to say nix slang is equal to a new map of.

53
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:59.700
And this time just for kicks I'm going to provide the type so I'm going to say string comma string just

54
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:06.480
because I can go ahead put the i in there and you've got to spell this stuff correctly or it's not going

55
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.710
to work.

56
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.440
So the first word let's go with what I had before.

57
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:25.530
So programming she's going to say this is to coding and eating mac and cheese and that's like the dumbest

58
00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.840
definition in the world.

59
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.330
Let's go ahead and think of another sort of random word grub.

60
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.350
That's one that I use sometimes that people don't know the definition of although I feel like that's

61
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.610
pretty standard.

62
00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.980
That's a you know food.

63
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.700
Like I'm going to go grub I'm going to go get something to eat.

64
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:46.740
I'm going to go.

65
00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.130
I guess maybe I'll clarify here it's to eat food.

66
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:55.570
If you're going to grub and then the last one of my slang dictionary.

67
00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.020
Geez I don't have very many good words in my life.

68
00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.930
I guess one cool thing is Rick is my summer name instead of Nick.

69
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:12.180
So summer name of Nick every month from May 1st of September 1st I go by Rick instead of Nick.

70
00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:18.090
So those are probably the worst examples in the history of programming courses.

71
00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.470
But you know what we got through it we're still alive and the next one we're going to be talking about

72
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.370
functions and we're almost done with this you've been flying through.

73
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.330
Let's keep up the pace Let's keep going.
