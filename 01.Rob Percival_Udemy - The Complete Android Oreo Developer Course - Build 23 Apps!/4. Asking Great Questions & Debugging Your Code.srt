1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,580
During the course you'll probably have a few problems with your code.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,390
It won't work as you expect it to.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,880
You'll get bugs and you'll probably be pretty frustrated.

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,550
So I'd like to take a couple of minutes right now to show you how best to deal with those situations

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:18,630
when they arise and how to get answers super quickly.

6
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,510
So step one is debug your code.

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,700
Usual thing is to check for error messages.

8
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,750
So I would have a look in the compiler in the browser wherever it is that you're working to see exactly

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,040
what's causing the problem.

10
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,170
You can normally get a line number as well and then you can just use that to hopefully work out where

11
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,940
the error messages had in that bracket or the semi-colon or whatever it is that is missing and move

12
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,920
on with the course.

13
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,560
Failing that my usual advice is to remove all the code that you just added until it works again.

14
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:56,230
And then add it in gradually one line by line then you should find that at some point it will stop working.

15
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,040
If it doesn't and your problem solved.

16
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,940
But if it does at least then you know exactly where the problem is and you can start to find solutions

17
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:03,590
to it.

18
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:10,620
Finally if that doesn't help compay your code against my demo code all the lectures have code built

19
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:16,290
in to them so that you can download and then you can see what is different in your code and hopefully

20
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,550
see if that is causing the problem.

21
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:20,520
All right.

22
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:23,830
So what if you've done all this debugging and you still can't get it working.

23
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:30,340
Well step three and this is what makes you a real programmer is learning how to find solutions online.

24
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:35,300
So it's pretty straightforward really it is just googling my general approach is to google the specific

25
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:40,580
error message that you've got and if you don't have an error message then get one either from the compiler

26
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:45,920
from the browser from X code whatever it is and then Google that along with the name of the programming

27
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,500
language almost certainly at least one person if not several people have had that exact same problem.

28
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:55,430
And there's probably a solution right there on Stack Overflow for you.

29
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,150
So that's issue number one.

30
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:00,860
If that doesn't help then you can always google how do I do.

31
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,020
And then whatever it is you're trying to do.

32
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:06,040
Again put the name of the programming language in there as well.

33
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:10,760
And that will probably get you a few lines of code which will achieve exactly what you want.

34
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:15,530
You can either paste those in and move on or you can see what was different about those to the code

35
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,510
that you were using.

36
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:19,180
And then hopefully work out where you are going wrong.

37
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,710
And then once again move on with the course.

38
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,050
All right.

39
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,410
Occasionally of course you will have to ask them questions.

40
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,980
And that's absolutely fine.

41
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:34,070
I love that we've got 200000 people in the forums for these courses and people are extremely helpful

42
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,890
and I want to get answers to your questions as quickly as possible.

43
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,890
So the main thing here is to ask good questions.

44
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:47,140
I've answered thousands of simple questions now over these courses and I know what makes a good question.

45
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,910
So first off Be positive.

46
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:56,120
I know you're feeling frustrated and often that can leak out into when you're asking a question but

47
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,290
if you keep things positive you're much more likely to get an answer.

48
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,030
So ask very nicely for help.

49
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:04,970
So you'd be very grateful for anyone that can help you out and you're much more likely to get a quick

50
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:07,610
and helpful response.

51
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,310
Secondly be specific.

52
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:14,750
So don't just paste in a massive load of code and say this doesn't work what's wrong but once you've

53
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:19,220
done all the error checking in the debugging you should know exactly where your problem is.

54
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:24,680
So send a screenshot of that code or send the few lines of code that are not working along with the

55
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,500
error message so that we know exactly where you're going wrong.

56
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:33,680
And then once again you should get a nice quick and accurate response to your question.

57
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,880
If you can t give a link to your code in action.

58
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,980
So this is particularly useful for the web course but maybe for other courses as well.

59
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,970
Either give a link on your web hosting or to just been dot com or another site where your code is actually

60
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:47,640
running.

61
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:52,400
Then we can make changes and test it out and we should be able to get back to you even quicker with

62
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,400
a solution.

63
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,920
Finally once you've got your solution.

64
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,590
Thanks someone if they've helped you.

65
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:03,370
I've looked back over the forums and the vast majority of helpful comments are not thanked at all.

66
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,540
Which doesn't encourage people to help people again.

67
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:10,390
So please do just go back and say thanks that was really helpful so that they know that they've helped

68
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,630
you.

69
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,850
And last but not least while you're there.

70
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,410
Why not see if you can answer someone else's question.

71
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:21,670
If you've had help from me or from other people during the course then it's great to give back a little

72
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:25,140
to the cause and then help a few other people as well.

73
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:29,680
So while you've asked your question just answer a couple of other peoples and then that will keep the

74
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:36,630
love flowing and keep everyone happy and progressing in that coding Korea's so enjoy the course and

75
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,110
I'll see you in the forums.
