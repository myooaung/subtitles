00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.530
So before we move on to our hiking up there one more skill that I want to teach you and that's reverse

2
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:05.370
geocoding.

3
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.610
So the basic idea is that you give some sort of location.

4
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.090
Google Maps will give you back information about that location.

5
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.470
For example it's address that's all we're going to make is an app that can sort of take an address and

6
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.060
then get us back from there.

7
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.220
So we want to move forward with our map and location demo that we had from last time we just kind of

8
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.010
want to extend this just a little bit so we can do something cool.

9
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:34.050
Every time that we get a new address so we are going to move up to where we have the code for on location

10
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.120
change of course we still want to you know clear the map and then add all the new stuff.

11
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.690
That's great.

12
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.180
That's fine but there is one extra thing that we'd like to do and that's to work with something called

13
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.440
a geocoder.

14
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.930
So again Google Maps makes this incredibly simple that we pass at any latitude and longitude.

15
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.370
And then it's going to turn it into an address for us which is just great great stuff.

16
00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:03.330
So what we're going to do first is we're just going to type out geocoder and we'll call this geocoder.

17
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:13.200
And with this geocoder we got a new geocoder and we are going to set this up with our application context

18
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:21.450
and from there we're going to go ahead and pass our low cal dot default.

19
00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.920
So you might be wondering what this locale stuff is.

20
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.690
Well you'll notice if you do locale dot there's all sorts of different locales right in these different

21
00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.730
locations around the world.

22
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:36.960
But if you do get default what this does is it basically says hey whatever the users current phone is

23
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.750
and if they're in Canada or if they're in the U.K. U.S. Japan or wherever it is that uses that locale

24
00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.000
in order to get back the address information.

25
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.270
So once we've gone ahead and gotten that in place then we can go about trying to get some information

26
00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:53.910
from our particular location.

27
00:01:53.910 --> 00:02:01.990
So to do this we just access the geocoder we're going to say geocoder get from.

28
00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.430
And we want get from location.

29
00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.000
So this means we have to provide it a latitude and longitude and you can see this is where we can get

30
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.410
back that information.

31
00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.690
So we're going to use our location object we're going to say location dot latitude that we're going

32
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:23.440
to say location that longitude and the last thing we asked for is the max results that we want back

33
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.050
because if you give to a particular location maybe a couple of different addresses around.

34
00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.960
And you know you're wondering OK well which one of these is supposed to be correct.

35
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.300
Well you know you just want to give something there.

36
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.460
So let's just go ahead and do one to say just give us your best match of whatever it is that you found.

37
00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.290
Now this is going to require a try catch.

38
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.790
So let's go ahead and just hover over here so we can get the auto try catch.

39
00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.890
I'm going to change this instead of IO exception.

40
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.980
I'd like to do it just for all exceptions.

41
00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:59.440
But once we have that we will go ahead and do a little bit of work with this and the first thing that

42
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.460
we basically want to do is make sure that we got back some information.

43
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:10.990
And so this geocoder it passes back a list of things and so we have to go ahead and put this into a

44
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:19.840
variable so we're going to say list not list view we want a list.

45
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:27.520
And we this is going to be a list of addresses just like that or we're going to give it the name of

46
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.670
list addresses.

47
00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.590
OK.

48
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.130
So that's going to be equal to this geocoder thing then we got to check and see if we actually got the

49
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:37.830
info that we were looking for.

50
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.480
So let's set up an if statement.

51
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:47.550
And inside of their first check and see if list addresses is not equal to know if it's equal to know

52
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.330
that means we've got back nothing.

53
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.500
And the next thing that we want to check for is make sure that there's actually something there.

54
00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:00.730
So we're going to say list addresses that size and we're going to make sure that that is greater than

55
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:01.400
zero.

56
00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:02.500
OK.

57
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.960
So if this all works then this means that we actually have an address that we can work with.

58
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:15.730
So we're going to go ahead and do a log will say log that i we're going to pass in the here place info

59
00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:23.140
and the second parameter that we'll throw in there is our list addresses and we're going to get the

60
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:28.660
first item in there because we only asked for one right in here and we said list address Maxtor results

61
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:35.650
one then with that we want to go ahead and convert that to a string so that we can see it.

62
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:36.360
OK.

63
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.670
So now that we've got this in place let's go ahead and run our app.

64
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:42.050
OK.

65
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:47.350
So we should be able to if we move to a particular location and we send that information we should get

66
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.810
that back.

67
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.700
So let's go ahead and find a place that we can actually look for.

68
00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.550
Be cool maybe do something in New York.

69
00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:03.480
So let's just search for New York let's do Empire State Building Empire State Building.

70
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.310
So should have a link for a map here.

71
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:13.760
Here we go and we'll go ahead and inside of this your all we can find that latitude and longitude on

72
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:19.370
that copy latitude Let's open up our simulator here emulator.

73
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:30.140
Plug that in there and then we need the longitude and we'll copy that OK once we pass those and then

74
00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.680
we'll go ahead and send this and look at that.

75
00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.110
Oh it took us to Antarctica.

76
00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.670
That's not what I was expecting.

77
00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.720
Let me go back and see did we miss something here.

78
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.040
Does this I mean is this supposed to be negative.

79
00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.760
No I don't think that's our problem.

80
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:58.910
Let's see what happens if this is a positive 73 and that still puts us way above let's see what happens

81
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.150
if I do negative there.

82
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.480
Now that puts us in Greenland.

83
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.820
Wow.

84
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:03.180
OK.

85
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:10.480
Well I'm a little bit shocked that our latitude and longitude are so off let's separate tab.

86
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:17.840
Maybe we can't trust that latitude and longitude for New York.

87
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.410
Let's just see if we're even within the right ballpark here.

88
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:28.730
So 40 in 74 they're saying that both of those should be positive.

89
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.830
So 40 and 74.

90
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:42.640
Maybe I mix the two around so maybe this needs to go here and then this needs to be 40 now.

91
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.900
Let me go ahead and take a look at this real quick.

92
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:47.240
All right.

93
00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.490
So I finally figured out what the issue was.

94
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:55.140
My latitude and longitude were off so I finally got those things hammered in and look at that.

95
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.690
We're in New York and hopefully at the Empire State Building here.

96
00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:05.600
So once we've done that let's go ahead and go to log cat and you can see all the different places we

97
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.170
were going as we tried to find the correct location.

98
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:13.160
So that's pretty cool to see all those different addresses there.

99
00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:19.680
And look I mean that this last one we got to New York so there's geocoding isn't perfect because.

100
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:20.300
Right.

101
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:21.620
Let's go ahead and look.

102
00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.810
This is West 33rd Street in New York.

103
00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:32.930
OK and if we go ahead and go back and look at the Empire State Building this says you know Fifth Avenue.

104
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:38.480
So I mean it is on that 31 32 33.

105
00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:43.670
So I mean I think it's you know pretty close there but I mean it's not the exact address but I think

106
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:46.880
you could use it fairly reliably to at least get in the ballpark.

107
00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:52.400
I mean an interesting thing to do would be to take the address that we get from our app here and then

108
00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.540
plug that back in.

109
00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:58.490
Which leads us to the next thing is how do we take this object this address object and turn it into

110
00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:04.280
something that we can actually read and that the user can understand right like this West 33rd Street

111
00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:06.610
and all that good stuff there.

112
00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:07.200
OK.

113
00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:10.370
So let's go ahead and talk about how we can do that.

114
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:17.630
So what we're going to do is let's give ourselves some space to work here after we've successfully made

115
00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:21.000
sure that we've got an address here that we can work with.

116
00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:24.790
Let's go ahead and make a string that we're going to call address.

117
00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:31.250
And this initially is just going to be equal to an empty string and we're going to fill this address

118
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:36.140
up over time with information about the particular location.

119
00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:39.990
So when we do this we kind of have to work through a couple of layers of stuff.

120
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:44.690
And let's go ahead and take a look again at log cat like what are some of the things that we'd want

121
00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:46.440
to get out of here.

122
00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:55.580
So if we go ahead and look some of these be could be like the locality New York that seems to be the

123
00:08:55.850 --> 00:09:01.280
like state for example or maybe admin is going to be that also.

124
00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:03.020
Right because we're in New York State.

125
00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:04.250
New York City.

126
00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:05.930
Let's see admen Pennsylvania.

127
00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:14.690
So when we were over here locality Fredericktown OK so the localities the city the admins the state.

128
00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:18.620
Right and you can see we can just kind of go through here the thoroughfare that seems to be like the

129
00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:22.430
actual address so we kind of want to work through those pieces.

130
00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:25.520
And again this is going to change depending on what your locality is.

131
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:31.640
Again you know if you're in the UK or China or Japan like I'm sure these are going to have different

132
00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:36.410
names as you're moving through here unless this is some sort of standard things for addresses I think

133
00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:40.150
you'd have to play around with it for whatever your address type is.

134
00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.940
But regardless you find something that you want for example the admin.

135
00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:47.490
So we've figured out the admin is equal to the state.

136
00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:50.550
So what we're going to do is create an if statement.

137
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:52.550
Let's get that all set up.

138
00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:56.570
And we first want to check and make sure that there's actually an actual thing there because you can

139
00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:59.000
see sometimes like the sub admins are equal to.

140
00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:02.840
No we're not going to be using sub admin in this situation.

141
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:08.210
But you know for example if admin was equal to NULL for some reason we would want to be able to appropriately

142
00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:09.290
handle that.

143
00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:14.820
So what we're going to do is first talk to our list addresses get zero.

144
00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:21.760
That's getting that first address object and then with that we're going to do not yet.

145
00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:24.320
And there's all sorts of different items here right.

146
00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:29.180
So there's you know your rules and stuff like that we want to get the admin.

147
00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:31.280
So we're going to get admin area.

148
00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:36.930
And so once we get this admin area and just to check to show you what that is that gives us back a string.

149
00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:42.410
We want to check and see what this is equal to and we're not trying to see if it's an empty string or

150
00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:46.090
something like that we want to make sure that this thing is not equal to null.

151
00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:49.910
No basically means that it doesn't exist something went wrong like that.

152
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:52.400
And so we're just checking for knowability here.

153
00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:57.890
So if this thing is not know then we're going to say OK you know what we're going to take our address

154
00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:04.060
and we're going to plus equal this line of code here where we go and get the admin right.

155
00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:08.900
So this is throwing essentially the state onto their case.

156
00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:13.700
So once we go ahead and get that in place as not only do we want to throw the state we also want to

157
00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:19.820
throw on a space here so that we can add the next thing that's coming on the list and it's going to

158
00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:20.540
be pretty similar.

159
00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:25.420
So I think the next thing we'd look for is the city which in this case looks like New York.

160
00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:34.460
So just go ahead and copy this and paste below instead of get admin area are you going to look for get

161
00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:36.950
locality.

162
00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:39.580
There we go and we want to change this.

163
00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:46.290
Get the for here as well so that you know we're adding the appropriate thing to the address there.

164
00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:54.940
So once we've got that in place the next thing that we're going to be looking for is the thoroughfare.

165
00:11:55.240 --> 00:12:03.260
And so we'll go ahead and just copy and paste what we had before but this time we want that thoroughfare

166
00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:09.720
because that seems to be thoroughfare because that seems to be where we can get that information.

167
00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:15.760
Let's see is that I think that's about all that we're looking for latitude longitude.

168
00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:20.050
Even some of these try and get the phone number that's kind of interesting there.

169
00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:22.560
But yeah this looks pretty good.

170
00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:31.440
So let's make sure we get thoroughfare here that we are copying and pasting that down below we don't

171
00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:36.400
have to do the extra space there at the end because that's going to be the very last one.

172
00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:42.210
But once you've gone ahead and gotten all those different pieces I mean you could get more detailed

173
00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:47.690
if you want you could go and get the country name and stuff like that right like that.

174
00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.930
Let's see it's listing USA.

175
00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:51.690
I'm wondering what the name is to that.

176
00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:55.290
There we go country name United States country code U.S..

177
00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:57.090
You can go grab that you need and get the postcode.

178
00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:59.010
Maybe that's at the postcode.

179
00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:03.780
So let's see right now would be like New York New York.

180
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:12.690
I'm just thinking about how we do addresses and typically we do the street address first and then let's

181
00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:14.510
go ahead and have something on to here.

182
00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:24.230
And we usually do the city and then whoops.

183
00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:27.450
Let me cut and paste this.

184
00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:28.190
All right.

185
00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:34.700
So we've got the street we've got the city we've got the state maybe we're a tween city and state we're

186
00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:39.470
going to put the zip code in there that's I think something that would be good or call it here the postal

187
00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:45.410
code so let's copy one of these changes to get postal code.

188
00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:46.430
All right.

189
00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:51.950
So copy and paste update that and then for our last one here where we get the the state will get rid

190
00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:53.540
of the extra space.

191
00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:53.960
All right.

192
00:13:53.990 --> 00:14:02.390
So all of that work to go get this address and we'll go ahead here we'll make a toast and ring and say

193
00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.190
toaster make text.

194
00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:06.770
We'll go ahead and pass in the maps.

195
00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:15.200
Activity dot this also pass in this address string that we've been building up and then say how long

196
00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.970
we want to show it.

197
00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:23.660
We'll do short here and then we'll make sure we'll do a show at the end because I seem to always forget

198
00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:25.260
that.

199
00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:31.070
So that looks like all the code that we need to get this in order to work so let's go ahead and give

200
00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:31.540
this a run.

201
00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:37.940
Again depending on where you live or how you want this address displayed you might want to change what

202
00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:41.630
this looks like here through the different parts that we get.

203
00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:46.370
But the big thing here is that we should be checking for the ability to make sure you know just in case

204
00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:50.220
we get know on something we can recover from that.

205
00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:55.220
So app opens up here should be on the Empire State Building.

206
00:14:55.220 --> 00:15:01.850
We'll go ahead and hit send here and look at that West 33rd Street New York 1 0 0 1 New York.

207
00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:09.050
So I'm also going to hear just because for fun I want to log in and plug back in the address and see

208
00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:11.380
how close it is to the Empire State Building.

209
00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:15.630
You know see how accurate Google is of an address.

210
00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:21.710
Google is providing here so we'll say something like address and that will provide the actual address

211
00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:22.440
there.

212
00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.550
And let's run this.

213
00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:25.940
Yeah this is kind of fun.

214
00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:33.980
You know we searched Google for the location of the Empire State Building got the latitude and longitude

215
00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:37.230
budget plugged it back into Google Maps to get the address.

216
00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:38.750
We'll see if it all matches out.

217
00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:44.450
I know that sounds kind of ridiculous that we're doing but we'll go ahead and send this the West 33rd

218
00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:47.480
Street and look that printed out down there for us.

219
00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:50.240
If we just copy this exactly.

220
00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:57.000
Go back to our search bar and look for that it's pretty close.

221
00:15:57.070 --> 00:16:01.400
So the Empire State Building was right over here.

222
00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:03.390
At least I think it was right.

223
00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:09.140
Now I'm starting to doubt where they say it was on Fifth Avenue.

224
00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:10.040
OK.

225
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:13.050
So it wasn't the closest in the world.

226
00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.950
And we lost that for a second.

227
00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:15.220
Right.

228
00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:19.490
So it's given us this address an Empire State Building is over there.

229
00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:25.330
But at least we're in the general vicinity there with what we're trying to do.

230
00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:25.820
OK.

231
00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:29.590
So with this information we can now go ahead and work on our hiking up.
