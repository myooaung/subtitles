1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:06,000
Are right in this lecture I'm going to show you how you can integrate Java and Codlin in the same project

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:11,510
and even do some conversion if you decide to go all the way with cotland and how to do that.

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:18,840
So we're going to go ahead and start a new Android studio project and we're going to call this project

4
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:24,630
the Java faithful because we're going to take this Java a faithful person and convert them into a Cartland

5
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:25,380
believer.

6
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:31,770
So we want to uncheck include Codlin support on this one we want to just do Java faithful here go ahead

7
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:32,440
and hit next.

8
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,840
Yes just making a phone app.

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,090
MT activity finish.

10
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:43,700
So the first thing I want to show you is how both Java in cotland can coexist inside of the same project.

11
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,440
Then from there I'm going to show you how you can convert whole files and then get everything up and

12
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:49,850
running.

13
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:55,500
So let's go ahead and wait for everything to set up here.

14
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,880
Looks like we're in a pretty good place so let's open up our app directory.

15
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:03,110
We're going to go down to where we have all of our Java code right.

16
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:08,710
We have our main activity here at showing us some stuff that we have inside.

17
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:13,670
So what we're going to do is we're going to right click where it says compact Zappy code Java faithful

18
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:19,270
years might say something a little bit different but we want to go ahead and create a new cop files

19
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:25,340
we're going Right-Click we're going to say new shoes cotland file here and I want to make a file that

20
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:32,580
maybe holds that new class maybe it's like a dog class so I'm going to say name this file dog.

21
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:40,730
And so it makes this new dog Katie and look at this we have a cotland file and a java file co-existing

22
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,100
in the same project.

23
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:43,800
And there's a little work we have to do.

24
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:48,170
So we have to hit this configure button in order to get everything working here.

25
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:49,330
And so we're going to go ahead and hit.

26
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:49,770
OK.

27
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:53,490
That Android studio is going to go do its thing.

28
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:57,460
We've got to sync the cradle and just all these different things have to happen.

29
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:04,580
But eventually this is going to get to a point where we can have both files together and to really prove

30
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,150
this to you.

31
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,150
Let's go back to our dog dog Katie.

32
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:15,800
And inside of here we're going to make a new class of Let's Make a class called Dog and inside of here

33
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:27,910
the dog maybe has a property called name which is a string and maybe also has an age which is a it will

34
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,850
we'll go ahead and have those two options there.

35
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:37,800
So maybe we have this and let's make sure well it's still doing that sync so we'll go ahead and give

36
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,820
that a second to finish up here.

37
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:46,710
But the idea is things that we have inside of our Java files we can still access inside of our Cartland

38
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:52,440
files and things that are inside of our cotland files we can access inside of our Java files.

39
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,470
So looks like this is about coming to a close here.

40
00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:00,030
I just want to give a full time to finish its process.

41
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:03,770
Let's go ahead and type and see what we get as we're waiting for this here.

42
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:11,040
So I'm now in Java world right because I'm in main activity Java and I'm trying I'm going to try and

43
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,990
make a new dog object so I'm going to type inside of here.

44
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:21,630
Capitol dog and look at that look what comes up a new dog saw that say you to make a new dog called

45
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:22,990
my dog.

46
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:28,350
And this is going to be equal to a new Capitol dog object.

47
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:35,370
And I'm going to have to pass in a name and an end so you know I'll maybe pass in something like dick

48
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,430
inside of here and I'll go ahead and do an age of five.

49
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,280
OK.

50
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,630
So we have a new dog object.

51
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:45,920
I even put the semi-colon in there bottom being bada boom.

52
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,190
It works.

53
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:53,220
So you can see that we successfully have two projects living next to each other side by side and everything's

54
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,320
still OK.

55
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:59,730
So the big magic that comes with this is to know that you know maybe you have a huge Android app that's

56
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:03,750
already written in Java and you want to start adding some cotland to it.

57
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,780
You can do that piece by piece.

58
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,710
Maybe whenever you're writing a new class or something like that you say I'm going to make this new

59
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:13,670
file in cotland and you can go ahead and do that.

60
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:19,000
And the two can sort of live in their own worlds and the same goes for you know if we had made a class

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,860
here inside of Java and wanted to reference it over here we could definitely do that as well.

62
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,640
Now something else that we can do.

63
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:31,900
Let's say we have this main activity which is the java file and we want to convert it to a Scotland

64
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,640
file.

65
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,180
We can totally do that.

66
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:41,670
We're going to select main activity go up to code and choose this convert java file to cotland file.

67
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,720
So go ahead and select this and boom just like that.

68
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,660
The whole Java files Now main activity dog.

69
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,500
And look at this.

70
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,720
It even changed where I had you know Capitol dog my dog is equal to a new dog.

71
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,600
It change it to evolve here.

72
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,480
That still named by dog like it just did everything for us it's amazing.

73
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:05,240
And this last bit this is really going to blow your mind.

74
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,700
So let's say we're searching for an example on how to do something on the Internet.

75
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:17,910
And that example is in Java but we're working on a cotland project so let's say for example I have something

76
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:22,090
like trying to learn how to make an array list.

77
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:28,070
And I'm trying to learn how to do it or for example the only option I find is in Java.

78
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:32,010
So usually you would just search for cotland or whatever but let's say you find something that's in

79
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,480
Java right.

80
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:38,780
So maybe I find this code snippet here and it's like oh this is how you make an array list.

81
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,860
But I got to convert this to Java or cotland and you think and I can probably do that in my head but

82
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,030
it take a little bit of time.

83
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:48,900
Watch this if you copy this Java code.

84
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:54,390
Come back to android studio and you just simply paste it in.

85
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:58,140
It's going to say hey this looks like it's Java code.

86
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,360
Do you want to convert this over to Scotland.

87
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:07,130
I'm going to say yes and all of a sudden just like that boom it did the conversion for us.

88
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:14,070
So even if you find code examples that are in Java you can simply paste them in the Android studio.

89
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:16,000
It'll turn it into cotland for you.

90
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:21,960
So if you want to slowly introduce Katelin into your life or you want to do some big conversions these

91
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,310
are some awesome tools that can help you.
