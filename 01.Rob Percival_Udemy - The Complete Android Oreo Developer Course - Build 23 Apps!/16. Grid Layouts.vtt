00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:07.920
A final act of this section is called basic phrases and it's an app designed to allow you to say basic

2
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:21.760
phrases in the language so we're just going to take a brief break from our hard coding and see how we

3
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:29.290
create the layout that we're going to need using a grid layout similar to the one that we created in

4
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.390
the connect 3 app.

5
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.110
We're going to have eight basic phrases in our out.

6
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:42.040
So that means we want a grid which is too along by a four tool and each of those is going to have a

7
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.140
button.

8
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:49.930
So if you want to consider this a challenge to create that layout using a grid layout want eight buttons

9
00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.010
two by four.

10
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.790
If you're coming from a previous version of Android studio it's actually quite a bit easier to do with

11
00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:05.080
Android Studio 3 because you don't need to be so careful about which row and column each button is in

12
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:14.240
could just list them in order and they will fill up the gradely out from top to bottom and left or right.

13
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.350
So let's get going.

14
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.190
We'll add a great layout.

15
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.420
Which by default will fill almost the whole screen which is fine for our purposes.

16
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.120
Add in some constraints and then set the number of rows and columns.

17
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.590
I always do very fast even though I see comes before El.

18
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:47.310
So the right count is for the column count

19
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:57.270
is to and then similar to what we did.

20
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:05.170
When they connect three up we bring in a button which will always get into the habit of dragging into

21
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.690
the the top left.

22
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:16.000
And then let's see what happens if we copy and paste the text for that button a few times.

23
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:18.370
OK.

24
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.340
So you can see it is laying it out correctly according to the grid.

25
00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.810
And if we keep going.

26
00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.890
It will fill up the two by four grid lay out that we've specified.

27
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.030
But we want our buttons to fill the screen.

28
00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:41.470
Now as always there's a number of ways that we can do that but I'm going to show you a nice and easy

29
00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.980
way using gravity which is not something that we've used much safer.

30
00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:52.310
So let me show you how we can use gravity to fill up the available space.

31
00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.360
So we just set lay out

32
00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.670
gravity.

33
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:04.080
And often we use this to specify whether we want it to be on the left right top or bottom but we're

34
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:14.470
going to go for Phil and this will then fill the hole space available to the bottom three that we also

35
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.880
need to get rid of the width and height there.

36
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:28.730
And then we need to specify how many rows and columns we want this button to take up and we can specify

37
00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:35.700
that using Android lay out right to wait.

38
00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:43.230
And we wanted to take up a row of one by one right.

39
00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:54.020
And similarly we wanted to take up one column so when there's only one button that it will spread to

40
00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.980
the whole of the grid layout.

41
00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.560
But when we add more buttons.

42
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:09.650
So now we have a nicely filled griddle out of just two by one.

43
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.840
Now we're up to a two by two.

44
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.210
So let's add in fact I can copy all of those

45
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:25.450
and paste another four in and now I have the layout which I'm looking for which was two by four.

46
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:32.230
I've got various problems with IDS and I haven't done any own methods but those will set in the next

47
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.440
video for now.

48
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.590
We've got a that we wanted.

49
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:41.720
And it's actually quite a common one to aim for but a tricky one if you don't know about gravity Phil

50
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.100
and Roy wait and call them wait.

51
00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:49.130
So now that we've covered those let's jump in the next video to actually making our basic phrases AB.
