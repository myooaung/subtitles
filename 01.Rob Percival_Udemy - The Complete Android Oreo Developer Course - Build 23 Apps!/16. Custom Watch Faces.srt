1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:01,170
All right.

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:05,040
Welcome to the very last lecture here in the Android where many course.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,130
And what we're going to do is learn how to make watch faces.

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,990
This is my favorite thing because I think this is probably something you could spend the most time on

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,390
as far as making an app for the Watch what it is that the user is going to be looking at.

6
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,960
The risk most of the time and there's so much customization we can do.

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:23,620
So let's go ahead and give it a name here.

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,550
I'm just going to call it something pretty boring like my watch face.

9
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:34,110
And I mean you can decide what you want to call it but that seems fine for me and I'm going to go ahead

10
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:38,620
and make sure this is Android where I'm going to do the latest And next on this.

11
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,920
And you can tell so rather than doing a blank activity we want to do a watch face.

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,730
Make sure you have that selected.

13
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,790
So we'll just go ahead and call this my watch face for style.

14
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,500
I think digital is a little bit more fun than analog especially for customizing it.

15
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:59,460
It's going to be a lot easier to customize what is digital and you want to have interactive check there.

16
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,900
So I'll go ahead and hit finish and this will start up our project.

17
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:12,390
So with this there's really only one file that this whole app consists of quote unquote app.

18
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:18,720
And if we open up this app folder here and go into Java you can see a file called my watch face.

19
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,630
Now there's some other information here like in rez there's you know we've got some values here.

20
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:27,230
And you know we've also got some images and stuff like that.

21
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:34,760
But as far as like actual code it's really just this my watch phrase file and most of it's been written

22
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,640
out for you.

23
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,600
You can just see all this code that's been provided for you.

24
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:43,000
And there's great documentation here about how you can edit these things.

25
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:48,510
But first I want to just show you how you can test out a watch face so you can see if we want to try

26
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:53,480
and run this right now we're going to get in there and says hey the default activity is not found.

27
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,690
And so in order to fix this we've got to go up to app here and say configurations.

28
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:05,280
And with this default app selected under launch we're going to change from default activity to nothing.

29
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:11,190
So this says hey you know if you're going to be starting a new activity or whatnot we should be able

30
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,470
to just go ahead and open this game.

31
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:19,350
So once you have that set you can go ahead and X out of there and should now be able to run this

32
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,860
as I was about to say but it looks like it's not.

33
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:31,680
Oh for some reason my OK button was getting cutoff but it changed that to nothing and then hit the OK

34
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,620
or applied button down at the bottom.

35
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,290
So now that I've done that we should be able to hit run here.

36
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,040
I'm going to do this on my round device.

37
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:46,340
OK so let's go ahead and get that emulator up and rolling in here.

38
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:50,880
So we're going to wait until this finishes and I'm going to show you how you can add a new watch face

39
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:57,720
to your device because it seems to change every time there's a new update that comes out for the watch

40
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,790
operating system here.

41
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,060
But once it looks like that's finally finished you'll notice nothing really changes here and that's

42
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,580
because we said when it launches do nothing.

43
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:10,350
But if you go ahead and do a swipe from left to right here you're going to see this option to add more

44
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,580
watch faces.

45
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:16,680
So we're going to do that again and then click on this so you can see there's this elements analog elements

46
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:23,340
digital but also there's this one called my digital and that's in fact our one that we had just created.

47
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,900
So if we go ahead and click on this this is our watch face.

48
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,690
Now let's go ahead and walk through this.

49
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:37,080
My watch face file here and talk about the different things that we can customize so you can say you

50
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:42,000
know how often you want this thing to update here.

51
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,740
It's creating this new engine.

52
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:48,660
I mean this is also really kind of complex stuff that we don't really need to know all the specifics

53
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,990
of what's going on there.

54
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,840
But the real things that we can start customizing is you can see here like here's a calendar that's

55
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,710
going to handle all the time information for us.

56
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:01,950
Here's the thing that goes and gets the time zone that should be shown up you could make it so that

57
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,980
your app only shows up for one particular time zone.

58
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:11,940
There's a background paint and there's background text now it doesn't have to be just you know one color

59
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:17,270
or the other like you could add images here if you wanted to but probably just solid colors.

60
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,880
A good way to roll.

61
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:23,670
There's all these information about how you can have ambiant watch faces which can kind of save some

62
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:24,940
battery power.

63
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:30,480
And this is sort of the big method here the Create this is when everything gets set up just like in

64
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:33,800
other activity files right on create method.

65
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,650
And so you can see things here like where we're setting the background color.

66
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,620
And so right now it's just getting the default background color.

67
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:46,200
But if we wanted to change this for example like let's say we want to make the Christmas watch face

68
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:53,220
we could do a red color for the background and here for the typeface we could go ahead and change this

69
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,360
to be something like green.

70
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:02,730
So if we have red and green in there and we go ahead and run on our emulator Let's get this ready to

71
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:06,890
rock and roll the app should open up here.

72
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:07,460
Boom.

73
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,030
Look at that.

74
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,180
All sudden we're in this very ugly Christmas looking watch face here.

75
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:17,790
And we have you know some space down here that we get at other things if we want to do this on destroyed

76
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:22,320
basically just clears the cache whenever the user is switching away from your watch face.

77
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,430
So you can add some code there if you need to do some more complex stuff.

78
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:33,510
Other information about when things are changing into the timer and out of the timer and you know in

79
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:37,600
this case they're just updating the time zone to see if anything's working.

80
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,400
There are just all sorts of options that you can impact here.

81
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:45,780
Now I'm going to take you down to what I consider to be the most important changes here.

82
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,370
And so one of them is this on time tick.

83
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:52,600
And so this occurs as we had mentioned up above.

84
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:57,840
We had set the specification here to I believe every second or milliseconds here.

85
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,220
This was seconds.

86
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,550
So we have that.

87
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,780
And so it's updating every second and every second that it updates.

88
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,740
It comes down to this.

89
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,930
No I lost it this on time.

90
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:15,630
And so you could run some code that every second you want to change something and this invalidate function

91
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:20,880
is called which basically says hey you need to redraw the watch face and so if there's any sort of special

92
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,740
customization that you want to do you can do it here.

93
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,250
That's a really important one to know.

94
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:32,520
And then another one is on the on tap command if you want to be able to respond to the user touching

95
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,660
the screen.

96
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:39,510
You can you know put in custom code to handle that there but this one I think this is where you can

97
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:45,930
really get the most bang for your buck and that's that this is where we actually draw the time on the

98
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:46,740
screen.

99
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:52,230
And so there's two different options here the text if it's an ambient moan mode just shows the hours

100
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:52,970
in the minutes.

101
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,940
But if it's not it shows the hours the minutes and the seconds and we're not in ambient mode so that's

102
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,630
why we get all three of those.

103
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:06,090
So let's say for example we don't want to show out the hours cold and minute like we wanted to put a

104
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,380
dash in between those.

105
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:10,640
Well we could go ahead and do that we could put dashes there.

106
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:18,520
And now if we go ahead and hit run on this we should see our updates come up.

107
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,750
It looks like we had our updates but we're going to have to move to our watch face here.

108
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,770
Well it was until the left so I have to swipe to the left there and look at that.

109
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:32,290
All sudden now we have a dash inside the colon like there's a cool little customizations that we can

110
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:37,270
do you know here inside of this watch face which I just think is amazing.

111
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:41,280
So there's so many different options that you can cover here.

112
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:46,350
Another one that you might be able to just quickly change here if you wanted to was the typeface.

113
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:50,920
That's something that you could quickly get to but again completely up to you.

114
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,800
So I really hope you enjoyed learning about Android Wear.

115
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:59,980
Like I said at the beginning this is kind of a little mini course inside of this whole bundle and there's

116
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,910
this whole world of extra things that you go get into.

117
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:08,950
Android has excellent documentation on the where functionality and you can go check out all sorts of

118
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:09,450
new things.

119
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:13,350
But hopefully this was a good launching pad for you if you're interested in that.

120
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,010
All right.

121
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,220
Well I hope you enjoyed that.

122
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,250
We still have more for you.

123
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,400
So let's keep moving in the overall bigger course.
