1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:05,940
All right it's time to learn a new skill and it's all coming around the idea that basically every app

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:11,280
that we've made is a one screen app nothing ever moves to a different page or does anything else just

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,710
sort of all on one screen and that's been fine.

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,720
We've been able to build some really cool stuff.

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:21,160
But if we want to take our app abilities to the next level we're going to have to be able to move onto

6
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:23,090
some new screens and have multiple screens.

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:28,140
And so in the Android world a screen is called an activity so when you're moving from screen to screen

8
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,580
those are you're moving from one activity to another.

9
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,100
So let's go ahead and learn how we can do that.

10
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:43,560
We're going to start a new project and let's just call this multipole activity demo and we'll go ahead.

11
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,380
Hit next on this.

12
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:48,010
We just want the empty activity to start out with.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,130
Now of course we're going to show you how you can add your own after this but you know we've got to

14
00:00:53,130 --> 00:01:01,990
start at least with a blank one or go ahead and wait for Android studio to finish up here.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,930
I mean if you think about it it's actually quite impressive how much we've been able to do with just

16
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:08,640
stain on one activity.

17
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:10,810
And now once we have this in place.

18
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:14,180
I mean the world just really really opens up here.

19
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,920
As far as potential apps that we can do.

20
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:25,430
So step number one is we've got to go add a new activity to our app so to do that.

21
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:37,970
Go ahead and go up here to file and you want to go to we want to go to new and we are really waiting

22
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,160
on Android studio here.

23
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,560
There we go.

24
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,070
File new.

25
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:45,230
And then we want to come down here to activity.

26
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,470
So there's all sorts of different activities that we can add if you'd like to see them all.

27
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:54,610
I recommend just clicking on gallery here so you can see what your different options are.

28
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,120
So go ahead and pick this up again.

29
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:01,720
All sorts of stuff look there is that cool Google Maps one that we had worked with earlier.

30
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:06,960
So nice little starting points if you're going to be adding ads a full screen thing.

31
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,610
In our case we're finally just an empty activity so let's go ahead and select that one.

32
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:17,220
Then it's time for you to choose a name for your activity so typically the first activity you're in

33
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:22,560
your app is called The main activity so I wouldn't recommend naming the change changing the name of

34
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,710
your original activity that's the one that's already there.

35
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,990
But for this one main two is not a good name for your next activity you should describe what's going

36
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:31,260
on.

37
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,200
So in this simple example we just want to move from one activity to the other.

38
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,120
So I'm going to simply call this segment activity.

39
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:44,580
I know pretty weak sauce here but I just you know it should be descriptive of what it is and having

40
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:49,320
the named main If it's not the first one probably not a good idea.

41
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:54,840
So go ahead and hit finish here as that will add that to our app.

42
00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:02,370
So you'll see now we have the main activity and we also have the second activity so it's nice that we

43
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:08,550
have two these now also if we go into our resources and lay out you can see we have lay out files for

44
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,300
each of these.

45
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,590
So that's pretty cool.

46
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,810
And let's talk about you know so how are you going to make it so that we can move from one activity

47
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:16,860
to the next.

48
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:21,730
So we've got to start paying attention paying attention to names here.

49
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,250
Let's open up our activity main and not to be confused with activity second.

50
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:26,510
Right.

51
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:29,950
That's for our second activity.

52
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:35,280
So an activity mean we have to have some way to let the user say that they want to move on to the next

53
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,260
one so let's just add a button to that that's going to be a really simple button.

54
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:47,370
In fact let's just right click this puppy and just center it both horizontally and vertically so that

55
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:56,050
that way it'll just be right there in the middle and we'll change the name to say go to next.

56
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,440
All right.

57
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:03,870
And then with this button let's go ahead and give it a click name we'll say maybe you just call it go

58
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:04,910
to next.

59
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,020
Probably seems fine.

60
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,860
It's all copy that text.

61
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,990
Once we have that in place now we have to write the code for when the button is tapped to go to the

62
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,530
next activity.

63
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,660
So we'll go up here.

64
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:22,200
We've done this a million times I'll just say public void and we'll paste in that name go to the next.

65
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,590
And now we can run some code whenever that is tapped.

66
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:31,610
So the way to move from one activity to the next is using something called intent.

67
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:34,500
The intent basically triggers this whole process.

68
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,940
OK I was in this activity and now I'm moving to the next one so let me go ahead and type it out and

69
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,620
hopefully you can learn from this example.

70
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,450
So we're going to say capital intent.

71
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:45,960
All right.

72
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,760
And I'll just call this intent.

73
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:51,590
So this is going to be equal to a new capital intent.

74
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,550
Now there's a couple of things that we've got to pass in here so the first one is the context so let's

75
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:59,800
just go ahead and say get application context.

76
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:03,420
The next one is the class that you want to move to.

77
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:08,540
So in our case we want to go to second activity right if we go ahead and click on this file.

78
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:13,620
This is a public class called second activity whereas then the main activity that class is called main

79
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:18,640
activity so let's just go ahead and type the name of this one where it's going to be second activity.

80
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:24,150
And then after second activity want to say Doc class because we're saying that's the class that we want

81
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:24,880
to move to.

82
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:30,870
And so we're not going into a specific instance of that class we're just going to that class.

83
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:36,210
Okay so that's all it takes to make an intent but this is only making the intent this is saying this

84
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,990
is what I would want to do but to actually make it happen.

85
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:47,730
We have to call a separate function where we're going to say start activity and you can see it's looking

86
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,540
for an intent.

87
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:54,110
So if we pass an intent in there boom that's going to move us from our first activity to the next.

88
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:57,330
So let's go ahead and hit run on this.

89
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:04,140
Well my app finally opened up but I realized I had a big year here I forgot to go to next function to

90
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:07,440
put in the view parameter.

91
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,050
We'll go ahead and add that in and that's going to fix our deadly air that we had before.

92
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:18,820
It was funny I hit the button and all of a sudden everything just went bad it exited out of the app.

93
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,560
But anyways we should be good now.

94
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:22,330
All right.

95
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,430
So app opened up.

96
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,500
Let's go ahead and tap on this button.

97
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:26,860
Look at that.

98
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:29,580
It moves onto the next activity so it's pretty cool.

99
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:34,920
Here is that in Android you have your back button right so if we just go ahead and hit this that takes

100
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:40,740
us back to the privacy right so we can just hit this button and go back just like that.

101
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:45,610
So this now gives me the opportunity to present you a challenge.

102
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:55,980
I want you to make it so that when I open up the app and my goodness we lost the app or to go here to

103
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,600
want pull There we go.

104
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,500
So I want you to make it when you hit this button goes to the second activity we've already finished

105
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:03,670
that.

106
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,780
But then I want you to add a button to this screen so that when we hit that button it will automatically

107
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,270
take us back to the other screen.

108
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:11,730
OK.

109
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,310
So that's my challenge for you.

110
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:13,790
Go ahead.

111
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:17,240
Hit pause now right.

112
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,440
Hopefully that went well for you.

113
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:25,130
So it takes a couple of steps you're the first one is to dive into the ex-MIL for the visual side of

114
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:30,500
this activity so pretty cool that we get to see that we're going to keep it real simple here by just

115
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,480
adding a button.

116
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:40,880
And again just centering this thing horizontally and vertically and we'll call this maybe go back.

117
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:41,670
All right.

118
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,630
And that's probably a good name there.

119
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,570
Go back.

120
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:45,430
OK.

121
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:49,120
So then we'll go to our second activity that Java Java.

122
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,710
Did I say Jabba the Hutt dot Java.

123
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:52,220
There we go.

124
00:07:52,220 --> 00:08:03,820
So we're going to say public voyde go back in which we take in capital view and will do lowercase view

125
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,740
on our curly brackets.

126
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:11,210
So there's a couple of ways to handle going back so one of them if we just use the knowledge that we

127
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:18,680
had before where we say capital intent right we can do this and say we're going to make a new intent

128
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:25,010
and we're going to pass in here and get application context and then we'll just write the name of this

129
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:25,970
main activity.

130
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:29,670
So main activity class room.

131
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:38,590
We now have an intent and then we just need to say start activity and I'll pass in that intense and

132
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,860
that will do it again.

133
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,750
So go ahead and do that.

134
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,240
Well hit around here

135
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:52,790
get our emulator up here so we can see how this all works.

136
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:01,690
All right.

137
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,960
So we'll hit the button.

138
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,130
Now we have this button if we tap on that.

139
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:05,890
Look at that.

140
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,240
We can go back.

141
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:11,720
So the one thing that I want you to see here though that's a little bit freaky about this is so let's

142
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,230
say I've opened the app and you might have just seen it here.

143
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:19,550
I hit go to next and I hit go back and then I say go to next and I go back I mean we could just do this

144
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:25,970
forever but when the user hits the back button you know it keeps going forward and backwards because

145
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:31,250
we've essentially piled a bunch of intense on top of each other so eventually it finished up there.

146
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:37,610
But you would hope that if you hit go to next and then you hit go back that you would think oh if I

147
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:41,630
hit the back button it will take me back to like the android devices homescreen.

148
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:44,420
But now it takes you back here and takes you back there.

149
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:48,800
So the other possibility if you're moving backwards you're not doing an intent forward you're simply

150
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,520
just saying hey go to wherever I was previously.

151
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:54,500
Let me go ahead and just comment this out for a second.

152
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:58,010
You can very simply just go ahead and type finish.

153
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,120
OK.

154
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,300
So we'll say finish here.

155
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,220
Go ahead and check out this piece of code

156
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:10,190
again this is in the second activity.

157
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:14,330
Right because we're just saying we want to go backwards so we hit go to next.

158
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,210
And now when I hit go back it still takes us back to the home.

159
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,210
But if I hit the back button Well it just takes us out.

160
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:25,650
So up to you about how you want that functionality to work I think from a user's perspective if you're

161
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:31,620
going to be providing a back button that it's probably best to just go ahead and.

162
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:36,620
Well number one let the user just use the back button of the devices have a back button for a reason

163
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,760
that's probably the most intuitive for the user.

164
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,130
But if you're going to have a button I will go ahead and use this finish function if you're moving backwards.

165
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:47,460
But of course if you're going forward you've got to provide an attempt to say where it is that you want

166
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,030
to go.

167
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:52,590
Now a very common thing that people want to do when they move from one activity to another is they want

168
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,660
to pass along some information.

169
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,590
So let me show you how we can do that with an intent.

170
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,150
You have the ability to add something called an extra that gives a little piece of information or I

171
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:07,950
guess a bigger piece of information if you want to that as you go forward and you simply just type out

172
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:08,910
the name of your intent.

173
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:11,560
So we called ours and temp kind of boring name.

174
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,170
We'll just say intent.

175
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,920
Put extra.

176
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,360
And then this allows us to pass whatever it is that we want.

177
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,470
So I mean the first thing that we have to provide is the name of the extra.

178
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:28,560
So in this case let's say I want to pass forward my age so I'm going to put age inside of here.

179
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,110
OK.

180
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:33,930
So that's our first parameter then you can see you can pass through a boolean byte char short and long

181
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,810
float double string.

182
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:39,120
I mean there just a jillion things that you could pass through here.

183
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,650
So let's maybe just pass through an right because we're passing through age so I'm going to go ahead

184
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:45,020
and pass in twenty eight.

185
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:51,360
That's my age and now that can be accessed on the second activity and you might be wondering how do

186
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,630
we get access to that.

187
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:55,380
Well here inside of our create method right.

188
00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:01,530
This is the function that gets called when our activity opens up the first time we can get the information

189
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:09,240
by going ahead and typing out k we want to get the activity so the first thing that we got to do is

190
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,410
we've got to get access to the intent.

191
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:17,240
So if you just type get intent that gives us back the current intent that got us here.

192
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:24,490
So I'll just use capital intent and call that intent and say this is equal to that then with this intent

193
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:28,670
to object we can go ahead and grab the extras out of there.

194
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:33,040
So instead of saying put extra We are going to say get.

195
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,990
And then you have to specify what type it is that you want.

196
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:42,120
So if I want an end I have to say get indexed if I wanted a string I would say get string extra.

197
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:49,110
In our case we wanted that song I say get it extra and we have to provide the name of what it is that

198
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,180
we're looking for.

199
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:56,610
So we're going to go ahead and provide a name there and if we go back to the name that we had used was

200
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,340
age.

201
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:02,460
So we'll just do lowercase age in there and let's put this inside a variable so I can say it.

202
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:06,860
Age is equal to this guy right here.

203
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:12,510
Now when you're working with getting an extra you'll notice there's the option here where you have to

204
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:17,700
set the default value so if that's for some reason you know it didn't come through or whatever so just

205
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,760
go ahead and put zero for there.

206
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:22,770
But just to confirm that this information came through.

207
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:24,870
Let's go ahead and make a toast message.

208
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:34,540
So we'll go ahead and say that make text and inside of here we'll pass this and then intent dot.

209
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:39,150
Well we already have access to the age so then we just have to turn this into a string so will say integer

210
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:43,050
to string and we'll provide age right inside there.

211
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:47,730
Then the last thing that we need to provide is whether it's going to be long or short so just say capital

212
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:56,170
toast length short and also a show on the end of this and do the semi-colon.

213
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:56,930
OK.

214
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:02,220
So hopefully we should be able to get the age of 28 to pass through and have that show up in a toast.

215
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:06,810
Let's go ahead and run this on the simulator and make sure that that's the case.

216
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:11,160
So let's go back to the home screen here.

217
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:13,450
Opens up.

218
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:18,140
I say go to next and look at that the number twenty eight passes through.

219
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,530
Awesome stuff.

220
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,070
OK.

221
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:26,290
So that brings us to the next part of the lecture here where I have a little bit of a challenge for

222
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:31,480
you and simply put I want it to be a little bit more than just hitting a button and having it show up

223
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:36,630
I want you to take the concepts that we've learned from being able to pass information and do the following.

224
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:42,970
So I want to add a list view to your app here in the main activities are going to go back to the main

225
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:44,350
activity here.

226
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:45,120
OK.

227
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:50,710
In this main activity I want you to do a list view of some friends and when someone taps on one of your

228
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:57,190
friends it should go to the next activity and it should show a text message saying whoever you tapped

229
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:57,670
on.

230
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:57,940
Right.

231
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:02,740
So list out some friends make it so when someone taps on one of those it shows that their name in a

232
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:05,200
toast in the next activity.

233
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,250
All right.

234
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:06,760
Go ahead.

235
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,650
Hit pause do that now.

236
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:10,470
All right.

237
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:12,800
So hopefully that went well for you.

238
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,800
And of course in order to do this we're going to start first visually we're going to get rid of this

239
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,570
button which then means we've got to go back to our main activity we're getting rid of this whole go

240
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:27,540
to next things will go ahead and delete that then we'll go back to our main activity and we need a list

241
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:27,800
view.

242
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:34,540
So we're going to go to our layouts and excuse me not our layout see a list view there.

243
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:40,700
So there it is List view must be in containers.

244
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:42,960
So go ahead and bring this out.

245
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:45,690
We want to fill the whole screen it looks like it's doing pretty good.

246
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:50,850
I might just hit the plus buttons here and just kind of confirm Yeah that's what we're looking for.

247
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,880
I'm going to give this idea of list view.

248
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:56,040
Very boring but we're just trying to get to the point here.

249
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:02,670
So here inside of our Creator I want to get access to this list views on the set list view and I'll

250
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:10,380
simply call it list view is equal to find view by id capital art ID dot.

251
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,900
You can.

252
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:14,460
So now we have access to our list view.

253
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:19,020
The next thing that we need is an array list of all of our friends.

254
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:24,600
So I'm going to type out a re list and I want this to be an array of strings because it's just going

255
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:32,160
to hold the names I'm going to call this friends and I'll say that this is equal to a new array list

256
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:38,740
which should also be of a bunch of string objects and we don't put anything in there to start.

257
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:46,080
But then with this we've got to add some friends inside of there so I'll say friends got ADD and let's

258
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:50,550
go ahead and maybe put our friend Fido in there and I'll copy.

259
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:55,320
We've got to have a little bit of a list of friends so maybe let's have four friends in total so of

260
00:16:55,710 --> 00:17:00,510
Fido Sean Sarah and Jane Jane.

261
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:04,920
So those are going to be the four friends that we have now.

262
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:13,680
Those are out in there we need to create an array adapter so go ahead and type out a re adapter and

263
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:17,850
we want to specify that this should have the name of array adapter.

264
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:26,590
Well set the sequel to a new array adapter and then here we want to provide this as the context.

265
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:32,490
Then we have to specify We just want the simple list item so lowercase Android

266
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:45,130
it and then we want capital are not way out and we just want simple list item one.

267
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:49,730
There we go that's a long one to type out and then we have to provide the array lists all do friends

268
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,460
right there.

269
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:57,100
So now we've got this Bawler array adapter and then we've got to connect it with the list view.

270
00:17:57,170 --> 00:18:06,230
So we'll go ahead and say list view set adapter and we'll go ahead and pass in this array adapter so

271
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:08,770
that should be able to show a list view of all of our friends.

272
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:13,040
But now this is sort of where the real magic happened so this is kind of the core of the challenge that

273
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:19,100
I had for you is that that is when someone taps on one of these friends we want to be able to do an

274
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,270
intent move on to the next activity.

275
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,440
So we're going to set it on click listener.

276
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,430
So we'll say list view.

277
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:30,290
Set on item click listener.

278
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:37,970
So this we need a new adapter view on item click listener and boom.

279
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,420
Look at that.

280
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:42,080
It gives us this awesome on item click method.

281
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,470
So inside of here we want to create that intent.

282
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:48,670
So again just capitol intent I'll call this intent.

283
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,130
And this is equal to a new intent.

284
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:59,450
Now we got to go ahead and get the application to lower case or get application context.

285
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,930
Next thing that we're looking for inside of here is where is it that we're moving to.

286
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:08,960
So I'm going to say second activity class and boom we've gotten intent.

287
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,070
So with this we want to go ahead and pass forward some information.

288
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:18,760
Remember we want to pass what friend it is that their name was selected so we'll take this intent and

289
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,270
we'll say put extra.

290
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:26,180
We have to give it some sort of a name and I'll just literally call the name name because we're passing

291
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:32,920
the name of a friend and then we need to pass forward that friend's name so we can get that from this

292
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,370
friend's array list so just go ahead and type friends dot get.

293
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,000
And we want to pass on.

294
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:44,050
Because I here's whatever the index of whatever friend it is that we're working with here.

295
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,840
So go ahead and put a semi-colon on that.

296
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:53,390
And once we've have the friend inserted as an extra We just need to go ahead and say start activity

297
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,770
and we'll pass in that intent.

298
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:04,910
Jane now when this goes to the next activity right now we have the code to say OK when we get the on

299
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:10,640
create here we're going to take a look for this extra called age and if we get that you know we're going

300
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,570
to go ahead and show that there but that's no longer what we want.

301
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:20,990
Instead what we're looking for is we want a string that we're going to call name and we're going to

302
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:26,880
say this should be equal to intent get string extra.

303
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:31,850
And remember we've literally provided the name name for the name because that's going to be the name

304
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:32,990
of our friend.

305
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:39,350
So here inside of our toast rather than you know doing this energy conversion we'll just type name.

306
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:40,040
All right.

307
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,680
So let's go ahead and hit run here.

308
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,450
This is sort of our big moment of truth.

309
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,930
We'll see if we got this working.

310
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:48,490
OK.

311
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,370
We'll open up the emulator here.

312
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,830
And here comes the app.

313
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:56,510
So look at that.

314
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,850
We've got all our friends listed.

315
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:03,680
Let's tap on Jane boom look out we get Jane let's go back tap on Sean.

316
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:04,810
Oh it says Shaun.

317
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:08,000
I'll hit the back button this time we'll do Sarah.

318
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:14,030
And just to make sure Fido isn't feeling lonely we'll tap on him as well.

319
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:14,300
All right.

320
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:18,830
We just have one more lecture one more apt to build in this section and that's going to wrap it up for

321
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:24,390
us as far as learning about maps and geolocation so this one's a little bit of a hefty one.

322
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,760
So let's go ahead and dive headfirst into it right now.
