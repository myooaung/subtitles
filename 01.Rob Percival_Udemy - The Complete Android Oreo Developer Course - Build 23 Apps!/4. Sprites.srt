1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,470
And this lecture we're going to cover the beginning points of starting our app we're going to learn

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:09,720
how to add our character coin man to the screen how to apply a background all sorts of fun stuff like

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,400
that.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,820
But the first thing I want to do is I want to fix the layout of this app.

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:19,980
And so it's right now set to be landscape and we can fix that if we go to our Android manifest go ahead

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,800
and double click on that you'll see as we scroll through here the screen orientation right now is set

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,170
to landscape.

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,790
We want to go ahead and change this to portrait.

9
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:35,580
So just go ahead and put lowercase portrait there and that's all we need to get this app running in

10
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:36,930
the correct direction for us.

11
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,880
Now maybe in your game you wanted to be landscape that's the decision up to you that you can decide

12
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:46,860
how you want to handle that but for us I think it looks better if we have things in more of a portrait

13
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:52,460
style So let's go ahead and open up the emulator and look at it.

14
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:54,430
It's now in the correct position.

15
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:55,220
All right.

16
00:00:55,430 --> 00:01:02,580
So with this we don't need this image texture right that we had before.

17
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,760
We don't need to do any of this stuff.

18
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,820
They've kind of pre-done for us we're just going to go ahead and delete everything except for this dispose

19
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,770
keep batched not dispose.

20
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,730
Then we're not going to really touch this function for the rest of this.

21
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,060
We clear everything and render and we're going to keep everything or get rid of everything except for

22
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:20,940
this batch.

23
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,950
And we'll even get rid of this texture called image.

24
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:28,930
So let's start first with how we can add a background to our app.

25
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:36,240
And so I actually have a series of image assets for you and so I want you to go on your browser.

26
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:41,010
I want you to go to Android of course dot com slash.

27
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:42,920
Let's go ahead and do this in a new tab.

28
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:51,830
I want you to go to Android of course dot com slash and then we're going to do a coin or lowercase coin

29
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:57,500
pan dot zip so just go ahead and hit enter on that and that's going to download this folder.

30
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,310
I already have one here on my desktop that's going to have some images.

31
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:06,140
Let me go ahead and grab that.

32
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,660
So I'm just going to go ahead and open this up made a folder by the same name so I'm going to rename

33
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:14,610
this to be coign man images.

34
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,240
Excellent.

35
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,630
And you can see inside of here we just have some images that we're going to be using.

36
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:22,460
So for example this background beat up piano.

37
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,580
That's what we want to fill the screen.

38
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,300
We're going to put coins in there there's a little dude and you can see we've got some different photos

39
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,080
of him running.

40
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:32,280
Also one when he dies what that's going to look like.

41
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,800
So we've got the bomb and we've got the coins.

42
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:39,010
Now I got these images from a multiple few places.

43
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,540
One of almost flat icons.

44
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:49,150
So again I think this is a great place to go and get images this one was by Smash icons and then also

45
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,700
I just did a simple search for a bomb.

46
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,210
And you can replace these with any images that you want.

47
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:57,880
You don't have to use the same ones but this one came from free pick.

48
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:03,490
And then also the character this came from open game art or this is a really cool Web site this one

49
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:08,860
happens to come with the Creative Commons zero license which means you don't have to give attribution

50
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,100
if you don't want to.

51
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:15,940
But I thought it would cool to give a shout out to the author Bev ovule and I don't know how to pronounce

52
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,980
your name but there is the website if you want to see more.

53
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:25,050
So with all of that in place we now have those extracted images.

54
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,980
We're going to go back to our Android studio project and on this asset folder.

55
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:34,740
Go ahead and right click this and do reveal in Finder because we want to move in those images.

56
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,700
So we'll go ahead.

57
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,560
We've got this asset folder here that just right now has that bad logic image.

58
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,430
We're going to take all these images from the desktop.

59
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,170
Go ahead select all of them.

60
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:50,190
We're just going to drag and drop right into that asset folder.

61
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:53,420
So now we have access to all of those.

62
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:59,930
And we should see here an android studio if we right click and say synchronize assets boom there's all

63
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,600
those images.

64
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:07,090
Now step number one for us is we want to get a background showing up inside of our app.

65
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:13,210
And so what we're going to do is we're going to create a texture texture is a way to add an image into

66
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:18,080
that we're going to do this for like our Queen Mab and also the coins the bombs any sort of visual image

67
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:24,560
you want to use a texture so we're going to make a new texture and for this one we're going to go ahead

68
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,970
and just call it the background.

69
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:33,770
So we'll just simply type out background here you are semi-colon and then we're going to go through

70
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:36,930
the process of getting this all set up.

71
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,210
So step number one for us.

72
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:42,560
You might have seen this from what we had before but we want to get this background set up and we'll

73
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,380
just do that by same background is equal to a new texture.

74
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,990
And we want to pass in the name of the image so that's B.G. peahens.

75
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:54,910
You can see that from over there in the menu.

76
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,490
Don't forget your semi-colon.

77
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:03,460
And then once you have this in place we now move on to how we get things to show up on the screen.

78
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:11,540
This is the drawing part of this so we have to first take this batch that we have up here and in order

79
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:15,500
to start things we want to go ahead and say batch that begin.

80
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:21,050
And eventually when we're finished with every single thing that we could possibly want to put on that

81
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:26,040
screen we are going to do a batch dot and change.

82
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,000
So those are kind of the two positions that we want to go to.

83
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:35,590
But then the question comes well how do we get an image to show up inside the app like what is you know

84
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:39,330
the proper way to quote unquote draw something there.

85
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:48,770
Well for this we simply want to say Bache dot draw and then it's going to ask us a series of questions

86
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:49,010
here.

87
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:52,460
So the first one is you know what texture is it that you want to draw.

88
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,610
So we're going to pass in background here.

89
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:57,930
Well just go ahead and type that out.

90
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:00,000
Sure we spell that correctly.

91
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:00,800
Background.

92
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,190
There we go.

93
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:05,620
Then it's going to ask us for the starting position of this.

94
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:13,930
And it actually starts things in the corner so we want to actually just put zero and zero here.

95
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,690
And then it's going to ask us for the height and the width of this and we want to say hey however wide

96
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:23,370
the screen is and however tall the screen is that's what we want.

97
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:31,780
So to do that we're going to type capital G but lowercase d x so GDX dot and we want to get to the graphics

98
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:35,740
and then we're going to say don't get with it's going to fill it up.

99
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:44,680
And then for the height same thing GDX dot graphics get height.

100
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:48,420
So if we go ahead and pass and all that information this will draw a background for us.

101
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:54,060
And let's go ahead and run this and just make sure that we can get this situation to show up

102
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:03,950
so we'll go ahead and give this a moment here and look at that.

103
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:09,690
We see that nice landscape filling up the entire screen and just looking great now something I will

104
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:15,690
mention my fan is going crazy because whenever you're running the game this renders is being called

105
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:19,360
over and over and over and over again it's just as crazy loop that won't stop.

106
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:24,060
So I like hitting the stop button after I've tested out the app because that way my computer doesn't

107
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:28,950
go crazy and the fan sounds like it's a you know 7:47 about to take off.

108
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:32,130
It kind of makes things chill out a little bit.

109
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:36,450
So the next position for us is we want to draw our little map.

110
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,940
So you might think OK let's go ahead and add a texture.

111
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,960
But the thing is we have lots of different pictures for our guy.

112
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:49,230
So here he is at frame one frame too like that we're trying to give the illusion that he's running.

113
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,660
And so we have to have a way to show all these different frames to the users we have to have a bunch

114
00:07:54,660 --> 00:08:00,900
of textures so in this case we're going to make a texture array for our coin man who will simply call

115
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,700
man.

116
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:06,110
So we have coin man here inside of create.

117
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:09,620
We want to go in ahead and get him set up.

118
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:16,820
So with this we're going to say man is equal to a new texture array and we've got to say how many are

119
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,540
going to be in there and we have four images.

120
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:22,920
So we'll go ahead and pass and for then the next thing that we want to do is fill up that array.

121
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:30,540
So we're going to say for man at position 0 we want to go ahead and set you equal to a new capital texture

122
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:36,110
and again we just want to pass in the name of the image so this one's going to be frame all lowercase

123
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:43,770
one p n g and that's all it takes to add our first one and we want to do this for the other three positions

124
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,120
inside of the array.

125
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:51,270
So we're just going to copy and paste this and we'll just increment our numbers here.

126
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:57,240
So there we go that's all the positions in the array and we'll just change these numbers to 2 3 and

127
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,390
4.

128
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,160
So that gives us the proper array for our new man.

129
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:07,170
But then the question is Will how do we get to show all these different textures and you don't remember

130
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:14,010
this render method just gets called over and over and over again like it's just constantly repeating

131
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:14,310
loop.

132
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:20,220
So basically what we want to do is we want to keep track of you know what position we are on with the

133
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:26,100
man and we want to draw the man at that particular time with you know whatever it is that it's going

134
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:26,710
to be.

135
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:32,100
So you know it's going to take a little bit of you know math to figure out what it is that we should

136
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,300
do but really not all that much.

137
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:41,570
So what we want to do is let's go ahead and just draw our little guy once.

138
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:45,210
And it's important that you do this after the background because the order in which you draw things

139
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:48,460
is very important because now the man's going to appear on top of the background.

140
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:54,240
If you did it before the background he would be completely smothered by the background so we're going

141
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:01,800
to say Bache dot draw and we're going to pass on our man and let's say just initially we're going to

142
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:07,840
do the very first texture inside of there and let's say we want him to fill the center of the screen

143
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,730
right like that would probably seem like a reasonable thing.

144
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:17,940
Well the math that we'd want to do for this is we first have to figure out his x and y position if he's

145
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:21,900
going to go to the center of the screen we have to take the high divided by two and the width divided

146
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:22,850
by two.

147
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:27,050
So start first with X which is referring to the left and right position on the screen.

148
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:32,140
We're going to say Jeeta X graphics.

149
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,310
Get with.

150
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,170
We're going to divide that number by two.

151
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:36,910
OK.

152
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:46,170
And we're also going to say X dot graphics and get the height we're going to divide that number by two.

153
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:52,050
Then with those two positions in place let's go ahead and see what this looks like.

154
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:55,460
So again this is only going to show our little dude in one position.

155
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:59,410
But then we're going to learn how we can loop through and make this happen.

156
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:04,880
So go ahead and give a second to have this show up on the emulator.

157
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,510
And look there's our guy.

158
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:11,950
So you'll notice he's not exactly in the center of the screen.

159
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:17,990
And the reason for that is that you know we went to the position for him it starts at the corner here

160
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,440
the bottom left corner.

161
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,560
So he said go to the center of the width which is here and then the center of this like we actually

162
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,890
want to go to the center position.

163
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:29,630
And then half of his width to move him over just enough.

164
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:35,740
So if we want to get technical and go to that position let me stop that before my computer heats up.

165
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:42,050
We're going to get half the width and then we're also going to subtract whatever the width of our man

166
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:42,700
is.

167
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:45,790
And you know let's say position zero.

168
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:50,390
We can just do the get with from here but then we want to also divide that by two.

169
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:53,590
So let's go ahead and do that and we should see that he is centered on the screen.

170
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:58,430
It's important that we get him centered on the screen because if he's too far to the right you know

171
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:02,660
the player doesn't have enough time to see the coins you could arguably put a maybe more to the left

172
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,090
if you really wanted to.

173
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:07,690
But look at that all of a sudden now he's in the center he's still a little bit high.

174
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,870
But we're going to talk about his height in the second here and we're not going to want to put too much

175
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,190
effort into that.

176
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:18,290
So the one thing that I want to finish before we end this lecture is I want to make it look like he

177
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:19,140
is running.

178
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:24,160
And so we have to have a way to loop through all of his different running positions.

179
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:31,130
So in order to do that what we're going to do is create a new integer that we are going to call man's

180
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,170
state.

181
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:37,350
So this is going to tell us you know is he in the zero position the one the two the three.

182
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:37,930
Right.

183
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:47,930
And so we're just going to do a cool little statement here and we say if Man state is equal to or excuse

184
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:50,580
me if it's less than three.

185
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:57,970
So if it's for example 0 when it starts up we want to say Man state plus plus.

186
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:02,360
So that's going to add once so that it will initially be zero and one and two.

187
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:06,130
And then when it gets to three that's when that's kind of our pushing point.

188
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:12,740
Well in that case that's when we're all going to want to say ELTs and flip man's state back to zero.

189
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,280
It's all set that equal to zero.

190
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:21,700
So now rather than saying man's at the zero position here we're going to use the man state and here

191
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,920
as well rather than just saying zero.

192
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,490
We want to do the man state.

193
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:30,580
So let's go ahead and see what this looks like.

194
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:31,840
I forgot to hit stop there.

195
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,260
So that's Peter's heating up again.

196
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,840
So let's go ahead and see what this looks like.

197
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:46,060
I think that he's running put it is way way way too fast in the so we've got to find a way to sort of

198
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:47,660
time this down a bit.

199
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,870
So let's go ahead and stop that.

200
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:55,030
We're going to bring yet another INT into the equation and we're going to call this pause.

201
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:59,560
Now we're going to use this number to just kind of give pause to our Apple and set it equal to zero

202
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:00,880
initially.

203
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:06,010
But what we're going to do here is we're going to set up an if statement where we say hey if.

204
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:12,970
Pause and you'll have to pick the number I found that 8 below 8 is a good one to say if pause is less

205
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:18,160
than eight then I want you to go ahead and say pause.

206
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:30,100
Plus plus OK and if that's not the case in the else situation here then I want you to have our man here.

207
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:38,380
Excuse me I want pause to be equal to zero so you'll notice every eight times that we run through this

208
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,630
loop then we'll come through and change the man's state.

209
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,580
So it kind of gives pause here.

210
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:46,940
So it's like runs through eight times and it just hits there but once it's pauses equal to it it comes

211
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:51,820
down says oh I can update the Mansei that comes back Pozzi equal to zero so I to run through there eight

212
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,720
times and it comes back says oh I'll move and say it again.

213
00:14:55,030 --> 00:15:04,140
So if you want to see this in action hit this run button and we will see hopefully our little dude run

214
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:07,340
in here and a much more visual good pace.

215
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,730
And again I thought this was the right number.

216
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:12,990
You can have it be less or more to change the speed at which he runs.

217
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,630
But I think this looks pretty good.

218
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:19,840
So this is a good stopping point for our app right here in the next lecture.

219
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:24,910
We're going to cover how we can make Quain man fall to the ground and then eventually start doing things

220
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:27,190
like adding the coins and the bombs.
