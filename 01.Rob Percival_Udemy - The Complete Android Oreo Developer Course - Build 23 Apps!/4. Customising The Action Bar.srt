1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,860
So as I mentioned earlier there's two Android concepts that I want to teach you before we move forward

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:05,790
and make our notes app.

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:10,800
So the first one that I want to teach you about is menu so this is a way to add some actual options

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,040
for our users and they're kind of in their own menu place you'll notice as soon as we build it in an

5
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,750
app about where this is and how different apps use them.

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:24,730
So let's go ahead and start a new project I'm going to name mine just simply the menu demo.

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:30,010
Nice plain vanilla title there and we'll go ahead and hit next on this.

8
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:34,460
We want this to be an empty activity and we'll finish up there.

9
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,350
So it's been a little bit interesting with the android studio in the past.

10
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:41,560
It used to be that there always used to be apps that start with a menu.

11
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:46,170
Now that is not the case you can choose an activity habit in there but I'd rather just show you how

12
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:51,350
to make an empty app and be able to add a menu and later than have you have to depend on a certain you

13
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,470
know template when you start an app if you know how to add it in.

14
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,990
It's just going to make it that much better of an Android Developer.

15
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:05,760
So with that the first thing that we need to do is we need to be able to go and get the particular menu

16
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,990
that is that we want to create.

17
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:12,030
So there's a couple of steps that have to happen here so if we expand our app out here we're going to

18
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,780
go to our resources and we're first going to create a new folder here.

19
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,070
So let's go ahead and Right-Click we want to do new directory.

20
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:27,200
There we go and let's just simply call this menu right like that.

21
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,320
OK.

22
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,960
Now once we go ahead and grab that the next thing that we're going to do is we're going to have this

23
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:41,250
menu selected and then we're going to say file new menu resource file right here so go ahead and select

24
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,030
that.

25
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:46,740
Now for the name that you want to give this you simply just doesn't matter immensely what this says

26
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,880
but let's just go ahead and call ours underscore main menu.

27
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:55,680
This is our way of saying this is going to be you know the one and only sort of main menu that we have

28
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,070
in the directory name.

29
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,690
Make sure the menu right we're trying to put it in that folder there we'll go ahead and hit OK.

30
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:07,800
And now once we've done that you'll see we get in SML file which is very similar to like our activity

31
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:13,550
underscore main X-amount right where we can kind of set things up visually see what they look like.

32
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,340
But this is going to be for the menu item.

33
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,780
And if we go ahead and write or click on this little menu directory here we can see we've got that main

34
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,430
underscore menu X-amount.

35
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,310
That means we're in a good place.

36
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:31,050
Now the next step for us is we've got to fill in this main menu with the appropriate information so

37
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,590
I find this easiest to do via text.

38
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,430
So let's go ahead and go to the text.

39
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:41,130
View here so in between these two menu tags This is where we want to add what are called menu items.

40
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:45,960
So these items we've got to give them a title we got to give them an idea and really that's it.

41
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,960
So let's go ahead and create our first item.

42
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:53,160
You'll see as we do that we get some nice auto complete help from Android studio so the name that we're

43
00:02:53,160 --> 00:03:00,210
looking for here is Android title so I'll type out Android Colan title and it we've got to set this

44
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:03,900
to some strings so in this case let's maybe call it like settings.

45
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,440
All right.

46
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:08,120
And we'll do a space the next thing that we're looking for here is Android.

47
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:11,300
I will scroll down there that is.

48
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:17,310
So then we've got to put some sort of idea in here and I'm just going to call this maybe you'll see

49
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:25,570
at plus ID slash and I'm going to have this be equal to the settings.

50
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:26,310
OK.

51
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:31,890
So once you've gone ahead and got that in place we can go ahead and do our ending and that will automatically

52
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:33,790
add the back side of that item tag there.

53
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,370
OK.

54
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:39,330
So just to see what this would look like if we go back to our design view look at that we get the three

55
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,600
little icon menu item here.

56
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:47,540
And then whenever someone wants to check out one of the menu items it's going to show up here like this.

57
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,740
So let's go ahead and go back to our text.

58
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:55,380
We want to add another menu item here we just simply have to copy this and paste it down below.

59
00:03:55,380 --> 00:04:01,170
And we're going to change this from settings to help and instead of the idea of settings we'll call

60
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,940
this one help.

61
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,950
So now if we go back to our design view.

62
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:05,550
Right.

63
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:10,070
Someone can either check for more information about the settings or they can suffer help.

64
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:15,020
And as you can imagine you can put as many or as little of these as you would like.

65
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:19,920
So with those in place we've got to write a little bit of code here.

66
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:23,350
So let's go back to our main activity.

67
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,760
We're not going to touch this on create method but what we're going to do is we're going to add a new

68
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:34,300
method up top and we're going to call if we just start typing out on create options menu.

69
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:37,990
That's what we're looking for it's going to go do a ton of stuff for us.

70
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:43,770
Basically this is going to allow us to get the menu all set up so what we're going to do first is get

71
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:49,470
something called the menu inflator or want to say capital menu in Fator lower case menu inflator is

72
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,700
equal to get menu inflator.

73
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:56,280
And how many times you say inflator.

74
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:03,330
Then once we have this menu inflator we go ahead and type that out then we are going to say Dot inflate

75
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,360
and this is where we're going to give access to our menu that we had just created.

76
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:14,280
So we're going to say capital our DOT that we want to get to menue that gets us to our menu directory

77
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,870
and then we're going to say Dot main menu.

78
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:17,390
OK.

79
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,890
That's how it connects there.

80
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:24,270
And the next thing that we need to pass this is this menu object right up top so just go ahead and pass

81
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,330
that through.

82
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,940
And so now with these things in place let's go ahead and hit run.

83
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,340
We want to see what this looks like on the emulator.

84
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:37,770
So again what we should see showing up here is the menu popping down and showing the settings showing

85
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:38,560
the help.

86
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:43,080
And then I'm going to show you how you can go about making it so that when someone selects one of those

87
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,010
you can write some code to appropriately respond to that.

88
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:54,690
So let's go ahead and get her emulator all set up here and we'll just wait a moment here while this

89
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,600
is getting all ready to rock and roll.

90
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,760
And there we go as soon as you mentioned the emulator taking a long time.

91
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,750
That's as soon as the menu or emulator starts working.

92
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,470
So let's hit the little gypsies here for the menu and look at that.

93
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:11,280
We get the settings we get the help just like we were looking for and if you decide user decides they

94
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,720
don't want to pick something they just tap out here.

95
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:19,350
But then the next question for us is you know someone wants to select the settings or they select help

96
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:19,570
right.

97
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:22,220
Like we should have the ability to run some code.

98
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,520
And let me show you how we can do that.

99
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:30,150
So we're going to come back to our code that we have here but we're going to create Now a new method

100
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:37,930
and the method that we're going to create is called on options and on options items selected.

101
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:43,670
So this gets called when someone selects one of these items so they give us a couple of things here

102
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,470
first it's calling superdog on item selections we want to keep that.

103
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:52,860
But we do with this want to return back a boolean about true or false about whether we were able to

104
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:56,250
successfully provide the user what they needed.

105
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:02,040
So right now it's calling to the Super one we want to leave the super call but we want to do this return

106
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:07,260
later so I'm going to cut out the return and I'm going to pases it down below and we'll do our own return

107
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,510
later and again we have to return a boolean.

108
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:15,360
So maybe for the time being we'll go ahead and return true to say everything works out.

109
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:22,020
Now with this on options item selected it passes us this menu item and we can go ahead and check with

110
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,610
this menu item and see what it's ideas in.

111
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:29,190
Depending on the ID we can do something with it so this is a great situation to use a switch.

112
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:32,580
You could also use these statements but I think a switch is a little more elegant.

113
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:36,910
So we're going to say switch print the season do our curly brackets like that.

114
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:40,640
And the thing that we want to inspect is this item over here.

115
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:46,330
So when I say item dot and then we want to get item ID.

116
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:51,030
So this is going to provide us for example if we go back to our menu item it's either going to give

117
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:55,140
us like settings or help right and then we can move forward from there.

118
00:07:55,140 --> 00:08:04,790
So one of the cases would be we're going to say case capital R ID dot settings just like that.

119
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,930
So after that we're going to do a colon make sure it's not a semi-colon and in which case then we'd

120
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:19,830
want to log out some information so maybe you would say something like item selected and then we'd specify

121
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:22,060
here what menu item it was that was selected.

122
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,330
And if this is the settings we'll say settings can do our semi-colon there.

123
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:32,790
Once we have that in place if we were able to successfully do that we would want to return true here

124
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,680
to say Yep the user.

125
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:39,930
We ran the code that we needed to return true and that then makes it so to make sure that no other code

126
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,180
gets run.

127
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:46,220
Another case that we would want to check for would be capital our DOT ID dot.

128
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,060
In this case we want the help.

129
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,950
So go ahead and do that and we're essentially running the same code right like we're going to just copy

130
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:56,910
and paste this instead of settings will say item selected.

131
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,720
And I guess we should put an extra he's selected.

132
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,770
There we go.

133
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,630
This one should say help if they select that.

134
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:09,420
Now any time that you have a switch statement you have to have a default there to say you know in case

135
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:15,030
it didn't equal anything from above and in this situation let's just go ahead and return false because

136
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:19,460
that's saying hey something went wrong we didn't run the code that we wanted to there.

137
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:20,230
All right.

138
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:25,560
So with all of this in place that means we can now get rid of this return in fact you can see Andray

139
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,460
studio saying this thing's on resettable you've already handled all the situations there.

140
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:34,620
So let's just go ahead and get rid of that and with this this is everything that I wanted to teach you.

141
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:37,830
Let's go ahead and test it out to make sure that this works.

142
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,610
So we'll pull up our emulator here.

143
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:46,470
We should also get Lague cat up and running so that you can see what gets logged whenever we select

144
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:52,680
one of these items so here comes the app and we'll hit the menu and let's select one of the items maybe

145
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,340
help and look at that item selected help.

146
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,720
Now let's go ahead do the same thing for once someone taps on settings and look it up.

147
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,760
Item selected settings.

148
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:08,220
So this is a quick little lecture I wanted to just teach you this one concept very simply remember the

149
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:13,360
whole process for creating a menu item is you've got to create a menu directory.

150
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:18,150
Then one of these menu layouts once you do that you've got to put in the correct items and then these

151
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,330
are the two main functions that you'll be working with.

152
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:27,420
The create option menus that just make sure that this shows this menu over here and then on option items

153
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,470
select it says ok when someone clicks on one of these or taps on one of these.

154
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,780
Go ahead run a code depending on which item it is that they selected.

155
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,510
OK.

156
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:41,940
All right so let's go ahead and learn about dialog boxes and then we'll move forward with making our

157
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,270
app.
