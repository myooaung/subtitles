1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,900
So this is going to be an interesting lecture here.

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:07,380
And the main thing that I want you to learn from this is I want you to be able to learn how to hide

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,620
and show you the elements in that.

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:14,850
So we learned how to enable and disable some elements in our last egg time wrap but this one I want

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:18,120
you to be able to completely show them or hide them.

6
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,640
And the big kind of difference here is I want you to try and learn this on your own so I actually want

7
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:23,730
you to go on on the internet.

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,920
Figure out how to do this maybe like Android documentation's Stack Overflow questions whatever it is

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,240
you want but I want you to learn the skill of being able to figure out something on your own.

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,410
And this is going to be a quick one.

11
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:39,630
All I want you to do is make an app that has two buttons one that says show one that says hide if the

12
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:40,990
user taps the show on.

13
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,760
There should be a text view on the screen that is visible.

14
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:49,710
And if the user taps the Hide button that text you should become invisible so the show in the hide depending

15
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,860
on which one you click is going to make the text you either appear or disappear.

16
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:54,440
OK.

17
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,490
So go ahead hit pause on your videos.

18
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,000
I want you to go ahead and do this on your own.

19
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,230
Then I'll come back and talk about it this really shouldn't take long this is going to be a quick lecture.

20
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,660
But go ahead and hit pause now.

21
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,100
All right so hopefully that went well for you and I'm not trying to be lazy here and say you know go

22
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,440
ahead and google this yourself.

23
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,670
I'm trying to help you develop that skill of you know.

24
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,590
So let's say you're making an app on your own and you think others want to learn how to do this but

25
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:25,720
I don't exactly know how to do it by having that skill to be able to go out and find the answer to your

26
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,500
question is very very valuable.

27
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:35,410
So what I would do if I was in this situation I'd go to Google and look at something like maybe Android

28
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:42,310
hide UI element or something like that maybe you I view could be another one to go to.

29
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,600
Let's see what the stack overview question says.

30
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,180
And you know we get some good information here.

31
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,070
Look at this set.

32
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,890
Visibility view visible.

33
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:52,370
OK.

34
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:55,240
So this will probably get us along the right track.

35
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,180
Right like this question wasn't exactly what we were trying to find there working with the table lay

36
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,410
out in all this different stuff.

37
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:06,970
But this visibility stuff that looks like probably you know what we're looking for and you know we'll

38
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:07,920
see what we can do there.

39
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,650
So let's go ahead and open up Android studio.

40
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:17,610
We're going to start a new project we're going to call this one show to show hide really simple on this

41
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:24,130
we just want to kind of make sure that we can you know make an app that learns this new skill.

42
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:29,860
And yeah I've had some students say well it feels really good you know weird Googling things like you

43
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,700
know I feel like I'm not a real developer when I do that.

44
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:37,690
Let me tell you all developers Google and have to look up things like the idea that you should just

45
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:42,100
have in your brain how to do every single thing in programming is absurd.

46
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:47,260
I mean we have the Internet available to us we don't have to remember things we just have to know how

47
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:52,000
to get them we have to remember how to get to the information and if we can do that we are going to

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,260
be in great shape.

49
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:57,600
So let's go ahead and move to our display here.

50
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,320
We're going to work on the visual side of things.

51
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,540
And again we're going to be very simple here.

52
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,080
So the first thing that we just need is a text view.

53
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:09,100
And in fact we could just keep the existing text you that we have if we want to.

54
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:13,600
And I think I'll just do that and we just need two buttons here so I'm going to put one button here.

55
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,540
Up at the top left then put another button.

56
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,460
Right below it.

57
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:24,460
So this first button I want it to say show go ahead and change that.

58
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:29,920
And with this next button I want it to say hide case so those are sort of the two options there with

59
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,630
the show one.

60
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,770
We want to for the unclick have it it's name B show and for the hide one.

61
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,380
Let's just go ahead and have that one called Hide.

62
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,100
And for this hello world button here let's go ahead and give it a proper I.D..

63
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,730
We'll just call this.

64
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,700
Now I'm just going to call it.

65
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:52,410
Are you saying just because you know we're just trying to get a quick example out here time.

66
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,770
So with this let's go ahead and move over to our main activity.

67
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,840
So the big thing that we've got to do is we've got to write the functions for when someone either wants

68
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,550
to show the text for you or hide the text for you.

69
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:11,250
So we're going to say public void forgot the V on there their public void.

70
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:18,490
And I want to do show where we pass in a capital view and we'll call that view that our curly brackets.

71
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:23,320
And on that view better make sure I hit enter to import what we need.

72
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:28,240
And I'm just going to copy and paste the same thing but I'm going to change the name to hide so we should

73
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,220
have our show and hide functions here.

74
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:35,190
Next in order to manipulate the text view we have to have access to it.

75
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:41,400
So we're going to say you know text view here and we want to say text view.

76
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:46,180
Well I mean we could just simply call it text you maybe that's the simplest name and we'll come down

77
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,920
here and say all right text view.

78
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,380
You're going to be equal to find you by ID.

79
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:56,080
Capitol dot ID dot text view thing.

80
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,280
And here we go.

81
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:01,540
And I brought this up as a property so we can reference it in both of these.

82
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:05,630
So again if we go back to our Google search we were saying OK the set visibility.

83
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:08,290
Maybe this is what we're looking for.

84
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,410
So let's go ahead and try.

85
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:16,060
We're going to say text few dot set visibility.

86
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,190
And we're going to come back.

87
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:24,300
What did they say here view dot visible in all caps looks like so we're going to say View dot.

88
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,290
And then there it is capital visible.

89
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:27,240
That looks good.

90
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:32,340
Let's go ahead and copy the same chunk of code for the hide that instead of visible.

91
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,850
We need to find the opposite of that.

92
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:36,330
So maybe invisible.

93
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:36,970
Look at that.

94
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,520
We've got the option there.

95
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,890
Invisible can.

96
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,830
So this looks good in theory.

97
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:45,270
Let's go ahead and check it out make sure that it actually works.

98
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,260
We'll go ahead and throw this on to the old simulator and see what we can get there.

99
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:56,680
So again hopefully I mean you probably already have some sort of skill here with being able to google

100
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,240
things you know the fact that you found this course and were able to get into it I mean you probably

101
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:06,480
did some of your own research there but the main goal of this lecture were to sort of really release

102
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:12,020
and give you some freedom to say hey in programming you do not have to know everything.

103
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:18,580
You know it's perfectly OK to go reference up look up things Google when you get lost on stuff totally

104
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,850
totally normal behavior.

105
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:27,820
So well the hide button shows up but the the show one cancels it out and that's because visually we

106
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,880
didn't put any good constraints here I guess more correctly.

107
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,520
I didn't put any good constraint.

108
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,720
So I'm just going to go ahead.

109
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:36,370
Go ahead and add some quick ones here.

110
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:39,130
I think even just that enough is going to do it.

111
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:44,440
I mean if we were going to make a more in-depth app that we really cared about I think we'd put a little

112
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,220
bit more time into the interface there.

113
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:51,360
But again we just want to make sure the functionality works so let's hit the high.

114
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:56,810
Look at that it goes away we have the show it comes back and we can hit show multiple time.

115
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:04,120
We can hit hide multiple times and you know no matter what if we need to do the opposite it comes through

116
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:04,670
OK.

117
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,470
So I hope you enjoyed this little quick one.

118
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:12,130
We have now learned a new skill about how to do the visibility of objects and hopefully now you're feeling

119
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:16,070
a little bit more confident about your ability to go learn new things.

120
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:20,260
Now that was kind of a little break for us because I know we had just made that big egg timer app and

121
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:25,270
we've got an even awesomer app here is that a word awesome or I don't know we're going to be building

122
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:29,470
a great app in the next lecture so let's go ahead and dive into that now.
