00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:05.910
In this lecture we want to learn how we can figure out whether we're working with a round device or

2
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.130
a square device and you know we already sort of have some concept of that where you know we have the

3
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.900
string files that we're going to use these particular strings for around going to use these particular

4
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.710
ones for square and you know that'll probably work in a lot of cases but you know what if programmatically

5
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.260
we wanted to know about that because we were going to do something different with the layout.

6
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.710
Well we can do that very simply through Android studio here and I want to show you something cool that's

7
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.160
new.

8
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:37.220
And that's if we go to our activity main x M-L Let's go to the text size.

9
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.390
This is all contained in something called a box inset layout.

10
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.880
And this is a fairly new thing in the Android Ware world.

11
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.810
There's this awesome blog post about it.

12
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.700
You can find it by just googling Android Wear box inset lay out.

13
00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.730
But basically this replaces an old way of working that basically says whether you're working with a

14
00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.110
square you know lay out or you're working with the round one we're going to just make sure everything

15
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.660
fits in a particular box and so that really helps the situation when we're trying to figure things out.

16
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.700
So I really recommend going and giving this a read you can find some awesome information here.

17
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.130
But get back to the present task.

18
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.430
We want to know via code if we are working with a square or a round layout so we can do that fairly

19
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:32.100
simply by getting our just type you know get resources that get configuration and then it has this awesome

20
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.130
method called is screen round that just gives us a boolean true or false whether this thing is round.

21
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.830
So we could just do a very simple if statement like this where we just say you know if this thing gives

22
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:50.910
us back you know this then we can go ahead and log out some information so we can say log I will just

23
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.820
say device and in this case we would say round.

24
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.720
But you know if it's the situation then we were No.

25
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:06.640
We know that we were working in the square world so we can go ahead and change this to square.

26
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.470
And with that in place let's go ahead and try it on both devices.

27
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.800
So let's try this first with the round.

28
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.820
So this should log out round.

29
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:23.390
When we do that Lucky for me I've got both of them here so that we don't have to wait super long in

30
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.360
between each of the apps to get them to launch up and rock n roll.

31
00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:35.020
Even then though Android studio likes to try my patience so come on you can do it.

32
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:41.700
There we go and we'll get Lague cat up and run and heres cause we should be seeing a message come there.

33
00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.910
Now it's important to note that when you're looking through log cat here that you have the appropriate

34
00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.860
watch set up here because we ran this on round but we have square showing up here so we want to make

35
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.910
sure we change that around so we can find the round information.

36
00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.770
But with that in place let's go ahead and see if we had our message here.

37
00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.540
And look at that device round.

38
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.160
So we know that it worked for the round side of things.

39
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.290
Let's go ahead and stop this and then hit play and now we'll say we want to see what things look like

40
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.900
in the square side of the Android world.

41
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.470
So we'll go ahead and do that.

42
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.160
Make sure you change log cat to show the square information.

43
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.160
And here comes or app up and running app opens up.

44
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.340
Hello squirt world.

45
00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.340
And that device Square.

46
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.070
So now I'm going to turn things over to you with a challenge.

47
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:35.910
I want you to make a brand new Android studio project that is creating an android Ware app and I want

48
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.400
you to say have a button in the middle of the screen that the user can press that will then display

49
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.770
a text message that says whether they are on a round or a square device.

50
00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:46.160
OK.

51
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:52.140
So new Android Studio Project button on the screen when they tap that it will show a message that says

52
00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.650
either round or square.

53
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.410
Go ahead and do that now.

54
00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.700
All right so hopefully that went well for you.

55
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.960
Again we need to make a new Android studio project.

56
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:09.990
So I'm just going to say start a new project I'm going to call this one round or square and we'll go

57
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:15.790
ahead and say Next there I'm going to keep this one at API.

58
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:20.640
Well let's do 26 we'll do the latest and greatest on this one just for fun open.

59
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.710
I almost forgot that's not the phone that I'm trying to do.

60
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.530
It's Android Wear that I'm trying to do.

61
00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.710
So let's do latest and greatest and see what that's like there.

62
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:37.680
We want a blank where activity so we'll go ahead and select that and we'll hit finish and we'll give

63
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.450
this a second to finish up here.

64
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.510
So again main goal that we're looking for is we just want to have a button in the middle of the screen

65
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:47.980
or taps on that.

66
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.570
It's going to display a message.

67
00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:58.430
So let's go ahead and move first to this main activity where we're going to do some logic so we're you

68
00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:04.560
know going to have to have some sort of method when the user taps something so we'll say public void.

69
00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.880
Button clicked maybe as well we'll call it.

70
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:15.250
Maybe we'll do something better we'll say determined round or square

71
00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.120
there we go.

72
00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:27.400
This is going to take in a capital view just like that and forgot to do the auto complete here.

73
00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.210
See you there we go.

74
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:42.250
So remember the way to check whether it is round or square we're going to say get the resources resources.

75
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.640
There we go get configuration that is screen round.

76
00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:54.160
So we'll just do a simple IF statement here with this and we'll say you know if the screen is round

77
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.310
we want to display a text message saying that it is round.

78
00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:05.800
So we're going to say capital TOSed make text go ahead and pass this and then we're going to say a round

79
00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:12.650
exclamation point at least I think that's what I think we should say and say toast that length short

80
00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.720
and then we'll go ahead and show the toast.

81
00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:21.010
Now with that in place we also need an else statement that basically does the opposite of this.

82
00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:25.760
So go ahead and copy and then this time we'll say where.

83
00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.660
Exclamation point.

84
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:31.810
So with this in place we just need to have a button that's going to call this method right here so we'll

85
00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:37.960
go ahead and copy this come to the visual side of things so we don't need this text view so we're going

86
00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.760
to go ahead and delete that.

87
00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.260
But then we're going to go grab a button and bring that right inside of the app.

88
00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:49.860
So with this you can kind of determine how it is that you want this button to show up you'll notice

89
00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:56.250
we don't get the same sort of functionality about saying you know we want this to you know be a certain

90
00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:59.480
space from here you don't get the constraint lay out that you had before.

91
00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.100
In this case it's using a frame play out here.

92
00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.200
So I mean you can change that.

93
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.910
I believe if you'd like to but you know it's probably best to just stay with the frame here.

94
00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:13.860
But what you can do is you can say you know for the lay out with I want you to go ahead and match the

95
00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:19.290
same as the parent and then for the height you know you can go ahead and just say wrap content there.

96
00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:24.990
So that'll probably be fine for us let's go and double click and change the name to say something like.

97
00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:27.590
Which device.

98
00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:32.970
So then it will you know say oh if you you know click on this it'll tell you which device is going on.

99
00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:40.050
And the big one is we need to set the on click method and paste indetermined round or square and that

100
00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:43.500
should be it as far as getting this app to rock and roll.

101
00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:51.310
So let's go ahead and run this let's go first on let's maybe do the round one and we'll confirm that

102
00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:55.900
this is showing up so because we don't need to use log cat we won't have to worry about that but let's

103
00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:59.630
get both of our emulators up here.

104
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:04.260
So again hit the button.

105
00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:08.880
We should see the toe showing up and I don't know if you're like me but the very first time I did a

106
00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.430
toast on Android where I just thought it was hilarious.

107
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:16.560
It's like oh my gosh this little tiny screen this little toast message it's the cutest thing in the

108
00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.640
world.

109
00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:22.740
I don't know if you're into cute apps but I just thought it was hilarious when it happened so I think

110
00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:26.340
you'll be interested to see that one show up.

111
00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:27.880
All right finally showed up.

112
00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:28.730
Here's that button.

113
00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:29.930
And let's go ahead and tap it.

114
00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:30.970
Boum look at that.

115
00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:32.050
It says round.

116
00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:34.050
Isn't that a cool little text message.

117
00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:35.290
I think that's a great.

118
00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:37.980
I'm just going to keep hitting that over and over again.

119
00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:39.330
So awesome.

120
00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:45.810
Now just to make sure we got that we'll stop and this time we will choose the square emulator to work

121
00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:46.410
with.

122
00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:52.460
So look at that this app popped up and we can say which device hit that and boom it tells us it's square.

123
00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:57.880
And so that's pretty awesome that we can have an app that tell us whether it's square or round.

124
00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:02.940
Hopefully you completely understand that functionality now and you had that experience of setting up

125
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:04.980
the Android Ware app on your own.

126
00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:08.230
Hopefully you're starting to feel more familiar with this whole concept.
