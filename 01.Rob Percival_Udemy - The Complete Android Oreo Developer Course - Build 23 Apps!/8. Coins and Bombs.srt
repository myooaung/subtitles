1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,380
So like I said this is going to be a little bit tougher we're going to learn how to make the coins move

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:09,210
across the screen and I think technically you have the chops to get this done but you'll you'll notice

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,560
women work with game programming there's kind of some weird tips and tricks that we'll use along the

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:13,770
way.

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:15,510
So let's go ahead and stop this.

6
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:19,230
So we don't have that running the whole time that we're adding this new code here and we need to add

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,190
a lot of the top.

8
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:25,980
So basically what we're going to be doing is we're going to be creating a bunch of coin objects that

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:31,140
are going to be on the screen and we're going to have an array basically of these and they're just going

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,860
to show up do their thing.

11
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:42,650
And so what we want to do is that we're going to make an array list and we want this to be of integers.

12
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,510
I know this sounds a little bit crazy but follow me on this.

13
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:53,910
So we're going to make an array of Integer objects and we're going to set this equal to coin X with

14
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:54,330
an ass.

15
00:00:54,330 --> 00:01:01,560
So this is all the coin X expositions so to speak to a new array l'Est nothing fancy there.

16
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,430
And then we're going to do the same thing for the y position.

17
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:12,200
So the coin Y so we can now track in two or raise the x's in the why's of these coins.

18
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,590
Next we need to make a texture for our coins.

19
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,980
We're going to go ahead and say text your coin.

20
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,460
Just simple as that we'll just stop right there.

21
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,620
And then the next thing that we need to make is something called a coin counts.

22
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,820
This is just going to be an integer and we'll call it coin count.

23
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:34,760
And this is going to help us to make sure that we have the proper spacing in between the coins.

24
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:41,970
So with all of this in place let's go ahead and move now to our create method where we're going to get

25
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,570
things set up.

26
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,800
So the first thing that we need to do is we need to set up the coin.

27
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,170
So we're going to say coin is equal to a new texture.

28
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,520
Simple enough right.

29
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,020
Needs to have the name of the image which I believe is just coin PMG.

30
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,870
Let's check that coin P G.

31
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,560
We are in a good spot.

32
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,450
So we'll go ahead and do our semi-colon there.

33
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:09,320
But other than that that's really all we had to get up and running for the coins.

34
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:15,060
But you'll notice now what we're going to have to do so because we're going to want to have multiple

35
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,940
coins going across the screen.

36
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,490
We're going to want to make a method to support that.

37
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,500
So we're going to make a new method here.

38
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,430
Public void make coin.

39
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:29,950
I mean this sounds like a business like model we're going to make Kornya you know.

40
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:34,140
But with this there's a couple of things that we want to do here.

41
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:39,850
So now the first one is we want to determine what the height of this coin is going to be because the

42
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,540
coins are going to float across the screen.

43
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,490
Screen left to right.

44
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,320
That's not an issue.

45
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:47,770
But you know we don't want coins always come in at the same spot like we want one down here than up

46
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:52,120
here and then in the middle and you know maybe back down and down then up and you know we want that

47
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,770
to all be random.

48
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:59,470
So in order for that to work we're going to make a new float that we are going to call the height.

49
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:05,320
When you say this height is equal to and we're now going to have to use some randomness so let's go

50
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:14,610
ahead and make a new random object and say are random random and inside of our create we'll set it up.

51
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,440
So I should do my complete there.

52
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,710
So random is equal to in New random.

53
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,130
Excellent.

54
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:30,580
So there's this awesome function with random where we can say random dot next float.

55
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:35,240
And this gives us a number between 0 and 1 is going to be some sort of decimal point right.

56
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:42,410
So we can multiply this times the height of the screen which we do that do that geed X dot graphics

57
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,200
dot get height.

58
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:48,250
And this allows us then to go some position if it's time zero it's going to go to the bottom of the

59
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,390
screen if it's you know point five will go to the middle screen if this is one that will go to the top

60
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:52,800
of the screen.

61
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,370
So it kind of chooses where the coin is going to go on the screen.

62
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:02,770
So now that we have that height Well then we can go ahead and say OK Mike coin wise I know where to

63
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:03,700
place you.

64
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,370
I'm gonna say coin wise.

65
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:12,940
Dot ad and I'm going to add a higher object and I've got to make sure that I convert it into an object

66
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,440
because it is a float.

67
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,910
So go ahead and do that conversion there.

68
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:21,430
Now for the coin X the coin X is going to be the same every single time.

69
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:26,980
So in this situation you just want to make sure it appears you know off of the screen.

70
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,760
So we simply going to say hey give the whole width of the screen so we're going to get access graphics

71
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:36,220
Doug get with that's all we need as far as the width.

72
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,860
So you're probably still a little bit lost.

73
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:43,660
Like OK we've decided a random y position for our coin and we've decided an exposition that is going

74
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,020
to be right off the screen.

75
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:49,840
But then how do we get all these coins to show up and that's where we're going to start getting our

76
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,890
hands dirty here.

77
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,290
So the first thing is we're going to use this in that we created coin count to make it so that only

78
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:58,530
ever you like 100 loops.

79
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,980
We have a coin show up.

80
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:06,300
So let's go ahead and have our player let's do the coins before our player.

81
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:11,970
So that way if he if there's a choice whether we call draw the coin or him first we should do the coin

82
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:14,740
then him so he peers appears above it.

83
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:22,690
So we're going to say if and when this statement when you say coin count is less than 100 you've seen

84
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:23,510
this before.

85
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:28,700
Down here right we're kind of doing the same sort of style a thing we're going to say OK coin count.

86
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,850
You should go ahead and up yourself.

87
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,060
So plus plus.

88
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:42,450
But if that's not the situation then I want you to say coin count should be zero equal to zero.

89
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:45,820
That is and that you should also make a coin.

90
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,570
So that's going to go ahead and add yet another coin.

91
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:53,860
So this you know every time we run through 100 times and say put another coin on the screen and then

92
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:59,130
it runs another have another hundred times Boop put another coin on the screen.

93
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:04,500
So after we've got that in place the next thing for us is we have to draw these coins.

94
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,200
So we're going to do a little for a loop because we don't know how many coins it is that we're going

95
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,050
to have.

96
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,380
So we'll do a little for loop here or we're going to say four.

97
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:20,370
And what we want to check inside of here is we're just going to do a classic I is equal to zero.

98
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:26,230
And we want to know and I is less than the coin and you can choose.

99
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:29,910
Taxes are wise size ok whatever you want.

100
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,410
And then I plus plus.

101
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:37,590
So we'll go ahead and do this so that now we can go ahead and do some drawing.

102
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:45,220
So first let's go ahead and draw on the coin we're going to say batch dot draw.

103
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:49,680
And we want to draw the coin texture that we already have.

104
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,390
And we know where the X and Y is supposed to be.

105
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:59,200
So we just have to simply say here coin X get at the position and same thing.

106
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,990
Coin wise get at the high position.

107
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:04,880
Simple as that.

108
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:05,720
OK.

109
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:09,430
So that's going to go ahead and draw it on the screen.

110
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:13,830
And so with this let's go ahead and just run this and see what happens.

111
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,330
OK.

112
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:24,820
So we're going to go ahead and run this let's check and see what it looks like on a device.

113
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,610
All right.

114
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:28,960
So we'll go ahead and do this.

115
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:35,140
The app opens up and you'll notice what the heck there there's no coins like there's no way for this

116
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,970
thing to suddenly suddenly move.

117
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:43,660
And the reason for this is we never anywhere in our code update the coin acts to say you know we want

118
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:48,010
it to move slowly to the left so that's why we're going to do a new line down below here where we're

119
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:56,250
going to say coin X's dot set in this situation and we want to update where we currently are at.

120
00:07:56,410 --> 00:08:01,630
So we're going to say at position II and then we want to set it up to whatever it currently is just

121
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,190
minus 4.

122
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:09,510
So we're going to tap into the same array list and say Corozal extra get that position.

123
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,480
But then minus four.

124
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:17,110
So this will make it so that slowly over time we've got some coins moving on the screen moment of truth

125
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:17,710
here.

126
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,290
Let's go see what this looks like.

127
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,310
All right.

128
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:25,770
I mean later here we go.

129
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:29,770
There's our dude and there's a coin.

130
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:30,920
Look at that.

131
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,540
They are just flowing across the screen.

132
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,690
That's that's a side of beauty right there.

133
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:39,380
We just got these things going in all sorts of different directions.

134
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:39,980
OK.

135
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:43,850
So so far so good this is looking great.

136
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:48,530
The next thing that we want to add is we want to add bombs that show up every so often so I'm going

137
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:54,400
to present this as a challenge to you I want you to make it so that not every 100 counts more than that

138
00:08:54,830 --> 00:09:01,700
that we have a bunch of bombs showing up on the screen will NOT a bunch only a couple but you are in

139
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,210
charge of that.

140
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,340
So go ahead and do that now.

141
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,300
All right.

142
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,880
So hopefully that worked out for you.

143
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:12,190
It's a lot of just copy and paste of what we did before.

144
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:16,490
So for example these four lines of code we got to do the same thing for our bombs.

145
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:23,560
So we're going to call this bomb x' we're to this bomb wise.

146
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,750
We're going to make a bomb texture and we're going to have a bomb count.

147
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:35,970
We're going to have to set up our bomb texture here so to say bomb is equal to a new texture where the

148
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:39,840
image is just bombed up TNG.

149
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:45,430
And then we're going to have to make our own make bomb function here.

150
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,310
Really.

151
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:52,470
I'm telling you it's a lot of the same copy paste so same thing where we just want to get a random position

152
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:58,450
but rather than adding to the coin wise we want to add to bomb wise and bomb exits.

153
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:59,490
OK.

154
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:05,970
So once we have those in place we're going to do basically the same two things that we saw here so maybe

155
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:08,380
let's just mark out here the comment.

156
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:09,750
This is for coins.

157
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:15,570
And we're now going to do this for bombs so we'll just copy and paste here.

158
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:20,220
I actually think we should have the coin show above the bomb so it makes it that much sneakier.

159
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:25,080
Right so that if a coin and a bomb appear at the same position you know sort of hard to see that so

160
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,070
I'm going to put that at top.

161
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:34,480
So we're now say all right if bomb count is less then maybe 250.

162
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:38,790
I will kind of be in between the coin so I guess never We'll have one on top of each other but we could

163
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,810
change that.

164
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,400
Go ahead.

165
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,910
Instead of make coin we want to make bomb.

166
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:47,970
Also we have to change these to be bomb count.

167
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:50,400
And this is well to be bomb count.

168
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,290
Good good good then for our for loop.

169
00:10:53,490 --> 00:11:04,930
We want this to be for bomb x' then we're going to say go ahead and drop a bomb go get the bomb x' go

170
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:05,830
get the bomb.

171
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:14,850
Wise and then go ahead and update here on the bomb axes so that it slowly moving across the screen there.

172
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:15,640
OK.

173
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,710
So go ahead and run this and something this could be kind of fun maybe we'll make the bombs move faster

174
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:26,290
so we'll put those at 8 for example so that the coins are moving at one speed but also and these bombs

175
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:31,030
become a little bit more dangerous right because we can't you know they're coming quicker and maybe

176
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,740
they'll just sort of appear out of nowhere.

177
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,360
So here's our guy.

178
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,250
We got some coins.

179
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:39,880
Well they get that bomb out of nowhere or go in there and also.

180
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:45,730
Well you know I think that's pretty cool that that speed variable in there now might be too quick because

181
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:50,300
I think if you're in one position and you see a bomb coming like would you have enough time to respond.

182
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,970
I want to see if one comes my way.

183
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,690
No I haven't gotten any one in my space yet.

184
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,570
Come on.

185
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,510
You know you kind of get the point.

186
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:03,870
We could have a situation there that could be tough.

187
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:09,520
Now one last thing I want to talk about before we finish out here is you know right now our dude was

188
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:14,470
just running into coin after coin bomb after bomb and there was no consequences the score wasn't being

189
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,840
updated or anything.

190
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:22,270
And in order to do that to the side if our dude is running into a coin or a bomb we have to write some

191
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:25,230
code to dis Terman if there were some collision.

192
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:29,920
And in order to do that we have to add an extra little bit of physics into our app.

193
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:36,100
So what we're going to do is we're both the coins and the bombs that we're going to make a new array

194
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,120
list.

195
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,500
So up here with the coins first we're going to say array list.

196
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:47,110
And this time we're going to make it of type rectangles you haven't seen rectangles yet but these allow

197
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,960
us to add a shape to our objects.

198
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:56,350
So when you say rectangle and we're going to call this coin rectangles just like that and we're going

199
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:59,670
to say this is equal to a new array list.

200
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,320
All right.

201
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:01,410
Nothing new there.

202
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:09,960
But then what we're going to do as we move down here and we are creating our various coins.

203
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:17,900
We are going to want to draw essentially this physics Corning rectangle around the coin.

204
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:22,190
So after we do the proper class for bombs let's do this for coins.

205
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:29,320
So after we do the proper setting a little bit off to the left we're going to say coin rectangles and

206
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:40,390
we're going to say Dot to me here for and we're going to say BOM rectangles dot and we're going to add

207
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:48,980
a rectangle here and we're going to say new rectangle All right.

208
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:54,210
And we're going to set this up say bomb taxes go ahead and grab those.

209
00:13:54,550 --> 00:14:00,360
And we want to do that get to figure out the position that we're in there.

210
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,130
OK.

211
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:05,400
So with the rectangle you have to say sort of the x and y of those.

212
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:12,750
So we're going to put in that first then we're going to do when I'm mixing this up with bombs and coin

213
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,020
so let's go ahead and do coin there.

214
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:18,630
Know I Do The Same thing with coin wise.

215
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:22,000
I'd get at a particular location.

216
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:22,680
OK.

217
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:28,120
So once we have those things in place we also just want to say how big it should be.

218
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,340
So this is where we're simply just going to say coin.

219
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:32,190
Get with.

220
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:37,640
And we're also just going to go ahead and say coin not yet.

221
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,490
Right now if your programming sense sort of went on the back of your neck and take a little bit you're

222
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,230
just like whoa whoa whoa.

223
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,640
Every time we go through this function that's already looping a million times and then we're going in

224
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,920
the for loop from there we're adding a bunch of things to the surveillance like that sounds really bad.

225
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:53,940
Yes it is.

226
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:59,850
But before we go into this release we are going to clear out everything inside of the coin rectangle

227
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:02,470
so going to say coin rectangles.

228
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,050
Clear.

229
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:06,010
And that way it is emptied out every time.

230
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:11,260
And we're going to do the same thing for bumps which I kept so intently doing here so I'm going to copy

231
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,070
this.

232
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:20,650
Same thing for Bom So let's go ahead and call this bomb rectangles now as we're going through here we

233
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:27,430
want to make sure we do a clear write up at the top but make sure that is now four bombs and then we

234
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:33,580
also want to do this last line of code where we are adding these rectangles.

235
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:45,130
So let's update this to be four bomb rectangles and we have bomb axes bomb wise and then we'll just

236
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:48,980
go ahead and get the bombs with the bombs.

237
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,070
Right.

238
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,130
All right.

239
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:56,320
So if we went and ran or app right now you wouldn't see anything different but we are going to have

240
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:02,440
an awesome situation down below where we can actually check and see if there was some sort of collision

241
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:05,620
and if there was a collision we're going to want to do something about it.

242
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:11,350
So first let's go ahead and write some code to see if our dude collides with a coin.

243
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:16,150
So for this we're going to do this after everything is drawn.

244
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:24,280
And I guess before we do this we have to make a geometric shape for our little dude so we're also going

245
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,410
to create something.

246
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:28,390
Well let's go up to the top here.

247
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:33,580
We are going to call this a rectangle.

248
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:39,300
We are going to call it man rectangle.

249
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:42,710
I know a little bit ridiculous with our names here.

250
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,770
Maybe man wasn't the best choice.

251
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,430
I don't know.

252
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,590
Seems fine to me.

253
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:51,200
But here inside of our create you're going to say man.

254
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:58,180
Rectangle is equal to a new rectangle.

255
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,260
Excellent.

256
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,770
And just go ahead and get that set up.

257
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:10,910
Now with that then when we go down we are going to draw out our guy.

258
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:11,950
Here it is.

259
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:20,450
We're going to set up the man rectangle So we're going to say man rectangle dot set and this is where

260
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:24,910
we want to figure out where the man is in his current position.

261
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:33,760
So we're just going to go ahead and get to the man exposition which we can get.

262
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:37,350
Oh well we know the man position his ex never changes.

263
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:42,570
In fact the best way to do that is just go ahead and grab this point decode right here.

264
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,180
Well go ahead and copy that right there.

265
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:52,950
But I was going to say the easy thing for us is we do know what his particular y position is going to

266
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:53,630
be.

267
00:17:53,640 --> 00:18:02,370
So this is where we're just going to say Man why position is and then after we've done that we want

268
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:12,780
to specify what his height and width is going to be so this we can simply just say man with excuse me

269
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:20,000
get with an I'm not sure oh we have to provide something inside of there around a man's state.

270
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,660
I forgot that we had a man or a so to say get with an also.

271
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:31,450
Man the man's state to get height.

272
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:36,240
So with that information in place we now can go ahead and do this.

273
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:44,520
And I know we've done a whole lot of code here to get this stuff set up and I didn't want to do a set

274
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:44,720
here.

275
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:55,740
In fact when we create our new rectangle we should be doing this down below or in say an rectangle is

276
00:18:56,790 --> 00:19:01,780
equal to a new rectangle.

277
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:05,750
And where we pass forward all that information.

278
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:12,150
So now that we have that in place let's just do an if statement to check and see if the man's colliding

279
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:12,720
with the coin.

280
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,190
So for to do that we have to go through all the coins so we're going to do a for loop to get through

281
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,700
all of our coins.

282
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:23,400
And so we'll just do our classic ant is equal to zero.

283
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:31,020
So long as it is less then and we want this to be the number of coin rectangles thought size

284
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:40,410
and we'll just go ahead and say I A-plus plus they don't get a semi-colon there.

285
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:44,510
Now with that in place we're going to do a really interesting if statement and we're just going to say

286
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:53,690
if we're going to check out here something called inters sector in terms sector go ahead and open that

287
00:19:53,690 --> 00:20:00,350
up into sector dot overlaps this basically checks if two things are on top of each other.

288
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:06,740
So when I say overlaps are we going to pass in first the man rectangle and then we're also going to

289
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,990
pass the particular coin that we're looking at.

290
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:16,510
So we're going to say coin rectangles get us ever at position.

291
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:23,320
So this is going to compare the two things and see hey do either of these things overlap here.

292
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,700
So I figured out what the air here it's a nasty little one if we go up to the very top to our imports

293
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:36,140
here expand this out the rectangle that I imported was from Java ATWT which is not the rectangle that

294
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:36,530
we want.

295
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:43,190
So if we do that and now we try and enter in our rectangle we want to do the rectangle from GDX so make

296
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:48,910
sure that you have that and then that's going to get rid of the situation that we had down below.

297
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,200
So let's go ahead and log some information here.

298
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,130
It's a little bit different.

299
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:55,870
We're going to say GDX dot app dot log.

300
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:59,060
And this is going to allow us to say something like.

301
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:06,080
CONAN And we'll say college on exclamation point.

302
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:06,670
OK.

303
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:10,160
So let's go ahead and test this with our app.

304
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:16,280
We're going to have to have log cat running up beside us so that we can you know see if we're getting

305
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:20,450
the proper message when we run into those coins I'll give some space so we can see what's at the bottom

306
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:21,350
sort of float around.

307
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:24,670
Oh there's a coin here you go down and look at that said collision.

308
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:30,470
And if we go we can hit those coins to get collisions there come back down like we can collide with

309
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:31,040
that coin.

310
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,200
All sorts of cool stuff there.

311
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,220
All right.

312
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,830
So go ahead and stop that.

313
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:44,470
Now the next thing that we want to do with this like beautiful is just detect the bomb collisions.

314
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:51,950
So you know still lots of adject logic to add here but let's just go ahead at least get this you know

315
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:56,160
detecting if we're colliding with bombs which is probably something we should know about.

316
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:59,480
So go ahead and say bomb rectangles.

317
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:04,500
We'll see if man rectangle overlaps with bomb rectangles.

318
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,470
And in that case we're going to say bomb.

319
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:10,040
So let's go ahead and run this.

320
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:13,880
Make sure it works and then we'll move on to finishing the sap up.

321
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,810
We're getting really really close here.

322
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:18,200
But just a little bit more to go.

323
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:24,530
So sorry guys floating around if we get the coins let's open a blog cat we've got that we've got coins.

324
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:25,610
But let me hit that bottom.

325
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,010
Whoa.

326
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:26,450
Look at that.

327
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:28,850
You see the bomb collision Let's see if I can catch another one.

328
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,080
I just missed it.

329
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,750
Oh that's a direct hit.

330
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,550
Look at that.

331
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,640
OK.

332
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:37,880
So in the next one we'll go ahead and put all the polish on this app and then we'll be ready to rock

333
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,500
and roll.
