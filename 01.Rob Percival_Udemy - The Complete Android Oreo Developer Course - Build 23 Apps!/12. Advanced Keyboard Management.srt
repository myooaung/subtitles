00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,630
The purpose of this lecture is to fix two keyboard issues.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:07,030
So one of them is that we have this background space right.

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:12,820
Like when I tap on this white space the image here I'd like for the keyboard to disappear a little bit

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,490
frustrating that doesn't happen.

5
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:19,180
The other one is is that as I'm typing out the password I'd like to just hit the little checkbox down

6
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:24,520
here and have that automatically initiate the log in process which right now is not happening.

7
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:29,770
So the two things I want to fix so let's fix the problem first of you know if I have entered in the

8
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:35,290
password you know and I want to hit that checkbox that I can sort of complete and move on to doing the

9
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,930
log in or sign up process depending on which one is selected right.

10
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:45,400
So let's go into Android studio and we are going to have to implement something else here so after we

11
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:54,650
have implement view on click Lisner we are also going to implement capital view dot and we went on key

12
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:59,930
not inti on key Lisner this time.

13
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:03,760
Now we do this we're going to get a little bit of an air here because that saying hey you don't have

14
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:12,190
the right stuff and we need to add a new function here called on key and just go ahead and hit enter

15
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:12,570
on that.

16
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:18,100
And as soon as we do that that error will disappear up there then the code that we want to right here

17
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:24,110
is basically telling us you know hey when someone hits a key how do we want to handle this situation.

18
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:29,530
So before we dive into that code let's go down to our own create method here and sort of set up this

19
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:37,940
on key listener and we're going to do it for our password at Tech So we're going to come down here and

20
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,290
let's make sure we have our password techs at a place that we can get to it.

21
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:43,240
And we currently do not.

22
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:50,800
So for both these texting going to just copy this one paste it up above and we'll do the same thing

23
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:53,170
for a password here.

24
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:56,940
Copy that and paste it up above.

25
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:57,850
OK.

26
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:03,340
And we'll go ahead and say that now we can access these anywhere inside of the class.

27
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:10,150
So since we have that option now we bring out a special little code here that says OK with this password

28
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:15,880
edit text and realize in here that we probably need these in the uncreate so I'm going to cut this code

29
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:20,860
doing all sorts of moving around here but we'll add this code.

30
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,300
And now I can say all right passwords edit text.

31
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:31,940
I want to set in on the listener and the listener that I want to add is this.

32
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:37,630
And since we had added on key listener up here's something that this class implements we are then able

33
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,910
to move forward with the following function.

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,880
So a very simple if statement we want to provide here and it's basically just saying hey did they you

35
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,430
know is this the right key event here.

36
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:52,210
And so what we're going to check with is first into I.

37
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:56,260
This tells us what kind of key event it was.

38
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:00,520
And so we're going to check first and see if it is equal to.

39
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,260
Don't forget to equal signs.

40
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,920
Capital key event and that's key event dot.

41
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,810
And then all caps key you can see there's all sorts of things here.

42
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,240
Want key code underscore.

43
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,460
Enter.

44
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,060
OK.

45
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,140
So that's if they've hit the enter key.

46
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,210
So we're going to check that.

47
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:27,510
And we're also going to check for a key event and we want to get action from that.

48
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,640
That's another options that the passed inside of here.

49
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:34,140
We want to see if this is equal to the action down.

50
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:38,800
So we're going to say capital key event that action down.

51
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:43,600
So this is checking to make sure that is the you know return key the enter key that we have and that

52
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:50,350
it's being on the press down because this can be entered multiple times so if this is the case we want

53
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:53,830
to then run the code inside of this sign up clicked.

54
00:03:53,830 --> 00:04:00,360
So we'll simply just type inside of here sign up clicked.

55
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,900
We're going to have a pass that a view which we have a view here so let's go ahead and throw that in

56
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,490
there and this should solve our first issue.

57
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:13,990
So we'll go ahead and run this on our emulator and see what that looks like.

58
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:20,920
So again we're trying to fix the issue that when we open the app when we're you know entering in the

59
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,860
information we should just be able to run everything from the keyboard there.

60
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:28,960
So looks like the emulator is going to take a second here there is a little bit of busy work that we

61
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,410
can do while that's running.

62
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,930
And that's that in the next portion.

63
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:37,700
In order to get access to this relative lay out in this image you have to give them some idea.

64
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:44,320
So with this play out remember I gave it the name lay out because I had accidentally mistaken this for

65
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:44,870
the text.

66
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:49,650
But anyways I'm going to call this background lay out.

67
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,340
Give that a proper ID there.

68
00:04:52,340 --> 00:05:00,190
And I'm also going to select the image view and I can just call this maybe logo image view with I want

69
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:06,160
to make sure that we give proper names to those so then we can reference them in code.

70
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:12,760
So now with those two things in place we need to be able to access these in our code.

71
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:18,700
So we're going to get access to them in our on Create are going to add to all this code where we get

72
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:28,000
everything set up here so we need to get access to an image of you that we are simply just going to

73
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,510
call logo.

74
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:40,820
That means you will say this is equal to find you by id want capital art ID logo image view.

75
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,140
There we go.

76
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:48,630
The other one the one you want access to is that relative layout so we're going to say relative lay

77
00:05:48,630 --> 00:06:00,170
out what is called background layout equal to or find view by id capital or dot ID dot background layout.

78
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,120
So we'll come and deal with these in a second.

79
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:04,150
It looks like your emulator has finished.

80
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:09,070
So let's see if this first part works or if I want to come into a user name maybe I can type like Nick

81
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:13,090
inside of here and if I hit this next button you'll notice automatically we get a come down of the password

82
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:18,250
which is pretty great but then you know let's say I go ahead and put in some sort of password or put

83
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,520
some jibberish and I hit this button.

84
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:25,780
Well now it comes out and says hey there's already a user account there and if I switch to log in and

85
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:29,680
you know I hit enter on this I got to make sure my cursor is there but if I hit that's going to say

86
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:33,220
oh invalid username and password so that's successful.

87
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,200
That part is working.

88
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:39,520
But now we want to make it so that if I tap in this white space or on the image view that we get the

89
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,990
keyboard to go away.

90
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:47,170
So in order for this to happen remember how we did the set on click listener for the log in text you

91
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:50,550
were going to do it for the image view and this relative lay up.

92
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:57,250
So just like we simply have above we're going to take first my logo image view and I'm going to say

93
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:03,370
Dot set and want to do on click listener.

94
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:04,530
There we go.

95
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:09,340
And I just want to pass and this will do the same thing with the background.

96
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:17,000
Lay out say set on click listener it'll pass in this.

97
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,560
So then it sort of alerting us about that.

98
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:25,890
Now once we've done this this function up here becomes a little bit more complicated in this on click

99
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,640
right so we do this check here to make sure we're working with the log in text view.

100
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:35,050
We're going to put in a situation here where we sort of want to say hey well if it's not that maybe

101
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:38,720
it's you know they've tapped on the background or they've tapped on that image.

102
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:43,690
So if that's the case we're going to run another statement here so whoever else if and what we're checking

103
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:49,720
for here is we're going to say All right let's get this view and we're going to get the ID and check

104
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:58,330
and see if this is equal to capital our DOT I.D. dot logo image view.

105
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:06,550
So I would tell us if it was equal to image view or we want to know if the same view get ID is equal

106
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:10,160
to our DOT ID dot.

107
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:14,720
And this is where we want to get our background way out.

108
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:19,390
So if it's equal to either one of these we know that they're trying the users trying to dismiss the

109
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,130
keyboard.

110
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:25,490
So we're going to use something called the input method manager.

111
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:29,260
So makes you go ahead and hit enter on that so you get the proper things imported.

112
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:36,940
And we're just going to call this an input method manager and say this is equal to get system service.

113
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:42,540
And the one that we're looking for is an all caps input method and service.

114
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,320
Look at that it pops right up.

115
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:51,240
So once we have this in place we've got to make sure that we cast this the correct way so you don't

116
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,110
have to go ahead and put in parentheses here.

117
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:55,150
Hey this thing coming back.

118
00:08:55,150 --> 00:09:02,300
This is an input method manager but then on a new line we'll be able to say OK we're going to take this

119
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:10,290
input method manager and we're going to say hide soft input from the window.

120
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:22,990
And with that we're going to say get the current focus datt get window token and then we also are able

121
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:28,330
to pass on some flags we don't want to do anything extra special this will just close the keyboard for

122
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:28,750
us.

123
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,660
So go ahead and hit run.

124
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:36,460
Now you may be thinking man this whole lecture this was kind of some simple boring code nothing intricate

125
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,260
was going on here.

126
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:43,600
But it's these tiny small details that I think really makes an app for a user and if you know most apps

127
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,740
they're able to just hit that next button to get to the next field and then that final one to say log

128
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,820
in.

129
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:52,960
It's going to be a little bit frustrating if they try that and nothing happens so this just makes it

130
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:57,850
that much easier for them if they have a smaller device if they need to get to that.

131
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:02,980
You know get the keyboard to go down or whatever this is going to help them immensely.

132
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:06,000
So let's go ahead and test this out.

133
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:10,840
Right so I guess I don't have to click here to get the sophomore keyword to come up and if I now click

134
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:15,560
elsewhere boom look at that goes away even on the image it's showing up.

135
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,730
And I'll just hit this next key.

136
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:23,660
I'll do some sort of password switch that's logging when I hit that button look invalid username and

137
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,770
password.

138
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,730
So we know that that's working.

139
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,440
OK.

140
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,800
We'll go ahead and cover more in the next lecture.
