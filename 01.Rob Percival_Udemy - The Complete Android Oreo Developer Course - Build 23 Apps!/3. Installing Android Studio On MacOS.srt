00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,560
In this video I'm going to show you how to download the one and only piece of software you need for

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,300
this course Android studio.

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:10,380
If you're on Windows you can jump straight to the next video where I'll lead you through the process

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:11,460
using Windows 10.

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:17,580
But in this video I'll show you how to get Android studio on Mac OS so all you need to do is go to your

6
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,560
favorite search engine.

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:25,830
Type in Android studio and you can see the top result there for me is developer dot Android dot com

8
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,180
slash studio.

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,390
That's what you want.

10
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:36,210
So Android studio is currently on version 3 and it's a complete system that allows you to both design

11
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:42,120
and Cojo apps and you can also run them in an emulator on your computer so you don't need a phone or

12
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,170
a smartwatch or a tablet to actually test your applications.

13
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:52,170
I can do everything from within Android studio so click the big green download Android studio button

14
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,290
agree to the terms and conditions and then click the blue download button that will maybe take a little

15
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:00,020
while to download it is a pretty big file.

16
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,010
So have a break have a cup of tea.

17
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,820
Come back when you're done.

18
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:11,090
All done then you just need to flip over to find the look in your downloads and you should have this

19
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:17,430
address judaeo DMG file which you just double click on and then it will verify unpack and allow you

20
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,400
to install it.

21
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:25,170
Now we're going to just drag Android studio over into applications and it will complete the installation

22
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,110
process.

23
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,540
And that's it.

24
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,050
Once you've done that open Android studio in the way you would any application I use command space to

25
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:41,120
open spotlight's and then just search for Android and it should be towards the top there.

26
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:48,790
DoubleClick on George do you ask you if you want to open it and we'll say yes you will then get this

27
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,650
loading screen.

28
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:57,310
It might need to download some extra components and then you get to the set up with it which just allows

29
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,350
you to choose a few options.

30
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:02,500
We're going to go for the standard installation.

31
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:07,060
I'm going to use the default like theme but if you prefer dark you can choose the dark killer theme

32
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,550
then next.

33
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:16,570
Again I would allow it to choose all these default SDK that is software development kit components and

34
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:18,370
then click Finish.

35
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:23,260
Again it'll take a little while to download but when it's done you'll finally be ready to get started

36
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:25,140
with developing for Android.

37
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,430
And then when you're done you should see the Wolken to endorse Judaea message.

38
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:33,350
And this is where will kick off in our Andrys to yota at the beginning of the next video.
