1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:01,130
All right.

2
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:06,290
It's time to learn how we can take these apps that we've been building all our own and sharing them

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:07,130
with the world.

4
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:12,140
One of the coolest things that I love about Android development is how quickly you can get your apps

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,070
on the App Store.

6
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:20,930
So the reason that I say this is because I initially started as an IOW developer and I remember my first

7
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:22,730
time trying to get my app on the App Store.

8
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:28,230
It took weeks to figure out the whole process about how to upload my app to apples App Store.

9
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:34,040
I got it rejected two times before I finally got approved in between each decision was about a week

10
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,460
and a half's worth of waiting.

11
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,070
And it was just awful.

12
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,190
It was terrible to see this thing that I spent so much time on.

13
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:43,400
Take that much effort to just get through to the App Store.

14
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:48,920
Whereas with Android with the Google Play store it's much much simpler.

15
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:53,960
So you can take this thing that you created and very quickly share that with family and friends.

16
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:59,990
That's that's one of the things I love about Android now in order to get this rocking and rolling.

17
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:02,720
I'm just going to use one of our past apps here.

18
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,960
I'm using this list view demo that we had created before this.

19
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,680
I just want to show you what the process would be I'm not actually going to put this into the store

20
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,880
but I want to walk you through everything that you would need.

21
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:17,500
So the first step is to go to developer dot Android dot com.

22
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:21,160
And so you're going to need a Google Developer account now if you don't have one of those yet.

23
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:22,510
It's going to prompt you for everything.

24
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,670
But once you're to this page you want to click on this play console.

25
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:31,480
So this is going to take you to a screen where it's going to ask you to sign in then with an account.

26
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:36,320
So go ahead and do this if you don't already have a Google account get one but do that and I'll meet

27
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,650
you at the next step.

28
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:40,450
So once you're there you're going to have to go through a series of steps here.

29
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:45,530
And it's essentially you have to agree to the terms and you also have to pay a registration fee and

30
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,560
it's a one time twenty dollar twenty five dollar fee.

31
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,240
So I know that's kind of annoying that you got to pay money to get your app on the App Store.

32
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,030
But again compare this with the Apple world.

33
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,310
It's ninety nine dollars per year.

34
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:03,320
It's an ongoing reoccurring payment where this is a one time twenty five dollars thing.

35
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,660
So we're in a pretty good situation comparatively to what's out there.

36
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:11,740
But go ahead and go through those steps and then I'll meet you once you're finished with all that.

37
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:16,460
So once you've gone ahead and gone through that process you should be at this console screen here and

38
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,880
you can click on this publish an Android app on Google Play.

39
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,980
So we want to make a new one here.

40
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,600
It's going to ask you for your language.

41
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:28,640
It's also going to ask for a title you can always come back and change us so don't worry too much about

42
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:28,820
this.

43
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:37,790
So I'm going to call this list view fun something like that and I'll go ahead and hit create so this

44
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:42,380
will then take you to the details for your app and there's all sorts of information that you can fill

45
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:42,800
out here.

46
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,540
So there's stuff like the title The short description full description all these things that are going

47
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,230
to show up on Google Play.

48
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,830
There's graphical assets.

49
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:57,320
So this mostly includes screenshots but also you've got these high rez versions of your icons and even

50
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,120
TV banners.

51
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:03,650
I thought this was really interesting the daydream 360 degree image for those people using the daydream

52
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,010
VR stuff.

53
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:09,770
You can even include like a promo video you've got to say what category you want this information to

54
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:13,120
be in just all sorts of details that you want to fill out.

55
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,550
So we're going to come back and talk about screenshots in just a second.

56
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:23,120
But I do want to focus on one thing and that's actually uploading your app to the App Store here because

57
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,160
you know you can fill in these details but it's another thing to actually get a file up to say hey this

58
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,630
is what I want to release to the store.

59
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:33,460
Now to do that you want to go here to app releases over on the left.

60
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:39,980
And here this is where you're going to release an AP case file so the AP case contains everything about

61
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,460
your app all the images that you have in there.

62
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:46,150
All your main activities.

63
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:53,990
I mean your manifests the layouts everything is inside of the AP file and so when you're here you can

64
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:57,090
actually use this to do like some beta and alpha testing.

65
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:00,290
That was pretty funny that they split between the two there.

66
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:04,880
But we want to work with production because we have an app that's ready to rock and roll so you just

67
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:12,110
want to go to manage production and you want to create a release and you want to go ahead and say I'm

68
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:14,750
going to continue with the signing stuff.

69
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,700
Yes accept the terms.

70
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,140
OK.

71
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:23,480
And this now allows you to add in a P.K. which we have to go get this from Android Studio.

72
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:29,780
So let's move back to Android Studio and what we're going to do once we're here is we need to open up

73
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,430
our variance.

74
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:36,310
And so if you have build variance over here on the left side needs you to click on that.

75
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:43,130
If not go to help but if you just search for variance you're going to get the build variance options

76
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:43,720
up there.

77
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:44,460
OK.

78
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:51,170
So with all of that in place what you want to go to do is click on this build variant and change it

79
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:52,430
from debug to release.

80
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:57,020
So every time we've been running our app it's been in quote unquote debug mode now we want to go to

81
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:01,630
release mode which is going to create an AP Kay File for us.

82
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,570
All right.

83
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:07,480
Now before we can go ahead and just you know build this and let this thing rock and roll.

84
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:14,270
We have to sign our app and basically what signing our app does is it says hey we are the only people

85
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:18,320
that are going to be able to make updates to this app for the foreseeable future.

86
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:23,510
So in order to do this we want to go up to the top here to build and then we're going to come down and

87
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,860
say generate signed a peak.

88
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,970
Remember that's the file that contains everything.

89
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,600
So go ahead click on that and it's going to ask you what module you want to do this from.

90
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,940
We just want to choose the default app that we have there.

91
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,890
Now when you get to this next part it's going to ask for this key store pass.

92
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:44,330
So it's basically saying you know do you want to make any one of these and yes we don't have an existing

93
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:46,500
one so we're going to say create new.

94
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,750
Now once you click on that it brings up even more details here in this first can ask where do you want

95
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,230
to save this.

96
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,610
So I'm just going to go ahead and throw mine on the desktop.

97
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,510
So I'll go ahead and choose that.

98
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,580
Then you have to make a password for this.

99
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm going to do a fairly simple password but you know feel free to do something more complex for your

100
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,080
app.

101
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,450
Then you've got to make a alias here and go ahead and choose what you want this to be.

102
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:17,930
I'm going to call it something like a list view key something like that.

103
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:21,320
I know it's kind of simple and again up up here in the key store path.

104
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,390
We should also give this a proper name.

105
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:30,800
So I'm going to call this maybe something like a list view key store.

106
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,820
OK.

107
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:35,180
So with that in place again you've got to have another password.

108
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:35,790
So we'll go ahead.

109
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,480
I'm just going to reuse the same one.

110
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,530
Feel free to do different if you'd like.

111
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,910
You've got to choose how long you want this to be valid for and I think twenty five years is pretty

112
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:44,180
good.

113
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,840
I don't know if the Google Play store is going to be around in twenty five years who knows what kind

114
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,150
of tech we're going to have in that timeframe.

115
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,990
So with that in place you want to go ahead and put in your information.

116
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:59,810
So I'll just say Nick Walter here organization unit.

117
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:05,300
Honestly you can just copy and paste your name for each of these it's not too big of a deal city or

118
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,220
locality.

119
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:12,620
Again listen if you want I'll do SLC Utah in the old U.S. of A.

120
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:16,600
OK so with all that information in place you're going to go ahead and hit.

121
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:17,930
OK.

122
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,690
And it's going to say hey I've got all this information is this what you want.

123
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:25,340
The next thing that you want to do is make sure that this remembers your password.

124
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:27,890
So go ahead and check that box.

125
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:30,280
So go ahead and hit this next button.

126
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,830
And with this you want to make sure that you save this to a place where then you can go get to it and

127
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:41,090
upload build type we want to make sure this release and have both of these signature versions checked.

128
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,420
So with that go ahead and click on finish here.

129
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:48,450
And this is going to go make that AP case file and it might take a little bit of time because it's trying

130
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:54,110
to recreate your app as a whole but luckily for me that didn't take too long.

131
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,270
But if you do does take a bit of time don't worry.

132
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,140
That's usually expected.

133
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:03,630
So with that let's go back to safari here and now we'll just say browse file I have saved mine to my

134
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:08,870
desktop so look here it is it came in this release folder and there's that app release that AP.

135
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,050
So go ahead and choose that.

136
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:16,020
That's going to upload it here to Google Play and it will tell us what it thinks and oh it is not happy

137
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,790
with what we've given it.

138
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:24,120
And that's because we had when we were setting this up just the com dot example package name in there

139
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,080
which I guess has been taken by someone else that was you know working through an example.

140
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,660
So in order to fix this we can do this let's go back to Android Studio.

141
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:38,280
This will be a good process for you to see because we've always mentioned you know you can have it be

142
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,510
your Web site in reverse.

143
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,820
You can have it be your name but you can always come back and change it.

144
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,270
Well this is how you can change it if you need to.

145
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:49,050
So you're gonna go here make sure you have the Android view selected.

146
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:54,270
And once you have that you just want to hit the settings icon and you want to uncheck this hide empty

147
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,230
middle packages.

148
00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:01,560
So what that does it sort of breaks these out into the full you know com example zap code.

149
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:07,880
So unfortunately for me I had this example if it had just been com zapping code I would've been fine.

150
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:12,090
So we actually just want to move that directory up to there and saying Hey are you sure you want to

151
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:12,970
move this.

152
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:19,020
And you just say yes to all this for you you might be renaming the folders rather than moving it up

153
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:25,770
because I just needed to get rid of the example and you just say yes go ahead do this refactor and it's

154
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:30,090
going to go through your project and make sure it can handle all of the changes for this.

155
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:37,690
So it's you know going to go through and do its thing and we'll give Android Studio a second here.

156
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:43,710
So once we have that in place you know you would want to do the same thing here for you know like the

157
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:44,850
tests and everything.

158
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:50,550
We're not using the test in our app and so I'm just gonna go ahead and actually just delete these so

159
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:57,060
I'll get rid of the Android test and we'll come back and do the second test here once Android Studio

160
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:01,960
has finished up.

161
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:06,430
So it looks like it did that and then we'll go ahead and delete this one as well.

162
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,830
So we'll go ahead and get rid of those.

163
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,650
Okay.

164
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:15,150
So once we've done that we can go ahead and change this back to the compact view so that we can go ahead

165
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:18,940
and see those items a little bit easier.

166
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:26,370
You can see we have a little bit of an issue here because we had to get rid of this example directory

167
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:30,840
in that one and there we go.

168
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,590
Now if we go back to compact.

169
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,200
There we go.

170
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,220
That's looking a lot better for us.

171
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:35,900
OK.

172
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,520
So with this in place that was a good change to make.

173
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,210
There's also one more thing that we need to change.

174
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:49,620
And so we need to go open up one of our great all files so we're gonna go down here to the great scripts.

175
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:54,120
Make sure you open the one that says module app and once you have this open.

176
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:59,220
This is where you'd want to have the appropriate application I.D. and it looks like we've got this in

177
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,660
place we've got comm dots app barcode that list view demo it's listing what we have there so that must

178
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,980
have done that and the refactor so good to know that that'll work.

179
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:13,680
But now that we have that in place we can go back and do our build and do generate the AP okay we'll

180
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:19,640
say next to this put in our password and with all that make sure both those are checked.

181
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:30,910
We will hit finish Gates will give Android Studio a second to finish up here and there we go now after

182
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:36,160
this unfortunate error let's go ahead and try this one more time we'll browse our files.

183
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:43,680
Try this new release dot KPK and come on be nice to us Google Play

184
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,090
moment of truth here drum roll.

185
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:52,630
Look at that it's processing it's kind of going through the app and look at that good news.

186
00:11:52,630 --> 00:12:00,910
So we have Version 1.0 here ready to rock and roll and that means that we now have an AP Kay file.

187
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:05,440
So with this you know the next step for us would be to review and roll out.

188
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:11,800
But there's so many details that we have to go sort of fill out here in our app and so as I mentioned

189
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:16,540
before if we go back here to the store listing this is where the real meat and potatoes of the Google

190
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:20,500
Play Store is one of the big things that you'll need is screenshots.

191
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,550
You don't necessarily need them but I think it makes your app that much better.

192
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:27,840
Well in fact I'm reading the texture at least two screenshots are required.

193
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:32,050
I know before maybe they weren't but it looks like now you need at least two.

194
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:37,030
So I'm going to show you how you can go ahead and get these in case you're not sure how to do that so

195
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:43,180
we're gonna go back to Android Studio and under build variance we're gonna switch this back to debug

196
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:47,240
so that we can run the app on one of our simulators.

197
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:54,280
So we'll go ahead and help my devices weren't showing up for a second I was wondering what was going

198
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,140
on there.

199
00:12:55,270 --> 00:13:00,400
But basically you're going to run your device and I'm going to show you how you can very quickly take

200
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,090
some screenshots from it.

201
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:07,900
It basically consists of hitting this little camera button here and what that does is it takes a screenshot

202
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:15,580
and then you can upload that full rez image to the Google Play Store here which is pretty great.

203
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:16,380
OK.

204
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,500
So that's one thing that you're going to want to set.

205
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:22,840
Really the less the rest of these options you just want to go through like the content rating going

206
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:28,720
to tell you you know what kind of stuff is going to be inside of your game game your app whatever it

207
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,490
is that you're making pricing and distribution.

208
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,120
Do you want this to be a free app.

209
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:37,870
If you do want to do a paid app you have to create a merchant account with Google and get that all set

210
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:37,990
up.

211
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:40,230
But it's not too much trouble.

212
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:45,310
You can set where you want this app to be available there's just all sorts of good details here is your

213
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:46,870
app going to contain ads.

214
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,140
Is it primarily directed at children.

215
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:53,020
Does it can intrude include Google Android Wear stuff.

216
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,990
There's just so many things that you've got here.

217
00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:00,610
Also in app purchases you know if your app contains that then you know you can go ahead and get that

218
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,990
all set up here.

219
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,810
All sorts of information.

220
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:09,580
But I'm going to leave that up to you because this is gonna be so specific for whatever app it is that

221
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,680
you're uploading to the store here.

222
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:15,640
It's really just direct to you about how you're going to go ahead and work with that.

223
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:20,500
So let me go ahead and show you here on the emulator.

224
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,140
Looks like the app opened up here.

225
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:28,810
So if we go ahead and we hit this little camera button that's going to save a screenshot and I believe

226
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:31,790
it saves that to our desktop.

227
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,950
No it doesn't.

228
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:38,170
So let's see if we can do that one more time and find where it is.

229
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:42,020
Oh there it had taken a screenshot it was just taking a while to show up.

230
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,090
So there it is we've got the screenshot it's showing up on the desktop.

231
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:52,240
We could then take this and go back under store listing and upload this as one of our screenshots.

232
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,640
So there you have it.

233
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:57,470
I'd love to see whatever app it is that you've created.

234
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,560
Please feel free to share it with Robyn I.

235
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,080
On Twitter we'd love to see what your app looks like.

236
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:07,870
My twitter handle is at Nick Chuck Walter and Rob is at Tech Rob.

237
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:10,320
So please let us know how the app goes.

238
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:12,580
And we can't wait to see what you've created.
