00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.790
All right here we are at the last lecture of the section we're ready to make it so that we can now see

2
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.180
everyone else's tweets when we log into the app.

3
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:15.900
So what we're going to do is first we need to make a new activity where we can view all of these tweets.

4
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:23.100
So we're going to go to new file new activity and let's go ahead and go to the gallery here.

5
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.360
We want an empty activity and let's go ahead and call this our feed activity.

6
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:36.300
So go ahead and create this now for what's going to go inside of the feed activity visually.

7
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.390
It's going to be another list view where we can simply list out everything that the current user or

8
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.850
all the people that the current users following have tweeted.

9
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:54.690
So with that we're going to go ahead and move over to oh not the activity feed we need the feed activity

10
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.340
lay out.

11
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.770
So let's go ahead to our layouts.

12
00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.670
So like we might have to wait a second here and Oh there's our activity feed.

13
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.970
I was already on it.

14
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:07.370
All right.

15
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.510
So let's give ourselves some space to work with.

16
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.370
Let's go to our containers and we'll bring down a list for you.

17
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.850
And we want that to be able to fill up the whole screen and we'll select this list for you.

18
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:25.580
Give a proper ID of list view and something that's going to be a little bit interesting with this is

19
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.360
going to be the first time that we're going to use one of these sub items so we haven't done that yet.

20
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.240
I'm going to show you how to do that.

21
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.280
It's pretty cool that we'll be able to take advantage of that.

22
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:42.470
So with that in place let's go ahead and move over to this new feed activity and let's start setting

23
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:43.360
things up.

24
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:50.000
So first we need to get access to that list view sole See List View and go ahead and give it the name

25
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.380
of lowercase list view as equal to find view by id our ID dot list view.

26
00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.510
OK so now that we've gone ahead and grab that we need to talk about how we're going to display these

27
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:08.270
tweets because when you think about a tweet it has both the actual tweet text but then also has who

28
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.490
sent that tweet.

29
00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.050
And so I think the best way to represent this is using a map.

30
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.270
Remember we have covered maps before and basically it's a way to hold two pieces of information you

31
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.290
can have a key and a value.

32
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:25.940
So we're going to have maps that have a string for the key and they're also going to have a string for

33
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:26.750
the value.

34
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.430
And so in order it's going to be a list of maps.

35
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:39.170
And so what we're looking to create here is we're going to make a list of map objects where we have

36
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.690
strings for the keys and strings for the values.

37
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.680
I know a little complex get in here and let me go ahead and do the autocomplete on our map.

38
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.040
And I guess we should do that for list as well.

39
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.060
There we go.

40
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:59.900
But we're going to have this world call something like tweet data and we're going to set this equal

41
00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:06.830
to make sure I get my extra either and we're going to set this equal to a new array list for the time

42
00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:07.760
being.

43
00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.210
So I want to go through and show you how to manually create your own list.

44
00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.510
Let's go ahead and do that before we start working with.

45
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.200
I just want you to really understand this concept sort of go and make some dummy data let's make a for

46
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:29.990
loop the loop through like five times and so let's go ahead and make an event that we will set.

47
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:39.500
I will set equal to one and all say as long as the eye is less than or equal to five then we are going

48
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.080
to do I plus plus just like that.

49
00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.750
Then inside of this for loop we want to be able to create a new map.

50
00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.420
So we're going to make a new map here.

51
00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.500
Strings is the keys and strings as the value.

52
00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:00.020
And we're going to go ahead and give this the name of tweet info and we'll say tweet info is equal to

53
00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.310
a new capital hash map.

54
00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.990
Go ahead hit enter on that.

55
00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.060
And inside of this hash map we just want it to be an empty one.

56
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.860
But then with Thweatt info this is where will start adding some information.

57
00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:20.500
So we're going to say tweet info dot put so we can put in some information so we have to provide a key.

58
00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:27.650
In this case we'll say content so say content comma and let's pass and some content here and then we're

59
00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:35.670
going to go ahead and add something like tweet content and we'll go ahead and add on onto that.

60
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.880
So there's some sort of number and we're going to have to convert that to a string so will say integer

61
00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:50.460
into your dot to a string and then we can go ahead and pass I right inside of there k.

62
00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.880
So this will go ahead and put in the content part of the tweet.

63
00:04:54.890 --> 00:05:01.250
We also need a user name so we're going to copy the same line of code to paste it down but rather than

64
00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.310
content.

65
00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:08.720
This is going to be user name and rather than tweak content we are going to say user space and then

66
00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:15.230
have the user it's going to be like User 1 user 2 and that's going to say tweak content tweak content.

67
00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.940
Right.

68
00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.830
So with that in place after we have successfully created this map fill that up with information we want

69
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.290
to add it to the list.

70
00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:31.170
So we're going to say tweet data which is our last dot ad and we're going to add in tweet info.

71
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.890
OK.

72
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.860
So that will successfully add that in there.

73
00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:40.580
Then once we've done this we want to go ahead and set up our array adapter so we're going to be using

74
00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.370
a different kind of adapter this time it's going to be called a simple adapter.

75
00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:52.430
So we have simple adapter that we'll just call simple adapter and this will be equal to a new Capitol

76
00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.550
simple adapter.

77
00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:57.610
So we want to pass in this context.

78
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.320
We want to pass in tweet data as you know the array that we're looking for here.

79
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:07.600
And then there's some more complex things that we want to add here so the first one is the layout.

80
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:14.340
We usually do Android are lay out a lot and we do simple list item one.

81
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.190
Well in this case we want to do a simple list item too.

82
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:25.250
This is kind of a new development for us list item 2 allows us to utilize both of the pieces of information

83
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:26.010
to have.

84
00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.850
If we go back to the activity feed here the top item and then a sub item.

85
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.950
So that's why we're using simple list item too.

86
00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:38.960
Along with that we need to say how we want to fill in the two pieces of information.

87
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.820
So what we're going to do is we're going to create a new string array.

88
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:49.710
So when I a new string array and will just do curly brackets to make one here on the fly.

89
00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:55.840
And we're going to say the keys that we need to look for inside of the dictionary are content.

90
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.310
Right.

91
00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.610
That's the one that we had created right here.

92
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:02.450
And also it's going to be user name.

93
00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:04.850
So those are the two that they should be looking for.

94
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:06.720
Let me make sure that's lower case.

95
00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:07.420
All right.

96
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.360
So that's one array that we need to pass in.

97
00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:16.730
We need to pass in yet another array to say where should we be filling in the information with what

98
00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:19.120
we get back for content and user name.

99
00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:25.280
So in this situation we want to make a new int array and we'll do our curly brackets again.

100
00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:37.430
But in this situation we're going to do lower lowercase Android dot capital are dot ID dot and this

101
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:39.920
is where we want to say Text 1.

102
00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:51.200
So this is that top text position and then we also want to pass an android dot capital dot ID text to.

103
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:53.890
So that's going to go to that sub text position.

104
00:07:53.950 --> 00:08:03.760
OK so I know this is a really really big long sort of method that we have over here or creation.

105
00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:10.170
But this is what we need in order to create this new simple adapter.

106
00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:13.490
And we have this error here that says unreachable statement.

107
00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:15.130
And if you're wondering what this is about.

108
00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:20.630
I accidentally said while one is less than or equal to 5 and one is always going to be less than or

109
00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:21.390
equal to five.

110
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:27.530
So if we can go ahead and change that to I then this statement is going to be reachable otherwise it

111
00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:31.010
would have just stayed in the loop forever and ever and ever.

112
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:35.900
Now since we have this simple adapter we can go ahead and add this to our list view.

113
00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:43.370
So we're going to say List View set adapter and we're just going to go ahead and pass in that simple

114
00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:44.300
adapter.

115
00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:45.050
OK.

116
00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:48.900
So let's go ahead and have a take a look at what this looks like.

117
00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:54.610
Now in order to do that to reach this activity we're going to go and have to edit our menu.

118
00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:59.390
So let's go down to our tweet menu and we'll go to the text view of this.

119
00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:01.900
We want to add another item.

120
00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.360
I'm going to put it in between a tweet and log out.

121
00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:12.770
And this is going to say your feed because we want to see the feed that's coming out there and we can

122
00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:18.490
go ahead and call this something like view the feed for the ID.

123
00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:21.390
Yeah let's keep that capital I think that's a good idea.

124
00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:22.500
OK.

125
00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:29.660
So with that in place the next thing that we need to do is just make sure that when someone taps on

126
00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:31.930
that it takes them to the correct activity.

127
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:35.150
So we'll go to our feed activity here.

128
00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:38.860
I think we actually want that user's activity.

129
00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:44.170
We need to go up to our on item selected so that's when someone wants to tweet.

130
00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:51.720
This is when someone wants to log out now and do an ELSE IF statement to see if someone is trying to

131
00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.650
look at the feed.

132
00:09:52.860 --> 00:10:06.670
So I will say item get item Id see if this is equal to our DOT I.D. dot and then we want you feed.

133
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:12.210
So that's not coming through right now but I am guessing if we go ahead and run this that's going to

134
00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:13.800
show up in just a second here.

135
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:18.690
So while that's running what we need to do is very similar to what we have here.

136
00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:24.240
We basically want to make him intent and start that intent although the place that we're trying to get

137
00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:28.580
to is not the main activity but the feed activity.

138
00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:32.020
So go ahead and put that in feed at the D.

139
00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:33.330
There we go.

140
00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:36.210
Got the nice autocomplete and look that you feed.

141
00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:38.410
Finally finished up there for us.

142
00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:42.730
So let's go ahead and run this and see what this looks like.

143
00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:48.030
We'll have to go ahead and pull up the emulator here.

144
00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:57.020
So again right now we're just looking at sort of some dummy data that we made with this for loop but

145
00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:01.010
eventually we're going to have it fill in actual information from parts.

146
00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:03.880
So we'll go ahead and make this a little bit bigger.

147
00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:04.280
OK.

148
00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:05.250
Here it comes.

149
00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:09.300
And let's go to your feed and look at that.

150
00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.580
We have all the tweets there so tweet content for one two three four five.

151
00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:13.700
And again users.

152
00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:15.320
One two three four five.

153
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:20.000
So I hope you enjoyed learning about how to do the little simple adapter and how to make it so that

154
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.580
you could you know work with maps inside of an array list.

155
00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:29.440
We did some pretty cool stuff there but now we need to go ahead and actually show some real tweets in

156
00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:33.920
before we show some real tweets we have to have some tweets in order to show off to people.

157
00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:39.410
So let's go back to our parsed dashboard let's remind ourselves of what users we have so Nick Feydeau

158
00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:40.250
John Sara.

159
00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:42.220
Let's have a tweet for each of them.

160
00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.800
So I'm going to make a new tweet.

161
00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:50.570
This one is going to be for John.

162
00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:55.130
That's going to say hey what's up.

163
00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:59.850
And there's one I don't know why I don't have that.

164
00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:04.500
Hey what's up.

165
00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:05.990
There we go.

166
00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:10.460
Another user was Fido So let's add one for Fido.

167
00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:14.800
It'll say something like I am a dog.

168
00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:20.210
Exclamation point and the username for this will be Fido.

169
00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:22.210
Excellent.

170
00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:25.390
And the last one here is Sarah.

171
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:28.690
So let's have a tweet for Sarah.

172
00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:36.360
She'll say coding rocks with an X and username name there will be Sarah.

173
00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:41.920
OK so now there's some actual tweets that we could show we got to make sure that this is lower case.

174
00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:43.320
Sarah there.

175
00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:51.400
Go ahead and it keeps trying to uppercase that we go lowercase lowercase J.

176
00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:52.760
Here.

177
00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:53.570
Awesome.

178
00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:57.920
So now there's some tweets that we could actually end up showing to the user.

179
00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:04.850
So we're going to go ahead and move to Android studio and here inside of the feed activity where right

180
00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:09.490
now we're setting all this code in order to you know make some fake data.

181
00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:11.350
Well let's go get some real data.

182
00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:17.510
So we're going to make a new parse query and we are going to be looking for just straight up parse objects

183
00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:20.280
this time we don't need parce users.

184
00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:26.960
Remember we're trying to get a bunch of tweets so call this our queery will say this is equal to capital

185
00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:30.860
parse query does it get queery.

186
00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:36.950
And we want to pass in here that we are looking for a tweet object so capital tweet and this coincides

187
00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:39.540
with this class that we have right here.

188
00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:42.390
So we'll go ahead and put that in.

189
00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:46.580
Now that we have this query there is some a few parameters that we want to add to it.

190
00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:52.670
So the first one is with this query we want to make sure that it's everyone that we're following.

191
00:13:52.700 --> 00:14:00.700
So we're going to say Dot where contains in software contained in.

192
00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:06.710
And this is where we're going to say wherever the user name is contained and then we're going to pass

193
00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:11.570
the list that we have of all the users that the current users following.

194
00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:22.260
So we're going to say parse user dot get current user dog get list and we'll pass in the is following.

195
00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:29.090
So go ahead and add that at our semi-colon there so that says hey whoever this person is following we

196
00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:35.780
want to get all those user names then we want to put these in a particular order.

197
00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:43.980
So we're going to say queery and we want to do a dot order by and let's go ahead do order by descending.

198
00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:50.540
And we want to pass in the key created at sure remember this is one of those special fields that is

199
00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:52.400
just automatically created for us.

200
00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:57.970
But it tells us exactly when these tweets were tweets were created so we can get the latest ones the

201
00:14:58.010 --> 00:14:58.760
earliest.

202
00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:08.000
So with that in place let's go back to android studio say created at and do or a semi-colon after that.

203
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.990
There could be a lot of tweets so we want to be careful that we don't get too many.

204
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:17.060
So we're going to say set limit to those latest 20 tweets.

205
00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:21.590
And with all of that in place we're ready to actually go ahead and execute this query.

206
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:30.230
So we're going to say queery find in background with this we want to do a new find callback.

207
00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:33.410
So this will come back and give us some information.

208
00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:42.170
We'll go ahead and do the classic objective where we say OK if EU is equal to no then you know we're

209
00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:43.740
ready to rock and roll.

210
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:49.630
And then we've got to start doing some work here to then see what is it that we're going to do.

211
00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:54.030
So essentially what we want to do is the same stuff that we're doing inside of the for loop.

212
00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:59.280
We just want to do it inside of here and we need to do it for each and every tweet that we get.

213
00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:02.660
So first thing is we're going to list through these parse objects.

214
00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:09.840
Let's do a for loop and we're trying to loop through all those objects and each time we loop through

215
00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:15.180
we're going to get back a partas object that I'm going to call a tweet.

216
00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:23.310
So each time we have a tweet that's when we're going to want to go ahead and then you know make like

217
00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:24.270
a map and all this stuff.

218
00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:29.100
I'm actually just going to cut and paste this right down below I can get rid of this for a loop now

219
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.200
and from there we're going to just start filling in the information.

220
00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:40.260
So for the tweak content rather than saying tweak content and adding an integer into there we're actually

221
00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:46.230
just going to say OK we're going to use the tweet and then we want to get a string from that.

222
00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:53.040
So the key that we're going to provide inside of there is going to be tweaked and similarly down below

223
00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:54.290
for the user name.

224
00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:57.410
We can get that from the tweet as well and I'm going to say tweet.

225
00:16:57.510 --> 00:16:58.890
Get string.

226
00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:01.770
We want to go grab that username.

227
00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:07.050
All right so once we have that information in place we still want to add this to tweet data.

228
00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:12.600
But in order for that to work we're going to have to make this a final so that we can have access to

229
00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:13.350
it.

230
00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:18.810
And with that that's going to give us access to the things we need and we still down below here.

231
00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:23.550
You know we've got our simple adapter right and we're going to update the list view all those things

232
00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:27.480
we've got to make sure that these happen into the correct places.

233
00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:35.600
And so what we want to do after we've made it through this entire four loop here is set up the following.

234
00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:39.290
So I'm going to go ahead and cut and paste this down below.

235
00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:42.360
So this is going to get everything set up for us.

236
00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:50.680
We're going to have to change this to say feed activity this can for the last few here.

237
00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:55.230
Again we're going to have to make this a final so that we can have access to it.

238
00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:57.580
So go ahead and change that.

239
00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:04.120
And one more change that we'd like to make is just up at the top of this on Create.

240
00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:05.730
Let's go ahead and set the title.

241
00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:12.960
So it looks good just like all the other activities so we'll put inside of your capital your feed.

242
00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:14.340
All right.

243
00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:20.120
So with this all in place let's go ahead and run this and see what it looks like on the device.

244
00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:26.850
It was a big moment for us you know this should hypothetically be a complete Twitter app so we'll have

245
00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:28.660
to see what we get

246
00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:38.090
up opens up and I'm going to go check out your feed when we go there.

247
00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:38.630
Look at that.

248
00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.110
So we have I am a dog we have.

249
00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:42.110
Hey what's up.

250
00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:47.480
So we are missing one of the tweets which is kind of interesting and I think it says that we're missing.

251
00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:49.360
So let's go ahead and see.

252
00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:51.730
But that's because we're not following Sarah.

253
00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:53.310
That's the reason that's not showing up.

254
00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:53.910
OK.

255
00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:58.330
So this is just real proof that we know that that is working.

256
00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:03.300
So if we wanted to go and test and see if this is really you know 100 percent here let's go ahead and

257
00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:06.270
follow Sarah now that we're following Sarah.

258
00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:08.930
Let's go to your feed and look at that.

259
00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:10.930
Now we get Sarah's tweet.

260
00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:12.390
Wow this is impressive.

261
00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:16.500
I mean I know that that's what's supposed to happen but when you see it actually happen you're just

262
00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:19.060
kind of oh ok wow this is great.

263
00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:23.480
So thank you so much for coming along building this whole Twitter client.

264
00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:27.900
Hopefully you'll feel much better now about working with Parsky after going through for your second

265
00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:29.270
time now.

266
00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:34.050
And if you wanted to make your own social network I think you'd really have the chops to get into it

267
00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:34.480
now.

268
00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:36.150
So thanks for coming along.

269
00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:37.360
But we still got more to do.
