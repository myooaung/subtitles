00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:05.470
Hello and welcome to this lecture we're we're going to be creating a time table.

2
00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:11.020
So the idea is you have a child or you yourself you're trying to learn the times tables you can have

3
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.760
this awesome app where you say you know I want to know the times table for five and it lists out all

4
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:17.300
the time tables.

5
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.050
You move down to like you know to for example and it's showing two 4 6 8.

6
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.670
And if you're not familiar with times tables it's you know what is two times one two times two two times

7
00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.170
three two times four.

8
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.900
And if you do in the times table for five it's what's five times one five times to five times three

9
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.990
five times four or five times five.

10
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.580
And so we use the seek bar slider and we can kind of you know move around in whatever number it is.

11
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.860
I think we should have a minimum of one and go up to a max of 20.

12
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.360
You can decide what your parameters are going to be but if you think about it you know everything that

13
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.490
you need in order to make this happen you know about CGC bars you know about list views you can put

14
00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:58.420
this all together.

15
00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.550
So your challenge is for this lecture to go and make this app on your own.

16
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.240
So I'm going to ask you to pause in a second here and go ahead and do this and please give this a real

17
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.630
effort.

18
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.990
I know it's very tempting to just go ahead and you know hit play.

19
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.490
I'll I'll just walk through this with how Nick does it no you know how to do both these things.

20
00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.620
I want you to give this a real try because as I've said before this is where the real learning takes

21
00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:21.150
place.

22
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.760
So go ahead hit pause make this app and then come back.

23
00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.190
I'll show you how I did it.

24
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.110
Maybe you'll find some differences between the way that we did things or maybe you'll just get absolutely

25
00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.250
lost and after you spend a good chunk of time trying to figure it out you can say OK I'm just going

26
00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:37.560
to go ahead and watch how Nick did it.

27
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.530
Please give this the old college try and go ahead.

28
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.250
Hit pause now.

29
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.520
All right so let's go ahead and get started here by creating a new project and I'm going to go ahead

30
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.270
and call mine.

31
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:55.680
Times tables think that adequately describes what it is we're trying to create here.

32
00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.690
Let's go ahead and do that classic empty activity and we'll finish Android studio is off to do all its

33
00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:08.170
magic creating this new project for so really what we're doing here is we're combining the stuff that

34
00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.310
we learned with the Sikh bar and the recent stuff with the list view we're bringing it all together

35
00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.050
for this nice mishmash So I hope you enjoyed the challenge here.

36
00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.350
And of course I want to walk you through how I did it maybe see any differences you saw between the

37
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.700
two of us in case you just really really got stuck on something.

38
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.380
But with that let's go ahead and dive into the sort of first thing that we got to work on is the visual

39
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.740
side of things right we want to get our seek bar up top and then we also want to have a list view below

40
00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:36.060
that.

41
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.320
So let's go ahead and get rid of that text view that we always get by default and we are going to bring

42
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:47.380
down a Sikh bar and luckily it's just nice here up at the top for some is going to click drag this out

43
00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.140
and we've got to work on our constraints here so we're going to go ahead and up to the top and say hey

44
00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.350
maybe you should be Lou.

45
00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.520
I don't know five from the top.

46
00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.350
That might be a good number just sort of all around because I got to hit enter on there.

47
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.340
There we go.

48
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.990
So maybe you know five from the top five from the left.

49
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.650
This is all looking good.

50
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:09.280
OK.

51
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.990
So we've got that information now it doesn't by default stretch all the way to the side.

52
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.280
Let me go and give us some space here so this will zoom in a little bit more so we can go ahead and

53
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.090
change these options and this is what we want so that we can get it to go all the way to the edges.

54
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.610
Right so we can see that.

55
00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:31.480
And so the seeker looks pretty good the next thing that we want to work now is the table so we're going

56
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.330
to go to our containers.

57
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.430
There's our list fields just go ahead and drag that out.

58
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.620
And for this one almost by default you can always hit those plus buttons.

59
00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.100
Right now it's got about an 8 border on all of it if you want to change that.

60
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.960
You totally can.

61
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.100
But that's up to you.

62
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.860
So with that let's go ahead with the Sikh bar and give them an ID.

63
00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:59.700
So rather than just seek bar I'm going to call it times tables capital seek bar.

64
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:06.430
There we go it's usually good with IDs to have this camel case style of typing right where each time

65
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.840
we have a new word we capitalize the first letter.

66
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.920
I just want to make sure I'm aware of what we're doing when I do that so let's go ahead and update that.

67
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.530
OK.

68
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:25.660
On this list view we want to call this our times tables list view.

69
00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.940
Excellent.

70
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.840
OK.

71
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.800
So we got ideas for both of these.

72
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.850
Now we can move back to our code here and actually start working on everything.

73
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.290
So first let's get access to that Sikh bar.

74
00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:43.720
So we're going to say Sikh bar space and let's go ahead and give this a name I think we should just

75
00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.270
stick with what we have the time.

76
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.310
Times tables seek par excellence.

77
00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:58.120
So we're going to say this thing should be equal to animal use or a classic fine view by id capital

78
00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.870
are id times table.

79
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.250
And look at that times tables seek bar.

80
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:15.150
All right so now that we've got the Sikh bar Oh and we've got to make sure that this is properly imported.

81
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.000
Come on I need you to give me the little pop up so I can import you.

82
00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:25.510
Well we'll see as we keep going if this gets all that good that commenters should get rid of that are

83
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:26.380
saying should.

84
00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:27.990
No no.

85
00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:29.980
There we go there is our little light bulb.

86
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.800
OK.

87
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:35.750
So I'm not sure let's try this one more time.

88
00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.940
Capital C bar.

89
00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.590
We want the one here from Android widget.

90
00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:43.130
We hit enter.

91
00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.720
OK.

92
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.420
I guess maybe I just had typed out seek bar without hitting enter.

93
00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.080
When you do that auto complete.

94
00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:54.140
And you see that Android studio will automatically import the stuff that you need up top there.

95
00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:58.270
So sometimes it can be a little bit tricky but you've got to make sure you get that.

96
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.110
Next we're going to go on to the list view and I'm going to go ahead and just call this.

97
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.810
You guessed it times tables list view.

98
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:15.860
And again we'll use our find view by Idea Capitol our I.D. times table list view.

99
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:21.830
All right now we have access to both the things from our SML here in our Java code.

100
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.120
That's great.

101
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.170
So the next step for us is we just want to start setting up the CGC bar right.

102
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:31.250
There's a few different options that we want to have with the Sikh bar.

103
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.240
So first we have to give the Sikh bar a max.

104
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:39.980
So first thing I'm going to type out the times table seek bar and I'm going to say you know what I want

105
00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:46.180
to set the max that this thing could possibly be and I want that to be 20.

106
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.240
Other thing that we should probably set here is a starting point.

107
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:56.580
So we're going to take our seat bar and we're going to say set progress progress is sort of where the

108
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:58.440
Sikh bar currently is.

109
00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.220
So I say let's just go ahead and start this thing out at 10.

110
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:05.550
That kind of seems like a reasonable position to be in.

111
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:12.290
So once we have that in place we need to write some code so that whenever the user is changing that

112
00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:18.080
seat bar right moving things left to right that we can you know say OK now the times tables are going

113
00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.820
to be for the ones the twos or threes the fours whatever it is.

114
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:24.310
So we need some listeners here.

115
00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:33.230
So we're going to take our times table seek bar and then we're going to do a set on Sikh bar change

116
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:34.960
listener day.

117
00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.980
So check this out when we say noon.

118
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:44.030
And we want a new Capitol Sikh barred up on Sikh bar changelessness.

119
00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:46.220
This is going to be awesome when we hit enter here.

120
00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:49.780
Boom we get all this crazy information.

121
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:56.360
So the on progress change this is whenever the user changes to a new location it's going to tell us

122
00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.850
what position that's currently at.

123
00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:03.620
And then also you can get information about when it's starting when it's stopping we're not going to

124
00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:04.370
use these two.

125
00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:08.460
We really only care about when it's actually changed.

126
00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:11.870
But Gneisenau those two options are there for us.

127
00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:12.630
OK.

128
00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:18.680
So the first thing that we want to do is set some sort of minimum like this because we don't want to

129
00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:24.020
have a time table for zero right ZERO times one times two times so whatever it is is going to be easier.

130
00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.510
So we kind of want one to be our minimum.

131
00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:30.620
So what we're going to do is we're going to create an event that we're going to call in and we're going

132
00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:33.230
to sell it to what our minimum should be in this case one.

133
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:39.080
Now the reason we've created a variable here called men rather than just you know doing saying hey if

134
00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.760
it's less than one is I want the option to be able to change what the minimum amount is.

135
00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:48.710
You know maybe at some point in the future we want the minimum to be 5 10 to whatever it is it's just

136
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:51.140
always good in code to give names to variables.

137
00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:56.240
I've heard it referred to as magic numbers you shouldn't have any magic numbers in your code where you're

138
00:08:56.530 --> 00:09:01.800
you know doing computations and you know you just say oh OK as long as this thing is less than one and

139
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:06.080
say well why is it less than one it's better to say is this thing less than the minimum.

140
00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:07.820
And then you can update the minimum.

141
00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:11.730
So anyway a small little tip there.

142
00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:16.760
So the thing that we want to do is we want to do a little if statement with this minimum and say OK

143
00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:24.200
we want to check and see if what the progress is this little is that they pass over here if this thing

144
00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:29.540
which is called II is less than the minimum that we have set up.

145
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:33.560
We'll go ahead and do our curly brackets here.

146
00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:41.000
So if it's less than the minimum what we want to do is we want to update and say OK the times table

147
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.460
position that we're going to be working with is going to be equal to whatever the minimum is.

148
00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:52.820
So this is you know for example if they have scrolled down to zero then we want to say okay and I guess

149
00:09:52.820 --> 00:10:01.300
before this we need to make a new int called times table number OK.

150
00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:05.100
We're not going to set this equal to anything for right now we'll just have it set up.

151
00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:09.950
But what we're going to do here is we're going to say our times table number is going to be equal to

152
00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:10.430
minimum.

153
00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:16.730
So this basically saves us from OK if you know they have slide the slider all the way down to zero.

154
00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:21.350
Or if you know we update this minimum to be higher if it's below the minimum we want it to at least

155
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:26.060
be the minimum that we're going to put an else statement on here and say okay well as long as it's not

156
00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:27.860
lower than the minimum.

157
00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:29.120
It's very simple.

158
00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:38.460
We just want the times table number to be equal do whatever I is equal to because I is whatever wherever

159
00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:44.100
that seek bar currently is maybe it's one two three four five all the way up to our Max which in this

160
00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:51.960
case is 20 k so now that you've got that in place and the next thing that we want to do here is just

161
00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.760
see if this is even working.

162
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:58.200
And so we're going to log out some information to see if we can get this to work so we're going to say

163
00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:07.700
log in and we'll go ahead print out a few things so we're going to first say this is where the Sikh

164
00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.780
bar value is at.

165
00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:16.140
And then we are going to go ahead and get whatever this time table number is in print that out.

166
00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:22.940
So we're going to say integer to her.

167
00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.130
There we go.

168
00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:27.230
Got to string.

169
00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:32.400
We want to convert this puppy and then we're going to pass in the times table number.

170
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:36.340
So this way we can take what's ever inside of our times table number.

171
00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:41.230
Print that out and let's go ahead and run this on our emulator.

172
00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:54.660
OK go ahead and run that way for this guy to pop up it's always good to have the emulator sort of up

173
00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:58.860
and running in the background that feel a little bit foolish now because I was going to say it loads

174
00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:05.190
so quickly when you have the emulator up and running already but you are waiting for this it looks like

175
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:10.890
maybe it's doing a great or great old bill that's taking a little bit of time I guess as we're waiting

176
00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:13.920
for this something that I would want to point out.

177
00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:17.970
And just as I'm about to move into something it starts rolling up.

178
00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:18.440
OK.

179
00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:26.000
So here we go let's get log cat up so that we can see if our log shows so let's get our emulator here

180
00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:30.320
and I'm going to move the bar and look at that down the bottom.

181
00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:34.170
It's showing you know 987 all that good stuff.

182
00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:35.160
This is good.

183
00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:39.930
And let's go ahead and try to you know bring this thing down to zero and look at that and never display

184
00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:40.380
zero.

185
00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:45.690
Now something that we do have an issue with is that if we go all the way to the left it's actually at

186
00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:52.200
the zero position but it's still you know the times table number is still equal to 1 but we don't really

187
00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.190
want that there.

188
00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:57.960
So something that we can do is here in this if statement if we found that they've gone past the minimum

189
00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:04.830
we can go ahead and say all right you know what we want to update the CGC bar to you know move the bar

190
00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:11.370
to the actual minimum when we can do that by simply typing out times tables seek bar dot and what we're

191
00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:16.660
going to do is set progress just like we did up here where we set the progress to 10 initially.

192
00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:21.600
In this case we're going to set it to the minimum to say hey you know if someone's moving this thing

193
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:27.660
along you know pass there we want to make sure it gets back to the one position.

194
00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:31.790
So let's go ahead and see what this looks like on the actual device.

195
00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:34.220
And now if we go ahead and move that all the way.

196
00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.500
Look at that it won't even let us get down to that position.

197
00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:42.630
So this is exactly what we're looking for and we can check log kept look at that we're getting all the

198
00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:45.250
right values to show up there.

199
00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:45.900
OK.

200
00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:47.490
So that's looking really good.

201
00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:50.680
We can move the CGC bar we get the information that we need.

202
00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:58.320
The next thing that we need to do is we need to be able to now move forward and write some code.

203
00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:04.250
Whenever somebody is going to you know we need to actually fill out that list right.

204
00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:07.230
That's sort of our next step on things.

205
00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:15.360
So what we're going to do is after we've done this we need to go ahead and type out here.

206
00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:25.270
We need to make our array list first so we're going to say array list where we go and we want this to

207
00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:31.820
be an array list of strings that makes it really easy to work with the list view.

208
00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:36.630
And we're going to call this times table content.

209
00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:38.760
Excellent.

210
00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:48.360
And we're going to go ahead and say this is equal to a new array list of type string.

211
00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:53.560
OK so we've got them place this is what we want to create isn't a list of strings that hold the proper

212
00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:59.400
times table and then we need to fill that out for him with information that's a little bit tough here

213
00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:04.780
because you know we want to it's always going to be different if it's the times tables or one it's just

214
00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:10.180
one two three four five six seven eight nine you know up to I don't know you we can choose how far it

215
00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:17.760
is that we want to go but the next time we're going to be 2 4 6 8 and then 3 9 3 6 9 12.

216
00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:21.300
I should stop trying to do this and let the computer do the math for me.

217
00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:26.670
But the best way to handle this is a for loop so a for loop can just automatically go through and check

218
00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:31.060
and say OK well if you know the times table number is this then we're going to go ahead and do this

219
00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:31.720
type of thing.

220
00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:36.370
So what we're going to do is we're going to say four and let's set up our for loop here.

221
00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:39.690
So the first thing is we're going to make a little int.

222
00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:44.050
Now it's a little bit tough here because we're already using the int i hear.

223
00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:47.510
So let's go ahead and use a different variable I'm going to call it in J.

224
00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:53.080
So we're going to let I ere in J be equal to 1.

225
00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:59.380
All right then we're going to go ahead and say if J is less than or equal to.

226
00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:05.440
And this is we can decide how big we want our times table to go maybe we'll just say 10 for now and

227
00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:10.930
then we're going to say you know each time we go through this we want to increase J by 1 to our curly

228
00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:12.720
bracket with that for loop.

229
00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:18.150
And then what we're going to do is we want to add now to this times table content array.

230
00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:21.830
So let's go ahead and get that times table content.

231
00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:27.800
And once we have that there we're going to say Dot add on this.

232
00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:30.010
We have to add a string here.

233
00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:36.370
So really what we want to add in the end we're hoping to take whatever the current number is here.

234
00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:36.780
So what.

235
00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:38.050
So we're going to take J.

236
00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:42.450
And we want to multiply J times whatever the times table number is.

237
00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:44.400
Let's go ahead and type that out.

238
00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:48.960
So for example if J is 1 and they want to know the times table for five.

239
00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:51.920
So is equal to 1 1 times 5 is 5.

240
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:55.150
The next time this for loop goes through J will be equal to 2.

241
00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:56.620
So two times five is ten.

242
00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:58.270
You kind of see how that loops through.

243
00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:02.260
But we have a problem here because this is not a string.

244
00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:03.130
This is an integer.

245
00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:08.350
So again we need to do that cool little conversion step where we say all right we're going to take integer

246
00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:16.780
to string and let's go ahead and put this inside of the parentheses just like that and we'll put our

247
00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:18.330
cool little semi-colon.

248
00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:23.930
And now this for loop will go ahead and add the proper times tables there.

249
00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:26.600
So I mean we're getting to the homestretch here.

250
00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:28.840
We have the array list.

251
00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:31.370
We have the for loop that fills it up.

252
00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:35.580
The next thing that we need to do is make our array adapter so let's go ahead.

253
00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:37.980
We're going to make an array adapter.

254
00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:40.580
We want this to be of type string.

255
00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:41.670
OK.

256
00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:44.650
And I'm just going to call this classic old array adapter.

257
00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:48.450
This will be equal to a new array adapter.

258
00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:53.500
And this is where we're going to start filling out all of these parameters so we want this for the context

259
00:17:54.100 --> 00:18:06.490
and then we're going to pass lower case Android dot Capitol are lay out a simple list item one.

260
00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:08.870
And then we want to pass in our arrays.

261
00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:14.380
We're going to go ahead and pass and times table content and we'll do our semi-colon.

262
00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:15.290
OK.

263
00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:22.630
Now that we have the array adapter in place we are going to take our times table list view and say All

264
00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:30.890
right we are going to set your adapter and let's pass in our array adapter that we just created.

265
00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:33.310
Can we have written a lot of code.

266
00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:35.960
We should probably test and make sure this thing works.

267
00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:42.010
It's one of my big tips for programming never go too long without actually updating your code and making

268
00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:43.590
sure that everything's working here.

269
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:47.990
And oh we are having a bit of an issue here.

270
00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:50.620
Let's see what is not happy about.

271
00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:53.800
So Android done our way out

272
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:58.990
them it's all right.

273
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.660
Let me go ahead and pause and see what it's not so happy about.

274
00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:09.200
So I found out what the issue was and it's that when we refer to this I forgot that this is going to

275
00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:16.340
be referring to this see bar because we're currently in this you know change listener inside of there

276
00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:22.000
so this is referring to the Sikh bar when we actually wanted to refer to our activity here.

277
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:28.070
So I think the proper way to fix this and we're going to have to do this anyways because you know we

278
00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:28.900
need to.

279
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:34.220
Well I was going to show you how you know when we first run the app and whenever we change the seeker

280
00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:35.500
we want this code to run.

281
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:40.280
And so it's a good idea to put this code inside of its own function.

282
00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:47.240
So what we're going to do is up here at the top we're going to go ahead and create our very own function.

283
00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:53.040
So we're going to a public void or method you could also refer to it as a method.

284
00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:58.400
I kind of go back and forth on that because I know technically it's a method but for me it's kind of

285
00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:02.900
like well you know anytime you're in an activity you just sort of feels like you're making your own

286
00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:03.440
function.

287
00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:07.050
But anyway that's beyond the point of what we're trying to do here.

288
00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:13.290
So we're going to generate the times table and there we're going to pass.

289
00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:17.860
And then in the end we're going to pass in this times table number.

290
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:19.870
We'll go ahead and put that there.

291
00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:22.130
And let's now do our curly bracket.

292
00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:29.850
So with these curly brackets this is where we want to then go grab all of this awesome code.

293
00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:37.970
We're going to cut this and then we'll go ahead and paste this right inside.

294
00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:39.400
Excellent.

295
00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:39.960
OK.

296
00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:47.120
So now that we've got this information inside of here we need to be able to call this generate times

297
00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:47.720
table.

298
00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:53.450
So we're going to go ahead and move this down and I'm seeing a lot of red here I'm going to go ahead

299
00:20:53.450 --> 00:21:00.740
and hit run because I am assuming something's wrong maybe Android studio is just prematurely freaking

300
00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:02.150
out.

301
00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:05.290
Yeah it's not liking how I handle this.

302
00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:10.300
Oh and that's because I tried to put this function inside of the create method.

303
00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:14.120
OK we're getting all sorts of different sorts of dumb stuff here.

304
00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:16.790
OK so we need to put it up at the top here.

305
00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:19.330
There we go that's looking a lot better.

306
00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:25.730
All right so now that we have that again we need to call this generate times table song and move down

307
00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:29.230
to where we had this before.

308
00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:38.420
And we're going to call generate times table and we're going to pass in the times table number that

309
00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:42.710
looks good but you know this we're going to an issue here and that's because you know we're trying to

310
00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:50.030
refer to this time table list view which is created here inside of the on create method.

311
00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:52.370
So that's that's not what we're looking for.

312
00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:57.850
So what we need to do here is we're actually going to create this list view.

313
00:21:58.290 --> 00:21:59.990
Let's go ahead and cut this.

314
00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:02.770
We want this to be a property of the class.

315
00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:04.780
Just go ahead and put that there.

316
00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:08.850
And then instead we're going to take the name of this.

317
00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:13.230
Go ahead and copy that and paste it in.

318
00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:14.230
There we go.

319
00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:16.860
And then that should handle our issues there.

320
00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:22.980
So let's go ahead and now run this that we got everything sort of in place there.

321
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:29.630
So again when we move the CGC bar we should see that it updates the list view with the proper information.

322
00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:33.930
This is kind of a moment of truth here we've done a lot of work to get up to this moment so you'll know

323
00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:37.520
there's nothing and that's an issue I'm going to talk about that in a second but let's go ahead and

324
00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:41.730
move this and look at that as soon as we move this thing.

325
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:45.580
We can go all the way up to 20 showing the times tables for 20.

326
00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:47.950
We can go all the way down to 1.

327
00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:53.440
This is beautiful so we've got the core function functionality showing up here.

328
00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:58.610
Again I think the biggest thing is just when we opened the app for the first time we don't have anything

329
00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:06.260
showing up and it's a very simple fix that you know we just go ahead and we call this generate times

330
00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:09.650
table function on or on create for the very first time.

331
00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:13.850
So we're just going to go ahead and call generate times table.

332
00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:22.000
Now it's very tempting here to just go ahead and pass in the number 10 and this would probably be fine

333
00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:24.990
but remember my whole lecture about magic numbers.

334
00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:28.250
I think we can kind of clean up what we have here.

335
00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:31.760
In fact with the max here that probably be a good place to change as well.

336
00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:38.900
So I'm going to create an inch here called Max that I'm going to set equal to 20 an update with Max.

337
00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:45.340
And I'm also going to create another event that I'm just going to call starting position.

338
00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:48.230
And we're going to set this thing equal to 10.

339
00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:53.780
And the reason I'm doing this is because you see where we repeated ten two times if we now use starting

340
00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:59.530
position instead of just 10 arbitrarily I can say you know what I want starting position to be 1.

341
00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:03.090
Now I want it to be five maybe I want it to be 13.

342
00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:06.370
Whatever it is it just makes it that much easier for your coat.

343
00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:10.500
So this is all I want to be consistent with my advice that I'm giving you.

344
00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:11.990
But let's go ahead and see now.

345
00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:18.890
When the app runs for the very first time if it's displaying the times table for the 10 position hand

346
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:21.250
and here comes the app.

347
00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:21.940
Look at that.

348
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.890
It's showing the 10s.

349
00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:25.400
Beautiful beautiful stuff.

350
00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:30.250
Now just for fun because I think this is so cool that we can make this happen so quickly.

351
00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:35.700
I want to do the times tables out to 100 just to see what that would look like.

352
00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:39.060
So I'm going to go ahead and put that there.

353
00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:41.730
Let's see what this looks like on the emulator.

354
00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:44.650
I mean because this is what's cool about programming right this for loop.

355
00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:49.270
All we had to do is change one number and all sudden loops going 100 times instead of 10.

356
00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:52.100
So you know we go to some position here like that.

357
00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:55.790
I can see seven all the way out to 700.

358
00:24:55.810 --> 00:25:00.470
I mean it's just really amazing how this all works.

359
00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:05.340
Anyways I hope you enjoyed creating this.

360
00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:10.110
You know we kind of brought together some ideas and that's what we're hoping to do in this course right

361
00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:15.280
you learn about the Sikh bar you learn about list views how can I then put those things together to

362
00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:20.170
make something awesome right we want to take all these pieces that we're learning and build them together

363
00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:24.080
so in the end that you are just an awesome baller developer.

364
00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:24.640
OK.

365
00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:28.600
So we still got plenty more to learn so let's go ahead and keep moving forward.
