00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.090
All right let's go ahead and start talking about app marketing.

2
00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.300
Now I'm going to kind of break this into two sections.

3
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.830
The first bit I'm going to talk about is what I consider to be the basics.

4
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.450
And so first thing going to dive with some general principles about making an app that maybe not necessarily

5
00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:21.260
with marketing but sometimes I can I feel like is more important than the actual marketing.

6
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.830
So number one is let's say you have an idea for an app.

7
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.030
In my instance I'm going to be talking about an app that I made which is called later it allows you

8
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.540
to send text messages at a later point in time.

9
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.850
So this was actually an iOS app that wasn't an Android app and some of you are going to be laughing

10
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:46.030
because that is standard functionality on an Android device but it's not on ios so thus That's why I

11
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.770
created this iOS app because I thought you know the people on iOS need to know about this.

12
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.140
But anyways I had this idea for this app so let's say you have an idea for an app that will allow you

13
00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.380
to schedule text messages to be sent out at a later time.

14
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:06.040
Well if you are going to build this app I cannot recommend enough that you should draw out every single

15
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:12.040
piece of that app before you do anything just literally on a white piece of paper in a notebook wherever

16
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.650
it is you want to do it just get out and draw.

17
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.330
This is going to be the first screen of the app when you hit this button.

18
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.950
Then you go to this screen when you hit that button then you go to the screen.

19
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:27.310
And the reason for this is I have started many apps without drawing it out beforehand and I find myself

20
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.800
maybe you know two or three days into building this thing and I think well how is this going to work.

21
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.850
And I get lost on some point and I'm like well then maybe I should make a screen that does this and

22
00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.820
then I think well then how are we going to handle this situation.

23
00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.400
And it's just a really turns into a big nasty mess and I never get the project out the door.

24
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:51.430
So my first major tip here is draw out everything before you do anything because it gives you a nice

25
00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.750
plan of exactly what it is that you're trying to build you know what you're aiming towards.

26
00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.450
And I think it will actually make your project a success.

27
00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.610
I've seen too many of my own projects die.

28
00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:07.240
I now have a very strict rule I do not type 1 line of code until I have the entire thing drawn out because

29
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.550
I know that really increases the chances of success.

30
00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.580
So that's my first major tip.

31
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.310
Their next one is you kind of have to make a decision about whether you're building this app or you're

32
00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:25.030
going to buy someone some help to get this kind of the build or buy question now because you've taken

33
00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.610
this course.

34
00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.180
And you know all about programming now you're probably going to be in the build category but there's

35
00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.860
also an option there to now work with some other developers that you're saying.

36
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:34.520
OK.

37
00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:41.620
I know the basics maybe I want to work in tandem with another developer that I can hire or maybe I just

38
00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.930
want to say you know what you guys completely handle it.

39
00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.730
But now with my skills you know I'll be able to dive in and make sure that you're writing good code

40
00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.100
whatever it is you're working with a freelancer you know or just somebody that you know.

41
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.880
But that's kind of a decision you have to weigh out before you get started on anything again because

42
00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.140
you're taking this course you're probably going to be in the build category but just know that by option

43
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.660
is out there next is you need to make some sort of plan for your monetization.

44
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.190
So if the app that you're building is just a fun app and you're just making putting it on the App Store

45
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.240
because you know it's a hobby you're making an app for something that you love.

46
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.320
Honestly this later started as something that I just wanted for myself.

47
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.490
I just thought yeah you know this is something I'd like to see on iOS devices I don't really care about

48
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:25.780
monetization.

49
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.180
So if that's you you know you don't have to give any thought to how you're going to make money with

50
00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.550
this.

51
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.110
But you know if this is a little side hustle of yours you want to make some money with it want it to

52
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.840
be your full time thing whatever it is.

53
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.150
There are three ways that you can make money.

54
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.920
So one of them is through a straight up purchase of the app where it says OK if you want to download

55
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.190
the app you've got to pay 99 cents and then you can have it on your phone game.

56
00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.220
That's the purchase option.

57
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.690
The next one is ads.

58
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:58.870
Right so someone you know opens up the app and there's some ads there maybe at the bottom of the screen

59
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.190
or Typically in games it's like after you've done a few things a big full screen ads are going to pop

60
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.490
up and you have to you know wait for the timer to run out on that thing.

61
00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.130
I hate that thing and games but you know people got to get paid.

62
00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.930
And then the last way to do that is through in-app purchases.

63
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.980
So sometimes we see in-app purchases and ads sort of in tandem where it's like oh do you want to get

64
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.580
the ad free experience.

65
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.820
Well here you know get this one ninety nine in that purchase and we can get rid of those ads other time

66
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.800
in-app purchases can be more like a subscription.

67
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.070
That's what I've done with my later app where it says hey if you want this you know I had sort of a

68
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.910
basic version of my app that was free but if you wanted the more advanced features you would have to

69
00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.690
pay for ninety nine a month or if you bought three months or six months it would be a little bit cheaper.

70
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:47.600
But basically it was you know you would pay a subscription fee for the more advanced features.

71
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.770
So those are kind of three different methods for your app.

72
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.470
Oh kind of way out when I think the pros and cons are of each.

73
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.220
So number one the straight up purchase.

74
00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:02.490
Hi I'm not a fan of this mode of taxation at all.

75
00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.140
To be honest it's the cleanest way to do it because you know people pay money.

76
00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:11.700
They use your app you never have to worry about OK these are the free features these are the paid features

77
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:12.030
right.

78
00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:19.890
But people it just our whole society has moved into a way that most people can try things for free and

79
00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:21.050
then they end up paying for them.

80
00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:27.790
I mean think about Spotify Netflix YouTube TV whatever it is.

81
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.980
Usually you get like a free trial so that you can test it out and then if there's you know something

82
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:36.390
more advanced that you want you can always go pay for it or you know your free trial will run out.

83
00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:40.140
I think you're really just moving against the grain if you do this purchase option.

84
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:46.440
To me this is sort of a legacy way of paying for things that we saw back when people created software

85
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.450
and put it on CDs and you had to go to the you know software store to go buy that physically and bring

86
00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:52.920
it back to your computer.

87
00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:58.230
I really don't think it works well with apps but some people really love the whole idea of just you

88
00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:03.900
know their customer pays for it and then they just provide awesome support for it in the next one is

89
00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:04.540
ads.

90
00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.520
So ads is kind of a mix ground here.

91
00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:09.270
There's two things that you've got to worry about.

92
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:14.760
So one is how are your users going to react to the ads are they going to be completely and by them is

93
00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.580
it going to completely ruin the experience.

94
00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:23.190
Plus you have to make sure you're getting the correct ads from people so Google has an excellent ad

95
00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.200
service to provide ads in your app that you'll get paid from.

96
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.720
There's there's other special the ad platforms that you can use.

97
00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.440
I think particularly for games you'll find all sorts of companies there.

98
00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:38.790
But I have an app that I was doing with a friend that was supported with ads in the company behind those

99
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:42.410
ads suddenly had some sort of legal issue.

100
00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:48.510
And for about two months they weren't running any of their ads ads and we didn't have anything in place

101
00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:53.880
to go you know have some sort of backup or something and we lost a ton of revenue.

102
00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:58.650
We weren't expecting to lose because also their ads dried up because the ad provider wasn't there for

103
00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:01.710
us and we got totally hosed during that time.

104
00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:07.550
And so if you're supported by ads it's a little bit of a feast or famine kind of situation.

105
00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:12.960
Things can be can either be really really good or they can be really really bad depending on the situation.

106
00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.870
So if you're doing ads I would say make sure you're doing it in a tasteful way that doesn't anger your

107
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:20.730
users that you still get good reviews.

108
00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:26.040
I also think if you're going to offer ads you should also offer an option to pay in that purchase to

109
00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.110
get rid of them.

110
00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.060
That can really help out your users.

111
00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:33.480
And then the second thing is you've got to make sure you have lots of different ad providers so that

112
00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:38.610
in case one of them goes down the other one just automatically shows up and you should have that programmed

113
00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:44.070
in your code so that you don't have to you know oh the apps are out we've got to go put it on new.

114
00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:49.500
That was my friend and I we were in a mad panic to get these new updates in and it took forever to figure

115
00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:49.850
out.

116
00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:56.070
And eventually once it got into the App Store I think it was a month or two month period where we were

117
00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:57.380
kind of all messed up there.

118
00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:02.940
Maybe it was short or maybe I'm exaggerating here but there's that and then the last one is the in App

119
00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:03.860
purchases.

120
00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:08.460
So like I said I really like this one especially in connection with the ads.

121
00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:13.530
I think that's a great way so that people who don't want to pay can still get quote unquote pay with

122
00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:14.720
viewing the ads.

123
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:17.040
Yet if people don't like that experience they can pay for it.

124
00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:22.560
Also the upgraded features I've seen that my own personal app with later the subscription service is

125
00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:27.840
really really great because you'll get some returning customers and people you know will see oh if I

126
00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:32.370
you know have to pay this much for one month I might as well get the three month or six month because

127
00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:37.010
there's this awesome savings so sometimes you can get some really good up cells there.

128
00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:41.820
But I think it's really important that you pick one of these options are a combination of them before

129
00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:46.860
you get started on your out because if you want this app to make money you got to know where it's coming

130
00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.610
from and it's really going to be a big integral part of your app.

131
00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:55.080
For example with my later stuff if it was going to be ad supported versus you know this subscription

132
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:55.590
service.

133
00:08:55.830 --> 00:09:00.420
Well that completely changes what I would be having the ads showing up in certain places and the other

134
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:06.000
one you know I'd reserve a certain set of features for the subscription service and the other set for

135
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.500
the free side of things so just something you want to think about.

136
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:15.270
The last thing that I want to cover here is that you should tell a story with your app.

137
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:22.320
So whether you have a mobile game or it's a productivity app it's a map thing whatever your app is.

138
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:27.780
You should have some sort of story behind it because you want your users users to fall in love with

139
00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:28.620
what you've created.

140
00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:34.500
And also it's a really great opportunity to get some press for example with my later app.

141
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.660
I built the app out of frustration.

142
00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:38.380
I'm someone who is a night owl.

143
00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:43.800
I'm always up at like 1:00 2:00 in the morning and I think of these things that I'd want to text family

144
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.680
and friends but I couldn't text it at 2:00 in the morning.

145
00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.360
Your friends will think you're crazy.

146
00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:53.010
And so I needed an app where I could type out the message to someone and say you know just send this

147
00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:54.980
at 8:00 a.m. in the morning.

148
00:09:54.990 --> 00:10:00.520
And so I kind of had this cool story about the motivation behind building my app and so when I made

149
00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:06.160
my app I included some of that story in the description of the app I sent that out to some news publications

150
00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:13.420
and it got picked up by C-Net and somebody there wrote a review of it and oh my goodness I still remember

151
00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:14.780
the day crystal clear.

152
00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:21.220
I think I had 4000 app downloads in one day from this one article and it just blew my mind.

153
00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:26.260
How many downloads I was getting because before that I think I was getting 20 maybe 30 downloads a day

154
00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:31.690
and those were you know some really good days and then all of a sudden four thousand one day and I know

155
00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:36.610
friends who are app developers who have gotten even bigger numbers than that so there's even more out

156
00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:37.700
there for you.

157
00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:42.550
But I really think you should have a story it helps with both your users and if you're trying to get

158
00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:44.930
some press for your app.

159
00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:50.500
So next we're going to move into what I consider to be a really great way to make sure you have a good

160
00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:56.370
app to give to users and that's by getting your friends to test the app.

161
00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:01.250
So this was something that happened to me when I was building an app.

162
00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:06.370
It was this app to help you learn how to do a specific skill.

163
00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:09.250
So in this case the very first one that I made was weightlifting.

164
00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:14.950
So if you wanted to increase your upper body lower body abs whatever it was it was an app that would

165
00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:16.660
give you all the best videos for that.

166
00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:22.870
And there was like a little workout journal all this stuff and so I had spent months building this app

167
00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:26.090
just kind of in my room on my own plugging away on this thing.

168
00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.430
And I went to go submitted to the App Store.

169
00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:35.530
This was again on the iOS platform and it got rejected and it was a really nice note from Apple and

170
00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:39.510
it basically said your app is crap and I just thought well what's so bad about this.

171
00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:45.520
So I remember very vividly handing my app to a friend and saying hey what do you think about me.

172
00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:46.610
My app.

173
00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:50.410
And when I handed them the app I didn't say anything.

174
00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:54.350
I just let them look at it and they didn't know where to start.

175
00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:59.530
They opened it up and said What do I do.

176
00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:01.550
Like what's this app about.

177
00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:05.650
And I you know I was like oh you're really supposed to do this and like OK and they tapped into a thing

178
00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:08.470
and then they said well how am I supposed to play the video.

179
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:10.490
I'm like oh well you're supposed to click here.

180
00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:16.450
And I kind of had this aha moment that this whole time building this app I had assumed that this was

181
00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:18.520
the most user friendly app in the world.

182
00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:24.220
Everyone knew exactly how to use it but when I put it in the hands of someone else it was a really poorly

183
00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:26.530
designed app and it didn't work very well.

184
00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:32.080
And so I think this is an excellent test to make sure that you have a good app you give your app to

185
00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.720
friends and families.

186
00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:39.880
It could even be a random stranger but don't say anything except Hey I just made this new app I want

187
00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:44.500
you to check it out and tell me what you think or I just want you to go ahead and play around with this

188
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.740
app like don't give them too many stipulations.

189
00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:52.390
But the big thing is hand the app to them and shut up because you want to see what they do without you

190
00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:55.760
telling them if at some point you have to tell them what to do.

191
00:12:55.810 --> 00:13:01.480
You know that something's wrong with your app and this is can be a very hard thing to subject yourself

192
00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:06.910
to because you might think you know these people just they just don't get it and I spent so much time

193
00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:13.390
on this but this is the purest test to see how well your app is going to be used by your users.

194
00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:16.800
Different strategies that you can use to get there.

195
00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:20.700
So the very first one is you've got to experiment.

196
00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:23.110
You know the whole idea.

197
00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:27.760
Remember the main goal here with ASIO is you're trying to get your app to rank as high as possible either

198
00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:34.780
when someone searches something or on some sort of trending page and Google what they use to decide

199
00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:37.000
which apps go up or down.

200
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.250
This is a super top secret for them.

201
00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:44.570
They don't want to know what goes into their algorithm to decide which apps are going to be at the top

202
00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:46.420
and which apps are going to be at the bottom.

203
00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:50.600
And so you've always got to try different things to see if you can't get something to click.

204
00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:55.340
And there's all sorts of great blogs out there with people talking about you know what things they're

205
00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:58.150
doing that they think are working or not working.

206
00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:03.580
I mean there's also the idea out there that if you know some new secret tip that's working you're not

207
00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:07.150
going to share it with the world so I don't know always how much you can trust on those blogs.

208
00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:10.720
But I found some valuable information that I think have helped my out.

209
00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:16.270
But really the biggest impact I've seen on my own apps is when I experimented with things on my own

210
00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:20.140
and just found some excellent excellent results.

211
00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:25.870
The next thing I want to talk about and this is probably the most important with ASIO is your title

212
00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:28.250
your key words and your description.

213
00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:34.020
So Win the Google Play Store is deciding what order to rank apps.

214
00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:38.800
You know someone's searching for something if for example we were going to use my later app it's a little

215
00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:43.030
bit off because I the later app is in the Google Play app.

216
00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:51.100
But if someone was going to search for example schedule a text or maybe postpone Tech something like

217
00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:51.340
that.

218
00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:54.190
Like I want my app to shoot up to the front.

219
00:14:54.190 --> 00:15:00.460
So inside of Google Play they give you a place to list title a key word and descriptions and you want

220
00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:05.140
to make sure you put in the correct information so that when someone's searching for the relevant terms

221
00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:10.990
that you pop up and there's all sorts of different services out there that will help you understand

222
00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:12.030
how to do this.

223
00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:15.510
And one that I really like and recommend is called app Annie.

224
00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:18.320
The kind of help you pick what your title should be.

225
00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:23.380
You know keywords that you should have description that will also help you track the number of downloads

226
00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:29.140
that you have so that you can see oh what kind of impact are these words having on whatever but it was

227
00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:36.130
me personally with that weightlifting app that I had I eventually got that in the App Store when I had

228
00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:43.120
tweaked the title to put in the correct key words I remember overnight I tripled my downloads.

229
00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:46.330
That is no small feat to triple your daily downloads.

230
00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:50.750
It was just a holiday lujah moment like oh my goodness I can't believe this.

231
00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:55.210
And so for me in that instance it was picking the right words in using the max amount of characters

232
00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:58.250
that were allowed with the title in order to do that.

233
00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:04.870
And since then the AppStore rules have changed and that was shut down so that you know that technique

234
00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:07.770
didn't work as well and that's something that happens all the time with a.

235
00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:12.670
So there's something that's going to make your ab juice up to the top but then all sudden Google place

236
00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:14.410
or Apple says now you know what.

237
00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:17.870
We don't think we should allow that anymore so we're going to you know cut that back.

238
00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:23.470
And so that's just something you've got to be aware of but but so to take the top recommendation of

239
00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:28.540
experiment I would add it to here with the title keywords and descriptions you always want to be testing

240
00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:34.630
out new titles keywords descriptions and see what really hits in sticks with people.

241
00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.490
The next one is reviews.

242
00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:40.000
So there's two reasons to have really good reviews.

243
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.110
One is that it's going to put you up inside of Google plays rankings.

244
00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:45.960
That's a pretty big one right there.

245
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.040
The next one is when someone comes to your page and they see an app that has lots of reviews and that

246
00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.320
are good reviews.

247
00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:56.590
They're going to say oh you know this is an app that I should get there like there's like some social

248
00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:57.180
proof there.

249
00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:00.830
Like other people are you know downloading this thing they seem to like it.

250
00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:02.820
I think I'll go ahead and do it.

251
00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:04.950
So you got to make sure that you have good reviews.

252
00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.780
So how do you get good reviews.

253
00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:11.000
Well I mean sort of the basic answer is make sure you have a good app right.

254
00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:15.980
If someone ever writes a you know bad review because they had like a bug or some feature was missing.

255
00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:18.370
See what you can do in order to fix that.

256
00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:24.160
You can't always please every single reviewer out there you're going to go crazy trying to do that.

257
00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:26.260
But see what you can do.

258
00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:31.300
The next thing though is when you put your app into the app store initially you're probably not going

259
00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:35.740
to get very many downloads which I mean without a lot of downloads probably a lot of people are going

260
00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:37.030
to leave reviews.

261
00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:43.240
So I recommend for your very first app maybe go talk to your family and friends and say hey could you

262
00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:47.770
download my app and leave an honest review of what you thought the app was like.

263
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:52.270
You know I need sort of some social proof for my app and whenever I did that my friends were more than

264
00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:58.610
understanding and that really helped me to kind of get an initial base in order to move forward.

265
00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:04.870
The next one is localizations So this is an awesome little secret that I love and the basic story here

266
00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:07.220
is that you take your app if you like me.

267
00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:12.570
You speak English you made your app for English speakers but probably other people would find your app

268
00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:13.560
interesting.

269
00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:19.900
So what you need to do is take your title your keywords and descriptions and make a Chinese title a

270
00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:26.470
Chinese description and stuff like that do the same thing for German Japanese Spanish like as many languages

271
00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:33.160
as you can and by doing that you'll see your app show up more prominently in those app stores cars.

272
00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:39.730
For example if there's a German user that was searching for scheduling a text later which I don't know

273
00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:43.390
how to say that and Durbin maybe it's scheduled taxed I don't know.

274
00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:45.120
That was the worst German accent in the world.

275
00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:51.510
But you know that my app would probably not show up but if I had translated my title into German There

276
00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:55.050
is a much better chance that one my app would show up for that user.

277
00:18:55.060 --> 00:19:00.320
But to that they would say oh this person took the time to change the title into German.

278
00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:01.990
I think I'll go ahead and check it out.

279
00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:07.360
And so this localization This will take a little bit of effort right because you've got to translate

280
00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.280
your title your descriptions all that stuff.

281
00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:14.110
Even better if you can translate the name of buttons and menus and stuff inside your app.

282
00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:15.890
That's just one step better.

283
00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:21.370
I found the most basic thing you can do is maybe just look up the top three languages in the world.

284
00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:29.360
I mean it's probably Chinese English and Spanish is my guess the top three but you know get your just

285
00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:35.360
maybe some of the most popular languages in the world you can just even use google translate free tool

286
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:40.310
to you know just plug in your title here it'll show the translated version there and go add all those

287
00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:41.960
localized versions.

288
00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:48.200
When I did that for that weightlifting app remember that one I had seen the three x boost from the title

289
00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.060
change when I did the localization.

290
00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:53.780
I think that did maybe a 1.5 change there.

291
00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:57.990
So again that was you know some really big stuff.

292
00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:05.300
The next one is and this is my absolute favorite is I want you to visit your page as a potential customer

293
00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:12.080
because I think this one really just you'll start doing the right things after that so you're someone

294
00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:15.280
who has a phone and you download apps.

295
00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:18.590
What is it that you look for when you're going to go download apps.

296
00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:22.950
You need to take that same mentality and apply it to your own app.

297
00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:28.940
So I would go ahead and try searching for your app with whatever search term you think people would

298
00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:33.380
use and make sure the apps not installed on your phone so you can see what it looks like and then you

299
00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:39.080
know go look at the title the description the screenshots that are provided maybe a promo video that

300
00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:44.090
you have there maybe you have a lack of a promo video and you think oh maybe add a promo video people

301
00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:50.180
would like it more but just come look at your app page in the Google Play store with fresh eyes and

302
00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:54.350
just think would I download my own app like would I trust my own app.

303
00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:59.690
Does this look professional enough and maybe you'll think an I should really change that iconic title

304
00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:05.240
IX janky or maybe you'll think oh I found this you know grammar error and said in my description I need

305
00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:10.970
to fix that or the screen shot really doesn't convey what my app does but coming to your app with fresh

306
00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:16.640
eyes and you know saying I'm going to be a potential customer that's going to really help you to see

307
00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:22.010
what it is that someone is looking for in a nap and kind of the next time you go to download an app

308
00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:27.250
like you're going maybe to a baseball game and you want to get an app that's going to track the player's

309
00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:32.530
stats so you go search like baseball stat track or write something completely unrelated to your app

310
00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:37.400
but just sort of pay attention to what it is that you're looking for when you're searching through apps

311
00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:41.290
like do you look for the highest ratings first do you look for the most downloads.

312
00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:46.150
Do you look for the best icons or whatever it is like just to pay attention to your patterns.

313
00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:52.370
And I think you can apply that to most other users when they're looking through the Google Play store.

314
00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:56.970
Well I hope you enjoyed this lecture on marketing.

315
00:21:56.990 --> 00:22:01.820
Again we had sort of the general stuff here and then now we have the app store optimization sort of

316
00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:03.440
two separate worlds.

317
00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:08.360
But if you have any questions need any help feel free to leave a comment on the video and we'd be more

318
00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.510
than happy to talk more.
