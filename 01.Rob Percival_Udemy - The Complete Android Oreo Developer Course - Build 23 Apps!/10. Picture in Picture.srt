00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,920
Hello and welcome to the lecture we're we're going to be learning how to create a picture and picture

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,660
functionality in our app.

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:12,360
I had a blast making this one I think Android has absolutely killed this with making this so easy for

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,870
developers and just a pleasure to use.

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,520
So the basic idea here is you have an app.

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:24,240
This is mostly intended for apps that are streaming video and you want to have that video streaming

7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,800
you can kind of do this picture in picture and thing and have it in the bottom corner and still use

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,530
other apps but still of that video player.

9
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:36,930
So let's go ahead and start a new Android project and let's maybe just call this picture and picture

10
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:37,990
fun.

11
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:39,480
All right.

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,890
And we'll go ahead and create this.

13
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:47,700
We need to have the latest API 26 in order to do this so make sure you have that selected and we want

14
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,700
an empty activity.

15
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:58,050
So according to my understanding picture a picture was a thing in API 26 with TV devices but is now

16
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:02,910
officially available on mobile devices with Android which is pretty great.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,570
So I do want to mention here I thought of a really cool cause I thought why would you want to do Picture

18
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,990
in Picture if you weren't going to be playing video.

19
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,500
And so I kind of was as I was messing around I thought about it.

20
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:21,570
And if you were someone who was super into stocks or at a cryptocurrency that you're like always watching

21
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,650
the price of bitcoin or something like that.

22
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:30,000
A pretty funny picture in picture app would be showing the price of bitcoin down in the bottom corner

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,190
so that no matter what app it is what ever you do in your life you can see to the second updates on

24
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:38,560
the price of bitcoin or your favorite stock whatever it is.

25
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:41,240
And I thought ha that's the situation when you wouldn't need video.

26
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:47,010
But also if you're that concerned about your investments and stuff you probably need to be checked into

27
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,820
a mental hospital.

28
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:55,380
So with this let's go ahead and talk about how we can implement this like I said I just think that it

29
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,840
was absolutely nailed by Android.

30
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,260
So let's go ahead and open up first the visual side of things.

31
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:07,440
We want to make it so that when our user hits a button they can make the app go into picture in picture

32
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:07,950
mode.

33
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,140
So what we're going to do is we're going to bring a button into our project.

34
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:19,390
We're going to have to wait a second here for Android studio to finish itself up.

35
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,110
Come on.

36
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:20,800
There we go.

37
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:26,740
And so I'm just going to take this button and I'm going to put it right below this other button or the

38
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,840
hello world that we have there.

39
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:35,080
I'm going to go and hit its upper constraint so it is connected to Hello World and will go down and

40
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:40,850
change the text of this button to say something like Go picture in picture mode.

41
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:41,580
OK.

42
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,400
So we've got that button.

43
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:49,250
It's connected to Hello World and I'll go ahead and get the emulator ready to rock and roll here because

44
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,310
that will take a little bit of time to set up.

45
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:57,290
So with this button let's have it have a proper ID here.

46
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:06,110
When I go back to android studio and while we are really lagging right now let's try this again.

47
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:10,600
We've got the button select that I'm going to call this Peepy button.

48
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:15,010
And if you don't know p p stands for picture in picture.

49
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:17,250
Now with this we want to go ahead.

50
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,660
Oh I need to set in on click for that button.

51
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:29,240
So the unclick Maybe I'll call this like go pee IP so well I'd like to do that but wow Android studio

52
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,010
right now is just crawling

53
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,680
K

54
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:43,000
I think it's just great or great will build that's killing us but we'll go ahead and set up the method

55
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,980
while we're waiting for that to load.

56
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:51,040
So we want public void and we'll call it maybe go pee pee.

57
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,770
We've got to take a view with this.

58
00:03:53,890 --> 00:04:00,640
Let's make sure we hit enter on that so we get the proper view imported in our curly brackets.

59
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:04,330
So it's when the user hits this button wants to go to picture in picture.

60
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:09,970
This is when we want to get things set up so you will not believe this this is how easy it is to go

61
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,590
into picture in picture mode.

62
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,870
Are you ready for this.

63
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:19,060
You just type that and her picture in picture mode semi-colon.

64
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:20,590
That is it.

65
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:22,660
That is all you have to do.

66
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:30,700
So let's see we're still having beef with our little friend there but that's really all we need in order

67
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,620
to move forward.

68
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,100
So let's go back.

69
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,160
I think this is finally ready to cooperate with us.

70
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,300
I'm going to type this.

71
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,950
B go pee pee.

72
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,060
That's the name of our method that we have there.

73
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:48,480
And on our emulator you can see we have to go pee pee but it's not exactly centered so let's.

74
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:55,090
Right click and say hey you should be centered and let's try running that one more time.

75
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:58,250
Now that we got it in place so.

76
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:02,380
And then we'll be able to test out this Enter picture in picture mode.

77
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:07,210
Now I'm not sure why this is crossed out I got the message that this was deprecated but the research

78
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:12,980
that I did was showing that this was new to API 26 Not that it was deprecated and the functionality

79
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,140
is still completely there.

80
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:18,820
So I'm not sure why that's the case but everything was working for me.

81
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,380
So look at the button here is working.

82
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:28,160
And if we go ahead and click on this boom well says PKP has stopped.

83
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,190
Let's go ahead and see what problems we got going on here.

84
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:38,210
So this is the problem is that we didn't specify that this activity can handle picture in picture.

85
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:41,920
So not only do you have to do this you have to specify that you can handle picture and picture I guess

86
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:48,680
I oversold the simplicity of things are going to go into our Android manifest.

87
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:54,110
Well go ahead and open up that file and there's a few changes that we want to make inside of here.

88
00:05:54,200 --> 00:06:01,810
And so let's go ahead and we want to with our activity here set a few options to say hey we can handle

89
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,970
this picture and picture stuff.

90
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:09,510
So one of them is going to be Android and we are looking for resizable activity.

91
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:13,400
So scroll down till we can find resizable activity.

92
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,180
There we go.

93
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:18,030
We want to set this to true.

94
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:23,470
Another option that we want to set here is the support picture in picture so we're going to Android.

95
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:28,180
Scroll down to our asses and say this supports picture in picture.

96
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,120
We're going to say that is true as well.

97
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:38,260
And then the last one that we want to do is Android and we want to do config changes and we want to

98
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:43,000
set this equal to a couple of things so one of them is going to be screen size and then we're going

99
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,170
to do a straight line and then say smaller screen size.

100
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:54,310
We also wanted to screen lay out another line and then say orientation.

101
00:06:54,580 --> 00:07:00,700
So make sure when you're doing these this is part of the activity tag here for your main activity not

102
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:05,280
part of the application don't get it mixed up with these other ones have it down here with this.

103
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:12,120
But with those in place you should now see picture and picture work without things crashing.

104
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,980
You know hopefully I won't embarrass myself this time.

105
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,780
So Apple opens up.

106
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,870
I hit the button boom.

107
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,960
Look at that.

108
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,950
How cool is that.

109
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,400
Our little things showed up on there.

110
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:28,010
And if we click this it's going to give us the option to open it back up and we hit that again boom.

111
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:29,050
It shrinks down.

112
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:35,640
Now we have an issue here a couple of issues one is we have still the bar showing up there at the top

113
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:40,420
and for a second you could see the button but like nothing is clickable inside of picture in picture.

114
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:45,070
The only thing you can do is have it come back to life and so in fact I think we should make it so that

115
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:49,810
when we go to a picture in picture we get rid of this top toolbar we get rid of the button maybe for

116
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:53,290
fun we'll change the text here on the text view.

117
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:59,480
So let's go back I want to make sure a text view has an ID and yes it does text view.

118
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:01,830
So let's go into some coding.

119
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:08,100
Now we do get some information whenever we're trying to go into or out of picture in picture mode there's

120
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,520
a function that's called.

121
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:16,690
And so we're just going to type out here on picture and it should be the first one that pops up on picture

122
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:18,670
in picture mode changed.

123
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:24,060
So this will alert us whenever you know we are going into a picture and picture Moeder out of it and

124
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,300
the way that we can tell whether we're going in or out.

125
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,100
Is this is in picture in picture mode.

126
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:35,680
So we're going to do an if statement like this and we're going to check that is in picture in picture

127
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,250
mode.

128
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:39,390
And so it's in the top situation.

129
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:49,470
This is where we are saying we are going into a picture and picture and the situation here is that we

130
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:54,060
are going out of picture in picture.

131
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:00,090
And so those are the kind of two situations that are going into picture and picture.

132
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:05,700
Like I said we want to get rid of the button and we want to get rid of the toolbar there and also for

133
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:10,200
fun we should probably change the text so in order to do all those things we have to have access to

134
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:10,900
them.

135
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:16,350
So let's go ahead and first get access to our text view and to give this name of teks view and say this

136
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,480
is equal to find view by ID.

137
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,090
ID dot text view.

138
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:22,920
Excellent.

139
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,850
And let's get Also access to that button.

140
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:35,250
So I'm going to say i.p button is hard to find view by our idea.

141
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,120
P P button.

142
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:42,710
Ok so now that we have access to those two the first one is we want to just get rid of the button.

143
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:50,250
So we're going to set it's visibility to blank basically So we're going to say set visibility and we're

144
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,010
just going to type in capital in visible.

145
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:58,110
So that turns into view Capitol all caps invisible and that will get rid of it.

146
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:03,300
All right the next thing that we want to do is we want to get rid of the action bar up at the top so

147
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:11,400
we're going to say get support action bar dot and then we just want to do a hide going to say let's

148
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,260
get rid of this then just for fun let's go ahead and change the text for you.

149
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,900
Text I mean this is completely unnecessary.

150
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:22,320
But let's have it for example be like it was a Bitcoin thing right.

151
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:28,620
So this is going to show the price of bitcoin and so maybe will say Bitcoin just broke 10000 so I'll

152
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:33,920
have it be some random amount of bitcoin here.

153
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,310
Or go ahead and put that in.

154
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:39,150
So now when we're going to the picture in picture mode we're going to change the text we're going to

155
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:44,120
get rid of the action bar and get rid of that button and hopefully it'll be that much easier to read.

156
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:49,890
So we'll go ahead and run this I guess you could even want to this text you might look a little bit

157
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:55,140
small so you could change it so that it's going to be a little bit bigger so that people can read that

158
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:55,980
all the better.

159
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,170
But look we go ahead we hit that button boom.

160
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,290
I get that.

161
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,570
It shows us that price isn't that cool again.

162
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:08,070
This would be the weirdest app in the world but kind of a cool example since we don't have video to

163
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:08,730
play.

164
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:13,680
But you know we have one issue and that's when we come back to bring the full screen.

165
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,600
Well we no longer have the action bar.

166
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,650
We no longer have that button that says go into a picture and picture and I'd kind of like to change

167
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,200
this back to hello world.

168
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,300
So to do that you can probably guess we just need to reverse everything that we did here.

169
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,530
So I'm going to copy and paste this rather than invisible.

170
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:31,940
We're going to change this to visible rather than hide.

171
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,320
We're going to change this to show.

172
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:41,420
And rather than having this be some crazy Bitcoin dollar amount we're going to say hello world.

173
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:45,840
Again if you want to change the text size on things you could you know edit this text view to change

174
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,120
the font and whatnot.

175
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:51,990
But let's go ahead and run this and see if we can get this rolling.

176
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,360
OK.

177
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,890
So here comes the app.

178
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:02,830
We are going to go into a picture in picture mode that changed everything like just like we were hoping

179
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:09,920
for we hit it again to make it full screen and ah it brings back that button the top action bar.

180
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,700
Pretty awesome stuff.

181
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:14,800
So hopefully enjoyed learning about this again.

182
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,170
I just think it's so simple how all this works.

183
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:21,460
We just have to at some point call enter picture in picture mode.

184
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:25,780
We've got to have this function where we can you know handle some design changes we're moving in and

185
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:31,060
out and we have two on our Android manifest say which activities are allowed to do picture in picture

186
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:31,650
mode.

187
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:36,010
So there's all sorts of cool neat tricks that you can do to make it so that if you're in one particular

188
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:41,260
activity and someone hits the home button from there that it's you know saying oh they probably want

189
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:45,100
to have this go into picture in picture mode you can automatically do it without the user hitting a

190
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:45,790
button.

191
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:50,260
All sorts of fun stuff you can do but I just at least wanted to show you the basics here.

192
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,180
So I hope you enjoyed that.

193
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,470
Still got more to learn.
