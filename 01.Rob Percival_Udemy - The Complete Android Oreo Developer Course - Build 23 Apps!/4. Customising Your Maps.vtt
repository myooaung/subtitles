00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.080
All right in this lecture we're going to keep moving forward with learning about how to work with maps

2
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.120
particularly we're going to dive into how we can work with these different annotations that we have

3
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.040
for example or I guess markers what they're called.

4
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.530
You know we did a little bit of customization here saying I like Ossy for eyes of all we're going to

5
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.420
learn how to put something in a new location how we can find the location of things also how we can

6
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.420
change our maps so we can for instance show a satellite image rather than just sort of this cartoon

7
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.210
version of things that we have here.

8
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.340
So first let's go and talk about how we can find a new location.

9
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.760
So there's a couple of ways that you can do this really googling just the best.

10
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.850
We just need to find the latitude and longitude of a location if we go back to our code here.

11
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:44.210
Right.

12
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:51.330
So apparently Sidneys at negative 34 and positive 151 if we wanted to find it for some other location

13
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:59.280
we'd maybe open up a new tab and let's find like Mt. Everest and we'll just go ahead and search that

14
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.520
I'm sure we could find it in Google Maps.

15
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:10.510
So let's see the oh I thought it would have just automatically taken us there.

16
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.280
Oh look here we go.

17
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.310
Maybe this is the Google maps link that we're looking for.

18
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.680
Yeah.

19
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.220
OK.

20
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.210
So it's showing us Google or Mt. Everest here on the map.

21
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.810
And usually in the URL you can just find the latitude in the longitude just right there ready to go

22
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.830
you can just go ahead and copy that.

23
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.870
Also if you right click on an annotation and Google map you can say what's here and it's going to provide

24
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.100
you some more information about the specific latitude and longitude.

25
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.850
So feel free to pick whatever location it is that you want.

26
00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:46.150
I think just Mt. Everest would kind of be a cool one to have inside of our map here so I'm going to

27
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:52.200
go ahead back to the are L and I'm going to copy the latitude and longitude there.

28
00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:53.800
At least I'm hoping to.

29
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.180
There we go.

30
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.900
Copy.

31
00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:04.060
And once we take that I'm going to go back to our code and we'll now call this Everest and we'll paste

32
00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:12.710
in this number and we're going to have to cut that second number and will replace 151 with that.

33
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:19.000
OK so this should now be pointing towards Everest and of course we don't want to say I like Aussie fries

34
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:26.800
for Mt. Everest will change us to say biggest in the world would be kind of fun.

35
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.750
I mean we could just say Everest but I think it's kind of cool to do a little bit of a different tack

36
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:31.380
there now.

37
00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.820
You can see because we made this new lat long object which is the latitude and longitude right.

38
00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.730
We need to update Everest here to replace Sydney.

39
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.270
And also here for the move camera which is you know zoom into a particular cation location we need to

40
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.040
update that.

41
00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.740
So let's go ahead and run this on our device

42
00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.460
and we'll wait for the sky to pop up.

43
00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.990
Here we go and look at that.

44
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.710
Now we're showing Mt. Everest here and if we click on this biggest in the world it's showing that.

45
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.030
Isn't that cool.

46
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.400
So the way to do a little bit more customization with this is we can actually change what this marker

47
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.510
looks like.

48
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.850
So here after we've gone and we've set the title we can still do more on this.

49
00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:26.670
So not the very last and predecease but the one just before that we're going to say Dot title excuse

50
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:27.320
me not title.

51
00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:34.870
This is where we want to say that the fault or excuse me icon is what we're looking for.

52
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:35.800
OK so are you.

53
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:36.710
Icon.

54
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.890
Now this is looking for a bitmap descriptor.

55
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:46.300
So we are going to do a bit map the Scripter

56
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:49.930
goodness bitmap

57
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.180
descriptor factory.

58
00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:55.190
There we go.

59
00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.950
And then we're going to say Dot the fault marker.

60
00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.380
And with this default marker we're going to pass in a number to this but rather than do just a straight

61
00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:13.170
up number we're going to do capital bitmap factory description factory dot in on this you can see there's

62
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:18.540
all sorts of different colors here so you can pick which color you'd like I think would be kind of cool

63
00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:22.470
to maybe see let's do like a yellow one for instance.

64
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.680
So this should now be putting a yellow marker into our app so let's go ahead and run that

65
00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.030
you will get our app all ready to go here.

66
00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.540
And when it opens up oh look at that.

67
00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.030
All sudden it's a yellow marker instead of a red one so you can kind of you know change it and personalize

68
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:47.640
it and you can even with this rather than just doing the default marker you can actually add an actual

69
00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.650
bitmap image if you want to with this bitmap descriptor factory.

70
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.580
But we won't dive into that for right now that's if you want to do something custom for example Oubre

71
00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.590
when they have like the little card showing on the screen I imagine they're using their own custom icon

72
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:02.760
there.

73
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.590
Next thing I want to do is for example we have Mt. Everest here but it's like super zoomed out right

74
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:09.360
like we can see.

75
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:14.760
Oh ok it's like between Nepal and China but we could barely read Nepal I could be nice to actually be

76
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.780
zoomed in so we could see a little bit more of the mountains.

77
00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:25.860
So in order to do that here on this move camera instead of doing this camera update factory new lat

78
00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:33.300
longitude we're going to delete that and say camera update factory dot and instead we're going to pick

79
00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.390
new lat longitude zoom just like this.

80
00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.410
So we still have to provide latitude longitude which will provide us Everest but then also we get to

81
00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.040
provide a number here.

82
00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:51.960
So for example let's go ahead and throw in 15 and we'll run our app here you can choose a zoom between

83
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.230
one and twenty.

84
00:05:53.400 --> 00:06:00.380
One is the most zoomed out 20 is the most sumed and so 15 is pretty zoomed in here.

85
00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:07.500
And we'll see our app open up and maybe this is just way to zoom because I can't even see anything going

86
00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:13.440
on here so maybe we'll zoom out a bit and you can start to see where we are so it's like OK maybe 15

87
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:18.780
is too much and see what one looks like we'll go ahead and run that.

88
00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:23.880
Really it's just kind of playing around with this until you find what you think is the right zoom level

89
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.470
for your app.

90
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:31.070
So let's go ahead and see you know this is what we had before it was way too zoomed out.

91
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:36.890
So maybe the nice middle ground is somewhere like 10 or something like that like that will get us to

92
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:38.110
a good position.

93
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.950
Now the last thing that I want to cover here is how you can actually rather than just show sort of this

94
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:47.030
cartoony version of the world you can show satellite imagery.

95
00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:52.130
So amazing that Google allows us to access this stuff with like one or two lines of code.

96
00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:53.510
It really just blows me away.

97
00:06:53.510 --> 00:07:00.110
But what we're going to do is we're going to take this map and with this we're going to say Dot set

98
00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:05.060
and I want you to notice here for a second when you say set there is a lot of things that we can do

99
00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:05.710
with this map.

100
00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:08.260
It's pretty cool all the customization you can do.

101
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:14.500
But for right now we're going to say set map type and the type that we're looking for.

102
00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:21.500
We're going to go ahead and type capital Google Map dot and there's all sorts of options here so satellite

103
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:22.640
would be straight up satellite.

104
00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:28.100
I think normal is the one that shows kind of like the cartoon version terrain I think is what we saw

105
00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:35.240
when we actually searched for the mountain in the web and a hybrid is sort of like a combination.

106
00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:41.150
So I believe it's a combination of satellite and the cartoony stuff I don't think we get the train thing

107
00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:42.140
but we'll see.

108
00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:45.930
Let's go ahead and do hybrid and see what our app looks like now.

109
00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.030
OK.

110
00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:51.210
So we'll go ahead and run that.

111
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:53.920
And here comes the app.

112
00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:55.790
And look at that.

113
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:58.760
We get this awesome image of Mt. Everest.

114
00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:01.500
We've got some good names going so.

115
00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:03.730
So cool how this works.

116
00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:04.520
I'm just interested.

117
00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:12.640
I want to see you know what for example the terrain looks like that might be a really cool you know

118
00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.440
look for Everest particularly.

119
00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.230
Let's go ahead and see what that looks like.

120
00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:23.100
It's always fun in programming to kind of explore and just do different random things and yeah look

121
00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.000
at that.

122
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:29.020
That was more of what we saw when we were looking there on the web.

123
00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:32.200
Oh my goodness that is that is really cool.

124
00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:33.330
OK.

125
00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:36.470
So that is the basics of map.

126
00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.160
You know a little bit more advanced stuff.

127
00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:42.130
Now we're going to take a quick pause from hours to go learn how to get the user's location.

128
00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:44.580
We'll be back to work with Google Maps soon enough.

129
00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:48.480
But first we've got to figure out how we can figure out where a user is.
