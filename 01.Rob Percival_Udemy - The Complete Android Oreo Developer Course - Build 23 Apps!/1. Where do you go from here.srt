1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,650
Well congratulations you made it this far in the course.

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:04,740
I'm really proud of you.

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,880
Go ahead and give yourself a nice little pat on the back there because we've learned so much.

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:12,200
We covered two different programming languages.

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:18,180
Java and colonies should be very familiar with Java at this point and now you probably have a good grasp

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:23,650
on cotland and if you'd like to go further with that I'm sure you're going to have absolutely no problem.

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,890
You've learned so many different apps and how to make them.

8
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:34,050
We've covered topics like GPS yes Bluetooth data storage with an s q all database that was really awesome.

9
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,790
We've also learned how to make social apps.

10
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,850
We made the Twitter clone we made the Instagram clone.

11
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,390
I still have more for you if you'd like to go further.

12
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,980
We have some bonus content after that and that kind of leads me to the next point is you know where

13
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:47,920
do you go from here.

14
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,610
And like I said I have some bonus content for you.

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,100
Couple of other apps from a previous class that you can check out that a lot of that is still relevant.

16
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,050
But the bigger thing that I'd really like to emphasize here is that I think the best way for you to

17
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:06,780
grow and move forward from this point is to be working on your own apps if you have some idea for an

18
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,340
app that you've always wanted to make or you thought that would be really cool or maybe it's an app

19
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,170
that already exists but you just thought Ah if they would have done things this way I think it would

20
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,550
have been that much better.

21
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,200
I want you to pursue that go after your dream of making some out because when you're creating an app

22
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,710
you're drawing out the sketches for it and you're gonna have to figure out how to add all the different

23
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,850
features for it.

24
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,740
That's where the real learning takes place.

25
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:33,180
I know in my personal development journey that's when things really took off for me when I stopped doing

26
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,770
tutorials and I said I'm building this and I had to figure out how to do this.

27
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,200
For me that's where the real learning took place.

28
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,440
So again thank you so much for checking out this course.

29
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,840
Go ahead and look at the bonus content.

30
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,070
But please go attack those apps.

31
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:47,860
You can do it.
