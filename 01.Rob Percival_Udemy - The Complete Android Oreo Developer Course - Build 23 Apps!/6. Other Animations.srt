1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:06,430
So in the previous video we saw how we can fade images in and out in this video we're going to just

2
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:11,020
whip through a number of other animations that we can do just of which you caught a glimpse of in the

3
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:12,320
previous video.

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,290
So I'm just going to get rid of the

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,420
part is showing part because we get to do all our animations with Bart.

6
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:31,420
And let's start then by taking about imagery and animate and we'll look at first the translation

7
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,430
animations.

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,260
So I've got translations with x y and Zed there.

9
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:45,600
And you'll notice that we've got either translation X which translates to a particular value translate

10
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,810
by the way in this case just means move.

11
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,490
It's a mathematical term.

12
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:53,270
Or we can use translation x by.

13
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:59,740
So this would move it in the x direction by a certain number of the piece.

14
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:07,190
So let's try translation y by let's say we want to meet it 1000 d piece.

15
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:18,780
This will be a thousand deep down and again will have a duration of 2000 OK.

16
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:19,410
Let's have a look.

17
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:24,070
So this will mean that probably off the screen in a downward direction.

18
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:30,490
Which is something you might want to do if you want to get rid of an element from the screen.

19
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:32,820
Here we go.

20
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:33,870
But.

21
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:40,130
And off he goes Oh not quite off the screen so you want to go further maybe 2000 pixels or maybe more.

22
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:44,590
If you want to make sure he's off the screen regardless of the pixel size.

23
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:52,040
So he's a quick challenge for you then can you change this so that instead of disappearing down he disappears

24
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,390
to the left and he goes completely off the screen.

25
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,380
Give it a go.

26
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,060
All right.

27
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,570
Hopefully you manage that.

28
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:03,820
It's pretty simple.

29
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:11,400
We use a translation ex-spy and we want to beat him to the left so that's minus a thousand.

30
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,710
The plus direction is to the right.

31
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,580
And I think a thousand will be enough.

32
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,710
You might want to put more there just to be sure.

33
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,860
Here we go.

34
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:25,730
And off he goes.

35
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,200
Fantastic.

36
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,500
So that's translations or movements.

37
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:33,700
Let's try a rotation.

38
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:41,660
So again we've got rotation and rotation by and rotation in the x and y directions as well.

39
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:46,430
So let's start off with just a simple rotation and then we get the number of degrees that we want to

40
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,520
rotate about.

41
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:54,830
So let's turn him upside down 360 degrees is a full circle so 180 is a half circle.

42
00:02:55,670 --> 00:03:00,540
And again we'll set the duration date a bit quicker this time.

43
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,040
So we'll do it in one second.

44
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:09,520
The lightning button to load that up super quick.

45
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,410
Zap him and there we go.

46
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:23,090
If you wanted him to spin around many times you could put a zero on the end of that and he'll now rotate

47
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:27,400
five times in the same one second.

48
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,470
So it'll get him spinning.

49
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:30,320
Very nice.

50
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,830
You could even combine the animations in any way you like.

51
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:45,890
So notice if after rotation we put say an alpha to zero we could fade him out and spin him at the same

52
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:46,660
time.

53
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,310
See that in action.

54
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:52,990
There we go.

55
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,070
And the funnel type I want to show you is a scale

56
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:08,700
and again we can scale to a specific value or by a specific value and we can do it in the x and y directions

57
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,510
as well.

58
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,760
So let's say we want to make it half size.

59
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,870
We scale x and 0.5 will scale y to no point five as well.

60
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:28,460
And then as usual set the duration to 1 second.

61
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,840
Now notice we've got a red squiggly line here.

62
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:37,950
That's because the scale x function just with all the animation functions that we've used expects a

63
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:45,300
float and by default if you use a decimal value it's a double and even though they're just different

64
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,800
types of numbers we do need to convert from one to the other.

65
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:54,920
So the scale x value accepts the correct type but there's a very easy way to do that.

66
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:59,830
If you want to convert a number to a float you just put an F after it.

67
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:05,570
So that wasn't necessary before because we had integer values whole numbers which didn't require the

68
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:05,950
math.

69
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:12,070
But when you've got decimals then you do need to convert it to a flat.

70
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:12,600
All right.

71
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,370
Let's take a look.

72
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,220
So that should shrink down.

73
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:21,170
To half size.

74
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,070
There we go.

75
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,530
So here's a quick challenge for you then.

76
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,640
What I'd like you to do is animate Bart into existence.

77
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,490
So we're going to start the app with a blank screen.

78
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:36,100
I want Bart to spin into action from the left.

79
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:41,560
So after the animation he should be full screen just like he was at the beginning of this app.

80
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,150
But I want him to come in from the left and spinning as soon as the app is opened.

81
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:47,620
All right.

82
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,730
A little challenge for you there.

83
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,350
Best of luck over.

84
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,080
OK type you managed it.

85
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:04,200
So the first thing that will need to change is the initial position of bot.

86
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:10,390
So the moment is of course position on the screen but we want him to be positioned to the left of the

87
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,130
screen.

88
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:12,740
Initially.

89
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:16,640
So let's change our constraint from 0 8.

90
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:36,030
To minus 1000.

91
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,730
All right.

92
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,680
How did you manage that.

93
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,150
As always lots of different ways to do it.

94
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:46,390
But you almost certainly had to write some code in the on method because we wanted this animation to

95
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,970
happen on the opening of the app.

96
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:53,390
So first off we want to move Bart off of the main screen.

97
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:58,540
So we can use our bot image.

98
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:08,190
So I just copy this down rather than type it again and then will animate him off the screen.

99
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:21,100
So we want to use a translation X by and or use the same minus a thousand as before.

100
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:26,350
If we wanted this to work on every device we might make that 2000 but a thousand will be fine for our

101
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,400
emulator.

102
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:35,350
Let's just have a quick check and make sure that makes Bart initially disappear.

103
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,030
And they would get.

104
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,080
So you can say no about that.

105
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:45,070
Just a quick note if you're a little uneasy about using animations here we're doing effectively an instant

106
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,700
animation because we're not setting a generation.

107
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:52,650
There is another way to do that which is perhaps more self-explanatory.

108
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:59,740
So we could just set the x coordinate for example to minus thousand and that would do effectively the

109
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,590
same thing but without an animation.

110
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:08,080
So I'm going to use set X but you can use the animate if you prefer that.

111
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,050
All right.

112
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:11,560
Now it's just a matter of bringing him in.

113
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:18,590
So let's use that image we might.

114
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:30,430
And then we want to translate by and we want 1000 pixels to the rights this time to bring him back in.

115
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:44,200
And we also want the rotation overtakes him ten times 3600 degrees in the space of two seconds.

116
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,380
All right.

117
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:46,680
So let's have a look.

118
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:51,120
We should now find that Bart spins in from the left.

119
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,560
There we go.

120
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:59,520
Excellent so you can use these animations either to make your apps more exciting or to add actual fluidity

121
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,900
and functionality to games in particular.

122
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:06,660
And that's what we're going to be doing in the next video where we'll be making our own version of Kinect

123
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,150
3.
