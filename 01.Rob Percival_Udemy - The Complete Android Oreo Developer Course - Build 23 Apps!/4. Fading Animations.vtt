00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.670
That we've mastered the building of layouts we're going to do some advance working with images which

2
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.120
will lead us to being able to create a reasonably complicated game.

3
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.510
Kinect 3 which will do in a couple of videos time.

4
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.610
For now though we're going to learn about fading animations.

5
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:23.680
So let's create a new project and we're going to do something fairly simple here.

6
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.850
We're going to create app with an image of Bart Simpson and when the image is tapped we're going to

7
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.940
morph him into Homer Simpson.

8
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.900
So let's just jump over to Wikipedia.

9
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.230
Which is where I'm going to get my images from.

10
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.520
Here we go.

11
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.560
So we're going to control click save image to download.

12
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:57.120
It's and it's nicely 200 pixels so that's a nice small size.

13
00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:09.430
And then we'll do the same for Hyma.

14
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.400
Just check that I downloaded that one.

15
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.400
Yep there we go.

16
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.750
So those are two images.

17
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.950
So let's start by bringing them into our app again.

18
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.410
On Windows you can just drag straight in.

19
00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:38.060
But on Mac I need to use command C to copy and then in the drawable folder command VI pastes them in.

20
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.540
There we get so now over an hour layout.

21
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.570
Let's create our image of.

22
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.450
I'll use the search to find it.

23
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.580
And I'll just get rid of the text for years we don't need that.

24
00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:04.550
And bring in how Image view which is initially going to have the image of Bart Simpson and we might

25
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:05.840
as well make this full screen

26
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.140
or to get to the edge

27
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.240
and then tighten constraints

28
00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.850
will have 0 everywhere.

29
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.940
There we go.

30
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:48.730
And at the same time I'll match that and I'll add the scale type to fit start.

31
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.930
Now you might be wondering how we're going to get the theta to happen when the image is tapped.

32
00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:01.760
Well if you view all attributes for the image view and scroll down to earth you'll see that we have

33
00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:10.040
an on click attribute meaning that we can treat an image much like a button and run a method when the

34
00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.730
button is clicked.

35
00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:19.510
So let's call the fade method which I'm about to write when BART is clicked OK.

36
00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.180
That'll do for a set up.

37
00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.140
I'll just run the app in the background while I'm writing some code.

38
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.990
That's been awhile since we've done this so hopefully still reasonably fresh in your mind.

39
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:43.870
Let's create a public method which doesn't return anything that's void.

40
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.170
It's called Fate.

41
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.930
It's still going to be called by a view just in this case the view is going to be an image view rather

42
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.730
than a button.

43
00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.020
And initially let's just do a quick log

44
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.800
to confirm

45
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:18.030
that the image view has been tapped and then run it again.

46
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:24.650
And you can see we've got an error here which is new to address GTA 3 that results names Maslany contain

47
00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.330
lower case letters numbers or underscores.

48
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.210
So that's definitely worth remembering.

49
00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:43.700
Let's quickly rename our files so we'll have Homer and bolt and them will copy those in

50
00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.110
in the usual way.

51
00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.980
Get rid of him.

52
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.470
But so I just control clicked there.

53
00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.270
All right click on Windows and delete

54
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.570
yet we know that it's in use.

55
00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:13.540
That's fine because we can go back to our image view and update

56
00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.920
the image

57
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:28.120
to our new bot.

58
00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:29.010
All right.

59
00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:35.280
So if you're coming from an earlier version of Android studio that doesn't have that file name restriction

60
00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:41.630
then just be aware that you're going to need to rename your files to only contain lower case letters

61
00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.870
numbers and underscores.

62
00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.240
And here we go.

63
00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:53.030
But let's tap him and have a quick look in the locks and they we get images apt.

64
00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.760
So everything is connected up nicely.

65
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.100
So let's see how we fade bought out.

66
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:10.340
So as you might guess we initially have to get the image we will do that by creating a variable called

67
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.160
Image we only have one image.

68
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:25.110
So just calling it image view is fine and we'll get it using find VBIED resources to ID dot image we

69
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.870
need to cast that to an image.

70
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:38.530
And then initially we'll just do a simple fade out and we do that using image view.

71
00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:47.250
Dalt animate that's what we're going to be using for all of our animations and we're going to animate.

72
00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:52.150
You can see a lot of different options for animating here scaling.

73
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:56.560
Translating that's moving or rotating.

74
00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:01.960
But we're going to animate the alpha which if you remember from a couple of sections back decides how

75
00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.150
solid the picture appears.

76
00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.760
So if we animate the Alpha to 0

77
00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.900
then that will faded out completely.

78
00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:16.640
We want that to happen over a certain period of time.

79
00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.050
So we'll set the Joorabchian.

80
00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:21.360
And this is a number of milliseconds.

81
00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:23.680
Let's do it every two seconds.

82
00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.650
So that's two thousand milliseconds.

83
00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:28.330
All right.

84
00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:29.490
Let's have a look.

85
00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.390
I'm going to use the lightning button this time which

86
00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:38.570
reloads as quickly as possible.

87
00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:43.040
Just made simple changes to your code so you can try using that.

88
00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.600
And then if we tap you can see there we go.

89
00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:47.100
Magically disappears.

90
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:48.120
Fantastic.

91
00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:52.580
So you can experiment a little bit without changing the alpha value and the duration to see how that

92
00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:54.380
affects the animation.

93
00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:59.150
But we're going to move straight to animating from one to the other.

94
00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:04.370
So from Bart to Houma several different ways you can do this but the simplest is to bring in a second

95
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.010
image view.

96
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:12.020
In fact rather than drag it in which we could do we will do that using

97
00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.940
the text view and then just copying and pasting

98
00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:23.880
the image view Kate.

99
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:26.880
Of course we'll need to have different IDs

100
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.750
call them Bart imagery and home imagery.

101
00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:41.100
And then we can change the SLC.

102
00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:46.420
That is the source of the pain the image the Tahoma.

103
00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:54.030
But we want to set the Alpha for the homer image be to zero.

104
00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.950
So it's not visible initially.

105
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:10.800
So now we need to change this to Bart image v.

106
00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:18.460
And I'll change here as well.

107
00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:26.680
And we need to bring in home imagery.

108
00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:30.330
So let's create I never image v.

109
00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:35.970
just the same as before.

110
00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:45.570
Find VBI ID order ID Ducs.

111
00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:56.040
And then you can probably imagine what we're going to do hits a fade in the home or imagery we'll use

112
00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:04.980
Hyma imagery dot animate and this time we want to change the Alpha to 1 and we'll do it over the same

113
00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:05.980
duration.

114
00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:12.490
Two seconds.

115
00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:13.770
All right.

116
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:19.680
That makes sense so with fading out the BART image view and with fading in the home imagery.

117
00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:21.460
Let's take a look.

118
00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:26.130
All right so let's tap on BART and there we go.

119
00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:26.990
Wonderful.

120
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:27.940
So you've got the idea.

121
00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.920
A little challenge for you then to finish this off.

122
00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:34.650
You make it so that when we tap on Homer It goes back to Bart.

123
00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:40.590
So instead of just fading from Bart to Herma it goes back from back to time at about Hyma every time

124
00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:42.830
you tap lots of different ways you can do that.

125
00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:44.600
So try to be creative.

126
00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:48.210
I'll show you my solution when you've had a guy best of luck.

127
00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:48.950
Go for it.

128
00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:57.740
So I hope you manage that.

129
00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:05.040
As I said lots of different ways to do it but I'm going to do it using a boolean flag to track which

130
00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:08.920
image is displayed at any given time.

131
00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:17.440
So let's set up a boolean and I'll call it Bart is showing.

132
00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:23.020
And initially that's going to be equal to true.

133
00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:34.780
So then once we've got the two imageries we want to check to see if Bart is showing.

134
00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:42.510
Then we fade out and fade in Houma else.

135
00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:43.680
We're going to do the opposite

136
00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:58.130
fade in Bart fade out Hyma of course we need to update the BART is showing billion each time.

137
00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:03.680
So if Bart is showing We now want to change Barty's sharing to folks because we faded out

138
00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:09.090
otherwise we find him back in.

139
00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:16.850
So it will set Bartie showing back to true notice I've created the variable up here so it will be remembered

140
00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:18.100
as long as the app is open.

141
00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:25.040
If you create it in the fade method it will be forgotten when the method ends up being no good for keeping

142
00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:28.520
track of which image is being displayed.

143
00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.910
All right let's take a look see if it works.

144
00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.620
So here we go.

145
00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:43.160
Tapping on BART morphs into Houma tapping on Hyma moves us back into about Exham.

146
00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:45.500
So whether you did that or used a different method.

147
00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:50.760
Well the next video we're now going to take this further and extend into all sorts of other different

148
00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:52.860
types of animations.
