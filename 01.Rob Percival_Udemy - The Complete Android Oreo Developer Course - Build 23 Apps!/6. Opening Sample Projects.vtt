Just before we move on to editing our app and changing the way it looks and behaves Quickly we want

2
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.970
to show you how to open up these sample projects that come with of course after each video you'll see

3
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.230
that there's a sample project that you can download to view the actual content created in that video.

4
00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:15.900
A lot of people ask how to open those.

5
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.780
I want to show you two ways to do it now.

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.340
So one option and the one I'd recommend is let's just close our project here and open up Android studio

7
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:35.460
to see the welcome screen and then just select open an existing Android studio project and then open

8
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.760
the folder that you downloaded the project to hopefully have unzipped it and you should see the project

9
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.240
there.

10
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:50.390
Example app and then open it will load the app from the file contents.

11
00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:57.420
But another way of doing it lets just close that down again is to navigate to the folder itself.

12
00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.810
And this is where people sometimes get a bit confused because it's not obvious which file you actually

13
00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.110
click on to load the project into Android studio.

14
00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.540
The answer is you double click the build dock cradle file and then if that's the first time you've done

15
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:17.560
it you'll need to choose Android studio as the application to associate cradle files with.

16
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.950
I just find it in your applications.

17
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.910
There it is.

18
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.830
Click open and as usual I'd stick to the defaults.

19
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:37.530
You can overwrite any files and then open existing projects.

20
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:40.450
There we go.

21
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:41.750
So those are the two ways to do it.

22
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.450
I'd recommend using file open either within Android studio itself or on the Welcome Screen.

23
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.220
We want to do it directly you just double click the build cradle file.

24
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.070
All right.

25
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.680
Enough of this let's get started building and editing apps.
