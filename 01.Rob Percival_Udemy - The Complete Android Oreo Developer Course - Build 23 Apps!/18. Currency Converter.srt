00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:10,180
Congratulations on making it to the last video in this section of the complete Android Developer course

2
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:14,980
and now going to put together everything that we've learned so the out and behavior of Android studio

3
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:19,140
adding images buttons text fields and text views.

4
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:27,110
And of course writing Java code make our apps interactive and we're going to do that by making a currency

5
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:30,170
converter app so the app on the surface is pretty simple.

6
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:35,500
It converts from pounds to dollars which at the time of recording this video is about 1.3.

7
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:45,100
And if I put in say 15 pounds and top convert it tells me that 15 pounds is about $19 50.

8
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,240
So that's all the app does.

9
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,990
Mostly it's a good opportunity for you to practice the app layout.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,200
I'm writing a bit of simple java but it's also a bit more than that because you'll learn a little bit

11
00:00:54,200 --> 00:01:02,270
about variable types if you try and take the value of the text field and then multiply it by 1.3 to

12
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,190
convert it to dollars.

13
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:09,350
You'll find you get an error because this is a string and you need to convert it to a number type what's

14
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:17,190
known as a double in order to convert it in order to multiply by 1.3 to get it to please.

15
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:23,090
So you'll need to write some code to convert the string to a double then multiply it by 1.3 to get the

16
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:29,900
dollar amount and then convert it back to a string to be able to display it in the toast.

17
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:34,700
And unless you already know Java reasonably well expect you'll need to do a little bit of googling to

18
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,500
figure that out.

19
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,000
So I think you should be able to manage that.

20
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:41,090
But if not don't worry at all I will of course go through the whole process in this video and you're

21
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:42,400
very welcome to follow along.

22
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:45,460
If you'd rather do that I would recommend giving it a shot by yourself.

23
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:48,590
So now's the time to pause the video and give it a go.

24
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,540
Best of luck.

25
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:57,770
All right.

26
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,080
Hey that one for you.

27
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,870
Let's give it a go.

28
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:05,350
So file new project with very used to this now.

29
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:15,510
Currency converter for the application name everything else keeps the defaults.

30
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,000
Well that's lighting up.

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,780
I'm going to jump back over to Google images to borrow a nice image for

32
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:35,570
as always need to be very careful of the copyright images you're actually distributing.

33
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,540
But for our purposes

34
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:44,690
we'll just use one that looks nice for our practice app.

35
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,980
That's not a problem.

36
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:52,010
OK so I'll start by bringing in that image

37
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:59,180
to find.

38
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:08,300
Can get a name or an extension.

39
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,440
I've just had it one on.

40
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,820
That seems to have worked fine.

41
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,520
Slightly strange but there we go.

42
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:20,690
Come on C to copy the image and then command V to paste it.

43
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,180
And when dies you can just drag it straight in.

44
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:31,730
OK let's design up to get rid of hello world

45
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:40,080
and we'll start off with our image.

46
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,220
With currency image.

47
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:57,800
And because of the nature of the image we can try a different scale type

48
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:07,610
and I'm going to go for a fit x y which will just stretch it out to the width of the device.

49
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,720
Of course if you prefer you can use the more usual fit center or something like that.

50
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:14,720
OK.

51
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:24,650
And then we're going to constrain it to be linked to the left right and top of our screens.

52
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:30,220
And next we'll add our text.

53
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,730
And we'll change the text to enter

54
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:50,130
the amount you want to can that

55
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:57,780
there we go next we'll have

56
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:07,300
plain text you can see we can select a number type

57
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:16,520
which will give us the number keyboard and I'll go for decimal so that you can enter three point to

58
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:24,920
one if they want to and that ahint amount in pounds

59
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:34,720
and then at a button.

60
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,520
Center at

61
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,590
the button will say

62
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:44,790
convert

63
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,480
that we get.

64
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:54,020
Let's just add some constraints in four elements here.

65
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:59,980
So I don't need to worry about the width or height of that one but I'll just constrain it to the left

66
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:08,830
and to the top for the text field I'll make this one more or less full width

67
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:21,850
and let's just change those constraints to make it equal on both sides 16 and 16.

68
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,580
Lovely.

69
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,470
And finally the convert button

70
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:35,910
will add top and left and right constraints to keep it centered.

71
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,410
Excellent.

72
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,070
So are you.

73
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,280
As we've done before.

74
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm just going to run the app on our device while I jump over to write some code and it's the code that

75
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,170
we use now.

76
00:06:52,650 --> 00:07:02,370
So we're going to create a public method which doesn't return anything that's void I'll call it convert

77
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,860
currency.

78
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:14,580
As usual it's going to take a variable of type a few that will call you that in the view class with

79
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,780
old enter and then find out

80
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,650
which just logged in five

81
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:25,710
and

82
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,190
button pressed

83
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,070
OK let's have a quick look.

84
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,300
Something has gone wrong that I think I've forgotten the top

85
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,520
that we got.

86
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:54,740
Yep the top constraint on the textfield that's from that again.

87
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,340
OK.

88
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,640
Looks much better.

89
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,730
And that's type convert.

90
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,810
Have a look in the Lokes

91
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,650
don't see anything that's try that again.

92
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,330
What mistake if I made.

93
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:24,070
Hopefully you notice that as I was getting along I didn't at the on click method.

94
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,870
There we go.

95
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,250
That's the downside of writing the method first.

96
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,760
Sometimes you forget to add the on click method.

97
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:39,390
But that's why it's a good idea to check the app in its very basic form.

98
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:44,320
Before you write any complex code because at least I knew that it must have been an obvious problem

99
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,460
there rather than an issue with my code.

100
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:56,470
All right so now it's time to get the value that the user has entered in the edit text ready to convert

101
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:06,580
it from pounds to dollars so that you should be fairly comfortable with going to create an edit text

102
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:28,820
which will get from find view by id product ID edit text and only to convert that to an edit text and

103
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,980
then briefly let's just log that value

104
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,630
say some more and find

105
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:51,770
and then the value that we want is edit text not get text dot to string OK.

106
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:58,660
So let's just check that that's working and then we can do the that we'll need to look up online which

107
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:04,380
is converting that to a number so that we can convert it to a dollar amount.

108
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,100
OK let's take a look.

109
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:10,360
So let's say that we want to convert 23 pounds.

110
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,130
There we go.

111
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:11,980
OK.

112
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,490
So we've got the number.

113
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,920
And as I mentioned we're going to multiply that by 1.3.

114
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:26,930
So the first thing we're going to need to do is to get this value as a variable.

115
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:37,740
So we'll create a string variable with a capital S for string and I'll call it amount in pounds and

116
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:48,930
that's going to be equal to the added text value added text don't get text start to string.

117
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:58,120
Now what we'd like to be able to say is create another variable called amount in dollars which is equal

118
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,360
to the amount in pounds multiplied by.

119
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:07,350
And if you've used something like Excel before you'll be familiar with using an asterisk for multiply

120
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,940
and then 1.3.

121
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:19,610
But as you can see that gives us an error so we can't apply that to the string variable type.

122
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:22,320
We need to use a double.

123
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:23,580
OK.

124
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:38,920
So I have to Google again Java Android and will search for convert string to double and let's have a

125
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,310
look.

126
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:42,060
OK.

127
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:46,940
I think the Google answer looks like it's what we need.

128
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:53,790
So we create a double which is double with a capital D pass double and then the string.

129
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,080
OK.

130
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:56,810
That looks like what we need.

131
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,560
So let's take a look said double creates a double variable instead of a d.

132
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,580
We'll use something that makes a bit more sense.

133
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:18,780
So this is going to be amount in pounds but as a double but it's a nice bit of spacing.

134
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,830
And then we want double dot pass double.

135
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:30,860
But the thing we want to pass as a double is amount in pounds so we've converted amount in pounds which

136
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:35,580
is a string to the same value but as a double.

137
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:39,860
And now we should be able to create another double

138
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:45,260
code amount in dollars.

139
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:53,140
Double But of course instead of amount in pounds which is a string we're going to use amount in pounds

140
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:57,450
double and multiply that by 1.3.

141
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:02,820
And now we're going to want to initially log that and then we'll put it in a toast.

142
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:07,930
So we're going to need to convert that back to a string that's used that opportunity to do another quick

143
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,520
search.

144
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:14,830
So Java Android double to string.

145
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,140
How do we go the other way.

146
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,170
Looks like there might be several ways to do it.

147
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,990
That is often the case.

148
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:36,140
So here it looks like we can just use double dot to string and then our number which actually is extremely

149
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:42,380
similar to this are used double dot pass double to convert a string into a double.

150
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:46,910
And then when you double dot to string to convert it back to a string.

151
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:53,430
So let's create a string amount in dollars

152
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:02,280
string and using the code that we just looked at we want to use doubled up to string

153
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:12,240
and then out in Dolan's double.

154
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:15,240
And then let's have a look.

155
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,960
We should just be able to put this straight in amount in dollars string.

156
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,760
And just to make it clear.

157
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,790
I change the tag to amount in dollars.

158
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:29,790
All right.

159
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:37,080
That makes sense if not might be worth just re watching the last five minutes or so just to get clear

160
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,620
on the process of what problem we needed to solve and how we went about doing that.

161
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,230
Using Google to find some carry for us.

162
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:48,730
OK.

163
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:58,220
So let's say we want 10 pounds amount mountain dollars 13 fantastic.

164
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,850
Just try slightly now CNN but

165
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:06,130
ok.

166
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:08,540
There we go.

167
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:11,020
Now we've got a very very accurate number them.

168
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,280
I'm going to be a little bit fuzzy about this.

169
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:18,230
If we can convert it to two decimal places as currency usually is.

170
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:28,890
So again Android Java convert double to two decimal places.

171
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:39,850
We hope you're getting the idea of how we can quite easily solve a lot of problems with a quick google.

172
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:45,020
Now it looks like using one of the other ways to convert to a string.

173
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:49,730
It will convert it to two decimal places.

174
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:58,340
So let's change now converting it to a string code to this one.

175
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:07,260
But of course instead of D we'll use amount in dollars double.

176
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,020
So let's have a quick look.

177
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:09,980
Make sure that works.

178
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:19,410
And then if it does the anything we've got left today is to write the code for our toast.

179
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:30,890
I say it's go for a nasty amount of pounds and then we get a nicely rounded to two decimal places.

180
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:31,870
Fantastic.

181
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:44,520
So let's change our look command to a toast and use the down hour to automatically create the code for

182
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,200
us.

183
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:54,340
So the text is going to be a little bit complicated because we want to show the initial amount and they

184
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,880
convert the amount.

185
00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:07,110
So we'll start with a pound sign and then we'll combine that with the original amount amount in pounds

186
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,700
and then we want to say that that is

187
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,930
and then our dollar sign for dollars.

188
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:22,590
And finally we'll share the amount in dollars.

189
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:31,680
And we'll give them a bit more time to register the answer.

190
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:33,020
All right.

191
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,450
Here we go.

192
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:44,060
So if everything has gone well this should give us the final result that we're after.

193
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:56,200
So we want three pounds twenty three pounds twenty four dollars 16 which seems about right to me.

194
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:01,630
And forgive 20 pounds 26.

195
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,590
Fantastic.

196
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:08,000
So that brings us to the end of the first section and hopefully you now feel reasonably comfortable

197
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,420
with Android studio how it all fits together how you create a simple layout for your app how you integrate

198
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:17,270
code and the content of the app.

199
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:22,010
And you've written a little bit of Java and hopefully done a bit of googling to figure out the solution

200
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:25,100
to problems that you hadn't seen the answer for.

201
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,230
So that's quite a lot.

202
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,610
Congratulate yourself on getting this far.

203
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:33,770
Of course we are only just at the beginning and in the next section we'll be really focusing on Java

204
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:38,690
and writing code which will stand us in good stead for creating any type of app we want.

205
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,690
So go get yourself a congratulatory cup of tea maybe even a biscuit and I'll see you in the next section.

206
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,210
Our Java deep dive.
