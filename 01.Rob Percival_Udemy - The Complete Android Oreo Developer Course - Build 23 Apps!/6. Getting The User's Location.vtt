00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.370
All right in this lecture we're going to focus on how we can find the users location so we're not really

2
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.320
concerned about the map stuff about displaying where the current user is it's more about we just want

3
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.950
to find out their latitude and longitude be able to track movements there.

4
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.040
How do we get the permissions for that to happen.

5
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.440
There's a whole sort of process that we've got to follow for this.

6
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.890
So let's go ahead and start a new Android studio project.

7
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.710
We're going to go ahead and call this location demo and we'll just do our defaults.

8
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.870
We want the blank activity again we don't need to work with the map stuff on this one so we'll go ahead

9
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.690
and move forward here.

10
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.430
So like I said the very first thing that we want to move forward with before we do anything is that

11
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.560
we've got to get permission from the user in order to access their location right which makes sense.

12
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.970
It kind of creepy if and abstracting your location and you had no idea about it like you want to be

13
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.370
able to give that app that permission.

14
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.830
And it's the exact same process about when we asked the user if we can use their internet connection

15
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.500
that's inside that Android manifest where we go ahead and ask for that piece of information.

16
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.530
So what we're going to do.

17
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.890
So open up our app here and double click on our manifest and just like we do up at the top here.

18
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:19.410
We're going to go ahead and do our angle bracket here we'll give Android studio a second I'm trying

19
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.290
to get going right off the go.

20
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.600
But it's you know just finished putting all this stuff together for us.

21
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.370
Let's see.

22
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.310
Come here and wait a second.

23
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.700
There we go.

24
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.910
So we are looking for a use's permission.

25
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:35.820
There we go.

26
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.960
And when we do this are all sorts of options here.

27
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.830
And the one that we're looking for is access fine control.

28
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.760
Now there is of course control the difference between the two is fine it's like really specifically

29
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.190
looking for where the devices like it really utilizes the GPS.

30
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:58.620
Whereas the course more just sort of uses Wi-Fi and you know the network pinpointing of stuff.

31
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.000
So if you don't need as precise a stuff you can probably roll with course but if you really need to

32
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.730
know for most I think mapping applications you're going to want to use a fine location.

33
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:15.030
But again that's up to you and you want to be conscious of how much battery you're using on the user's

34
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:21.780
device so will use find location it will end up that tag right there so that's everything we need to

35
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.600
do to get the user's permission.

36
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.870
Then let's go ahead and move into our main activity and we're going to start writing some code in order

37
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.790
to get the users location.

38
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.380
So if you've ever worked with iOS before you'll see that the situation is pretty similar.

39
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.080
Basically we create something called a location manager that manages all our location tracking and then

40
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.450
we have this location listener that gives us updates about whenever the user says yes or no to things

41
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.610
or if they're going to you know whenever the device moves it sort of gives an update there we're going

42
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.220
to create all those.

43
00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.650
So the first one that we need is a location manager and we're just going to go ahead and call that location

44
00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:10.090
manager and we'll set this equal to this get system service OK.

45
00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:18.010
And then inside of here we're going to say capital context dot and we want to get location service.

46
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:25.020
OK so this tells us hey we want to create this location manager that's going to you know get the users

47
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.850
location.

48
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:33.740
And with this we need to go ahead and actually cast this to say this should be a location manager.

49
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:34.010
All right.

50
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.050
Then will get rid of our first air there for us.

51
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.670
We're going to have more in a second here.

52
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.940
But just give this a moment.

53
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:48.570
The next thing that we want to do is we want to create our location listener so we want location listener.

54
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:59.540
Let me go ahead and enter so we get that import we'll say location listener is equal to a new location

55
00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:06.080
listener and you can see when we do the autocomplete for that pool it brings up a lot of stuff so there's

56
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.260
a couple of different functions here.

57
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:14.130
The big one that you want to focus on is this location change so this is when you know all of a sudden

58
00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:20.730
we get you know the device move this much further that much further or just regular updates from the

59
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.440
GPS telling us hey things have changed here.

60
00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:29.190
You should know about it this on status change us is telling us hey you know the user either said yes

61
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.030
to working with this.

62
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.480
They said no to working with IT stuff like that.

63
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.680
It's kind of the big stuff they're saying hey whether or not this is all working.

64
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:43.590
So on location change we want to know whether or not we are able to get the user's location here.

65
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.990
And so let's just go ahead and log out this information.

66
00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:55.680
So I will say log I and let's just say this is going to be location and then for our second parameter

67
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.570
here we're going to take the location that we get right there.

68
00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.150
We can actually turn that into a string if we do dot to string.

69
00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.940
OK.

70
00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.320
So that will be something readable that we can actually go ahead and check out.

71
00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:13.700
Now in order for us to get any of this information I know that we have a location manager I know that

72
00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:18.950
we have a location listener and I know that we in the manifest said hey we need the user's permission

73
00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:23.490
but we actually have to write the code to ask for permission from the user.

74
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:27.410
So in order to get this we're going to go outside of this location listener.

75
00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.970
So we want to and don't forget we need a semi-colon there.

76
00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:38.000
But we want to go outside of this location listener so down below here we're going to do a big IF statement

77
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.590
where we can check and see if the user has granted us permission.

78
00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:48.080
So what we're going to do is we're going to first reference context.

79
00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:57.000
Contex compact dot and we want check self permission.

80
00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.680
And in this there's a couple of things that we want to provide.

81
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:06.280
So first this is going to be the context that it needs the next piece of information it needs is asking

82
00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:13.030
you know what sort of permission it is that we're looking for so we're going to say here manifest permission

83
00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:20.370
and this is where we want to say access capital access fine location.

84
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:25.510
Remember when we were choosing between fine location and course location that's what that's all about

85
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:26.420
there.

86
00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.140
So that's closed up in that parentheses.

87
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:42.530
And we want to know if this is not equal to capital package manager dot in all capitals.

88
00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.000
Permission granted.

89
00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:49.740
So what we're checking for here is before we ask for permission we're saying hey did they give us permission

90
00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:55.020
to access the find location or we're saying if they didn't give us this permission this is where we

91
00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.900
would want to move forward and ask for that.

92
00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:03.190
So the code that we would run is activity compact.

93
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.540
I guess I should just type that out and here we go.

94
00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.190
Activity.

95
00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:10.200
Compact.

96
00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:11.000
OK.

97
00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:12.850
And we're going to say Dot.

98
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:19.900
Request permission permissions within us and we'll say this for the context.

99
00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:24.870
The next thing is we need to provide that we're looking for the access of foreign control.

100
00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:31.110
So we're actually going to create a little string array thing here we're going to see a new capital

101
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:32.120
string array.

102
00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:37.930
And then in here right afterwards we are going to provide some curly brackets.

103
00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:49.340
We are going to say inside we go inside these curly brackets manifest permission.

104
00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:53.570
And there's that same access fine location.

105
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:58.760
So we're asking for that and after we've done that so after that ending curly bracket we're going to

106
00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.470
go ahead and provide the number one.

107
00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:02.780
Now you might be wondering well what is this number about.

108
00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:08.690
Well when we go in ahead and ask for this you can keep these numbers to keep track of you know which

109
00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:13.580
they call them request codes you were looking for but we don't really care only asking for one permission

110
00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:16.140
here soldiers kind of keep that as is.

111
00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.340
So let's go ahead and test and see if this works.

112
00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:24.000
When the app opens up please don't automatically say yes to granting the permission.

113
00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:28.820
We just want to check and see if our message is even showing up here right.

114
00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:34.580
So because we don't have anything right now that we you know basically we create the location manager

115
00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:37.040
and listener but we never activate them.

116
00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:45.320
We just want to make sure that we can at least get the message that says hey you know here is the question

117
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:48.350
asking you if we can use your location.

118
00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:53.230
So go ahead and wait by the emulator here just for a second.

119
00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:57.760
Looks like it's taking a little bit of time here.

120
00:08:58.960 --> 00:08:59.640
But look at that.

121
00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:06.610
It finished up so up it pops and you'll see when the app opens up it's asking allow location to access

122
00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:08.050
this device location.

123
00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:12.930
So it's got that option there for us and it could be really tempting to go say allow or deny but there's

124
00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:16.630
a little bit more code that we want to right for this.

125
00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:19.900
So what we're going to do is we're going to move up top.

126
00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:25.980
And there's a particular method that we want to implement that tells us when someone is requesting permission

127
00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:28.930
and they've either said yes or no to that question.

128
00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:34.300
So if you just start typing on request permission result.

129
00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:34.880
There we go.

130
00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:38.490
If you hit enter on that it's going to implement a ton of stuff here.

131
00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:44.770
Kind of get you the basics of what you need but and this tells us whether or not the user said yes or

132
00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:47.030
no to granting their permission.

133
00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:50.450
So the first thing that we want to do is check and see if we got permission.

134
00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:53.400
So the way that we can do this is we're going to make an if statement.

135
00:09:53.860 --> 00:10:00.940
And in this if statement the first thing that we're going to ask is OK if the grant results so we'll

136
00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:02.490
go ahead and say Grant results.

137
00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:10.120
And this has passed in over here so I can say if Grignon results length is greater than zero that's

138
00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.770
the first check that we want to do and then we're going to say.

139
00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:19.480
And by doing two ampler stamps so we want that to be true and we want to say Grant results access the

140
00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.100
first item in that array.

141
00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:25.990
So we checked this first to make sure there was at least something in there so say and if there is something

142
00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:33.250
we'll go ahead look at the first option and see if this is equal to we need to equal signs package manager

143
00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:41.390
dot and this is where we want the Capitol permission granted so this will tell us yes or no whether

144
00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:43.340
or not they said yes to us.

145
00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:48.730
So if this is the case we want to start working with the location manager and the listener.

146
00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:54.380
So I'm actually going to copy these two things and add them as properties up to the top there or define

147
00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:55.390
them there.

148
00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:58.650
So we've got location manager and listener.

149
00:10:58.650 --> 00:10:59.280
All right.

150
00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:04.730
And then we'll update this on create so that we're not redefining there.

151
00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:09.410
Let's go ahead and update that.

152
00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:14.400
So with those in place now we can write this cool line of code where we say OK.

153
00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:17.430
Location Manager.

154
00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:22.910
Remember everything sort of moves through the manager We're going to say location manager dot and we're

155
00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:27.620
going to ask for location update saying Hey any time you move update whatever we want to know about

156
00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:28.070
it.

157
00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:31.910
So we're going to say request location updates.

158
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:32.300
All right.

159
00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.360
And there's a couple of things that we've got to pass in here.

160
00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:40.700
So the first thing that we need to do is say that we are looking for information from the GPS GPS so

161
00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:46.780
we're going to say location manager and this is Capitol location manager dot and there's a couple of

162
00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:47.230
options here.

163
00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.000
But we want GPS provider.

164
00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:50.940
So we'll go ahead and select that one.

165
00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:56.070
The next thing that it's looking for is you know how much you want to be updated about things.

166
00:11:56.070 --> 00:12:00.920
So in our case we're going to put zero for the time and if you comma comments also going to ask for

167
00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:05.450
the distance we're going to put zero there and that's basically saying hey you know we could just update

168
00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:11.750
your information every couple of seconds or maybe every minute or whatever it is and or you know only

169
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:13.970
update when the user moves more than like 10 meters.

170
00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:18.170
And again these are measures that we can use to save the user some battery life.

171
00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:21.290
But in this case we're just trying to figure out this location thing.

172
00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:26.690
So we want to use zero minutes zero meters meaning that we just want all the information give us any

173
00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:30.750
sort of update that you have about the user's location.

174
00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:36.740
Then after that you can see it's looking for a location listener which we have already created.

175
00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:40.560
So we're just going to go ahead and pass and our location Lessner.

176
00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:41.930
All right.

177
00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:43.550
So that's all the code that we need.

178
00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:49.640
Except you'll see that we get this big nasty air here and it is asking us hey you've got to do one more

179
00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:52.200
check to make sure that this is actually OK.

180
00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:56.630
So we can actually just go ahead and do the check that we do down here.

181
00:12:56.630 --> 00:13:01.200
This big statement that we make sure that we have access to do this.

182
00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:08.840
So I'll just go ahead and copy the top part of this statement including that curly bracket and we'll

183
00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:10.550
just paste it above here.

184
00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:16.700
We'll do an ending curly bracket down below so that that sort of wraps everything up and the big thing

185
00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:22.700
that we want to check here is that this is equal to Permission granted because down here we're saying

186
00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:26.920
hey if the permission hasn't been granted then we want to go request it.

187
00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:33.440
Whereas in this situation we're saying OK if we did get permission granted then we want to go ahead

188
00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:39.070
and do this so I know a little bit crazy that we have to provide this question twice.

189
00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:46.310
And I just realized I've put this statement in the wrong location so I'm going to go ahead and copy

190
00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:48.990
this and cut it.

191
00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:55.460
And we're going to put it the first thing that we want to check for is that top level if statement here

192
00:13:55.460 --> 00:14:00.530
right where we check to see if the length is greater than zero and all that stuff and then we'll do

193
00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:01.370
this one.

194
00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:07.210
So with those things in place let's go ahead and check out our app.

195
00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:11.360
So we'll go ahead and hit the run button here on the simulator.

196
00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:15.500
And we'll see what it is that we get.

197
00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:22.680
Let me go ahead and open up our device so we're going to say allow to this

198
00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:33.410
so and I'm not exactly sure where the app went let's try this one more time.

199
00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.580
Can app opens up.

200
00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:47.760
And if we go ahead and check our logs hopefully we have a location here and Denton and a

201
00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:57.560
I'm looking for a location but I never saw one and that could have been because before we hit OK there

202
00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:02.630
we had entered in that we had already wanted to give permission.

203
00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:08.610
So I kind of ruined that special moment because this was supposed to show you how all of that worked.

204
00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:15.620
But I'm going to show you how we can fix this because right now we're only asking for the users location

205
00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:21.050
updates which is really that tells us when we get the information we're only asking for that when the

206
00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:27.200
user says yes to it so if the users already said yes this method never gets called and so in that case

207
00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:34.670
we'd want to do an else statement here that basically says hey if the user has already given us permission

208
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:39.190
then it's appropriate for you to go ahead and ask for some updates.

209
00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:42.930
So let's go ahead and scroll up here.

210
00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:49.460
We're just going to copy this line exactly where we basically say hey go ahead and give us the update

211
00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:52.870
so we'll copy this paste it down below.

212
00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:56.590
And now let's try running this in our app.

213
00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:00.110
Make sure we got latet up and running here so we can see this.

214
00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:04.730
And I do all that work to tell you not to touch the thing and then I go ahead and touch it at the wrong

215
00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:05.060
time.

216
00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:07.040
I feel foolish about that.

217
00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:08.830
But here we go.

218
00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:13.610
Now you might be a little bit disappointed saying we didn't get the location showing up here what the

219
00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:14.530
heck's going on with that.

220
00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:20.060
Well with the emulator we have to sort of manually give some of the location stuff so to the right of

221
00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:24.770
the emulator if you hit this little dot it shows you some of the controls that you can affect and if

222
00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:30.370
you click on location here you can actually provide a latitude and longitude So I think this right now

223
00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:31.670
centered on San Francisco.

224
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:34.200
So if we hit send here look at that.

225
00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:38.600
It prints out the location which means that we got to this point in our code right.

226
00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:44.120
Like we were able to log this information and that's pretty cool that you know we can put in any sort

227
00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:49.460
of latitude and longitude that we want like I could send this for example and boom all of sudden that

228
00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:52.340
comes through 54 64.

229
00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:54.360
So there you have it.

230
00:16:54.380 --> 00:17:01.070
Like I said not super exciting because you know we're not we don't have this on a map or anything but

231
00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:04.610
that's what we're going to be covering in our next lecture and it's going to be a cool challenge for

232
00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:05.960
you because you've learned a lot of stuff.

233
00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:11.190
It's now time to sort of bring it all together so let's go ahead and talk about it in the next lecture.
