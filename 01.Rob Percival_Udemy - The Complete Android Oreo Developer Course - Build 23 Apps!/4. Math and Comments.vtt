00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.740
In this lecture we're going to be talking about math and comments in cotland and let's go ahead and

2
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.260
start by talking about comments so comments are pretty straightforward let me go ahead and clear up

3
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.990
our last example so we have some space to work to create a comment in Coplan.

4
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.000
Caitlin It's pretty straightforward.

5
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.040
All we have to do is do two forward slashes and then type whatever you want.

6
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.630
That's it.

7
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.150
That's how you make a single line comment and cut that.

8
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.150
Now if you want to do a multi-line comment you do the forward slash star and then sometime down below

9
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.330
and look intelligent.

10
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:32.150
I already did it for me.

11
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.040
You just need the star in the slash below.

12
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.670
And then you can type whatever you want and take up as much spaces as you need.

13
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:39.420
OK.

14
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.070
So because you know what comments are I'm not going to type any further into that.

15
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.640
That's all you need to know.

16
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.360
All right so let's move forward to talk about math in cotland.

17
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.950
And it's pretty straightforward.

18
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.150
So we're going to introduce a new type you which is the double.

19
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.430
So if you create a variable and let's say I'm going to have my weight be represented as a double I'M

20
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.910
LIKE A hundred eighty eight point six pounds or something like that.

21
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.630
If you have anything with a decimal cotland defaults to be a double.

22
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.560
So if we were going to specify the type here we can go like this and say hey this thing is a double

23
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:21.190
If there's also lots of other math types like there's a float and I think there is large and small numbers

24
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.510
but I mean double and those are the basic ones that you need maybe you'll need a float but we usually

25
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:33.030
default by double In fact you'll see when it's trying to you know set the sequel to here it's going

26
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.530
to say hey you know that's not valid.

27
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.250
We want this by default to be a double.

28
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.330
So that's how you create a double if you want to do math with doubles and it's that's totally fine.

29
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.230
Let's do a quick example to find the circumference of a circle.

30
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:56.880
So if I say for example var radius is going to be equal to something like 6 or up and then I'm going

31
00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.250
to make a variable to represent pi.

32
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.850
So pi is equal to three point 1 4 4 1 to find the circumference of this I've got to do pi times are

33
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:06.540
times 2.

34
00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:18.240
So say VRC shore for circumferences is going to be equal to radius times pi also times 2 and you'll

35
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.570
see by doing this if I print out whatever is inside of C..

36
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.770
Let's go ahead and run this code.

37
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.260
Do you like that it turns it into a double so and smart enough to do any sort of conversion.

38
00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:41.020
Right like if you've got we have a mix of ints and doubles here in cotland just said you know we're

39
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.690
turning all these into doubles.

40
00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.240
Now if you wanted to for example you wanted the circumference to be represented by an ant.

41
00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.760
You do have to do a little bit of work here because it's saying OK radiuses and then two is and then

42
00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.980
but pi is not on PI.

43
00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.070
You'd have to say Dot 2 and you can turn into all sorts of different types here.

44
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.240
In fact there are some of the other math ones right the long the short but let's say you know we turn

45
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.530
this thing into an ant.

46
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.210
All of a sudden this is now valid code.

47
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.470
And so I will go ahead and run the see what we get.

48
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.850
Look at that.

49
00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:20.140
Now the circumference is equal to 36 in cotland if you want to add something on to a variable or subtract

50
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.750
something onto a variable.

51
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.530
You can do that with plus equals and minus equals so kind of the fun example I showed in the beginning

52
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:33.160
was the beginner section was if I have 40 bucks in my wallet and then I go to 7-Eleven and I buy like

53
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.850
a hotdog and a soda.

54
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.120
You know I might have to say wallet minus equal five.

55
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.870
And now wallet is going to be equal to 35.

56
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.900
At least it should be let's go ahead and just do a print line of that to make sure and look at that.

57
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:50.950
It's equal to 35.

58
00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.120
So you can do minus sequels you can also do plus equals.

59
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.670
Just like that to add something onto it.

60
00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.960
And just to reiterate if if I say wallet plus equals 100.

61
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:07.780
This is the same thing as wallet is equal to Wallet plus one hundred.

62
00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.450
So you're just taking the existing value and adding on to it.

63
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:18.610
So really everything that I have for you I'm going to have a very simple challenge for you here what

64
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:20.890
I want you to do and I'm going to type this out with comments.

65
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:34.870
Now that we know how to do comments and cotland is make a variable named age and set it equal to your

66
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.260
age and my spelling is just horrendous here.

67
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:52.300
The next thing that I want you to do is I want you to add 40 to your age and then tell me in a line

68
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:59.880
comment what you'll be doing in 40 years should be fun.

69
00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:00.350
OK.

70
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.660
So go ahead hip hop in a video and do this now.

71
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.920
OK.

72
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.690
So hopefully that went well for you.

73
00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.470
Again you should just absolutely blow by this.

74
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.590
You're going to create a variable named age set equal to your current age.

75
00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.360
Then just add 40 to your age.

76
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.520
Go ahead and use that plus equal stuff plus equals 40.

77
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.890
Tell me in a multi-line comment what you'll be doing in 40 years.

78
00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:25.660
So I would love to hear what yours is.

79
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.510
Please share it as a comment to this video.

80
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:42.350
But mine is I will be traveling in the U.S. with my wife in a self-driving RV to visit the grandchildren.

81
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.140
We don't have any children yet so we don't know if this is actually going to become a thing and we're

82
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.890
just banking on the fact that self-driving RV is will be a thing.

83
00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:55.780
So anyways there you have it we're just rolling through here let's keep going we're going to talk about

84
00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.240
if statements and booleans in the next lecture.
