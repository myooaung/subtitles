1
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.820
So the rest of this app is really just taking the information that we have and getting it set up inside

2
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:06.740
of our list view.

3
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.850
So I'm going to leave this to you as a challenge because everything we're going to cover here you can

4
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.370
completely handle on your own so I really recommend you do this.

5
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.930
Go ahead make all the Bluetooth devices that we find.

6
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.370
Add them to a list view that check to say hey if they haven't and I'm going to show the name if not

7
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.620
I'm going to show the address.

8
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.820
But then also in either case make sure you show the RSS eye and then when someone does another search

9
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.080
be sure to clear out the previous results that you had.

10
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.720
Jane.

11
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:34.440
Go ahead.

12
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.270
Hit pause do that now.

13
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.510
All right hopefully that went well for you.

14
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.490
So what we got to do is first go ahead and set up our list for you.

15
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.040
So there's a couple of things that we need to do here.

16
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.620
We already have access to our list view but we need to have an array adapter so that we can fill in

17
00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:03.060
you know information side of the re adapter and so excuse me a re list is what we need up here so we're

18
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:09.060
going to say array list and this is going to be full of a bunch of strings.

19
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.690
We'll go ahead and make that.

20
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.190
We're going to call this Bluetooth devices.

21
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.920
OK.

22
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.250
So we'll have that set up in fact maybe let's just go ahead and say this is equal to a new array list

23
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.090
and we don't have to worry about setting that up later.

24
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.860
Next we need to make sure that we have an array adapter.

25
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:38.410
So we'll go ahead and take make an array adapter and I'll just call the array adapter.

26
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.490
That will stop there.

27
00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:46.320
So we'll come back to our on create to create our ray adapter will say array adapter is equal to a new

28
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.830
array adapter so a couple of things that we got to pass in there so first is this for a context then

29
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.390
we want to go ahead and pass lowercase.

30
00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:03.010
Android capital are not lay out that simple list item one.

31
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.240
Then we have to pass the frailest And in this case that's going to be the blue tooth devices.

32
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.990
All right.

33
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:16.500
So once we have the array adapter set up we want to go ahead and set that to our list view and say List

34
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.160
view that set adapter.

35
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.250
We'll go ahead and pass that array adapter.

36
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.450
Now this all looks fine but really the next step for us is we have to add those strings to the list

37
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.770
view and then we've got to tell the last few hey you've got new information.

38
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.140
You should go ahead and update that.

39
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:40.620
So with this we're going to go after here right now where we're doing this big log of showing all this

40
00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.420
information and then we want to do a check here.

41
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.700
So the thing that we want to check is like I said before we can go ahead and comment.

42
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.480
So we don't need to log all that anymore.

43
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.950
The thing that we want to check and see if there is a name.

44
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:59.370
So we're going to say if name dot equals we're going to do the double quotes like this.

45
00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.990
Well then that means that it's an empty string.

46
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.330
Right.

47
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.150
And then in that case we would want to use the address.

48
00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:17.310
So if that is the case we're going to say Bluetooth adapter Bluetooth devices dot add and this is where

49
00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.480
we would want to add a combination here.

50
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:29.760
So if we if the name's blank in this case we would want to add the address plus a space and then we're

51
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.510
going to do a dash and then show what the are.

52
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:42.580
SS I is and we're going to go ahead and express that I say an our SS No lower case your are SSI.

53
00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.060
We also want to on the end of this.

54
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.470
Go ahead and provide a little bit extra.

55
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.160
The sort of unit that is used here when talking about our SSI.

56
00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:59.750
So I know nothing about this and why this is but it's lower case D capital B lower case.

57
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.890
And that's what we want to add.

58
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:08.010
So in the ELTs situation we want to do almost the exact same thing except rather than use the address

59
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.170
we want to use the name.

60
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:16.260
So we'll go ahead and pass the name inside of there and then regardless of the situation we want to

61
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.680
go ahead and update the adapter to let it know about the new information that we have.

62
00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:29.040
So we're going to get access to our array adapter and I want to say DOD notify data set changed Jane.

63
00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:38.710
So let's go ahead and run this on our device see what we get and we'll go ahead and open up Pfizer.

64
00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.270
Such a great app.

65
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.340
Love this thing and we'll see what we get.

66
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:45.230
So here it comes.

67
00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:49.320
I'm going to do a search and oh do we have an there.

68
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.780
Let's see what we've got going on here.

69
00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.000
So the air ultimately came down to this we had a null pointer exception it was saying a attempting attempt

70
00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:04.280
to invoke virtual method boolean on a no object and if we look it's on 9:46 So when I went and saw this

71
00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.460
I said name equals Well why is that an issue.

72
00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:13.730
Well it's an issue because maybe name is no and you know in which case name is actually either going

73
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.180
to be null rather than be an empty string.

74
00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:23.000
So that was mishandling that so let me go ahead and fix that the first thing that we want to check is

75
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:33.800
first see is if the name is equal to Noal or name that equals an empty string so this will handle the

76
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.420
two cases.

77
00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:40.010
But this one being in front if this thing is no it won't run the rest of the code so we won't risk you

78
00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:41.180
know having our app crash.

79
00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:47.590
So with that in place let's go ahead and run this one more time and see what it looks like.

80
00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:55.230
KERRY Well go ahead look at our app here.

81
00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.170
Let me pull up the view so you can see it.

82
00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.960
We will do a search and look at that boom.

83
00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:07.590
We got all sorts of information coming in here and like it's still searching it hasn't said finished

84
00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:12.140
yet so it's still look at that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8.

85
00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.660
Now it's found a lot of information here.

86
00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:20.580
So it's gone through a lot and it finally said finished here now.

87
00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:26.940
Once it got to this place we have a couple of issues here so one is you know oh I don't have the bluetooth

88
00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:28.020
thing up right.

89
00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:33.150
So if I go ahead and open this up don't open my Bluetooth preferences and it's like right now I want

90
00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:40.320
to do a search and I'm going to go hit search because you know I want to see the one that says Nick

91
00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:45.360
pro and if I scroll through here eventually we'll see the one that says MacBook Pro but you notice it

92
00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.330
didn't clear out the stuff from before.

93
00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:49.860
So that's a big issue.

94
00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.010
The other issues you'll see that we have some repeats here.

95
00:06:53.010 --> 00:07:00.910
So for example specifically here in the first case these have the exact same address yet it was added

96
00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:01.690
twice.

97
00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.820
And so we don't want to add the same address twice.

98
00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:09.550
We want to you know do some sort of check and make sure that that's the thing that we're about to add

99
00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:12.360
into the list is not already there.

100
00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:14.680
So what we're going to do next is.

101
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:19.180
So first let's make it so that whenever we go in and finding information that we're clearing the proper

102
00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:19.650
stuff.

103
00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:24.540
So let's give ourselves some space to look at the code here.

104
00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:30.010
And I think we should make it whenever the user hits that start discovery button even before they do

105
00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:36.750
that we should go ahead and clear out the list so we're going to take our Bluetooth devices array list

106
00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:39.870
as they got clear.

107
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:45.490
Now with that in place before we go ahead and do one of these ads there probably another check that

108
00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:51.610
we want to do to see if that blue tooth device has already been you know added to the list.

109
00:07:51.670 --> 00:08:00.640
And so this is where we would want to take our Bluetooth devices and we would want to do a dot contains

110
00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:01.360
check on that.

111
00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:08.200
So in order to do this we're going to have to add do the adding functionality down below so let's instead

112
00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:17.020
make a string up here that we'll call device string which is initially just set this equal to an empty

113
00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:17.700
string.

114
00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:27.060
It now rather than doing an ad we're going to say device string you are equal to.

115
00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:30.230
I just accidentally deleted that address blah blah blah.

116
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.060
All that info.

117
00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:35.880
So let's go ahead and do same thing over here.

118
00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:40.210
We're going to say hey the device string is equal to this.

119
00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:45.640
And then with this information we are going to go ahead and do our final check here.

120
00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:55.080
So we're going to say if two are parentheses and we want to do Bluetooth devices dot the contains and

121
00:08:55.090 --> 00:09:00.460
this is where we're going to pass in the device string and this will give us a true or false so if it

122
00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:04.540
does already contain that there's nothing that we want to do because we don't want to repeat it.

123
00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:09.490
So in fact we're going to put an exclamation point before this to say if it doesn't contain that then

124
00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:17.140
that's a situation where we would want to say OK Bluetooth devices not add and or simply add that device

125
00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:17.920
string.

126
00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:22.330
So there's simply you know just kind of does a little check make sure we haven't already added this

127
00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:27.810
before to the app so we'll go ahead and run this.

128
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:35.780
Let's get our visor friend up and running here.

129
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:41.610
All right app pops up we hit search and it's going to go through and pull some information.

130
00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:42.060
Look at that.

131
00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:49.080
Got the new book pro and so far no duplicates will allow this to run its course.

132
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:55.470
I'm going to kind of wave my phone around see if we can pick up anything else here and still have not

133
00:09:55.470 --> 00:10:02.490
gotten any duplicates except for this one we did get a duplicate.

134
00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:09.440
So the duplicate problem that we're getting in here is that the DBM the RSS site is changing right so

135
00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:13.880
that in this case it was the same Bluetooth device but they had different RSA size.

136
00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:17.590
So we're going to have to tweak our approach to this a little bit.

137
00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:22.200
So we're going to go ahead and add one more array list here so we already have our Bluetooth devices.

138
00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:26.700
Let's go ahead and keep that intact but let's make a separate array list that we're going to go ahead

139
00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:29.000
and call and address.

140
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:32.870
So we'll call this address new array lists.

141
00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:37.670
I guess I should call this addresses this because this is going to contain all the Bluetooth addresses

142
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:41.940
and every Bluetooth device has to have an address but it doesn't have to have a name.

143
00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:45.320
So not only is this going to protect us when the RSA site change.

144
00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:49.920
But for example with that Nick MacPro maybe you would show up one time as Nick book pro maybe one time

145
00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.720
it would show up with just its address.

146
00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:55.460
So in those situations this is also going to protect us.

147
00:10:55.470 --> 00:11:02.190
So with this new array list we have to make sure that when we do a new search that we go ahead and clear

148
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:03.850
out this list as well.

149
00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:12.120
So add that code and then we'll make it so that when before we go ahead and do this if statement.

150
00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:18.960
All right we are going to add to our address's array because we know how to do that really is say simply

151
00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:30.390
addresses dot add and we want to use me addresses and we'll just simply add the string that we want

152
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:32.450
which is called address.

153
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:35.490
So this is the actual thing that we want to check.

154
00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:38.680
So let's go ahead and do an if statement here.

155
00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:53.970
Well we're going to say all right if lowercase if if addresses that contains an address like this and

156
00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:59.220
we want to do our excellent exclamation point to say as long as it doesn't already contain this address

157
00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:02.690
we are going to go ahead and add this address.

158
00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:05.230
And we are also going to do all the following.

159
00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:12.070
So again we don't want to do this check down here so go ahead and get rid of that.

160
00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:18.040
But all this code inside of here we do want to go ahead and do that.

161
00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:23.000
And we also want to notify the array adapter if we don't have any new information.

162
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.880
Right it's just like a repeat that we don't want to update the list view.

163
00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:31.200
So we'll go ahead and move this in and say only if this is the case do we want to go ahead and move

164
00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:32.820
forward with this.

165
00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:33.580
All right.

166
00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:40.220
So let's go ahead and run that and see what we get on the device.

167
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:45.080
Opens up.

168
00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:56.600
Now it's about to go and we'll hit search and we go looking and we don't have anything coming and so

169
00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:59.640
we must have done some backward logic with this.

170
00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:08.690
OK so if addresses contains the address then.

171
00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:16.970
So I'm wondering why this is not adding anything to us here because we're still doing the Bluetooth

172
00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:21.020
devices that ad that's showing up the proper information.

173
00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:26.300
Well let me go ahead and show you how to do an old school debug here you can kind of watch me live.

174
00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:31.850
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to put a little red dot here I'm going to stop the current process

175
00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:32.540
that we have going.

176
00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:40.490
Going to do a debug on the actual Android device so this will be kind of fun to see what goes on here.

177
00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.660
So here the app opens up.

178
00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:47.600
I'm going to hit search and we can see it comes to this line.

179
00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:51.520
So then I'm going to go ahead and say step into.

180
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.970
And it automatically passed over.

181
00:13:55.030 --> 00:14:00.940
So there's something bad about my if statement here where I'm saying address it's not addresses it's

182
00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:02.920
simply just a singular address.

183
00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:04.310
That's what the issue is.

184
00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:06.930
OK we'll put addresses there.

185
00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:11.520
Now let's go ahead and run this and that should work.

186
00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.890
That's all it takes sometimes what debugging is to say.

187
00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:14.420
OK.

188
00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:15.990
It didn't do this if statement.

189
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.230
So obviously the problem is right here.

190
00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:22.000
And then you know you can kind of go from there and figure out what's going on.

191
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.400
All right we'll hit search and there we go we've got some information pulling up now.

192
00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:32.050
We'll do our check and make sure that we're not getting any sort of repeats here wait until this is

193
00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:32.800
finished.

194
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:39.160
Again way my device around so it has a chance to pick up new things at different distances and also

195
00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.300
throw things out of whack there.

196
00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:47.500
And look it's finished but we've lost our less fuel so let's search one more time here and I'm just

197
00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:51.430
going to move around my device and look at that.

198
00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:52.620
We have no repeats.

199
00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:56.800
I guess I should wait till we get the official information there.

200
00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:07.080
But wait till it says Finast and you still searching come on phone you can do it.

201
00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.710
I think you think you check them all out.

202
00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:14.200
There we go.

203
00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:14.740
Finished.

204
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:17.180
And we didn't have any repeats.

205
00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:18.110
Great.

206
00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:20.830
So I hope you enjoyed making this app again.

207
00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:25.760
You can move much further into bluetooth with talking about you know once you have a bluetooth device

208
00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:30.470
you could make it so that when someone clicks on one of these you could dive into that particular device

209
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:33.010
to learn more information about it or actually connect to it.

210
00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:38.810
Every Bluetooth device is going to have their own API so it's kind of tough to teach that because every

211
00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:44.300
situation is going to be different but all sorts of great documentation on there out there about that

212
00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:49.730
hopefully enjoyed learning about Bluetooth and we still got more to cover in this course so let's keep

213
00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:50.670
moving forward.
