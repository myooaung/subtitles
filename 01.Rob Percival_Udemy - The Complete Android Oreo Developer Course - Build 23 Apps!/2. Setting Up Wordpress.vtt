00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.310
In this section I'm going to show you how to create a great looking marketing web site for your app.

2
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.680
So we're going to be completely away from Android studio and we're actually going to use the tools that

3
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.890
you get free with this course in your area we're posting account.

4
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.940
So if you haven't set that up yet go right back to the beginning of the course and watch the video that

5
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.100
shows you how.

6
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.690
Of course you're very welcome to use another web hosting system or to do this another way if you prefer.

7
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.990
We're going to be using a freely available system called WordPress which allows you to create and edit

8
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.360
a web site without knowing any TNL or javascript or any coding at all in fact it's really great.

9
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.840
And if you want to get into developing web sites I'd definitely recommend looking into WordPress but

10
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.900
we'll see a lot more about how WordPress works in a minute.

11
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.030
So going back to your eco web hosting account the first thing you need to do is to create a hosting

12
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:58.410
package hosting package essentially adds a domain name to your account and allows you to put something

13
00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.020
on it.

14
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:06.480
So you might want to add to something like my great app dot com or if you've actually got a name for

15
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.290
your app you might want to put that in there.

16
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.450
You don't have to own the domain name to test it out.

17
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:17.080
But if you want to use the actual domain name itself you will need to purchase it.

18
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.630
You can do that from either web hosting for around seven pounds a year depending on the domain or you

19
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.620
could do that with another company completely up to you if you just want to test it out and just put

20
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.430
any domain you like in there and that will then set up for you.

21
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.450
Once you've done that you can go over to access your panels over here and then that will give you a

22
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.130
list of the domains that you've created you can say I've got a test one here and then Android of course

23
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:48.210
is the domain I'm going to be using for this particular demo here.

24
00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.310
So once you click on the domain name that will then log you into the see panel or control panel for

25
00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.170
that particular hosting package.

26
00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:58.720
And here we are.

27
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.680
This is where you can do all sorts of things with your hosting package.

28
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.680
I'll just give you a very quick flavor of what you can see so you can work with files up here.

29
00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.720
Backup your Web site work with e-mail.

30
00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.530
You will need a live domain so you will need to have to purchase a domain if you want to work with email

31
00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.040
but you can do everything you would want to do with e-mail.

32
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:26.950
Then there's various web stats and logs packages there my school databases page versions if all of this

33
00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.350
means nothing to you and you want to get into web development.

34
00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.510
You might want to check out my web developer course as it covers all of this but we're just going to

35
00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:41.780
scroll down because we're going to work with the one particular CGI script which is Wordpress blog.

36
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.110
Now it's called WordPress blog but it's not specifically to blogs.

37
00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.100
All sorts of sites one word press.

38
00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.210
And I think it's actually something like 15 percent of the Internet runs on wordpress.

39
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.930
So it is pretty huge.

40
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.790
So your only choice when installing Wordpress is a location.

41
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:06.230
So if you want to install WordPress on the route of your site so if you wanted it to appear at say Android

42
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.860
dev cause dot com then you would leave the block box back.

43
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.840
I'm going to enter a subdirectory there.

44
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.480
So this is going to appear at Android of course.

45
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.100
Slash demo sites and you can actually check it out.

46
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.590
Now if you want to it is there.

47
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.380
So let's click install site and that will then set up WordPress for you.

48
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.150
It takes a few seconds but then when it's done you'll be able to jump over to it.

49
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.950
Here we go.

50
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:42.220
And I'm going to click on that top on the Android of course slash demo site and then it will run through

51
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.380
the installation progress for you.

52
00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.660
So I'm going to call it my awesome app.

53
00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:57.250
Use a name you can have anything you like say I'll have a personal password.

54
00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.780
Good to have something nice and secure.

55
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.210
I'm still very weak.

56
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.710
Well it's just a demo anyway.

57
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.490
But obviously try and make a nice strong password and then your email address.

58
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.880
So I'll put mine in there too then just off the screen there I think that was the install word press

59
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.350
button.

60
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.230
So that's now been installed super easy.

61
00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:40.730
So then log in we've got a capture test just to avoid any denial of service attacks.

62
00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:49.000
So just enter the number them and then log in using the username and password that you just entered.

63
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:59.510
And I would click remember me you're probably coming back and doing things on it later.

64
00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.280
Here we go.

65
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.880
So this is the Wordpress dashboard and the first thing to see is that there's an updated version of

66
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.390
Wordpress available.

67
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.220
So I always recommend doing an update if there is one available.

68
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:20.500
And then just click the big blue update now button because Wordpress is so widely used it's often hacked

69
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.770
and old versions are vulnerable to attack.

70
00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:26.130
So here we go.

71
00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:30.650
Just make sure you keep your site up to the latest version at all times.

72
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:30.930
OK.

73
00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.420
So back to the dashboard.

74
00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.680
Let's have a quick look and see what we've got here.

75
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.190
We've got some basic options.

76
00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:42.280
So writing your first post we're actually creating a blog here so we're not that interested in those

77
00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.350
particular bits.

78
00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.650
And indeed the dashboard is probably somewhere you're not going to spend a lot of time unless you are

79
00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.260
actually making a blog and working with comments et cetera.

80
00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:59.110
So I would go straight to the pages area and this is what we're going to be working with.

81
00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.760
So pages are designed for more static content rather than blog posts.

82
00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:09.950
So we're going to set our site up as a page rather than a post.

83
00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.860
And that means we don't really need to worry about posts or any pay that much attention to media although

84
00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:21.430
we'll be looking at that later on really media is just a place to store all of your images and possibly

85
00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:25.040
videos and other media content that you want on your site.

86
00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.650
Again comments we're not going to be working with.

87
00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:33.220
But if you do want to then we've got our default comment here and as soon as comments come along you

88
00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:37.140
can choose to approve them or reply to them et cetera.

89
00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:44.260
So I'm going to jump over quickly to the settings page and just show you a few settings you should change

90
00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:47.020
whenever you create a WordPress site.

91
00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:52.480
So we've got our site title which we entered at the beginning my awesome app.

92
00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:58.750
So you should change the tagline of your site.

93
00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:02.170
That explains why your app is great.

94
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:06.460
This is the URL that we entered at the beginning so you can change that there if you want to.

95
00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:11.890
And then you've got a few basic settings that I'm not going to change.

96
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:22.750
So once we've saved that's another thing I always change is the public's So normally if you create lots

97
00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:27.860
of pages on your site then you get links like this which aren't particularly nice or friendly.

98
00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:36.610
So I usually change it to post name so it will just show the name of the post in the actual link in

99
00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:37.680
the address bar.

100
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.240
You can really have something else there.

101
00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:45.020
But OK for past posts name unless you particularly want something else.

102
00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:47.010
All right.

103
00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:50.080
So that's the very basics of wordpress.

104
00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.610
The main thing of course we want with our site is for it to look good.

105
00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:58.350
We're not interested in a massively complicated site but we just want something that looks good and

106
00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:00.590
has a link to download our app.

107
00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:07.380
So I'm going to use the app with a Zad WordPress theme which you can find in apps with Zed dot themes

108
00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:12.430
shakeout dot com and you can see it looks like this which is pretty snazzy.

109
00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:15.810
And the great thing about it is it's completely free.

110
00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:20.700
So if you want to do something more advanced or more customized then it's well worth paying a little

111
00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:24.820
bit of money for a decent theme for your website.

112
00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:29.250
But if you just want to get something up and running quickly then this free thing is a great way to

113
00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:29.920
go.

114
00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:35.920
So this theme is on theme shaker dot dotcom which has a number of other themes available as well.

115
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.890
And if you just Google WordPress themes you'll have a bunch of options.

116
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:47.100
But if you want to follow along with this tutorial then go to theme shake a dot com and search themes

117
00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:54.360
for apps with a zed and then you'll get this one here so you can view the demo that we just looked at

118
00:08:54.840 --> 00:09:02.710
and then click get theme and that will then download the theme files to your computer.

119
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:12.270
I'm just going to say them on the desktop and then we just need to import them into our WordPress website.

120
00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:16.610
So we go down to appearance and themes.

121
00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:21.600
You can see there's all sorts of options there which I'm not going to go into into great detail beyond

122
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:28.200
just creating our basic app but there's a lot of choice and power that we can add him.

123
00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.750
So these are the themes that we have available.

124
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:37.090
By default we can add a new theme which is what we want to do.

125
00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:44.670
And you can see that there's a huge range of free themes available just within the Wordpress set up

126
00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:47.200
so you can install them completely from here.

127
00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:52.800
But what we want to do is upload a theme because we've found a theme on a separate web site and downloaded

128
00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:53.720
it.

129
00:09:53.970 --> 00:10:01.710
So we just click upload theme and then choose File and then find the file that you downloaded a moment

130
00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:02.290
ago.

131
00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:07.510
Apps themed up zip and then click Install now.

132
00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:12.350
That will then upload the theme and that's installed already.

133
00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:17.520
So I'm actually going to click activate straight away if you're not certain that you want to use it.

134
00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:21.930
Then you can have a live preview but it's definitely the one that we're going to go for a song and click

135
00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:25.080
activate there and there it is.

136
00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:27.810
So now we've got our new theme in place.

137
00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:28.790
Let's take a look.

138
00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:37.180
So I'm going to command click or control click on Windows to visit the site in a new browser tab.

139
00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:39.230
And here it is.

140
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:45.450
So first off I've already got this bar at the top because I'm logged into WordPress but you won't see

141
00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:47.660
that if you just visit these sites.

142
00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:51.320
It's just when you are logged into WordPress.

143
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:56.050
So it already looks pretty good we've got this nice big banner image at the top here.

144
00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:59.530
Our logo and our big download button.

145
00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:06.140
So now what remains is to customize our Web site putting our own content on and essentially trying it

146
00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:12.050
trying to make it look more like the demo but with our own content so we're going to add some screenshots

147
00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:21.350
here and we're going to add some images and text down further on as well.

148
00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.760
We'll do all that in the next video.

149
00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:23.970
I'll see you there.
