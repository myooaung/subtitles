00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,980
Hello and welcome to the section here where we're going to be building a Twitter clone.

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:10,830
So the idea with this right is you can make an app where you can create a user account log in share

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,440
some tweets and also look at other people's tweets.

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,040
So you'll notice we have a very interesting homescreen here where there's only one sign up and log in

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,390
and it's kind of all combo with each other.

6
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,960
So the idea here is someone puts in a name and a password.

7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:31,980
And if it's their very first time it'll try logging well regardless someone puts in a name and a password

8
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,060
it will try to log them in if the log in doesn't work.

9
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,650
It will try and sign them up with that name and password.

10
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:43,230
So if that names already been taken then it will say hey you know there's a problem there but if they

11
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,440
have a name and a password will just log them in the first time or it will make a new account for them.

12
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,050
So there are some drawbacks to this.

13
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:55,510
For example if I misspelled my name Nic for like two days for example it would sign me up with a new

14
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:01,650
account with Nick K-K rather than you know saying hey you misspelled your user name.

15
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:04,910
So there's some drawbacks but it's going to be fun to experiment with here.

16
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:10,620
But anyways you put in your information you log in it comes to a list of some users except for yourself

17
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,530
so notice Nick is excluded here.

18
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,670
And I can choose people I want to follow or not follow.

19
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:23,160
So for example right now I'm only following phyto and if I want to go see my feet of people I follow.

20
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:28,230
Look there's a tweet by Feydeau but if I hit the back button I say you know what I do want to follow

21
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,250
John and Sarah.

22
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,100
So I go and select those two checks.

23
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,680
And now I go back to my feed.

24
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,600
Well then I can now see tweets from John and Sarah.

25
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,840
The other thing that we want to mention here is that we can post tweets as well.

26
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:48,590
So if I go to here and I say I want to tweet and I'm going to send out a new tweet like this app rocks.

27
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,070
OK.

28
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,940
And I go ahead and send this.

29
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:57,150
I should be able to log out and then come see that tweet so I'm going to log out here and log in as

30
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,020
Feydeau.

31
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:06,220
So let me go ahead and put in my information there and if I go Follow Nick and I go look at his my feed.

32
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:07,730
I should see look at that.

33
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,230
This app rocks.

34
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:09,790
OK.

35
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:15,120
So I'd really encourage you to go do this by yourself it's going to be a really good exercise for you.

36
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,350
But of course you need any help you can always watch the lectures.

37
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,980
All right go ahead and get to it.

38
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:24,700
All right well let's go ahead and get started on our Twitter app here.

39
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,600
And the first thing that we want to do is we want to be able to get a parse server up and running.

40
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:34,710
So I actually reuse the one that we had used before from Instagram I just got rid of some classes.

41
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:40,110
You can create a separate instance if you want but you're gonna have to be a little bit careful there

42
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:44,790
because if you have more than one easy to instance you're going to get outside of that free tier and

43
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,260
you're not looking to pay for it.

44
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:51,410
This might not be you know you don't want to have more than one but you either create a new one you're

45
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:54,600
the one from last one but you need to get parce server up and running.

46
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,250
And then we need to get a partas starter server ready to go so this is where we need to go to Rob's

47
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,250
Web site.

48
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:07,460
So we in a new tab are going to go to Android of course.

49
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:10,230
Com and we want to do flash.

50
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,590
And this is where we're going to go get the download.

51
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:19,380
So we're going to do slash parce project all lowercase.

52
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:24,810
Zip OK so we'll go ahead and download that.

53
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:29,880
And while that's there I just wanted to show you that I have an android studio my last project which

54
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,560
has the appropriate application ID client key server all that good stuff.

55
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,280
So we now have access to those things.

56
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:43,010
And if you need any help on setting up your parse server you can always go back and reference the instagram.

57
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,840
But we got everything set up for that very first time.

58
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,550
So that's they're available for you.

59
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,010
All right.

60
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,520
Looks like that download finished.

61
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,300
I'm going to go ahead and throw this on to my desktop.

62
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,170
I'm also going to give this a new name.

63
00:03:55,170 --> 00:04:00,950
I'm going to rename this Twitter so it doesn't have the name of parce starter project anymore.

64
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:07,530
And so then I'm going to go open an android studio this new project so I'm going to go to the desktop

65
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:08,240
here.

66
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,080
I'm going to open up Twitter.

67
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:14,570
So it's going to go set up the new STK path.

68
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,010
That's fine with me.

69
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,090
Go ahead and wait for this to open again.

70
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,710
We're going to have to with this project go you know take all this information that we had just got

71
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,570
and set it up for our new Twitter up to make sure it can connect and we'll go ahead and do a test to

72
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:33,270
make sure that everything works out.

73
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,520
So here we have our new Twitter application.

74
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:43,500
And like I said we do want to go back here to the Instagram app and we want to go get the appropriate

75
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,370
information.

76
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,480
Yes we want to do all the applicable updates.

77
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:54,120
So I'm actually just going to go ahead and copy this line in parts and we'll come back to our Twitter

78
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:00,920
project here and we're going to replace that line you just go ahead and paste that in.

79
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:01,930
Excellent.

80
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:07,060
And we shouldn't now have access to everything that we need for this.

81
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,950
We still have to do a few updates here.

82
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:14,330
But at least as far as connecting to our server we should have everything in place that we need.

83
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,820
And the real way to test this to see if everything is up and running is by running this app and see

84
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:24,370
if it creates this example object like we had before.

85
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:30,280
So we'll go ahead and keep moving through these updates to make sure we're at the right level with everything.

86
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:35,350
So once that finishes we're going to want to go ahead and hit run here so we can test this out on our

87
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,190
emulator.

88
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:43,360
And again if everything's working correctly we'll see this new example object class that we have here

89
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,160
show up inside of our parse server.

90
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,940
So we'll go back and see if that works for us.

91
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:55,210
So the emulator finally opened up here but I did have a pretty nasty error and it was saying something

92
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,290
about a session token that was bad.

93
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:02,290
So there was two things I did to fix it so one is after you do a partial Nissel initialize and I think

94
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:07,480
these errors are coming because I'm using a parse server and I'm using the same emulator device and

95
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,840
I had deleted some classes.

96
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:15,120
But you want to do a parse user log out here at the very beginning before you create an object.

97
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:18,150
We only have to do this this one time and then also down below.

98
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,760
You want to comment out this parse user enable automatic use.

99
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:27,010
We were going to have to end up doing this anyways because we're going to be handling our own server

100
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,830
or user sign in process.

101
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:34,270
But go ahead and do those two things and you should have success and if you did you'll notice there's

102
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:39,650
no example object here but when we reload the page like it that we have an example object and mine has

103
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:40,080
to.

104
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:44,100
Because I ran it twice and that's where the two of those came from.

105
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:49,110
But if you had those issues that's what should get you to that point.

106
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:55,300
So from there now that we know that parts is working the next step for us is we want to go ahead and

107
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,490
get the design of our app correct.

108
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,530
So we want to go ahead and get a logo for our Twitter application.

109
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:07,480
So we're going to go to my favorite flat icon dot com and I'm just going to go ahead and search for

110
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,000
Twitter.

111
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,450
I think that's too many eyes for Twitter.

112
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:18,770
We'll go ahead and search that and we have some nice looking ones here.

113
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,680
I'm going to say you know maybe something like this bird with the circle that looks really good.

114
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,640
This is by free pick again if you're going to be using these images.

115
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:33,710
Make sure you have the proper license to do everything here and we'll go ahead and grab a PMG for this.

116
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:37,260
And let's maybe do this at one twenty eight.

117
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:42,860
So go ahead and grab that and I'll add this to our project here.

118
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:47,310
Let me go ahead and open it up and down here in Razz.

119
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,220
We need to have a drawable folder.

120
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:57,150
So I'm going to make a new resource directory and we want this to be drawable.

121
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,170
There we go.

122
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:04,850
Now that we have that let's go ahead and we want to reveal this in Finder.

123
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,660
There it is.

124
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:09,040
And so now we can take this image and bring it in.

125
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:15,820
OK so with that in place and if you're not seeing your image you might want to right click here and

126
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,270
say synchronize and look.

127
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:21,100
Now we get that awesome Twitter PLG.

128
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:26,680
So let's go ahead and move over to the lay out side of things going open up the layout folder here and

129
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:29,540
open up activity main.

130
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,780
So there's a few things that we want to add here.

131
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:35,190
One is the Twitter logo up and the top that's going to be a big thing.

132
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:42,490
But also we want to be able to add the edit text for this and we want to be able to add the sign in

133
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:43,310
button.

134
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:50,680
So let's go ahead and add a new constraint lay out I'm going to go ahead and add this we need to get

135
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,140
rid of our relative lay out.

136
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:59,480
Let's go ahead and delete that you know it's not playing nice with me so let's go ahead and just add

137
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,170
a constraint layout here.

138
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,430
It is really not playing nice with us.

139
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:10,470
So go ahead and change this to a constraint.

140
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:16,960
Lay out excellent and we'll come back to design here.

141
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:21,450
Now remember from last time there's a few issues with lay out here so there's a couple of things that

142
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:22,440
we're going to have to fix.

143
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,040
Let's go down to our grade old build to make sure you do this for the module.

144
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:34,060
And we just want to update this to be a key SDK version 26 also minimum SDK version we want 26 there

145
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:40,650
and target STK version let's do 26 and we're going to come back down and change this to twenty six point

146
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,510
zero point zero.

147
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:47,610
So once you do this you're going to have to sync your cradle project and go ahead and give this a moment

148
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:48,350
to run.

149
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:52,530
But once it's finished through we should be able to come back to that main activity and start working

150
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:53,340
with it.

151
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:59,230
So once that's finished we can go back to our main activity here and we'll be able to start designing.

152
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:02,190
So the first thing that we want to add is that image view.

153
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:08,580
So I'll just go ahead and click drag that out to our project and we'll go ahead and put that in in the

154
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:13,200
drawable it's going to be looking for a name here so we want to search for Twitter and it will go ahead

155
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:16,850
and grab that case or we're going to have this up at the top.

156
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:23,490
And you know we're going to figure out how big we want this to be and you know it looks like an OK size

157
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,380
but I don't know if there's going to be enough space to even type up there.

158
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:28,560
So maybe let's constrain the width and height.

159
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:34,790
Let's maybe see what like 50 and 50 looks like that's probably a bit too small.

160
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:40,410
It's not bad let's leave it at 50 and 50 and then we can come back and see what we think about it later.

161
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:46,530
With that in place we need to go ahead and add some edit text so we'll go ahead and drag one below here.

162
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,810
And this is going to be for that user name.

163
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:55,710
So for the width Let's go ahead and have this match the parent We're going to get rid of the text inside

164
00:10:55,710 --> 00:11:01,470
of there and instead provide a hint to say this is where that user name should go should probably spell

165
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,140
user name correctly.

166
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:06,880
We are also going to bring out one of these for the password.

167
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,010
So go ahead and bring one of those right below.

168
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:14,940
Again the width on this should match the parent and we'll get rid of the text instead.

169
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,940
Put a hint that says this should be the password.

170
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:21,870
Now we want to go ahead and change the input type for this one because it's going to be a password and

171
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:27,150
we want to have that blurred out so we're going to come here and choose text password uncheck person

172
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,120
name that's going to help us out.

173
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:31,590
So go ahead and hit OK there.

174
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,200
Now last thing that we need to add is a button.

175
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,460
So again we're going to do that.

176
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:42,000
Interesting button where there's only one button here that allows us to both sign in and sign up.

177
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:45,170
I guess the better name for this would be sign up slash log in.

178
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:50,980
But you know it kind of performs those two actions so we're just going to type out here sign up slash

179
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:56,730
log in because those are the two functions that we want to have happening with this button and it's

180
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:57,740
on click name here.

181
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,180
I think probably that's a good name.

182
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,880
I'm just going to say sign up capital log in.

183
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,290
And that's going to represent when someone tries to sign up or log in.

184
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:07,000
OK.

185
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,970
So let's go ahead and give appropriate names for these added.

186
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:15,900
I'm going to call this user name at a text here on the password.

187
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,380
Say yes to that.

188
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:26,800
I want this to be password and text password Capitol and a text we can get rid of too probably.

189
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:33,070
And then on this button let's go ahead and call this the sign up button.

190
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,960
Although I don't think we're going to need access to that in code.

191
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:39,130
But let's go ahead and give an ID just in case.

192
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:42,240
So let's get back to the Java code here.

193
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:50,430
Now we can get rid of a lot of this so we're going to get rid of here the parse user Well all of this

194
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:51,210
code.

195
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,050
We don't want to get rid of this Parslow user all that stuff.

196
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:59,040
Just leave the initialiser here with this in place.

197
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,340
Now we want to go move over to the main activity so we'll double click on that.

198
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:08,670
And then here inside of our main activity this is where we want to get things rolling.

199
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:14,940
So the first thing I guess that we should do we have in our copy and paste board here the name of the

200
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,980
method that we want so let's go ahead and just do it.

201
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,080
Public void.

202
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,490
Sign up log in.

203
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:27,310
This will take in a view which we'll call you then we'll go ahead and do our curly brackets there.

204
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:31,250
So now we can write some code whenever someone hits that button.

205
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:34,680
One other thing that I'd like to do is kind of just clean up the app a little bit.

206
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,100
Is going to set the title here.

207
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:44,980
So set title and I'm just going to have this be equal to Twitter colon log in.

208
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:50,310
So with this in place let's go ahead and write the code that we're trying to do and basically what it

209
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:55,620
is is we need to get the information out of the user name and the password edit text we need to attempt

210
00:13:55,620 --> 00:14:01,200
to first log in the user if that's unsuccessful then we will sign up the user.

211
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,780
That's kind of our process here.

212
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,110
So let's get access to those texts.

213
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:13,360
The first one is going to be the username and text and we'll just have this be equal to fine view by

214
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,410
ID.

215
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:16,790
Our dot ID.

216
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:23,760
User Name and we're not getting the proper ID here.

217
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:29,880
So this is an error sometimes I see with Android studio sometimes as simple as hitting this bill button.

218
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:32,620
Sometimes you have to completely close out and open it up again.

219
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:37,120
But through a little bit of work here by just closing and opening I got it too.

220
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:42,110
Now if I type out user name edit Tex it shows up but it really didn't change any code.

221
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:48,140
I just closed and open so it's just something freaky that Android studio is doing that gets us the username

222
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:48,830
edit text.

223
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:52,950
Let's go ahead and get the edit text for the password.

224
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:59,000
And that text and we'll have this be equal to fine view by ID.

225
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,550
Our idea of password at text.

226
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,280
OK that gives us access to both of the edit text.

227
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:10,330
So then next what we want to do is we want to try and log in.

228
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:17,210
So I'm going to take our parse user and I'm going to log in in the background so I'll go ahead and do

229
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:17,600
this.

230
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,010
First it needs to get the string for the user name.

231
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:27,470
So we're going to take user name edit text dot to string so will have access to that.

232
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:33,140
I guess before this we have to get the DOT get text and then to string.

233
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,190
There we go.

234
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:39,680
Same thing for the password so password edit text get string and

235
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:48,270
password edit text get text us trying to get string to string.

236
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:49,470
That'll get us there.

237
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,770
And then the last thing that we need to pass is a callback.

238
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:58,980
So we'll go ahead and do a new log in callback and that'll add excellent code for us to tell us hey

239
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,250
whether or not this thing worked.

240
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:07,050
So with this the first thing we want to check and see is if we have an error or an exception so we're

241
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:15,480
going to say if E is equal to no meaning that you know nothing's gone wrong then we want to go ahead

242
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:28,020
and log out that everything worked out so well say log I and we'll say log in and say this was a success

243
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:31,030
summation point and that's our happy news.

244
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:36,030
Now if it's the users very first time and we're assuming that would be the case if the log in failed

245
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,710
then we want to say hey let's go ahead and try and sign up this user.

246
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:46,530
So we're going to make a brand new parse user who we're just going to call user and we're going to say

247
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:52,320
this new user equal to a new partas user just like that.

248
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:59,190
Next we want to set this user's name so we're going to say user dot com I guess we're already using

249
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:05,400
the name of user there so let's go ahead and call this guy parce user or maybe a better better yet another

250
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,620
name his new user.

251
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,890
There we go.

252
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:17,040
So now we can say new user set user name and just follow the same path we're going to get that username

253
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:21,350
edit text that get text to string.

254
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,940
Next thing I want to do is take this new user and say set the password for this user and that that'll

255
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:31,990
be password edit text get text to stream.

256
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:35,010
So now we've set the username and the password.

257
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:42,060
And the next step is going to be signing up this user so we're going to see new user dot sign up in

258
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:42,730
background.

259
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:48,810
We want to get the option here with the callback and which will type the new sign up callback and we

260
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:52,560
get this awesome function telling us how that worked out.

261
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:59,040
So again we want to do an if statement where we check the exception so it will do if with our curly

262
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,550
brackets and we'll see if he is equal to know.

263
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:06,620
There were no problems and we will simply only say success.

264
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:13,330
But in this case we're going to say Sign-Up success and in the situation here.

265
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:16,080
Well you know we weren't able to log them in.

266
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,140
We weren't able to sign them up.

267
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:20,390
There must be some sort of problem.

268
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,560
So this is where we would want to create a toast message for the user.

269
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:33,090
So we're going to say toast dot make text and inside of here we'll just pass in main activity this for

270
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:40,760
the context and we'll say we get message because this is what we want to print out and show.

271
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:44,680
And then the next thing is how long we want this to last.

272
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,400
Well just keep us nice and short and then we'll show this.

273
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:54,590
Hopefully this will either log in sign up the user or tell them why this didn't work out.

274
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:58,400
So with this we'll go ahead and run the emulator here.

275
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:04,500
Now I have to admit this isn't the greatest situation and the biggest pitfall that I can see if someone

276
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:12,000
puts in the incorrect user name all of a sudden will make a new user for them with you know whatever

277
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,460
password they had entered in so they may think that they had logged in when in reality they had just

278
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,330
created a new user so there can be some confusion that way.

279
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:25,950
But I thought it would be an interesting exercise to see hey how could we make this just that much simpler

280
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:26,880
for the user right.

281
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,600
Like all they do is put in a user name and password.

282
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,170
And if they're logging in.

283
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:31,890
Boom get them in.

284
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:34,720
If they're trying to sign up then we'll sign them up.

285
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,250
But as I said there are some drawbacks to that.

286
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,190
So let's go ahead and give us a test.

287
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:43,540
We're going to need to have dog cat open here.

288
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:49,410
Let's try first user name of Nick password one two three four will try to sign up.

289
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:50,670
Log in.

290
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:56,250
So let's go ahead and take a look at what we got so we didn't see anything I said log success which

291
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:00,740
tells us we came down to this statement and look we had Sign-Up success.

292
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,770
And if I hit this button again we now see logons success.

293
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,090
That's pretty great right.

294
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:10,720
But let's say I put in the wrong password here like and add an extra letter there.

295
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:15,530
Well then we get an error that says an account already exists for this username.

296
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:21,120
So again this isn't the ideal situation because we would want to then present a message that says hey

297
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:25,860
you know you had entered in the wrong like the username and password don't match up.

298
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,610
But in this case we're getting the sign up here.

299
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,910
So not everything's perfect here.

300
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:33,280
And we also have another issue that for example let's say there's no password here.

301
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,920
And we try and do is sign up.

302
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:38,490
Well the air that we're printing out here it's kind of a nasty one right.

303
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:45,090
Like we've got this Java Lang illegals exception I don't want to say password cannot be missing or blank.

304
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:52,230
So in order to fix that we're going to come here to where we're just taking this message which gives

305
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:55,970
us a string and we're going to do a little bit of string magic here.

306
00:20:56,010 --> 00:21:01,940
In order to say hey we just want everything after the first space because in those text messages it's

307
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:02,910
this nice job.

308
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:06,540
Long Java thing colon space and then that message.

309
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:11,310
And so what we're going to do is we're going to take our e get message and then on this we're going

310
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:21,750
to say Dot sub string just like this and the substring that we want is easy to get message and we're

311
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:27,070
going to do this get message and then on this we're going to do dot index of.

312
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,830
And we're going to pass in a space.

313
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:33,530
So it's saying go to wherever the first space is and that's where we want to start our substring.

314
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:40,380
OK so with this in place let's go ahead and run this on our emulator here.

315
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:44,490
And we should see a successful log and slash Sign-Up screen.

316
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:48,050
It's a great start to our app.

317
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:50,570
So we'll see your honor app open up here.

318
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:53,250
Let's say I type in Nick but no password I sign up.

319
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:56,340
Look at that password cannot be missing or blank.

320
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,180
Great stuff.

321
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:57,790
OK.

322
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:03,060
So with this all in place we're ready to move on to the next lecture and keep driving on this Twitter

323
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:03,530
app.
