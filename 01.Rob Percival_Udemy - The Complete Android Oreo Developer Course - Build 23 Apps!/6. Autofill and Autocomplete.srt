1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,770
So in this lecture we're going to cover two different topics but they're all sort of under the same

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:08,780
Rella and it's about auto completing tasks for our user.

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,440
They're trying to fill in some information we want to make it that much easier for them.

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:18,810
So we're going to learn about the new autofill API that comes with Android API 26 point no.

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:24,760
And also we're going to learn about autocomplete with which came about I believe an API 22.

6
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:28,130
But you're going to see both and how you can use them in your app.

7
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:31,350
So let's go ahead and start a new Android project.

8
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:37,460
I'm just going to call this wado fun because we're working with both the autofill API and the autocomplete.

9
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,440
So let's just go ahead and name that.

10
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:42,620
Now what is important make sure you have API 26.

11
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:49,320
We want the latest and greatest here so that we can see what those new autofill API is look like.

12
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:57,140
And then we want an empty activity here and finish up so that I'll go out and create our project for

13
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:57,560
us.

14
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:04,610
So first off we are going to talk about how we can work with the autocomplete API I think that one's

15
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:12,330
really excellent basically the idea is you can take what is essentially an edit text and turn it into

16
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:18,570
an auto complete text and you can basically provide suggestions to users about what could go in there

17
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,800
and you get to decide what it is that you're going to suggest.

18
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:27,090
It's really just you create an array of strings and have it show up just like you would do inside of

19
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:27,720
a list view.

20
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,700
It's pretty straightforward that way.

21
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:37,170
So to kind of talk about this let's just sort of set up a situation here that maybe you know have an

22
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,620
app where you message your friends or something like that.

23
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:44,970
And so people when they compose a new message they're going to be typing in a friend's name and you

24
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:49,650
want to autocomplete it so they don't have to type out a friend's full name to get to them.

25
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:53,750
So if that's the case then we want to have a string array.

26
00:01:53,760 --> 00:02:02,970
Maybe we'll just call it friends and maybe let's call it friends then or Fern's come on spelling and

27
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:09,910
then we'll go ahead and fill it in with some values so maybe we'll have Nick in there.

28
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,950
And it's arch rival Rick.

29
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:16,350
Better put that in double quotes.

30
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:22,040
Maybe you also have Sarah someone else here James.

31
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:26,140
And I'm also the kind of show you how this auto complete works we're going to put in.

32
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,960
I'm going to put it in a couple of names here so we're going to do Nina as one.

33
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:37,740
I'm also going to have Noel and the let's do another one.

34
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,920
This probably isn't a real name but I do need a because this is going to help with the example that

35
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,480
we're doing.

36
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:47,460
So we have this array of friends.

37
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:48,630
Right.

38
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:54,090
And like I said it's as simple as connecting well I guess before we do this let's make the auto complete

39
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,310
edit text and then we'll get to the step.

40
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:02,750
So let's go over to our main activity and we'll go ahead and.

41
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,690
Well so if we look inside of what we have right now there's just a simple text view and we want to first

42
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:14,520
get an edit text but then even then it's a special version of an edit text so we'll go ahead and select

43
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,660
that text for you and delete it.

44
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:21,480
Then if we go to the text category all the way down the bottom you can see there's this auto complete

45
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:27,700
text view so go ahead and just drag this out you can decide where you want this.

46
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:33,210
I'm going to have mine be a certain distance from the top and also a certain space from the left and

47
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:33,830
the right.

48
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:34,690
OK.

49
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:40,680
And with this I don't want to have any text in there at the beginning so I'm just going to go ahead

50
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,830
and empty that out.

51
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,180
And when I do that it looks like it shrinks.

52
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,520
So let's go ahead and make sure this goes all the way to the edge here.

53
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,480
There we go.

54
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,580
Well not all the way to the edge but at least a certain distance that you know I can type something

55
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,390
out.

56
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,580
So that looks pretty good.

57
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:03,150
Auto complete text view is kind of a lame idea but we'll just leave it at that and then let's go ahead

58
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:07,140
and get access to that so we'll say auto

59
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:13,390
complete text view which we'll just call.

60
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:20,760
Let's call the thing out a complete text field is equal to find view by ID are Id done although complete

61
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,960
text field.

62
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:22,260
All right.

63
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:28,160
With that in place like I said this is very much similar to when you want to fill up a list view.

64
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:35,040
So with this string of friends or array of friends then we want to go ahead and make an array adapter

65
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:44,280
so we're going to say array adapter of a bunch of strings which we'll just call array adapter is equal

66
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,790
to a new array adapter.

67
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:55,510
And we'll just pass this for the context then we'll do lower case Android are laying out Daut simple

68
00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:01,940
list item 1 and we'll go ahead and pass and the friends are right there.

69
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:06,910
You know you've been doing enough android when you can pump out our DOT Android that are to lay out

70
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:09,540
that simple list item one like you just in your memory.

71
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:12,690
Oh yeah that's the thing that we need when we make a list for you.

72
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:13,670
All right.

73
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,110
So we get that array adapter and then really you're going to be blown away.

74
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:21,340
Here we just take this auto complete text for you right.

75
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:29,660
We just say set adapter just like that Cirus a set adapter and we pass in our array adapter.

76
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,100
Boom that is all we need.

77
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:36,580
So let's go ahead and run this so you can see what this looks like.

78
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:41,670
Again we are here working with the auto complete text view.

79
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:45,720
And then we're going to be talking about the autofill API framework.

80
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,600
However you'd like to phrase that.

81
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:55,830
So the basic idea is the SAP's going to open up and as we start typing out the name of a friend if we

82
00:05:55,830 --> 00:06:00,270
start typing out with an R it's going to hopefully show us Rick and if we do an asshole she'll share

83
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,140
Sarah.

84
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:07,600
And then why have all these names because I wanted to show you if we you know do a and it it'll show

85
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:14,880
all the ends of the food you and I will that show you know Nick need a Neenah but not know well.

86
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:18,020
And then you know we can keep sort of move from there.

87
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,840
So let's go ahead and pull up for you later.

88
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:30,700
Come on Android Syria we believe there we go.

89
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,800
All right.

90
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,640
So here it comes.

91
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,560
And if we start typing inside if you're like I said we'll do the.

92
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,610
And I look at that.

93
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,750
There's all our names.

94
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:39,490
Let's try out.

95
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,440
Sarah if I do an essay Oh it shows Sarah.

96
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:43,660
That's pretty cool.

97
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,240
James try the J.

98
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,700
Boom he pops up and if you're wondering if you type one of these out like I like Nina it will fill it

99
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,780
in the rest of the way for us.

100
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:57,780
And these are just like a tech so you can go ahead and get the text that's from inside of there turn

101
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,500
into a string whatever it is that you want to do.

102
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:04,950
But you might have noticed something that I think is a little bit annoying here is that I'd like it

103
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:10,020
if I type out just the letter and it would show me all the ends or I type out and it would show me all

104
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:10,790
the arts.

105
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:15,330
But instead we have to type out you know at least two letters in order for it to show up.

106
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,210
But that is customizable.

107
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:24,300
And so the way to fix that is you take your auto complete text for you and you say set threshold.

108
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:30,600
So this is how many characters someone has to type in order to get you know essentially the suggestions

109
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:36,000
to pop up so if we set it to one that's going to say they only need to do one letter and we'll go ahead

110
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,520
and search.

111
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:43,320
And the basic idea behind this is you know maybe if you don't have a huge array that you're tapping

112
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,710
into with only one letter it's not going to be enough.

113
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:51,960
Like it just doesn't make sense but you know to at that point maybe it's good and maybe for your situation

114
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:58,470
you want them to type three four or five characters whatever it is but just know that that is customizable.

115
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:02,970
So here comes the app and now you'll see when I type and inside of here look at that.

116
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:08,420
Nick Neenah Well NaeNae and if I do and I and all the sudden AOL drops out.

117
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:13,310
Same thing now if I do like J it goes for James Sarah bill.

118
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,340
There it is.

119
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,000
OK.

120
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,140
So there's the autocomplete text you which I think is really great.

121
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:23,980
Now the next one is the autofill framework API whatever you want to call it.

122
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:33,270
So this is the ability to have an app fill in edit Tex in other people's apps and Web sites stuff like

123
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:38,040
that and you can only have one default app that does a set of time.

124
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:41,700
So 99 percent of the time it's going to be a password manager.

125
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,110
Android has very explicitly stated in their documentation.

126
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:51,540
If you're using this technology you're most likely a password manager which if you are a password manager

127
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,770
you're probably a pretty large scale operation.

128
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,910
And so there's not really a lot of relevance for us.

129
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:01,920
But the part of relevance that we have is if someone's password manager is going to work with our app

130
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:07,770
we have to be able to work with it and so there's a little work that we have to do on our end so that

131
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:14,550
apps that use this autofill API can then successfully work with our app and it's really simple anywhere

132
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:21,450
that you have an edit text you just have to go into the SML and add a new attribute inside of here.

133
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:26,310
So what we're looking for is the Android Auto fill hints.

134
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:26,910
OK.

135
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,610
So go ahead and select this.

136
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:37,950
And once you do this you basically what you're trying to do is tell the app you know what kind of information

137
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:40,690
you're looking for in this particular task.

138
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:50,560
So for example if we were looking for a user name of somebody we would type in all caps auto fill and

139
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:55,820
we want underscore can't underscore user name.

140
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:56,500
OK.

141
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,990
And there's all sorts of different strings that we can use here.

142
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:07,020
So you know there's auto fill hint email auto fill hint phone number.

143
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:12,210
I think there's a great list of these in fact if you just go ahead and copy this whole string and if

144
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:18,950
we opened up Safari for instance if we paste this then I'm pretty sure we can get the full list here.

145
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:25,570
So let's see the autofill framework.

146
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:28,730
So look there's another one autofill and password.

147
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,740
I mean that would be a really really big one if your password manager.

148
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:36,510
But the idea is you know whatever it is in your app that you're going to be using that you're old you

149
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:42,210
know put these here so that those apps can say hey someone's trying to fill out a username I'm going

150
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:47,430
to suggest this option and then essentially brings up a menu very similar to what we have here where

151
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,730
it says oh are you looking to add this.

152
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:56,250
So again from my perspective it's very unlikely that you're going to be making an app with the autofill

153
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,850
API to be like the password manager on someone's phone.

154
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:04,950
Maybe you are and if you are props to you but more than likely you want to do your best to anywhere

155
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:10,110
you have an edit text that you think could work with this auto fill that you do your part to support

156
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:13,120
that to make it easier for your users.

157
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,150
Well that's all I've got for you.

158
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:17,050
Hope you learned about these two things.

159
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:22,440
Both of them are just these small little tips that we can add to our app to make it that much easier

160
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,610
for our users.

161
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:25,500
I'm sure they'll really appreciate our work.
