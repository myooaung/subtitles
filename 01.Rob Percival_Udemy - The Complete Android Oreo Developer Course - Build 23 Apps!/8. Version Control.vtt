00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.280
All right it's time to learn about get.

2
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.620
And if you don't know what it is it's an awesome way to sort of control your code as you move along

3
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:08.280
in development.

4
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.100
So it's especially helpful to go back to previous versions of your code in case you sort of break something

5
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.370
you say I need to go back to this point in time.

6
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:21.180
Or if you're working on a bunch of different features you can work on one individual feature and then

7
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.770
bring it back smoothly into your code if you're working with teams get is an awesome resource.

8
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:32.550
So if you want to know more about good go to get dash SVM dot com and you can learn a ton of stuff there

9
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.050
and I'd recommend regardless of what operating system or system you're on.

10
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.880
Make sure you have get installed on your computer as you can see from the home screen here.

11
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.620
You can download it for Mac which is what I'm on.

12
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:51.210
But again that will get you to the right download for whatever operating system that you have.

13
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.770
And although it said it was going to download looks like I'm going to have to click this to get it to

14
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.870
install automatically.

15
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:05.100
But yeah with this the basic idea you know with get is that you have some control it's called version

16
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.420
control.

17
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.930
There's lots of different kinds of this and you'll see that as we move forward with Android studio.

18
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.700
But let's go ahead and open up a new Android studio project and we're just going to make one to learn

19
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.930
how to work with it.

20
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.880
So let's just go ahead and call this version control demo.

21
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.340
Just like that.

22
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.130
And we just want to do all the defaults for this and go ahead and make a new project.

23
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.030
Now I already have get installed on my machine that's why I didn't go forward with the whole installer

24
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.780
and all that stuff.

25
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.370
But again you might want to do that to make sure that you have get installed on your computer.

26
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:50.040
I can tell you personally there have been many times that it has saved my butt when I've done something

27
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.510
absolutely dumb with my code deleted something that I shouldn't have.

28
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.610
But then the other thing get is it's only as good as as many times as you essentially make these commits

29
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.190
which are basically saves.

30
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.570
So as much as you save your code you're going to be able to go back in time to a point when things were

31
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.020
working.

32
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.200
So it's kind of a you know get is great but it's only as great as you use it to be.

33
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.900
So you've got to kind of be on top of it but we'll learn how to how to use all this stuff.

34
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:23.850
So now that we have Android studio open you can see we've got this VC here up at the top this is one

35
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:30.930
of our menu items up there and this is called version control systems and you can choose which one that

36
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:31.710
you'd like to work with.

37
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:37.770
So here if we go enable version control integration it's going to say hey which system would you like

38
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:38.490
to integrate with.

39
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:46.160
And so there's others besides get but get is definitely the most popular and I think the best.

40
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.440
So let's go ahead and move forward with get.

41
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.560
We'll say okay to that.

42
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.660
And now that we have that in place let me show you how to create your first commit again.

43
00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:03.780
Think of it as a way to sort of make tiny points in a timeline of your project that you're working on.

44
00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.640
So to make our first commit what we're going to do is we're going to go to Visi Yes.

45
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:14.690
And then we're going to go to get there we're going to scroll down here until we find this ad.

46
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.080
And now with this ad I guess before we click this we have to choose what it is we're going to add so

47
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.480
we're going to select this whole app folder as far as this great script goes like we could add this

48
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.810
stuff.

49
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.380
But sometimes that's going to cause problems so we just want to add the bulk of our app here with this

50
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.170
ad so.

51
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.100
So go ahead and Right-Click this and we're going to go down to get and we're going to say AD So that's

52
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.330
going to add this code into our new commit that once we have that we're going to go to.

53
00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.930
Yes.

54
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.420
And we're going to go over and go to commit here and we want to create a new commit or excuse me it's

55
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.470
not in the get dropped on there it's here in commit change.

56
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.550
So go ahead and do that.

57
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.630
So this is going to bring this little pop up message that says hey look you added all the files that

58
00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.250
are here and if you're wondering what does AD mean.

59
00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:02.580
Well remember commits are what we're ultimately trying to create and commits our points in time.

60
00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.290
And so we're adding things to this commit saying that you know we want to add who files for this particular

61
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.750
point in time and since this is our very first commit Inish people usually say something for the first

62
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.780
time it like initial commit or something like that.

63
00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:23.870
I'm going to do just in it that's typical one that is short for initialization.

64
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.590
And we'll just go ahead and hit commit here.

65
00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:27.240
OK.

66
00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.220
So you're going to see that it takes a little bit of time to get this up and running.

67
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:37.410
But this creates our first saved point in time our first commit in the project so this is kind of our

68
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:38.890
starting point here.

69
00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.200
So it's going to say hey we found some mornings this year I want to move forward yes just go ahead and

70
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.760
commit that you know you it will get a little pop up here.

71
00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.780
This is version control item down here and if you click on this this will show you the different things

72
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:57.780
that are happening if we go to the log here you can see our initial commit and this is on a branch called

73
00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.980
M. we're going to learn about branches here and a second.

74
00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:06.780
But what's really cool about these commits is that let's say we wanted to add some code to our project

75
00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:12.630
so here we've got our main activity and I decide you know what I'm going to make a new string.

76
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.030
I'm going to call it name and I'm going to set it equal to you.

77
00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.080
Nick do my little semi-colon there boom.

78
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.280
I've added some new code.

79
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.530
And you can see as I made any space out of this line of code there's some green over here to the left

80
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:30.260
side and this is saying this is new additional stuff that you've added to your app.

81
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:35.070
So what we want to do is once we've added this information we're going to save then we're going to go

82
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.480
to VHS get ADD.

83
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:44.610
That's going to add our code and if we go back here and say commit changes you'll notice it has tracked

84
00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:49.370
this one new change that we've created over here on the left side it's showing for the main activity

85
00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:50.310
that Java.

86
00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:56.040
There was no code after set content view there was just that curly bracket but now we've added a space

87
00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:02.530
and our new line and we've added this new string called name so it's saying hey this is a new thing.

88
00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.400
Are you sure you want to add it.

89
00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.850
So we do want to do that let's you know put some sort of message with this that we're going to say maybe

90
00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:15.460
something like We added a variable something like that.

91
00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:21.200
That's not how you spell variable variable.

92
00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.120
Now I'm feeling dumb so let's just say we added a VAR.

93
00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.970
OK.

94
00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.350
So let's go ahead and commit that.

95
00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:33.360
And now if you look here inside of our log for version control the initial commit was in it and then

96
00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:39.660
we said we added a VAR K and you can see this is like the next point in time.

97
00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:45.660
So what's cool about this is if we want to we can always go back in time with something so let's say

98
00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:52.110
for example I decide that you know what I don't need this string Nick any more Instead I'm going to

99
00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:59.100
make a new int called age and I get a set it equal to 67 right like something like this if I'm going

100
00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.610
to save this code.

101
00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:08.610
Well I have an opportunity here to go to if I go to local changes and I unpack default here I can take

102
00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:15.390
my main activity and I can right click here and I can say you know what I want to revert and I say reverse

103
00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:16.230
there and boom.

104
00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.180
It brings back the code that I have.

105
00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:22.890
So if you ever make a mistake do something wrong you can always go ahead and do that and we'll take

106
00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:25.550
you back to the starting point which is pretty great.

107
00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:30.360
So the other thing that I wanted to talk about with get is that you can make things called branches

108
00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:34.290
that's where if you're working like a new feature or something like that you might want to make a branch

109
00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:38.240
in a branches separately creating a separate timeline.

110
00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:43.440
So if we go ahead down here to where it says Get master this is pretty hidden and the bottom want to

111
00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.690
make sure you see this.

112
00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:49.980
You can go ahead and click this in say a new branch you can give your branch name so let's say we were

113
00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:55.920
going to be adding Facebook to our app or something we could go ahead and click on this and say All

114
00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:02.850
right we're going to make a new branch we're going to call it an F. B stuff and we'll go ahead and add

115
00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:03.120
that.

116
00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:07.980
So now we have this new branch called FBI stuff so let's go ahead and you know say we're going to add

117
00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:17.140
some stuff like We love Facebook or just adding a comment here so we'll save this version control.

118
00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:24.480
We want to commit changes and if we go down here we can see it's added some stuff there so we're going

119
00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.450
to say something like Facebook rocks.

120
00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.370
OK.

121
00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:32.500
And we'll go ahead and commit that if we go now to the log.

122
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:36.420
You can see we have Facebook rocs this Newcomen.

123
00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:42.600
But look the master branch is still on the commit called we added a VAR whereas this new branch FBI

124
00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.880
stuff it's here.

125
00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:50.070
So let's go ahead and add something else like we'll just pretend like we had some other Facebook stuff

126
00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:55.180
like oh log in now works or something like that.

127
00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.740
So add that and we'll save and then we're going to go.

128
00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:07.300
VC Yes commit changes and say you know log in added or something like that and boom all of a sudden

129
00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:11.950
look there's another commit and you can see FBI stuff is going even further.

130
00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:17.880
So what's cool now is we can actually take you know it's nice to have these two branches and if we want

131
00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:24.810
to we can go ahead and if we go back down here to the bottom we can click on master and say check out

132
00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:30.000
and that will go back to this point in time and so you can see those two comments that are made are

133
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.260
completely gone.

134
00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:36.660
And if I want to go back to the FBI stuff and I say check that out boom it brings back the Facebook

135
00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:41.760
stuff so I can kind of travel between these two points in time which is neat.

136
00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:48.210
But let's say you know I wanted to go ahead and you know bring these two worlds together.

137
00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:52.970
Well what I can do is while I have master checked out here if I go.

138
00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:57.780
Let's see right now I am on the stuff so check out Master.

139
00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:04.210
So make sure it says get Master down here so I'm at this point in time I can go to FBI stuff.

140
00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:07.470
And here I'm going to say merge and that's going to bring.

141
00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:13.840
Look at that master up to the same point as FBI stuff and it's essentially added those two things together.

142
00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:17.650
So you know we have the string name as equal to Nick but we also have this.

143
00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:21.990
And so it sort of encapsulates that all in Kent.

144
00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:25.180
So this is kind of a really quick intro into get.

145
00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:26.680
There's so much more that you can do with this.

146
00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:31.690
Like I said a ton of possibility when you're working with a team with Get it makes it so much easier

147
00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:32.570
to work with.

148
00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:37.780
But just wanted to give you a nice introduction into this so I hope you enjoyed learning about a version

149
00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:41.450
control system and it helps you manage your code that much better.
