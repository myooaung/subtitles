1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,040
All right.

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:06,290
Welcome to the second lecture here where we're going to go ahead and finish getting this a.r course

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,790
services onto our phones so then we can test out the app.

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,900
So what we need to do now is we need to get Adeeb working and to confirm that this works.

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:21,430
Again you should be in the platform tools directory you're going to do a dot slash and then ADP.

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:27,780
And if you hit enter on this you should see some texts like this that basically says hey ADP is working

7
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:34,730
and to really test this we're going to do a dot slash and do a D and then space devices.

8
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:38,760
And this is going to tell us all the devices that are currently connected to the computer.

9
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:48,440
So I have my Google pixel to plugged in and I have it connected via USP So it's listed here and that's

10
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,810
its device name.

11
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:55,680
So now that we have this then we can you know start talking to that specific device and there's all

12
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:02,490
sorts of instructions in here about how to work with this and you know get to whatever device it is

13
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,490
that you want to be working with.

14
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:09,390
So you can kind of see from here when you're trying to list out the devices.

15
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,130
Let's go ahead and see here.

16
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:17,520
You can connect also via Wi-Fi which is kind of interesting I thought.

17
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:21,710
But anyways lots of different things that you can use.

18
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:29,930
So with this what we want to do is go back and we want to install this A-R core preview.

19
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,850
A B kit which this is in our download directory.

20
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,560
So what we're going to do is we're going to open up our terminal here and I'm going to kind of move

21
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,070
it off to the side so I can still see what's going on with this web page.

22
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,630
Maybe I'll kind of squash this off to the side.

23
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,320
Now that didn't work as well as I thought.

24
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,470
There we go.

25
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:50,970
So that will have some room to see both.

26
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:59,490
So again we're going to do our dot slash HDB and then we're going to type the install space dash our

27
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:06,750
dash D and then we need to get to the A-R core Dasch previous AP K-8 which for me is in my download

28
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,500
directory.

29
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:15,980
So I'm going to do slash capital users slash Zappy code and if I hit tab it's doing this autocomplete

30
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,980
for me if you get the autocomplete that's a good sign that you're on the right path.

31
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,330
Once I'm in Zappy code then I can get to my downloads so I'm going to start typing downloads.

32
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:25,390
There we go.

33
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:29,210
And then I want to get to the core and have a hit tab.

34
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,930
Well that gives me the zip.

35
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:37,710
And in fact I remember we actually move that to the desktop so I'm going to change this now to get to

36
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,680
the desktop.

37
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,310
There we go.

38
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:46,510
And now if I start typing a our core and the hit tab.

39
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,780
Oh good we get the dash.

40
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,480
And then let's do preview.

41
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,470
AP Okay.

42
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,820
Excellent.

43
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:57,210
So that means that open up there will go ahead and hit enter here.

44
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:03,440
Make sure when you do this that you have your device turned on plugged in via US be you set up that

45
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,130
you're going to be a developer and that you you know did us be debugging.

46
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:13,260
So you'll see the success message if everything worked out and on my device like a little pop up message

47
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,450
that said hey you know we just got things up and running here.

48
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:23,160
So if this is the case if you got all this fixed and I know this is really kind of weird step that we

49
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,630
have here in order to get to the finish line.

50
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:30,980
But with all of that now we can actually go ahead and open up this project.

51
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:36,870
So I'm going to go back to android studio and I'm just going to hit run on this app I'm going to select

52
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,530
my phone and we'll go ahead and get that running.

53
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:47,280
So basically this app it will try to detect the floor and then once it detects some floor it will allow

54
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,540
you to place a little Android doods on the ground which is pretty fun.

55
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,500
And so I think you'll enjoy seeing that.

56
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,290
Also you get to see a little preview of my basement here where I'm recording this.

57
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:06,110
So let's go ahead and get visor up and run in here so you can see what this looks like so you can see

58
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:08,330
my phone.

59
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:14,130
I'm going to move the camera off here to the side and I'm going to have it trying to take this ground.

60
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:17,220
I have this inflatable pumpkin from Halloween still out on the ground.

61
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,120
But look at that.

62
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,220
You can see it's picking up some of the ground here that's where like that red is.

63
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:26,260
I know it looks pretty blurry there but you can sort of see those winds that are coming up.

64
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:30,310
I'll get a little bit closer so that you can see that trying to be really steady.

65
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:37,710
But if I tap my finger and all of a sudden pop up these little Android dudes everywhere on the screen.

66
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,970
So that is so cool.

67
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:44,700
And these are completely 3D so I can you know move in get really close to them come back you know like

68
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,160
I'm totally part of the world now like this.

69
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:53,930
So a pretty cool little A-R world that we can get connected with here.

70
00:04:54,180 --> 00:05:00,030
So that is the A Our core example app that was provided by Google.

71
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,880
Now as far as you know how all this worked.

72
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,240
Well there's a couple of things that fed into this.

73
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:12,010
So the big one here is the assets as far as the 3D objects are involved and so the little Android dude

74
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,830
whose name here is Andy.

75
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:17,390
There's lots of different things that create this guy.

76
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,700
The piano this is sort of his skin.

77
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:26,960
Everything that creates him but these Drobe files as far as I was able to research are able to create

78
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,590
the 3D model of him and his shadow.

79
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,030
There's also a image file for his shadow and the trigram.

80
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:38,010
This is what sort of goes on the floor is when it's detecting where the floor is.

81
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:45,090
So it's a combination of these sort of skins for these 3D objects that come together as far as the coding

82
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:46,460
files goes.

83
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,400
The big one is this.

84
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,370
Hello our activity.

85
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:54,470
So inside of here this is where it does all the work of like detecting the ground.

86
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:59,640
And once the user taps on the screen getting one of those little and used to show up.

87
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:04,380
So in fact if you wanted to go test this out you could just go ahead and do find if you search for Andy

88
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:08,490
you can see this is the one particular place where Andy gets created.

89
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:14,940
So if you had your own 3-D objects that you wanted to go in there then you could go ahead and you know

90
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:22,140
plop them into here and you could also change the size of your android like make it super huge and it's

91
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,150
just going to dominate the whole screen.

92
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,450
There's all sorts of different things that you could do here.

93
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:32,470
So with a hard core this really advanced technology.

94
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:35,250
And like I said this Web site that we have here.

95
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,800
Excellent resource for you if you want to go learn more.

96
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,560
Like when you get to the bottom here for the next steps There's this awesome API references and if we

97
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:49,290
go back to that main screen there's some really cool guides in order to help you build your very first

98
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,460
app so.

99
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,290
So pretty cool stuff here.

100
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:57,720
You can kind of choose your own way when you got to go about this but I hope you enjoyed checking out

101
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,450
our core and all the functionality there.
