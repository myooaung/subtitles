00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.130
In this lecture we're going to make it so the user can now send out a tweet they already have the ability

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.740
to log in follow and unfollow people and now they're going to be able to actually send out a tweet.

3
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.380
So this is a really exciting lecture for us.

4
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.360
We're going to use a dialog box to do that.

5
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.270
It should be pretty interesting.

6
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:18.870
Let's go ahead and dive into it.

7
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.010
So the first thing that we want to do is many users logged in we want to show a little menu here so

8
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.450
that they can tweet.

9
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.550
We also want to give them the option to log out in case they don't you know don't want to be in anymore.

10
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.010
So if this is the case what we're going to do is we need to create a new menu.

11
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.240
So let's open up our little resource directory here.

12
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.430
And we don't have a menu so we're going to have to make a new Android resource directory.

13
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.670
And this is going to be for menus.

14
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.020
So go ahead and create that first.

15
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.030
Then we're going to right click and say hey we need a new menu resource file and I'm going to call this

16
00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.180
one just tweet underscore menu and we'll go ahead and create that.

17
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.640
So I'm going to move over to the text version of this.

18
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.620
I feel like it's the easiest way to work here.

19
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.330
And we want to add two items the first one is if somebody wants to tweet.

20
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.060
And so if that's the case we're just going to say item and then we'll do Android title and we're going

21
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.410
to set this equal to tweet and to any E's on a tweet.

22
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.460
There we go.

23
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.170
Then we need to set a proper ID on this.

24
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.890
So the idea is just going to be all lowercase tweet.

25
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.810
Will go ahead and wrap that up then we are going to do a second item we'll just go ahead and copy and

26
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:34.820
paste that.

27
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.940
And the title for this one is going to say log out and the ID for this one is going to be log out.

28
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.140
So those are our two menu options there.

29
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:52.710
We'll go back to the project here and now we want to get over to our users activity.

30
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.240
Okay.

31
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.640
So with that in place we got to make sure that we inflate the menu and then also allow some code to

32
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.630
be run when the user selects an option.

33
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:09.660
So we're going to go up to the top here above the Create and the first method that we're going to implement

34
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:19.340
is the on create and create we want create and this is the Options menu just like that.

35
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.440
So we are going to return that super on create eventually but the first thing that we want to do is

36
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:32.670
get a menu inflator which we'll call menu inflator and this will be a new menu in flater let's pass

37
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:42.160
in this and after we've done that we want to say menu inflator to inflate and then we'll pass in first.

38
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:52.770
Our menu We'll get to that by our DOT menu not tweet menu should be showing up for some reason that's

39
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.910
not appearing but I'm going to guess that this is like those other areas we were seeing earlier with

40
00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.550
Android studio so I trust that it's there.

41
00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:05.270
So I'll leave it there for the moment and then we want to pass in the actual menu object.

42
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.690
Okay.

43
00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:13.470
So that will inflate our menu then the next thing that we need to do is respond when somebody selects

44
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.500
one of the menu item so this is going to be on options item selected.

45
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.720
So again with this one we want to return that eventually but before that we want to do a little statement

46
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.320
to see what the user has selected.

47
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.880
So the first check that we're going to see is if the user is trying to tweet.

48
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:38.820
So if they are in fact trying to tweet we need to get this item that was just passed through here and

49
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:48.240
we're going to say item that get item ID and we're going to see if this is equal to capital our DOT

50
00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.910
and you that tweet underscore menu.

51
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.460
OK.

52
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.020
And again that's showing up red for us.

53
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.940
But I trust that that's going to work.

54
00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:03.480
And then in the situation we're going to do another half say if we're going to check the same thing

55
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:10.410
except for this time we want to see if this is equal to oh I see you what my air here.

56
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:18.180
So this is actually supposed to be just tweet and or I'm referencing that part was correct but here

57
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.940
we actually want to do our ID.

58
00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:26.850
So we're going to do our ID and this is where it will do or Crace tweet and of course it does recognize

59
00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:27.670
that either.

60
00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.180
And we'll do our ID in lower case log out.

61
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.690
So these areas are kind of driving me nuts here is something like go ahead and hit run.

62
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:42.240
This will hopefully clear these out for us and we can even check out and make sure that the menus showing

63
00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.560
up just like it's supposed to.

64
00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.870
So this will kind of be a nice double whammy for us.

65
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.510
So wait for a second for that to load.

66
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.930
And look our heirs disappear just as we expected.

67
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.480
And now if we wait for it to open up should see that menu.

68
00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.800
And boom there's those two beautiful options.

69
00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:06.020
So with that behind us the code for logging out should be fairly simple.

70
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.230
We're just going to say parse user log out.

71
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.560
Simple enough and after we've done that we want to move back to the logon screen so we're going to make

72
00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:25.870
a new intent which will just say lower case intent is equal to a new capital intent and we want to first

73
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:32.180
get the application context and then we want to move over to Main activity class so we can go back to

74
00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:37.200
the log in screen and then we just want to start that activity.

75
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.970
So we'll go ahead and pass in the intent there.

76
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.270
But then what happens if someone wants to tweet Well this is the really fun part of this right.

77
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:52.490
This is where we're going to write out this dialog box and makes it so that user can compose a tweet.

78
00:05:52.810 --> 00:06:00.370
So first thing that we need to do here inside of our tweet side we need to get an alert dialog.

79
00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:07.480
So we're going to say alert dialog dot builder and we're going to just call this our builder and say

80
00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:16.330
this is equal to a new capital alert dialog builder and we'll just pass this as a context.

81
00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:23.050
Then once we have that in place we want to take this builder and set a title for our alert sort of set

82
00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:26.070
builder set title.

83
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:30.280
It will just pass inside of here send a tweet.

84
00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:32.030
Excellent.

85
00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:38.280
So with that in place then we need to go get access to the edit text that's going to come from there

86
00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.370
so we're going to make a new edit text.

87
00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:49.220
And let's just go ahead and call this a tweet edit text just like that.

88
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:52.840
Oh we have a tweet we want to do tweet so tweet at it.

89
00:06:52.840 --> 00:07:00.840
Text is equal to a new added text and we'll go ahead and pass this for the context.

90
00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:07.780
Now that we have that we're going to take our builder and we're going to say set view on that and we're

91
00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:14.470
going to pass in that tweet added text that we had just created and then we are finally able to start

92
00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:15.880
setting some buttons here.

93
00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:20.530
So we're going to say for example build or set positive button.

94
00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.010
So the positive button this is saying they want to send their tweet.

95
00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:31.990
So we'll just type in there and send And we want this to be a new dialogue interface with an on click

96
00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:36.130
listener is this sort of coming back to you all the code that we had written for this when we first

97
00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:40.240
learned in this situation let's just go ahead and log out.

98
00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:44.850
That you know we had this successful thing you know the send button was hit.

99
00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:48.160
So we'll just go ahead and put info inside of here.

100
00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.340
And the thing that we want to send out is the tweet.

101
00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:56.110
So we're going to get to our tweet edit text.

102
00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:59.490
Get text not transition.

103
00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:00.500
OK.

104
00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:03.840
Tweet edit text get text.

105
00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:04.650
There we go.

106
00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:08.790
And with this we want to convert that into a string.

107
00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:09.670
Excellent.

108
00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:14.880
And we should be able to log that out and we'll do a semi-colon there.

109
00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:16.420
So that's our positive button.

110
00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:23.640
Now let's talk about the negative button we're going to say build or set and negative button.

111
00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:27.630
And so for this one we want them to say you know what.

112
00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:29.180
I actually didn't want to tweet.

113
00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.420
I want to cancel this.

114
00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:39.540
But we still need a new dialogue interface and inside of this one we're also going to log out some information.

115
00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:45.880
But in this case we're just going to you know say things didn't work out so we're going to say log and

116
00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:56.050
we'll put it here and just say no I don't want to tweet.

117
00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:57.320
OK.

118
00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:03.250
So put a little exclamation point at some anger then it's really important with this that we take the

119
00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:08.530
dialogue interface that was passed inside of here and we do a dot cancel on this.

120
00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:13.030
This will make it so the box disappears and if you don't do that you're going to be stuck with this

121
00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:15.490
alert dialog in front of them the whole time.

122
00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:21.220
And then once you've done all this we can take our builder and say show to finally show that dialog

123
00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:22.360
box.

124
00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.350
So with this all in place let's go ahead and give it a test.

125
00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:30.160
Of course we don't have any information in here to actually send this into parks but that will be our

126
00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:30.670
next step.

127
00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:34.100
We just want to make sure our alert dialog is working like we thought.

128
00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:35.800
So let's open this up.

129
00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:38.060
Let's say I want to tweet Oh look at that.

130
00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:38.930
That looks excellent.

131
00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:44.200
Let's get Lague cat ready to go here and let's say I want to tweet out my first message.

132
00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.040
Hello.

133
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.210
And I hit send.

134
00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:48.230
We do that.

135
00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:55.160
And down here below I'm not getting any sort of information that this came through.

136
00:09:55.540 --> 00:10:00.820
But it's also showing that this was disconnected so many will connect to the new look at that you connect

137
00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:03.730
to the right that's running and it will show you the correct information.

138
00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:05.140
OK so it said Hello.

139
00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:09.000
Let's say I also want to tweet but this time I hit cancel.

140
00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:11.100
Well then you'll see I don't want to tweet.

141
00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:13.840
So we know that that successfully working.

142
00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:18.870
So really the only step for us now is to make it so that when someone hits that positive button that

143
00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:24.250
we can actually go send a tweet on their behalf that actually log something inside of parce.

144
00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:29.530
So right below where we're logging out the information that's saying Hey we were able to successfully

145
00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:31.690
edit this tweet or send out this tweet.

146
00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:34.760
Now let's actually go and make a parse object.

147
00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:40.300
So we're going to say parse object and we're actually going to be creating a new class here and say

148
00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:50.690
parse object that we'll call tweet is equal to a new parse object and inside of here we want to pass

149
00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:53.640
the name of the class or we're going to do a capital tweet.

150
00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:57.960
Remember this is a new class that's going to show up right here on the left side.

151
00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.000
So let's get back to our code.

152
00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:05.320
And with that in place then we can start putting some information into this tweet.

153
00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:09.580
And the main things that we want to know is what did the person tweet and what user tweeted that.

154
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:16.150
Those are kind of the two key pieces so we'll start first and say What did the user want to tweet.

155
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:22.940
And so we're going to say tweet got put in the key for this one is going to be a tweet and then the

156
00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:27.400
information that we want to send in there is this tweet edit text.

157
00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:29.570
Get text string.

158
00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:31.600
So go ahead and paste that in.

159
00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:37.970
And the next one is to determine or put inside what the user name is of the person that wanted to send

160
00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:44.750
this or we're going to do lowercase username and then we want to pass in whatever the current users

161
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:52.790
name is so we're going to do parse user get current user or get user name.

162
00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:53.320
Right.

163
00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:54.850
And that'll pass that through.

164
00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:59.540
So with that in place we just now have to save this tweet in the background so we're going to say tweet

165
00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.930
save and background.

166
00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:06.740
We do want to call back with this information to tell the user whether or not it was successful and

167
00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:08.610
to close out that dialog box.

168
00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:13.110
So we're going to say new save callback.

169
00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:18.290
And with this first thing that we're going to do is check for an exception.

170
00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:24.080
So I will say all right if you are equal to null then we have no problems.

171
00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:31.370
Life is great and we'll just go ahead and do a toast here to tell the user hey everything was successful.

172
00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:40.600
So do TOSed make text and we'll go ahead and pass our user's activity here.

173
00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:45.660
So users activity class excuse me.

174
00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:54.410
This is the context and then we're going to say whatever it is that we want to say like tweet sent exclamation

175
00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:55.290
point.

176
00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:57.380
That seems like a good message to share.

177
00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:03.130
And then we'll do a short toast to let them know this and we've got to do a show at the end.

178
00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:08.450
So that's if things are successful now if things didn't work we're going to have an elde situation and

179
00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:10.010
we still want to show a toast.

180
00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:14.990
But this is going to be a toast that basically says hey things didn't work out.

181
00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:19.410
Sorry to let you know about it so we'll go ahead and put that toast down below.

182
00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:20.100
OK.

183
00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:22.850
So this one instead of saying tweet sent.

184
00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:31.200
We're going to say tweet failed and then we'll go ahead and do a little frowny face to really say yeah

185
00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:33.590
things just didn't work out here.

186
00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:37.750
So with all this in place let's go ahead and run this.

187
00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:38.820
See what we get

188
00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:44.840
get emulator here is.

189
00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:46.090
Check it out.

190
00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:54.430
Here comes the app and will hit the menu.

191
00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:57.530
Say we want to tweet our first tweet Shelby.

192
00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:59.360
I like cheese.

193
00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:02.430
It's my classic phrase I'll go ahead and send that.

194
00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:03.910
Look at that says tweet sent.

195
00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:05.160
Let's confirm.

196
00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:07.800
So right now you can see there's no class that says tweet.

197
00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.570
But if we reload the page look here's a tweet.

198
00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:11.840
It has one object.

199
00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:16.190
And from the user name of Nick the tweet was I like cheese.

200
00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:16.860
OK.

201
00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:20.440
Well we're getting really really close with this Twitter app.

202
00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:25.070
We have all the users that we can follow we can now tweet ourselves we can log out.

203
00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:29.980
The last step is to be able to view everybody's tweets and I'll go ahead and show you how to do that

204
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:30.830
in the next one.
