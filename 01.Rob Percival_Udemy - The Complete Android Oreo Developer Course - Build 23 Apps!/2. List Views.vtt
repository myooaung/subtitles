00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.360
We're going to kick out the section by learning about list views and list views are a super important

2
00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.760
skill to have for making Android apps.

3
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:13.730
In fact I'd argue on your phone you probably don't have an app that doesn't use lists views may be outside

4
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.320
of games like they're use in almost every single app so I have more to talk about that but let's go

5
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.080
ahead and start new projects so that we can learn how to work with list views.

6
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:28.430
So just go ahead and create a new project I'm going to call mine list view demo Cain and we'll go ahead

7
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:29.630
and start this project.

8
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.050
We just want our empty activity and that all looks good.

9
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.930
We'll go ahead and hit finish there.

10
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.960
So like I said What is a list view a list view is something that just lists out a bunch of items that

11
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.750
I know that sounds kind of dumb but think about it in your messaging app.

12
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.200
You list out all the context that you've recently had messages with.

13
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.890
And on the Facebook app it lists out a bunch of posts in the Twitter out it lists out a bunch of tweets

14
00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.630
if you go to the Settings app inside of Android is going to show all the different things that you can

15
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.720
get to so anywhere you see some sort of list that you can scroll through.

16
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.480
I mean think of a music app when you're scrolling through all the songs for a particular artist or you

17
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.910
know a bunch of albums for a particular artist like that is a list for you everywhere.

18
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.440
So now that we've got our project open let's go ahead and first move to our design here.

19
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.450
So let's move over to our activity main SML.

20
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.110
Essentially what we want to do is we visually want to add our list view first and then we'll come through

21
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.570
and programmatically add some things to that list view.

22
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.820
So we have by default that text you that always comes when we start a new project so let's go ahead

23
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.700
and delete that and then we're going to bring down our list view here bring it into the project.

24
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.870
You can see there it is.

25
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.970
Now with this we've got to go ahead and set some constraints so I'm just going to go ahead and hit Plus's

26
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.500
here and it's going edge to edge which is exactly what we want there so we have a list view that's filling

27
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.320
up the whole screen here.

28
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.060
But you'll notice there's nothing inside of it.

29
00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.330
Right.

30
00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.910
Like if we go ahead and run this app on the emulator it's going to essentially be a blank app and that's

31
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:08.060
because we have to tell the list view about what should go inside of there.

32
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:14.340
So this is where we're going to have to move to our programming to say hey you know we should fill this

33
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.880
up with something and you can see here in the emulator nothing going on.

34
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.510
So in order to do that let's go ahead and give an ID to our list view so we can be sure to get in our

35
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.110
code.

36
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.950
I'm just going to call it my list view just like that.

37
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:38.430
Now we can come over here to our main activity and here on the uncreate function we are going to get

38
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.440
access to that list view or first kind of reference we're going to say we want a list view that we're

39
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.200
going to call my list view.

40
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:53.100
And we're going to use our find view by ID in order to get this.

41
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.710
And we're just going to go ahead and do our classic our DOT I.D. dot and then this is where we'll start

42
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:05.460
typing my list for you and you should have an hour to complete here if everything worked out correctly.

43
00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.670
Oh almost forgot our semi-colon there so once you have that in place then we want to start filling up

44
00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:19.160
this list view with some items so for as an example let's go ahead and have a list view that shows all

45
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.080
the family members in your particular family so go ahead.

46
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.150
Hit pause on the video.

47
00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.400
Now I want you to create an array that contains the name of your family member.

48
00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.800
A little mid lecture challenge for you here make an array that contains your family member's name.

49
00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:34.320
Hit pause.

50
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.380
Do that now.

51
00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:36.150
All right.

52
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.230
So I just wanted you to make an array.

53
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:44.160
What I ended up doing was I said array list and I want this to be of type string because that's going

54
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.820
to hold a bunch of strings over family members names and I'm going to call this my family and I'm going

55
00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:57.120
to have this be equal to a new array list of type string.

56
00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.850
And can't forget that semi-colon can.

57
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.960
So once I had my family here just went ahead and added some family members so I said you know dot add

58
00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.450
and I added for example myself.

59
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:16.020
Nick then we'll go ahead in here let's add some other family member members will do.

60
00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:25.950
Sarah and my family let's go ahead and also add someone else let's add John.

61
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.340
And then lastly let's go ahead and add the family dog.

62
00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:36.290
So we're going to say let's add our family dog Fido and look at that.

63
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.450
We now have an array complete ready to use.

64
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.160
Now what's awesome about arrays enlist is they just work perfectly together right.

65
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:51.060
So here literally in the name array list right we're lists arrays list out things in a particular particular

66
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:57.120
order list views are really great at showing array list so it's going to be really awesome to sort of

67
00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.470
marry these two things now.

68
00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.460
So how do we get the information from this array inside of this list.

69
00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:03.610
Let's do that now.

70
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.970
So the bridge that's going to connect this array my family to this list view called my list view is

71
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:14.610
something called an array adapter and think of an array adapter as basically taking the information

72
00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.190
from an array and filling it inside of a list view.

73
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.800
So you're going to see a little bit more as it works as I type this.

74
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.380
But just remember the array is sort of the bridge between the data and actually getting things to show

75
00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:26.900
up inside of a list view.

76
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.160
So what we're going to do is we're first going to create a new array adapter so just type out.

77
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:37.860
Capital array adapter and it's going to ask you you know what type this is going to be and we're working

78
00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.860
with strings so we're going to do a string array adapter.

79
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.540
And let's go ahead and give it a name I know this is not very original but I'm just going to call it

80
00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.070
a re adapter.

81
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:52.530
And then what we're going to do is we're going to set this equal to a new capital array adapter of type

82
00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:52.980
string.

83
00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:53.680
Good.

84
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:59.100
And you can see in order to initialize one of these There's a couple of different options that we could

85
00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:04.320
put in here and I'm trying to get that list to show up again but the first thing that we need to pass

86
00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.160
inside of there.

87
00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:09.860
In fact I'm just going to delete this because I really want you to be able to see what's in there new

88
00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.730
array adapter of strings.

89
00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:12.430
There we go.

90
00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:16.860
So the first thing that we got to pass through is the context right and we've done that before.

91
00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.300
That's just going to be this.

92
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.270
So I'll just go ahead and type this.

93
00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:24.930
Then the next thing that it's looking for is it's looking out for a layout saying you know how should

94
00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.070
I display this information.

95
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:30.300
And the reason for this is because list views can show things a lot of different ways.

96
00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:36.270
You'll notice sometimes in a list view that you know there's images involved maybe it's just text you

97
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:40.170
know maybe it's a combination of the two there's lots of different options so for this let's go ahead

98
00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:45.360
and you know put our comma there to specify the layout that we want.

99
00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:56.160
We're going to type lower case Android Cayne Das Kapital our DOT layout dot and there's all sorts of

100
00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.030
different options here.

101
00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:01.110
So this is can be a place where you can go experiment if you want to go see what more of these things

102
00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:08.040
are like but we're going to use a simple list item one which basically allows you to display a string

103
00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:09.030
with a label.

104
00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:15.660
This is kind of the simplest version of having a list item shown inside of a list view.

105
00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:19.720
So we're going to go ahead and choose that so that's the second parameter that we're passing in here.

106
00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:23.310
And then for the last one it has to have some information.

107
00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:28.020
So for example you know it could be some sort of list or array whatever it is.

108
00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:32.940
And in our case that's you know my family so we're just going to go ahead and type my family there and

109
00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:34.230
we're going to pass it through.

110
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:37.230
So what have we done with this array adapter.

111
00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:44.520
We said hey you know we want you to take my family the array and you know turn it into the simple list

112
00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:47.560
item type of view inside of a list view.

113
00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:51.900
Now because we've created this array adapter this array adapter still doesn't know about the list view

114
00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:55.220
it only knows about the array and how it's supposed to display it.

115
00:07:55.410 --> 00:08:01.290
So in our next step we have to set this array adapter to the list view that we have.

116
00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:09.540
So we're going to take my list view and then we're going to say Dot set adapter and this is where we

117
00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:12.880
pass in our array adapter just like that.

118
00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:18.810
And by doing that now this list view knows OK I'm going to use this array adapter in order to convert

119
00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:21.990
everything and it should be all sunshine and rainbows from here on out.

120
00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:23.930
So let's go ahead and hit run.

121
00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:29.570
Check what this looks like on our emulator here should be quite exciting.

122
00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:34.810
OK there it comes.

123
00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:42.930
And once this opens up look at that we have got this nice list view showing up here's all the names

124
00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:46.710
there you can you know tap on these you see that cool little animation.

125
00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:51.420
We can't really scroll through any of it because there's not enough items to scroll if we did have enough

126
00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:57.570
in here you would see that in fact if you know you just go ahead and I want to properly copy this but

127
00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:04.190
let's copy this code and I'm going to paste it down a ton of times so you can see what happens here

128
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:09.450
but let's go ahead and run this one more time on the emulator.

129
00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:11.090
This is the fun part of programming right.

130
00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:15.350
You can do sort of ridiculous things like this in a couple of seconds and see what happens.

131
00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:21.480
And look at that now you can do a click drag and sort of see all these different items with the list

132
00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:21.620
view.

133
00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:28.620
So hopefully you've seen some of the magic of a list view in that you can take an array add as many

134
00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:29.650
things as you want to it.

135
00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:33.810
And because this array adapter just has to know about the re It's not like you have to manually say

136
00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:35.970
OK go you know show this thing this way.

137
00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:39.750
No it just sort of handles it as big or as small as your array is.

138
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:43.990
Your list view is going to show up properly as long as you have an array adapter.

139
00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:47.350
So very cool how all of that works out.

140
00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:47.870
All right.

141
00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:52.880
But you do notice so if for example you tap on one of these names we get this little animation to run

142
00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:55.970
so you see some code that's being run whenever that happens.

143
00:09:55.980 --> 00:10:00.420
But you know what if we want to run our own code to say you know when someone taps on a name maybe we

144
00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:02.580
want to log that name or something like that.

145
00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:07.860
Well let me show you how I can do that and I'm going to come back from our sort of ridiculous example

146
00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:08.700
here.

147
00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:11.010
We only need our four family members.

148
00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:17.220
So after we've done setting the adapter and all that good stuff we want to set in on click listener

149
00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:18.440
for our list view.

150
00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:22.930
So we're going to type out my list view dot and this will work.

151
00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:28.020
We're going to set on item click listener.

152
00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:29.160
There we go.

153
00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.960
So now we have to go ahead and create the actual listener.

154
00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:36.000
So we're going to say new adapter view.

155
00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:36.740
OK.

156
00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:42.960
That on item click listener and Android studio handles the rest for us so you might be interested to

157
00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:48.030
say OK on item click and you know we're getting all these different parameters here like what are these

158
00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:48.330
things.

159
00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:56.640
So the first one is the adapter view and this is basically the list view that we had coming through

160
00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:00.510
although the reason it's called an adapter view and it's got this question mark here is because there's

161
00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:05.010
different types of collections that you can have there is like a grid view and stuff like that.

162
00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:07.610
So they kind of leave that ambiguous by purpose.

163
00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:16.510
But we could if we wanted to take something like this and say you know adapter view dot set visibility

164
00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.670
and we go here I can't type correctly.

165
00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:21.190
There we go.

166
00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:25.890
Set visibility and we could do something like you know view dogone something like that and that would

167
00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:28.930
literally what would happen here is someone clicks on an item.

168
00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:31.560
It would have the whole thing disappear.

169
00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:32.600
So that's one thing that you could do.

170
00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:36.000
But I'm just kind of showing you that's how that works there.

171
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:43.470
The view is the actual individual item that has been clicked on so for example if I clicked on John

172
00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:49.700
it would be just this John thing here whereas adapter view is the entire list view there.

173
00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:54.510
The int is what item it is in the list so for example this is counted the same way as an array.

174
00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:59.030
So this is like 0 1 2 3 for just all the way through.

175
00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:03.360
And then the long this can be connected with sort of the idea of what's going on.

176
00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:07.650
And usually this is the same as the end but I really wouldn't work with that too much.

177
00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:15.960
So anyways what I want to do want you to do as a challenge is I want you to be able to log out someone's

178
00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:17.910
name when they are clicked on.

179
00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:18.360
OK.

180
00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:23.480
So someone you know clicks on one of these names like John Nick Feydeau whatever it is.

181
00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:26.130
I want that name to be logged out whenever that happens.

182
00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:26.370
So.

183
00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:26.850
Go ahead.

184
00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:28.120
Hit pause now.

185
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:30.160
All right.

186
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:33.880
So hopefully that little challenge went all right for you.

187
00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:40.750
Basically what I wanted to do was I want you to log whenever someone had tapped on something so you

188
00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:42.460
might say something like.

189
00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:45.930
Person selected.

190
00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:46.900
Right.

191
00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:52.510
And then you have to provide then what the person's name that was selected so you might be wondering

192
00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:53.870
you know how do you do this.

193
00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:57.720
Well first we get reference to the array which is my family right.

194
00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:02.500
So inside of here we're going to say my family and then we're going to do dot get right to pull something

195
00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:03.580
out of this array.

196
00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:05.690
And then we're going to pass in this.

197
00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:13.000
And so by passing in I this basically says OK if they tap the thing at the zero position we want to

198
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.950
go get the zero thing from the array if they did it the one the to whatever that's going to work through.

199
00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:24.650
So let's go ahead and run this and see if this is working for us again.

200
00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:27.570
We should have.

201
00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:33.060
We should be able to log out the person's name whenever they select somebody so there's our four names.

202
00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:35.710
Let's say go ahead and click on Sarah boom.

203
00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:37.720
Look at that person selected Sarah.

204
00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.030
I tap on John.

205
00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:42.210
John shows up Fido Sarah again.

206
00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:49.550
Nick oh isn't this cool so I mean in the short amount of time we have figured out how to list a bunch

207
00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:54.770
of items from an array and also run some code when someone has clicked on one of them and get access

208
00:13:54.770 --> 00:14:00.620
to the array item that is being displayed in that item so just some really awesome stuff that we've

209
00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:01.810
learned so far here.

210
00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:02.320
All right.

211
00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:07.070
So to really cement in and make sure that you're saying this concept which is so important because like

212
00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:12.230
I said now that you know what A-list viewers like don't you see this inside of almost every single app

213
00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:17.260
on your phone like at some point and apps got list out a bunch of information and ultimately they use

214
00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.000
List View so much.

215
00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:22.520
So I really want to make sure that you've got this so I've got a challenge for you.

216
00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:26.610
I want you to delete everything that we have so far.

217
00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:28.760
So in fact just go ahead.

218
00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:30.810
Select all of this.

219
00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:32.700
Go ahead and delete it.

220
00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:36.700
And I even want you to go here do you need to display delete that as well.

221
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:42.830
The list view that you have because I want you from scratch create a list view listing the name of your

222
00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:48.140
friends instead of your family this time instead of making it so that when someone taps on one of these

223
00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:49.750
that you're logging out the information.

224
00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:53.420
I want to display a little text message remember when we covered that.

225
00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:58.580
So that's sort of the difference here a little bit of a spin on that but I really want you to do this

226
00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:04.070
on your own remember the real learning takes place when you're struggling through in doing three things

227
00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:07.180
on your own so don't just go ahead and move forward and watch me do it.

228
00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:08.660
I want you to hit pause.

229
00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:10.040
Figure this out on your own.

230
00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:11.480
I believe in you.

231
00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.390
You can do it.

232
00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:14.090
So list out your friends.

233
00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:16.820
Make it so when you tap on one it shows a little toast of their name.

234
00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:17.900
All right go ahead.

235
00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:18.750
Hit pause.

236
00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:21.250
Now.

237
00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:25.330
All right so if you're watching this I assume you've done the challenge please not move forward till

238
00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:30.660
you've completed the challenge here maybe got to google some stuff re watch things whatever it is I

239
00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:33.340
want you to get through a little bit of that struggle here.

240
00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:36.420
But let me show you how I would accomplish this.

241
00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:42.670
So first thing we got to do is we visually got to bring in a list view Saunder containers here.

242
00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:46.480
We're going to go to our list view and drag and drop this guy out.

243
00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:48.400
And I'm going to show you a little bit different this time.

244
00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:53.440
So by default here by dragging it here there's going to be a little bit of margin here so when I hit

245
00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:59.650
these plus automatically you know there's a little bit eight point separation on each side so you can

246
00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:01.090
decide how you want to handle that.

247
00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:03.970
Laughs I remember we did zero so filled up the entire screen.

248
00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:08.110
I'm just going to show you some alternate options that you can use.

249
00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:11.890
So with this list view we got to give it some sort of ID.

250
00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:18.060
So if we want to since we're working with friends we could call this the friend list view for our ID

251
00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:20.060
that's definitely a possibility.

252
00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:23.810
So we'll go ahead and go back to our main activity here.

253
00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:28.170
So we want to get access to that list view soul say capitalist list view.

254
00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:31.990
And we're going to call this the friends list view.

255
00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:36.920
And we're going to go ahead and do our Classic find view by ID.

256
00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:44.300
And we'll do capital R dot ID dot friend list view just like that.

257
00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.810
Now we have access to the list view.

258
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:49.660
Next thing that we need to do is make an array of our friends.

259
00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:52.760
Now you could have handled this a lot of different ways.

260
00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:57.340
I'm going to show you a little bit of a special way that you can use array list to kind of do it all

261
00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:03.250
in one big line rather than having you know the add add add add and it just takes up a bunch of space

262
00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:13.030
here in Android studio but what we're going to do is we're going to say fine all array lists OK and

263
00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:15.180
we want this to be an array list of strings.

264
00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:18.340
We'll go ahead and pop that in there.

265
00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:23.970
We're just going to call this my friends right real original from my family right.

266
00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:29.110
But then what we're going to do here is we're going to say yes we want to create a new array list and

267
00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:31.490
this should be a bunch of strings.

268
00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:37.350
And then inside of here we're going to do is specify that this should come through as a list.

269
00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:43.180
And then what we're going to do is put some parentheses inside of here and we're just going to start

270
00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:54.220
listing out some people so for example I might say Mark and then you know I might say Jane another friend

271
00:17:54.220 --> 00:18:01.310
that we've got here so do Susie and then our very last one Jan came.

272
00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:04.660
So I got all my friends here let me go ahead and do that ending.

273
00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:06.360
Semi-colon there.

274
00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:06.970
All right.

275
00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:12.760
So after we've created all of our friends right the next step for us is that we have to create the array

276
00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:15.350
adapter and that's the thing that kind of converts it.

277
00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:17.090
Before we move forward.

278
00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:21.820
So you may have noticed I have a bit of an air here and that's because this as listed automatically

279
00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:22.410
import.

280
00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:28.180
So we want to do our import static method Java you tell array's that as list so that we can have that

281
00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:29.240
functionality.

282
00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:31.870
OK so that's going to go ahead and get rid of our Air Force.

283
00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:35.750
So now that we have the array we have the list view.

284
00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:38.320
Remember what is it that connects these two things.

285
00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:42.240
It's the array adapter so let's go ahead and make a new array adapter.

286
00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:44.570
And this is going to be working with strings.

287
00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:50.470
Just go ahead put a string in there and we'll call this our classic name array adapter and we'll say

288
00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:55.480
this is equal to a new capital array adapter of strings.

289
00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:58.900
And then we have to pass in this for our context.

290
00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:10.050
And then again we want to get the lay out that we want a lower case Android capital are not lay out.

291
00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:13.930
And this is where you get all your cool options and look since we recently you simple list item one

292
00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:16.480
it's nice up at the top for us.

293
00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:18.600
And then after that we have to pass the array.

294
00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:25.550
So in this case it's going to be my friends all right we'll put our ending semi-colon in there.

295
00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:29.380
So now we have the array adapter that knows you know how it's supposed to display it and it knows the

296
00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:29.650
array.

297
00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:31.900
But we've got to connect that to the list view.

298
00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.530
So we're going to take our friends list view.

299
00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:41.260
We're going to say let's set the adapter equal to our array adapter that we just created so I'll just

300
00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:43.460
type in array adapter there and boom.

301
00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:49.370
If we go ahead and run this we should see all of our friends showing up inside of the app.

302
00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:51.050
Let's go ahead and check this out

303
00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:57.130
mon emulator we believe in you.

304
00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:00.620
Hope you like my little Jingles while we're waiting for the emulator here and boom.

305
00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:01.150
Look at that.

306
00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.640
We've got our nice names listed out.

307
00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:04.460
OK.

308
00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:10.010
So once that's in place Remember we want to make it so that if someone taps on one of these names or

309
00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:14.060
clicks that we can actually show a little text message about that.

310
00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:18.460
So let's get back to our friends list view.

311
00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:19.090
OK.

312
00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:24.090
And we want to do a set on item click listener.

313
00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:29.090
So we're going to see a new adapter view on item click listener right.

314
00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:32.050
This is where we get all that cool information.

315
00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:38.680
And now we want to go ahead and use the TOSed functionality that we covered earlier in order to do that

316
00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:47.540
so if you don't remember to make a toast we do capital toast and we're going to say Dot make text and

317
00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:51.830
inside of here we're going to pass in a couple of things so the first one is we've got to get the application

318
00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:52.360
context.

319
00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:55.700
We're going to say get application context comma.

320
00:20:55.730 --> 00:21:00.290
The next thing that we're looking for is the actual message so we're going to put together two strings

321
00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:01.360
to make it friendly.

322
00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:05.870
We're going to say hello to our friends so we're going to say hello space and then we're going to add

323
00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:06.720
on to it.

324
00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:12.470
And this is where we've got to go grab the friend from the friendless So we're going to say my friends

325
00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:13.570
don't get.

326
00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:19.730
And then remember we want to pass this into I which says you know where it is that we're at in the list

327
00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:21.650
view.

328
00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:26.630
And then the last thing we have to pass for a toast is how long that toast message should appear.

329
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:31.760
So we're going to say toast length and you can choose whether it's going to be short or long.

330
00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:34.550
But let's go ahead and go with long for this one.

331
00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:41.170
And we've got to make sure after all of this that we do a dot show with our semi-colon there.

332
00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:41.850
OK.

333
00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:45.170
So this should be enough to complete everything that we've got.

334
00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:52.070
Let's go ahead and hit run here and see what this puppy looks like.

335
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:54.850
So shout out to you for doing all of this.

336
00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:55.280
Let's see.

337
00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:57.270
Moment of Truth here I tap on Susie.

338
00:21:57.410 --> 00:21:58.560
Hello Susie.

339
00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:01.940
I'd tap on Jan. We had to wait for Susie to go away.

340
00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:02.660
Hello Jan..

341
00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:04.640
Maybe we should have done a short toast message.

342
00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:06.050
I'm not sure but we tap on Mark.

343
00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:07.010
Hello Mark.

344
00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:07.660
OK.

345
00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:13.400
So congratulations on getting the first sort of basics of a list view down.

346
00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:17.460
I promise we're going to be working with list views a ton here after.

347
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:22.940
So don't worry if you're thinking like I kind of get the idea of it but I'm not 100 percent.

348
00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:28.160
Don't worry you're going to get lots and lots of practice in the source of course so congratulations

349
00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:32.110
on getting this all worked out but we've got more to learn let's keep movin.
