00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:07.050
Now that we know how to not only react when a button is pressed but get some data from fields that the

2
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:13.110
user can fill in a final bit of the puzzle we get up fully interactive is to display some information

3
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.350
to the user.

4
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.740
And that's actually pretty easy to do.

5
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.730
We can do it with a single line of code using something called a toast and we'll see why it's called

6
00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.280
a toast in a minute.

7
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:33.270
So I'm just going to add a single line of code here which says toast and I'm going to select the create

8
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.130
a new toast option and press enter.

9
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:44.280
And this will fill a lot of the code for me as well as import the host class.

10
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.650
So we use Toast Daut make text.

11
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.350
The context is the app itself where the toast is displayed.

12
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.900
So that's this.

13
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.960
Use this to refer to the app and then the text is what we want.

14
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.210
The toast to say.

15
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.030
And then we can decide whether we want the toast to appear for a short or long length of time using

16
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.740
length short or length long if we want.

17
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.150
And then we use dots show to show the text.

18
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.250
Simple as that.

19
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.580
So let's have a look and see how that actually displays on the screen.

20
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.530
If you're not an Android user it won't be a user interaction that you're familiar with because you don't

21
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.430
see this on iOS.

22
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:36.780
If I press the button now you can see it sort of pops up towards the bottom of the screen and pops up

23
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.500
is why it's called the toast.

24
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.230
In original versions of Android it sort of appeared from the bottom just like a bit of toast pops out

25
00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:45.580
the toaster.

26
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.160
So that's the only new bit of information for these videos.

27
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.340
If you're feeling super confident about that you're welcome to jump to the next video.

28
00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.550
But I would recommend you take my third and final challenge when it comes to interactivity.

29
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.320
Make sure you can put it all together.

30
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.220
And the challenge is to make this so it's pretty simple.

31
00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.000
You can probably guess right away how it's going to work.

32
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.250
We've got what is your name has a simple text view at the top there and then you enter your name.

33
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.530
Click the button and a text appears that says hello.

34
00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.430
And then whatever your name is.

35
00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:27.820
Now that last bit is the challenge bit of the challenge because what we haven't done before is taken

36
00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:35.410
a variable such as the contents of this text view and combined it with a string.

37
00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:36.850
In this case the words hello.

38
00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.220
So you're going to need to figure out how to take the word hello.

39
00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:45.110
Add it to the name and then display both of them in a text.

40
00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.540
So if you've done coding with another language that might be obvious how you do that or you may need

41
00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.300
to do a little bit of googling to figure out how to do it.

42
00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.300
Either way I think you'll be able to figure it out.

43
00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.460
If not don't worry just watch along with the video and I'll show you how to get it done.

44
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.900
So best of luck as well.

45
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.160
All right.

46
00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.160
Well here we go.

47
00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:18.070
Item so create a new project this time I'm going to leave the old project going to show you that you

48
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.500
can have more than one once.

49
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.300
And this one we'll call a toast demo.

50
00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.310
All the usual options.

51
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.800
Next Next finish.

52
00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:37.190
And being able to just do this sort of thing without thinking is really why we're doing all these examples

53
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.340
so that you don't want them each time.

54
00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:45.710
Oh was it that option or that option that is just there in your muscle memory to be able to create new

55
00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:48.800
apps which are interactive just like that.

56
00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:50.120
OK.

57
00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.570
So let's start with the lay out.

58
00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:01.180
Well get rid of the textfield get rid of protect as well.

59
00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:03.170
OK.

60
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:12.200
So we'll start with a simple text fee which we haven't used for a couple of videos but they're of course

61
00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.940
very simple

62
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.450
that will say What is your name.

63
00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.330
It's going to really center that.

64
00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.670
And then add in

65
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:42.270
the margins to look at emplace and then we'll use a plain text text field underneath that's OK for

66
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:46.780
leaving it there.

67
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:47.730
And

68
00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:51.830
we'll make it full with

69
00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.600
just change the right

70
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:11.910
constraint to 16 pixels at a top constraint which will link it to the text view.

71
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.790
And then finally we'll add our button.

72
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.140
Which will say

73
00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.970
click me.

74
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.120
And add some constraints as well.

75
00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:35.100
OK.

76
00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:44.060
I've used all the default IDs there which I think is fine a text view edit text and bottom but you're

77
00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:48.140
welcome to change things if you want the hand.

78
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.610
I'm going to add I didn't own click method.

79
00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:57.410
Now will pull it button clicked.

80
00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.010
All right.

81
00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.130
So we need to do with layout.

82
00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.430
So let's go with our code.

83
00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:09.940
We're creating a public method that doesn't return anything.

84
00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:18.200
It's called button clicked and it receives a single variable which is of a type view

85
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:30.130
and has a name view and it is in fact the button.

86
00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:38.030
And then we'll start by getting the value of the user's name which you remember had an idea of edit

87
00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:47.960
text so let's create an edit text called edit text and we're going to need to cast it or convert it

88
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:54.210
to an edit text and we're going to get it using fine V by ID.

89
00:06:54.230 --> 00:07:02.220
The ID is our DOT ID dot at text.

90
00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.090
And we're not going to log anything this time.

91
00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:15.320
We're just going to use a toast and or use the code predicter to give me the the code for a toast so

92
00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:17.110
to stop make text context.

93
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:27.030
Is this the app that we're in the text is going to be the name of the user.

94
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.770
So that's added text.

95
00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:39.990
Don't get text and then will convert it to a string and then we'll have a short length again.

96
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:46.140
In fact that's changed too long just so that you can see the difference and then sharp.

97
00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:50.790
Now the extra challenge which you maybe had to do a bit of googling for.

98
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:59.680
Or maybe if you've done coding for other platforms you knew how it worked is we need to combine two

99
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.170
strings.

100
00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:08.780
So the first string is going to be hello and then we use a plus to combine that with the name.

101
00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:11.220
So we get Halo and then don't forget the space.

102
00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:14.170
Otherwise it will all run together as a single word.

103
00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:18.580
And then we use a plus to combine that with the user's name.

104
00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:22.750
So that's it.

105
00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:25.010
That's from that.

106
00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:30.920
So what we've done is added two lines of code to our button clicked method and that's all we need is

107
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:35.290
to get a completely interactive app which takes some data from the user.

108
00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:36.280
They click a button.

109
00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:43.680
It responds to that and then it gives some data back in the form of a text.

110
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:44.860
So let's see it in action

111
00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:50.520
My name is Rob.

112
00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:51.440
Click that.

113
00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:52.910
Hello Rob.

114
00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:54.770
We gave.

115
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:56.840
Simple as that.

116
00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:04.200
So that went well for you and I hope you're starting to get the idea of how these two files work together

117
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:11.700
to control the layout and the functionality of your apps and also how you write some basic Java to make

118
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:16.910
your apps respond to things that they use that doesn't display data back to the user.

119
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:19.410
So we're almost there for the end of this first section.

120
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:23.850
We've just got one more thing to learn how to do and that is how to add images to make your apps look

121
00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.730
far more exciting and inviting.

122
00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:30.960
So we're going to learn how to do that in the next video and then we'll be able to make the big app

123
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.060
of this section the currency converter.
