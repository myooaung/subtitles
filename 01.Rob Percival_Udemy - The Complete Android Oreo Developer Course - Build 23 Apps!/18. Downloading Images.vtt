00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.320
All right in this lecture we are going to learn how to download images so we just had a great introduction

2
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.390
how to start downloading some web content.

3
00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.330
We're going to take things a bit further with actually downloading an image.

4
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.450
So let's go ahead and start a new project and let's just call it downloading

5
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:25.090
images and the default for everything.

6
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:31.300
And so kind of a form that this app is going to take is that we're going to have our screen we're going

7
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.610
to have a button that says download image if the user clicks on that button.

8
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.590
There's going to be an image view below.

9
00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.350
That's going to then display said image.

10
00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:46.690
And you can decide whatever image it is that you want we're going to be downloading a Bart Simpson image

11
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.920
Rob loves the Simpsons so in his honor we're going to be downloading an image of Bart.

12
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.140
But yeah that's what we're going for.

13
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.960
And you'll notice there's going to be a lot of similar code from what we saw last time but definitely

14
00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.370
a few different things.

15
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.090
So let's go ahead and start visually here.

16
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:09.630
Let's go ahead and get the SML part of this all set up and then we can go ahead and dive into the code.

17
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.850
So like I said we want to have a button up top saying download the image and then we want to have an

18
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.530
image you just below that

19
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.250
and here we go.

20
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.020
Android studio just needs the second to wake up there OK.

21
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.570
So first thing I want to do is let's get rid of our techs you that's in there by default and we'll bring

22
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:46.480
in a button and we want this button to go fairly close to each edge.

23
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:55.600
I might put you know something like 20 and 20 on that something from the top.

24
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.420
We need to change that so it goes all the way to the edge.

25
00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.580
There we go.

26
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.220
And go ahead and change the text on this.

27
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:12.580
You want that to say download image K for it's on click

28
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.040
maybe just call that download image as well.

29
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.820
All right.

30
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.660
So that's looking good as far as the button goes.

31
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.020
Then we want to have a nice big image below where we can show Bart.

32
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:36.450
So go ahead and drag him out there and let's try that one more time

33
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.510
oh it's looking for some sort of something in there.

34
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.730
Well we just wanted to be transparent so just choose the window background.

35
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:57.060
I mean we could pick a color here but you know I don't really want to fill that with anything right

36
00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.350
now.

37
00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.710
In fact I'm just going to go ahead and delete what we have there.

38
00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:08.280
All right so with this image you want to make sure that it's going where it needs to go so we'll go

39
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:18.140
ahead and add some constraints here maybe just make these 20 all around

40
00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.270
them go 20 on that.

41
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.840
Oh it went to the top of the page.

42
00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.980
We're going to have to add some extra though even more than that.

43
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.180
Let's see what 80 looks like.

44
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.260
Yeah that's good.

45
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.000
OK.

46
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.010
So with that let's go ahead and change this up.

47
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.330
So we have this filling the entire screen.

48
00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.860
Yeah.

49
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.120
There we go now.

50
00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.820
Now we're talking hoops and I have switched this now.

51
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:51.530
There we go.

52
00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.090
That's back to the usual screen size that we like seen.

53
00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.810
OK.

54
00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.460
So with this we want to make sure.

55
00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.960
Let's see if we have the on click which is download image and then for this image you must just leave

56
00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.340
its ID as image view.

57
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.030
And so let's go back to our code here.

58
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:19.920
First thing is let's make that method for whenever someone taps on the button so say download image

59
00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:26.200
taken a view that is called view right.

60
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:34.890
So this is when someone's going to tap on it let's make sure this is working here for just say button

61
00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:46.630
tapped OK and we'll go ahead and check that ok and go ahead and run this on the emulator and sense that

62
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.420
emulator is not running ready to go.

63
00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:55.750
Maybe we should move onto the other parts of our code so that we can make some good progress about what

64
00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:56.380
we're working with.

65
00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.580
So the first thing that we need to do is we need to get access to the image view.

66
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:07.750
So we're going to bring it out here as a property and we'll say image view and we'll just give it the

67
00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:18.730
boring name of image view and then here inside of our create we'll say image view is equal to our classic

68
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:27.900
fine view by id our DOT ID that we need the image you

69
00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.810
an android studio is not giving the pop up.

70
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:34.730
There we go.

71
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:40.470
Just because it's taken all its power trying to get the emulator up and running.

72
00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:45.310
Bullets hit enter on that so you get the nice import stuff.

73
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.240
OK.

74
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:52.310
So now that we've got the image in place we need to make a class for doing our background task right

75
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.720
whenever we extend a sync task.

76
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.450
So I'm going to put that code below this on create.

77
00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:03.830
So I'm going to say public class then we need to choose some name here.

78
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:10.080
I'm going to choose image downloader came with this.

79
00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.410
We need to say that it extends.

80
00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.620
And this is where we want to get our a sync task.

81
00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:17.160
Let's go ahead and hit enter on that.

82
00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:23.940
Now with this async task we still want to take in the string as your L and we're going to void our middle

83
00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:29.910
parameter and then for returning we don't worry Turnage string we want to return what's called a bitmap.

84
00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:32.230
This is our way to return an image.

85
00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:39.360
So we'll go ahead and do our curly brackets with that and you'll see that you know it's kind of upset

86
00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.210
here and that's because we need to implement those methods so click this way.

87
00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:44.130
Implement methods.

88
00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:49.470
Now I get that awesome do in background so you can see those doing background that is going to return

89
00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:51.660
a bitmap now instead of a string.

90
00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:52.650
So that's good.

91
00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:56.160
Let's rename this to you or else like we had before.

92
00:06:56.290 --> 00:07:02.670
I will kind of be a fun way to do that and it looks like the emulators fully loaded now so I just want

93
00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:08.280
to go ahead and test this code that the button tapped shows up whenever we hit the button.

94
00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:18.170
So let's go ahead and make sure that that's the case I'll get log cat up and run in there K so here

95
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:21.550
comes the app download image and look at that button tapped.

96
00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.770
OK.

97
00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:23.180
All right.

98
00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:27.170
So that means we're moving in the right direction here.

99
00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:37.210
So the next thing that we need to do is as we've done before convert the string you Arel into an actual

100
00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:38.990
real object.

101
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:46.720
So we're going to say you Arel that's called your elbows should be equal to a new you r l object that

102
00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:54.550
we use whatsoever inside of this or L's kind of pseudo array at the zero position meaning the very first

103
00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:59.100
one and looks like I forgot to hit enter there.

104
00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:01.420
There we go.

105
00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:08.890
And with this we are going to have to surround it with a try catch so we'll do our Try here and a catch

106
00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:16.000
when we get all exceptions exception.

107
00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:18.290
Excellent.

108
00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:21.110
All right so that gets us a u r l.

109
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:28.410
The next thing that we need to do is you need to create an HTP your L connection so as HTP your all

110
00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:40.750
connection we'll just simply call connection and this is equal to your l dot open connection and we're

111
00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:48.160
going to have to go ahead and cast this to say that is an H TTP or real connection.

112
00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.650
All right so that's looking a little bit better there.

113
00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:56.740
And then with this connection we want to say connect to say let's you know sort of fire this up just

114
00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:02.710
sounds a little funny saying connect the connection and then just like before we want to do an input

115
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:05.140
stream but things will be a little bit different after that.

116
00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:14.610
So we're going to say input stream i n is equal to Connection get input stream.

117
00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:20.740
OK and this is where things are going to change a bit because before we were just trying to read in

118
00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:28.060
a bunch of text right like we didn't want to you know return an image or anything like that so that's

119
00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:30.300
why we could kind of go step by step.

120
00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:34.270
Whereas with the bitmap we kind of need to do everything in one fell swoop.

121
00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:48.160
So we're going to create a new map and we're going to say mine bitmap is equal to bitmap factory type

122
00:09:48.160 --> 00:10:01.410
built bitmap factory and then on that we want to do dot D code stream and you can see we can pass in

123
00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:06.570
an input stream so that's what we're going to pass an eye and right which is the input stream that we

124
00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:08.010
created right here.

125
00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:13.980
And by doing that it just sort of in one fell swoop adds everything to this bitmap and which we can

126
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:20.790
very simply just return my bitmap and that's all it takes to get an image and download it and pass it

127
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:21.830
back.

128
00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:25.230
Now if there is some sort of exception we need to return something.

129
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:28.500
So in this case let's just go ahead and return no.

130
00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:36.600
We should also with this exception go ahead and do a print stack trace so we can figure out what the

131
00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:37.960
issue was.

132
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:42.540
But with this we have the beginnings of what it is that we're trying to do.

133
00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:49.880
So really from here it's just a matter of going ahead and actually using the code here.

134
00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:57.840
So we need to go back up to the top inside of this download image so let's go ahead and get access to

135
00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:07.590
our image downloader saw See image downloader and we'll call this task is equal to a new image downloader

136
00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:10.670
excellent.

137
00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:16.720
We also need to have an image that we're going to set things equal to so we're going to say make a new

138
00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:22.910
bitmap image that we'll call my image.

139
00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:30.190
Just define that for the time being but then will actually go about signing that to something and will

140
00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:39.720
say My image is equal to this task that we've created that execute and it's looking for strings so I'll

141
00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:41.630
just put an empty one for now.

142
00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:46.480
But on that we're going to have to do a get in you can see when we do get that's when it's going to

143
00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:51.170
return us back the bitmap so that's exactly what we're looking for.

144
00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:53.680
So go ahead put the semi-colon there.

145
00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:58.440
Now again there could be some exceptions with this so we have to surround this with a try catch.

146
00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:09.100
So we'll do our try there and then a catch for any and all exceptions exception here which in this case

147
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:14.500
we would want to print out this track track space stret stack trace.

148
00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.800
Man that's a real tongue twister there Jane.

149
00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:24.400
So this is going to be the code that we need in order to get this to execute and that'll get us an image

150
00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:31.450
but sort of the next step for us is we need to actually go ahead and pass this into the image view.

151
00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:44.400
So after we get the image this is where we'd want to save image view dot set image bitmap and we're

152
00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:49.030
going to pass in my image and that should do the trick.

153
00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:56.540
So remember before we move on that we've got to go ahead and get permission in the Android manifest.

154
00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.540
So we'll go ahead and open that up.

155
00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:05.910
Remember we want to do use permissions want the Internet one that remembered we use that recently.

156
00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:13.020
I like that feature in Android studio so we should have everything that we need to go get this except

157
00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:15.470
I guess I'm missing one big thing.

158
00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:21.020
Hopefully you noticed this is we never provided a u r l of which image it was that we wanted to go download

159
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:21.560
right.

160
00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:24.300
So let's go ahead and open up Safari.

161
00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:27.930
And like I said in Rob's honor let's go get an image of Bart.

162
00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:37.320
So if you just search Bart Simpson Wiki there should be a good image from the Wikipedia page and look

163
00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.120
at that.

164
00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:39.330
Good looking Bart.

165
00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:45.360
So you want to right click this image and you want to get the URL for the actual image.

166
00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:51.780
So there's a lot of different options that we can get here and we want to get the copy to the image

167
00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.250
address so you can.

168
00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:58.050
It's tempting to go to the image or copy link but that will take you to like the actual Wikipedia page

169
00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:02.100
you want to do copy image address and to confirm you have the right one.

170
00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:07.140
Just go ahead and paste in your browser should end in something like a P N G or a j peg.

171
00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:12.270
And if you go to visit it should just show the image there shouldn't be any sort of website connected

172
00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:13.090
with it.

173
00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:19.770
And if we have the proper moral Let's go ahead and pass it in there and let's see if we can get this

174
00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:20.500
to work.

175
00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:21.380
OK.

176
00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:31.780
So go ahead and run this is our our big moment of truth here to see if this thing works.

177
00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:34.340
All right we've got our emulator.

178
00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:37.060
I hit the download image button and boom.

179
00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:37.790
Look at that.

180
00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:41.690
We get Bart Simpson showing up here on our device.

181
00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:42.560
How cool is that.

182
00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:44.520
That is so awesome just for fun here.

183
00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:48.470
Let's go ahead and search for a different Simpsons character.

184
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:53.050
Let's go ahead and do Homer Simpson's wiki.

185
00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:53.770
OK.

186
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:59.980
We're going to copy the image address and let's go ahead and replace that.

187
00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:05.190
Go ahead and paste it in and let's run this.

188
00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:10.100
You know when you build something cool like this it's just it's the least it's my natural tendency to

189
00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:14.300
say oh I've got to go try this now with this different thing you know like just to see if it works and

190
00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:15.110
boom.

191
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.580
Look at that.

192
00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:19.310
We get Homer Simpson munching on a donut to pop up.

193
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:20.790
So pretty cool things.

194
00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:27.560
Well this is an excellent pretty face into working with our next guest the celebrity app.

195
00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:29.590
We're going to use a lot of the things that we just learned here.

196
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:33.140
But again a lot of other stuff and we're going to call compounded into one.

197
00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:35.070
Let's go ahead and dive into that app.
