WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.950
All right so now that we have our button all working it's disabled it's showing the searching message.

2
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.240
I mean this was kind of the simple stuff it's time to dive in into the actual Bluetooth meet.

3
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.640
So the first thing that we want to do is we want to be able to set up Bluetooth.

4
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:20.250
So let's go to our concrete where we're setting up the list view the status fuse search button all that

5
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.690
stuff.

6
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.320
We're going to take our Bluetooth adapter.

7
00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:31.710
I'm going to say this should be equal to capital Bluetooth adapter not get default adapter.

8
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.680
Now with this in place this will allow us then to go ahead and work with this Bluetooth adapter and

9
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.440
really at the end of the day the thing that we want to do is we want to say Bluetooth adapter that start

10
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.160
discovery and this will go out searching for Bluetooth devices.

11
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:56.560
Now in order to get this to work there's a little bit of code that we have to run here and looks like

12
00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:03.180
for whatever reason we're missing a permission here so we're going to come back to that in a second.

13
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.780
But well we've got the error message let's go ahead and just cover that now so you can see we need to

14
00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.390
have the Bluetooth admin permission.

15
00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.810
So let's go ahead and open up our manifest here.

16
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.350
And this is going to be a user's permission.

17
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:25.590
So and so uses permission and we want Bluetooth admin just like that.

18
00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:27.060
OK.

19
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.880
So once we've added that should see that air doesn't disappear.

20
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:31.990
Great.

21
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.970
The next thing that we need to do is we have to create something called an intent filter.

22
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.440
So with this Bluetooth adapter once we start searching for things we're going to get a lot of messages

23
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:48.130
telling us about you know what sort of thing we've gotten you know how we want to respond to it.

24
00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:54.860
And so if we create this intent filter it can help us sort of manage what it is that we're looking for.

25
00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.330
So I'm going to go ahead and create a new intent filter what is called lowercase and then filter and

26
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.910
let's give ourselves some space to type here.

27
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.200
And this is going to be equal to a new content filter.

28
00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.520
And with this we just want to say what sort of actions it is that we're looking for so we can say intent

29
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:23.710
filter that add action and we'll go ahead and just for example type out Bluetooth adapter dot.

30
00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:30.490
And one thing that we look can look for is action state changed so we don't want connected connections

31
00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.120
state change we just want action.

32
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.080
All caps state change.

33
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.180
That's one thing that we can look for and I'm just going to go ahead and copy and paste this a few times

34
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.300
might not end up needing all these but I just want to have enough that we can work with a big one here

35
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.980
is going to do capital action found.

36
00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.310
It's like you and have to type that out so that I can whittle that down.

37
00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:01.750
And that's not a Bluetooth adapter that's on Bluetooth device so bluetooth device.

38
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.060
We are looking for action found.

39
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:05.350
Excellent.

40
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.870
And that tells us whenever we found a new bluetooth device as far as the adapter stuff we have to look

41
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.660
now for action and we want to do discovery started.

42
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.510
And the last one is action.

43
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.220
Discovery finished.

44
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.910
So these are the different states that we're looking for look like had or actions looks I have an extra

45
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.400
one so I'll go ahead and delete that.

46
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.070
But these are the different things that will tell us you know hey we got something back.

47
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.630
Here's how you should you know do you want to do something about it now in order for this intent filter

48
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.690
to work we have to register it.

49
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:46.570
So the step that we're looking for is to register receiver and we're going to have to pass in a receiver

50
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:52.650
object and then we're also going to pass in this filter that we just created and we called that our

51
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:53.830
intent filter.

52
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.330
So the next step for us is now we have to create this receiver.

53
00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.070
And so we're going to go ahead and do this up on its own.

54
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:07.840
And so this is essentially just creating a property but there's a whole lot that's going into this property

55
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:14.800
so in fact let's just go ahead and do it right up here at the top we're going to say private fine and

56
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:22.120
all and we're going to be creating a broadcast receiver that we're just going to call our broadcast

57
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:28.870
receiver and we're going to set this equal to a new broadcast receiver.

58
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:35.460
So with this you can see we should auto automatically get this on receive function here.

59
00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:41.020
And this is basically saying hey whenever we get one of these actions you need to decide how you want

60
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.620
to take action.

61
00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.530
And so I'm going to go ahead and put a semi-colon there for the time bein.

62
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.650
Let's just go ahead and see if we can't figure out what actions that are there are that we're getting

63
00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:59.920
so I to say string and I'm going to call make a new string called action and we're going to set that

64
00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.000
equal to the intent.

65
00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:08.330
And get intent there.

66
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:13.720
Dot excuse me no we already have an intent here we have a lower case and to go on there.

67
00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.820
You can do this intent dot and then we want to do get action.

68
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.480
And that's going to give us back that string.

69
00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.880
And with that let's go ahead and just print it out.

70
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:31.140
And so I'm going to do a log here and what I'm going to log is the particular action that is that we're

71
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:32.240
getting back.

72
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.050
And we'll just go ahead and type in action there.

73
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:42.750
So with that in place let's go ahead and well we're not done here we have this broadcast receiver.

74
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.180
But then we have to actually go ahead and do something with it.

75
00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:51.660
So remember I register a receiver we're going to pass in that broadcast receiver and then that should

76
00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:52.990
fix those errors.

77
00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.980
So now we're ready to go ahead and check this out on our device.

78
00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:06.690
So I'm going to go ahead and run that androids and or studio seconds to pull this up let me get vizor

79
00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.250
ready to see this.

80
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.470
So here it comes.

81
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:18.860
We are going to have our app open up and oh we have an air let's go ahead and check that out.

82
00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:26.810
So dive into log cat and see what we've got here.

83
00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:31.920
We're not seeing anything specific right now to our app.

84
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.680
So let's go ahead and run this one more time.

85
00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:41.950
We're going to be paying a little more a little bit closer attention here to see if we can't figure

86
00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.190
out and look now it's for Bluetooth finder.

87
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:46.260
Here we go this is a nice looking air.

88
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:48.760
So unable to start activity

89
00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:56.270
component info Java security need Bluetooth permission.

90
00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.900
OK so we apparently have not asked for enough permission.

91
00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:02.330
So we did Bluetooth admin.

92
00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:10.000
I think we also need to go get just straight up Bluetooth or go ahead and ask for that as well.

93
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.890
All right let's go ahead and try this one more time.

94
00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:15.670
Run this app

95
00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:27.450
and here it is point up we're going to keep an eye here on Lague cat and the app opens up without destroying

96
00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:27.840
itself.

97
00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.530
But I want you to notice what we have coming out here.

98
00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:35.460
And so we see that we get these actions for example found here.

99
00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:40.140
That's means that it found some stuff and it's still finding some other Bluetooth devices.

100
00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:41.250
I mean it's just.

101
00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:45.150
Yours is going to look completely different from mine because it's you know finding things other than

102
00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:45.330
me.

103
00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:50.550
And look it that we get a discovery finished there at the end so that's telling us hey we went out we

104
00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:55.200
started looking for things at the very beginning it said discovery started and then it's telling us

105
00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.000
down here that we have discovery finished.

106
00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:59.450
And then it found some blue tooth devices.

107
00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:05.370
So that puts us at a great position to know that we are getting back some info but then we need to be

108
00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:09.620
able to pull the info from that and sort of handle everything appropriately.

109
00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:16.020
So I just want to do one quick fix here before we move forward and that's that I want to make it so

110
00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:23.970
that when we have finished doing the search that we can sort of give back the button that we can re-enable

111
00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:28.200
that and we'll get rid of the searching thing and may replace it with something that says finished.

112
00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:35.610
And so we're going to go ahead and in this on receive we are going to do an if statement and the if

113
00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:38.940
statement that we're looking for is we want to check what the action is.

114
00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:48.050
So we're going to say if an inside of our parentheses here we want to compare the bluetooth adapter

115
00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:53.110
dot and we're going to check for the action.

116
00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:57.360
Discovery finished remember that's the one that says hey we've finished looking for all the different

117
00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.340
Bluetooth devices we're going to see if this equals.

118
00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:04.380
And then we want to pass in this action string that we had just pulled out.

119
00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:09.510
So we're going to go ahead and put action right inside of there so if that's the case that means we

120
00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:14.650
have finished our search which then means we can sort of do the reverse of what we had here.

121
00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:22.100
So I'm just going to copy these two lines of code pasted inside of here instead of saying searching.

122
00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:31.530
It's going to say finished and instead of this being false it's going to be true.

123
00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:37.190
So then we can you know allow the user to hit that button again which then makes me realize we've done

124
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:43.250
all this work to create an intent filter and all this stuff yet we want to register the receiver and

125
00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:46.760
do we want to start this discovery when the user hits the button.

126
00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:52.320
So I'm actually going to cut this line of code and I'm going to move this to search clicked OK.

127
00:09:52.670 --> 00:10:01.280
So with that let's go ahead and try out the new app here and I'll go ahead and bring up vizor for this

128
00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.070
one.

129
00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:08.010
What kind of log cat lurking here in the background so that we can see that as well but we'll go ahead

130
00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:11.960
and get that view up here comes the apps are going to hit search.

131
00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:17.750
Now it says searching and eventually it's going to be every time that it you know finds something inside

132
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:18.720
of here.

133
00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:22.320
You know every time it's something is found it should be updating the list for you.

134
00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:23.640
That's going to come later.

135
00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:28.280
But we want to see that when this is finished that this will be done saying searching and we'll say

136
00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:31.000
finished and then we can hit the search button and look at that.

137
00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:35.780
It finished up and now we could click the button and do this process again.

138
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:41.900
So we are at a great point here we're finding some information about Bluetooth devices around us.

139
00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:48.320
We realized when it's over but we still have the task of being able to identify those particular Bluetooth

140
00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:52.010
devices and then getting them to show up inside of a list view.

141
00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:53.970
We're going to cover that in the next lecture.
