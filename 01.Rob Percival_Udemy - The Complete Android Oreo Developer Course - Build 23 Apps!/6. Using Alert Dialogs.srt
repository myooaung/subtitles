1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:05,900
All right in this lecture we are going to learn about alert dialog so this is the second Android concept

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,900
and I want you to learn before we dive into the Notes app.

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,960
And essentially what alert dialog does is it pops up to let the user select one of two options and allows

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,850
them to move forward.

5
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:20,630
It just sort of hey if you need to check on something maybe display an error to the user this can be

6
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,600
an effective way to do that.

7
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:27,230
So let's go ahead and start a new Android project what we're going to do is first learn about Alert

8
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,750
dialogs then we have a challenge for you.

9
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,660
So let's just go ahead and call this one alert demo.

10
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:39,170
Can't we just want defaults on everything here so we'll go ahead and get that set up.

11
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:44,510
So the basic idea with this first one is we're just going to create an alert dialog dialog that basically

12
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:50,330
says hey are you sure that you want to do this it's supposed to be like a dialogue that might be presented

13
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:55,370
when someone's you know open an app for the very first time or that they're about to do a save or they're

14
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:59,480
going to delete something right is time to confirm some sort of user action.

15
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:05,090
So it is mostly just a demo to make sure you understand what's going on and then we'll apply it later.

16
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:09,650
So let's give ourselves some space to type this is all done via code.

17
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:12,370
There's no visual part of this that needs to be done.

18
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:17,500
So let's go ahead and first just create a new alert dialog.

19
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,000
So we're going to create a new dialog.

20
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,510
And don't get those parentheses at the end there.

21
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,970
You want to do capital alert.

22
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:29,660
Capitol dialog dot we're going say capital builder just like this.

23
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:36,430
And inside of those parentheses you want to pass this because it's asking for a context and then you're

24
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:41,570
going to be amazed by this we're just going to keep an offering thing after thing where we keep setting

25
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,910
adding settings onto the alert dialog.

26
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:48,320
So for example the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to say you know this alert dialog

27
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:55,580
builder dot and then we want to set the icon so we'll say set icon and the way to get to you know a

28
00:01:55,580 --> 00:02:05,330
list of icon IDs we're going to say lowercase Android dot capital are not draw all dot.

29
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:11,060
And then this is where there's going to be a lot of them so we want to go for I.S. underscore dialog

30
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,680
alert and you can see there's all sorts of different options here but we just want the alert.

31
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:19,910
This is kind of the the basic one to work with now because we're going to be getting a ton of these

32
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:23,360
different settings on this one dialog builder.

33
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:27,480
I recommend hitting enter each time you've got to add a new bullet point.

34
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:32,900
So after we have set the icon we want to do another bullet point and we're going to say Dot said title

35
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:33,700
this time.

36
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:33,940
Right.

37
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:38,500
So this is just going to be some string that says what it is that we want this to say.

38
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,090
So we'll have the say.

39
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,680
Are you sure.

40
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:46,190
Exclamation Point question mark we've got to make this as dramatic as possible.

41
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:51,890
And then with this we're also then going to set a message so with an alert dialog you're able to set

42
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:56,390
a title and a message that title sort of the big thing in bold and then you can add some more details

43
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,500
here if you'd like.

44
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:08,650
You don't have to include a message but this one will say do you definitely we want to do this.

45
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:14,680
And then maybe we'll save the exclamation point on this one just to the question mark.

46
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,270
So we've set the icon title message.

47
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,690
Then we have to set the positive and the negative buttons.

48
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:25,400
So first let's go ahead and set the positive buttons will say set positive button.

49
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:31,010
So this is the one that users will select if they're trying to say yes to something or continue.

50
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:36,380
So the reason the Android chose positive and negative buttons is that you know every apps going to have

51
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,390
different use cases for these alert dialogs.

52
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:44,450
But if you always puts the kind of affirmative the yes the positive thing with a positive button users

53
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,430
will kind of get used to stuff that's you know in the positive position versus the not.

54
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:52,190
Of course there's titles there but just sort of helps to keep those things in place.

55
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,200
But with this positive button.

56
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,270
Couple of things of looking for first.

57
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:00,490
It's looking for an eye as a string about what you want to say in this button.

58
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,330
In this case we'll say yes.

59
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:05,770
Right so this is the positive button we want to say yes there.

60
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:12,320
Next thing is we want to set in on click listener so to do this we're going to go ahead say a new space

61
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:19,030
Capitol dialogue and we want the dialogue interface on listeners so just go ahead and hit enter on that

62
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,840
and you can see I guess there's this huge chunk of code.

63
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:28,040
And basically what we're looking for inside of here is inside of this enclave that we can type anything

64
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,570
and this will be code that's run.

65
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:36,920
If someone chooses the yes option so it will go ahead and let's just for example make a toast with this

66
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:42,530
or say toaster make text we'll provide our capital main activity.

67
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:51,980
This as the context let's go ahead and put some sort of message and we'll say maybe like it's done to

68
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:56,260
say that you know they had to confirm this action so we went ahead and went through with it.

69
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:06,160
We'll do capital TOSed dot length short and we'll do a show on that and semi-colon tank.

70
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:12,920
So that was set everything up for the positive but we also want to do a dot set negative button.

71
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:18,020
So for this one we want to go ahead and provide again the string for this one will say no.

72
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:23,260
And then if you want to for that Arncliffe listener you can provide no which basically says hey if they

73
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:28,360
choose this one and we're not going to do anything we'll just say you know what comes out of the dialog

74
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,300
box and move forward.

75
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:36,770
So after you said the negative button really the last option here is you just have to say Dot show can't.

76
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:41,670
So again this was a whole lot of code to create this dialog box and show it.

77
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,440
But this is what we need in order to move forward.

78
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,570
So let's go ahead and hit run here.

79
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,930
And again I'm going to teach you the skill.

80
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:55,010
And then we're going to come combine this with what we learned about menu items make sure we've got

81
00:05:55,010 --> 00:06:01,990
both these skills in our tool belt and then we'll move forward with making a fun little app.

82
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:09,160
So here comes the app open it up so look for this alert dialog to show up and look at that.

83
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,420
Are you sure.

84
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:15,830
And this you know I see dialog alert we could have chose different icons if we wanted to this one is

85
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:19,790
kind of the you know if something important is about to happen and you can kind of mess around with

86
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:24,740
those see which one you want and then you can see our message do you definitely want to do this and

87
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,380
there's the yes and the No.

88
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:32,060
So if we say yes then look we get that little toast that says It's it's done.

89
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:39,200
But if you run this one more time and instead said select No it's just going to simply not do anything

90
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,420
because we provide null for that click listener so we tap no on that one.

91
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,320
Nothing happens.

92
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:53,030
So the challenge that I have for you is I want you to create an app where the user can save a language

93
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:57,410
preference whether they want to use your app in English or they want to use it in Spanish and it doesn't

94
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:58,720
have to be English in Spanish.

95
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,920
Maybe you want it to be French and Japanese or Chinese and Guatemalan.

96
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:08,240
That's not a language that's a location regardless.

97
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:13,400
Anyways you know just the language preference app so I don't use English and Spanish and the idea is

98
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,430
that when the user opens the app for the very first time it's going to present them an alert dialog

99
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:24,440
and say Would you like to use English or Spanish in this app and you know they make their decision and

100
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:29,480
then once they've made their decision there should be a menu item here that if they select this they

101
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:34,580
can go choose English or Spanish and update their selection and when they update their selection either

102
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:41,560
the first time or through the menu item that should be saved inside of the shared preferences.

103
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,910
So the next time they open up it's like oh they told us once they want to use this app in Spanish.

104
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,800
Well you know be able to provide stuff in Spanish and whether they chose English or Spanish just show

105
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:55,790
it up inside of a text few here on the screen effect you can just use the hello world that comes with

106
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:56,500
a new app.

107
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,380
OK.

108
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:00,980
So go ahead create a new Android studio project go do that on your own.

109
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,940
Hit pause now.

110
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:04,360
All right.

111
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,210
So hopefully that went well for you.

112
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:13,340
Let's go ahead and move forward with this so we are going to create a new Android studio project.

113
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,430
So go ahead and pick this.

114
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,570
Now the name for this one.

115
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm going to call it playing with language.

116
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:27,010
You spell this correctly language preferences.

117
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,180
There we go.

118
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,950
Pref Bruin's.

119
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,610
Man my spelling is atrocious.

120
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,520
It's embarrassing.

121
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:38,400
But we'll go ahead I'll just use the standards for all this moving forward.

122
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:39,620
OK.

123
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:44,920
Now once we got this in place remember the first thing that we want to do is we want to present an alert

124
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:50,350
dialog that again just says hey do you want to move forward in English or Spanish.

125
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:55,760
So you know we had just created all that code before this should go really quickly.

126
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:00,300
I would go do a copy and paste but it's going to take about the same time to just type it out anyways

127
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,470
so let's just go for gold here.

128
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:07,990
So we want a new alert dialog and on this we want to do a builder.

129
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:13,040
And with this will pass and this as the context and then we'll start doing our dog.

130
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:23,950
So first thing we've got to set the icon and so we'll go ahead and do Android dog our dog drawable dot

131
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,030
and let's go ahead and with this one.

132
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:32,890
Let's do I see Button speak now that will kind of help you know.

133
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:38,410
Talk about that we're you know working with languages here then we're going to go ahead and set the

134
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,420
title with this.

135
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:47,980
We're going to go ahead and say choose a language remember we just want to provide two options next.

136
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,180
Let's go ahead and set the message.

137
00:09:51,500 --> 00:10:00,430
Well sort of reiterate what we had said before but will say which language would you like to use.

138
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:03,070
Questionmark excellent.

139
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:08,470
Next thing we've got to set a positive buttons or say set positive button with this.

140
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:12,360
We're going to have in this case the positive the English and the negative Spanish.

141
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:15,340
Now as for deciding which language goes where.

142
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,350
Totally up to you.

143
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:22,630
Maybe a more positive option or more popular option you put in the positive box but you know depending

144
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:27,250
on where you're going to be maybe Spanish is more popular than an English maybe German is more popular

145
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,240
than Japanese right.

146
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,730
But it probably doesn't matter too much in this situation.

147
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:38,570
So we're going to go ahead and put English in this one English.

148
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:47,170
So then we want to provide an enclave listeners who going to say new dialogue interface on click listener.

149
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:52,710
So the code that we want to run through here is essentially we want to set the language to English.

150
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,010
So let's just go ahead and say set English right now.

151
00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:01,200
We're going to create a function that is going to handle that for both either language option.

152
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:02,780
But we just want that for now.

153
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:06,760
Let's go ahead and set the negative button.

154
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:13,990
So for this one will say Spanish and again we want a new dialogue interface on click listener and this

155
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:17,340
one we want to set Spanish just like that.

156
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:21,780
All right so we've got icon title message positive negative button.

157
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:28,460
Once all those are in place we simply want to do a show and we'll do our semi-colon there.

158
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,880
Now the question is you know how do we set the English and how do we set the Spanish like what kind

159
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,930
of code do we want to provide there.

160
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:41,140
Well we want to create a function that no matter what language you pass into it it will be able to save

161
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,300
that information.

162
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,530
So let's go ahead and just make a new function we'll say.

163
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:52,430
Public void and we'll call this maybe set language and in the parentheses.

164
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:58,000
We'll go ahead and provide it and say you know you should pass on a string that we'll call language

165
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:04,990
can go do our curly brackets on that which now means if we want to set English we just call set language

166
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:09,360
and we provide English right inside of there.

167
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:17,020
And if we want to do Spanish we can say Set Language and just provide Spanish right inside of their

168
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,150
tank.

169
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,950
So now that's appropriately calling this method.

170
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:24,170
Now we've got to write the code in order to make this all happen.

171
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:29,620
So we want to save this and shared preferences for say shared preferences lowercase shared preferences

172
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:39,190
equal to this get shared preferences and inside of here we're going to first pass the name of our app

173
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,370
paste that in there.

174
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:49,570
Then we're going to go ahead and provide one a comma there and we want to do context dot and we want

175
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:52,350
unmowed private for this one.

176
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:58,750
So we now have our shared preferences set up and then let's go ahead and put in the language that they

177
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,670
selected.

178
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:06,280
So this should be very simple just say shared preferences dot it and this is where we're going to put

179
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,170
a string inside of there.

180
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,060
Now what's going to be the name of this remember.

181
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:14,320
Remember just say something like language because we're just describing what it is that we're saving

182
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:19,940
language in my spelling that correctly looks fine to me.

183
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:25,400
But then as for the actual value let's pass in whatever came through in this language parameter soldiers

184
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,330
to say pass in language right there.

185
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:35,050
Once we've got that in place the next thing that we want to do is we want to update the text to which

186
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:36,940
then means we have to have access to the text view.

187
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:42,950
So let's go over here to our main activity and let's figure out the ID for this hello world text view.

188
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,390
It doesn't have one so let's go ahead and put that in.

189
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:51,290
All right so now that we've give it the name of text view we have to get access to that.

190
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:59,590
So we're going to say text view lowercase text use equal to find view by id Capitol our DOT ID dot text

191
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:00,510
view.

192
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,450
Boom.

193
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,230
Now we have access to that.

194
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:08,770
Then the next step for us is we want to set the text so we can say text view set text and we'll pass

195
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,030
inside of there whatever the languages that they selected.

196
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:15,710
So we'll just pass in language Okay.

197
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,380
So with that in place let's go ahead and see what this looks like.

198
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:23,600
Let's run this on the emulator.

199
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,680
That looks good.

200
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,550
Again app should open up.

201
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:32,830
It should present that dialog box or alert dialog and you know we can say English or Spanish or whichever

202
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:36,180
one we chose it should be Chez saved and shared preferences.

203
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:40,170
And also it should be showing up in the text view.

204
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,100
OK.

205
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:45,360
So go ahead and give this a second to load up here.

206
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,940
And look at that comes through which language you like to use.

207
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,990
I want to use Spanish in a vice like Spanish.

208
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,170
Don't do it.

209
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:55,670
Look it shows Spanish.

210
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:01,260
Now one thing that I would like to show here is that if we're going to be working with this app again

211
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:06,300
like let's say we close out of it and we open it back up we would like it to be able to show what we

212
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,940
chose last time.

213
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:14,340
And so in order to do this we've got to have access to our shared preferences so let's go ahead and

214
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:19,740
rather than having to type this code all the time I'm going to cut this piece and I'm going to bring

215
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,890
it up top as a prop..

216
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:26,970
And then whenever we are going to create the shared preferences Let's go ahead and just put this inside

217
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:28,010
of the create.

218
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:33,530
So I'm going to cut this code when it comes down to our on create and paste that code right in there

219
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:38,670
so it says OK you know we have the shared preferences we can now use it here but we can also use it

220
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,250
in this method as well.

221
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:47,340
So with that let's go ahead and pull out whatever language we got from shared preferences.

222
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:55,350
So let's make a new string called language and we are going to set this equal to our shared preferences

223
00:15:55,470 --> 00:16:02,730
dot get string and the string that we're looking forward is the language and then we need to provide

224
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:08,040
a default just in case it doesn't come through and in that case you know we could just leave it blank.

225
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:13,650
I think it would be nice to leave something like air or so the user knows that something went wrong

226
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:13,950
here.

227
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:14,480
OK.

228
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:17,040
So that now gives us a language.

229
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:22,740
And with this we want to go ahead and do some sort of Estaban because if there's already been a language

230
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:29,250
selected inside of the shared preferences well then we don't want to go do this whole alert dialog box

231
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,440
like that would be annoying for the user.

232
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:38,670
Like right now if we go to our emulator and let's go ahead and close out of language preferences and

233
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:43,980
let's open it up let's see where's there's language preferences.

234
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:48,270
You can see even though we've already picked Spanish and it's saved in shared preferences.

235
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,520
You know we have to be presented that question again.

236
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:59,010
So we're going to go ahead and do an if statement and go put big curly brackets around all of this.

237
00:16:59,230 --> 00:16:59,870
OK.

238
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:06,660
And the thing that we want to check and see is language that equals and we want to see if it's equal

239
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:12,240
to Capitol Hill air because remember that's going to be our default to come back if you know we weren't

240
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,470
successfully able to get something.

241
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:19,740
So if the language equals error that means that we want to you know go through this whole thing asking

242
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,920
them which one they would like to use.

243
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:27,360
And then you know that gives us the opportunity to then present a Else situation to say OK you know

244
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:32,730
if they weren't able to find this information then you know let's go ahead and set some things.

245
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:35,700
Now the ELSE situation.

246
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,580
Go ahead and provide that.

247
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:41,450
We want to update the text for you which right now we only have access to up there.

248
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:46,120
So let's go ahead and cut this text view paste it right up at the top.

249
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:54,870
And again we can still have this text view but we want to move this to our on creative method same place

250
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:57,270
where we're setting our shared preferences here.

251
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,340
So just go ahead and paste that.

252
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:04,440
That really makes this set languages method that much cleaner.

253
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,650
Go ahead and leave some space there.

254
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:12,450
But with that in place now in this situation you know if we already have language select them selected

255
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:20,400
will simply just say okay text view set text and we'll go ahead and pass in whatever language has been

256
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:21,090
selected.

257
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,540
Right.

258
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:25,440
In this case it would be whatever came out of shared preferences.

259
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,120
All right.

260
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:32,070
So with those things in place let's go ahead and just see if we run the app that it will show.

261
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:36,840
I believe we selected Spanish last time she should say Spanish when the app opens up.

262
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,600
This is from last time so doesn't really count.

263
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:46,290
But look app opens up and oh we're still asked Would you like to use Spanish or English to let's do

264
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:49,230
Spanish should shouldn't be showing this again.

265
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:57,440
So go ahead and X out of this and let's try opening it one more time.

266
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:04,070
So will go to our APs language preferences and we're still getting the box there so let's go ahead and

267
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,610
walk through this real quick.

268
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:12,050
So if the language that comes back from here is equal to error then we want to run the code here so

269
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:17,860
maybe it's not maybe I'm not I didn't spell this correctly so laying edge.

270
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,760
No it looks like it's correct.

271
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,810
Let's go ahead and do this.

272
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:22,990
I'm going to do some live debugging in front of you.

273
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:31,040
Let's go ahead and log whatever language is equal to so say the Lang and we'll just go ahead and type

274
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,730
out language to see what it is that we're working with

275
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:38,700
language.

276
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:39,760
Excellent.

277
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:46,520
Now let's go ahead and run this so this time when we run we want to make sure that we've got log cabin

278
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,790
up and running here.

279
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,540
And let's see here comes the app.

280
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,690
So it opens up.

281
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,260
And so the langue is equal to air.

282
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,310
So for some reason.

283
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,870
Now I know what it is.

284
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:03,920
Whenever we did the put string we forgot to do a dot apply there.

285
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:04,540
OK.

286
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:08,780
So I bet once we fix this that's going to be the case.

287
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:13,710
So sometimes that's what it takes doing a quick log and just sort of walking through the code there

288
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:16,390
to see what the problem is.

289
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:26,330
Let's see so if I said Spanish here I go ahead and I X out this app and we open it up one more time.

290
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:29,360
So like language preference like that it shows Spanish.

291
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:34,040
So the last piece of this app is we want to integrate the menu ability right.

292
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:38,790
If someone wants to go hit a menu and say oh I originally said Spanish I want to change English we should

293
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,410
give them that option.

294
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:44,900
So let's go ahead bring back out our side menu.

295
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,610
We have to create that menu directory.

296
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,700
So we want a new directory that will call a menu.

297
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:57,610
And while we have that many Slichter will say file new and we want a menu resource file.

298
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:03,770
So again we're going to call this underscore main menu and that's going to go in that menu directory.

299
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:05,360
So that's good.

300
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,860
Go ahead and hit OK there.

301
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:10,570
So now we have this main menu.

302
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:15,980
SML where we can set some stuff up let's go ahead and go to that text view of this.

303
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,690
So remember we want to put items inside of here so let's make a new item.

304
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:27,210
And with this item we're going to first set the title so we're going to say Android title is equal to

305
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:32,430
let's do English first English.

306
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:33,780
Here we go.

307
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:37,190
The next thing that we want to set here is the IDs are in Android.

308
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:44,280
Idea is equal to a plus side slash in let's say English right there.

309
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:49,350
That means that we can close up this item and we just want to create another item in case they want

310
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:55,000
to do Spanish so we'll go ahead and pass that in and change this space vanish and also change this idea

311
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,640
to say Spanish.

312
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,500
Here we go.

313
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,120
So let's go look at the design.

314
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,040
That looks beautiful.

315
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,400
It's always weird to me why it shows that eclipsed here.

316
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:09,210
But when we actually run the app that it doesn't because there's clearly enough space I don't know if

317
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:15,990
that's an android studio bug or whatnot but with these two things in place we just then have to go and

318
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:24,360
are you know proper menus here by menus I mean the proper methods for when someone select something

319
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:27,010
so the first thing is we have to create the menu.

320
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,780
So we're going to say on create options menu.

321
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:38,460
And again the idea here is we use that menu inflators So we're going to say menu inflator menu inflator

322
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,910
is equal to.

323
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:46,170
We want to do get menu inflator then with that we're going to go ahead and say All right we're going

324
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:54,690
to take this menu inflator and we're going to do dot inflate and we want to pass in our dot menu dot

325
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:58,030
main menu that's the name of the one that we created.

326
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:01,350
Now we're going to pass through this menu object just like that.

327
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:01,920
OK.

328
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,850
That's all it takes for that method.

329
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:10,260
And then for the next one here this is when someone selects an item menu so menu item rather we're going

330
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:14,100
to say on options items selected.

331
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:20,560
And remember again we do want to call this Super But we have to return either true or false.

332
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:24,520
You know saying whether or not we were able to successfully do this.

333
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:30,120
So in this situation we basically just want to check whether or not they set things equal to English

334
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:34,960
or to Spanish so let's do our switch like we did before.

335
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:36,150
Inside of here.

336
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:41,710
We want to switch on an item not get item ID.

337
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:51,770
So in one case where we say OK if it's equal to capital our DOT ID dot English.

338
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:52,940
OK.

339
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:58,110
If that's the case then what we want to do is we want to call our set language method and we're going

340
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:06,120
to go ahead and pass in English just like that and we're going to do a similar case for if they choose

341
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:14,530
capital or indeed Spanish and that situation will say set language we want to pass in Spanish.

342
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,310
OK.

343
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:21,030
Now you know we could go ahead and do the return true here and the return return true for that other

344
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:26,070
one in the that you know define a default and all that stuff but for right now I think it's best if

345
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:34,050
we just go ahead and say return true here like that and then we can still you know do our default just

346
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:39,480
in case something else comes through in which case we'd want to return false.

347
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:45,590
But I think this will save us a little bit of code by saying you know if it wasn't one of those two

348
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:47,480
then we want to run that.

349
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:54,800
Although guess what the problem with this one is that there could be a situation where this handles

350
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:58,040
all of the situations so I guess we will actually have to do that.

351
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,430
I tried to save us some code didn't really work out.

352
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:03,610
Not everything works OK.

353
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:08,210
So go ahead make sure we get proper spacing on all of this.

354
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:12,100
And let's go ahead and give our app a run.

355
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:18,590
So our app when it opens up this time now that we've you know selected Spanish It should show that appropriately

356
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:24,020
when it opens but we should have the option to switch it to English back to Spanish if we want to.

357
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,240
So here comes the app.

358
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,700
Look it shows Spanish but we now have this menu.

359
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:35,270
So if I select English here that it uses English and to make sure that this works let's go ahead and

360
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:40,990
hit the X on that and we will open up the app again and it should show English.

361
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,890
Boom.

362
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,100
It shows English.

363
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,110
OK.

364
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:48,670
So you're now in a perfect position to move forward on our notes app.

365
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:54,230
You learn about dialog's you learn about menu items and we've even taken the stuff we've learned about

366
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:57,570
storage and we've sort of meshed it all in here so we're in a great spot.

367
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,710
Now make notes app.

368
00:25:58,730 --> 00:25:59,870
Let's dive into it.
