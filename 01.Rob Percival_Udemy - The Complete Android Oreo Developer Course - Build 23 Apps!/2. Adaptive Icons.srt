1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,490
In this lecture we're going to be learning about adaptive Eikon So this is something brand new in Android

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,680
8.00 Orio that is excellent.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,620
It allows you to make app icons that are going to look great on any device some devices choose you to

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:19,290
use round icons Some choose to do more of a square thing and then maybe a mix in between the two and

5
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:23,550
this is supposed to help make app icons look great on any device.

6
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:30,330
So the basic idea with this when you really bring it down to its core your app icons need to have two

7
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:38,340
different files and they both need to be 108 by 108 and you're going have a foreground and a background

8
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:43,890
in the background needs to be completely full of color you can't have any transparency in your background

9
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,870
but your fork foreground can have some transparency.

10
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:54,270
And the idea is that they're not going to touch a certain circle within the inner part the inner 72

11
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,310
by 72 that's always going to be visible.

12
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:59,990
But then you can have some transparency.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,820
Well you don't have as much transparency as you want in that inner part but it's a guarantee that inner

14
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,430
72 by 72 won't be cut off at all.

15
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:15,690
So the basic idea with all of this is that like for example if you want to have like some parallax features

16
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:20,460
with your app then if they're going to be circles or square or some combo of the two the both of them

17
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,140
are going to work.

18
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:27,120
And so you just need to have a foreground and a background and shows you a quick little example about

19
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,670
how you can get this working inside of your app.

20
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,980
So let's go ahead and create a new project here.

21
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:41,130
Let's open up Android Studio 10 and we're just going to go and see how this works.

22
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:46,460
Now it's important to know when we're creating this that we're going to be using the latest Android.

23
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,350
So we need to use API version 26.

24
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,920
That's the latest.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,970
So let's go ahead and make a new project we're just going to call this app Divx.

26
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,510
Icons.

27
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:03,630
Go ahead hit next and this is where it's important make sure you're on API 26.

28
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,350
8.00 will hit next on here.

29
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,010
Empty activity will finish this.

30
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:14,910
Now it's also important to note that in order to test this you're going to have to have to have a simulated

31
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:23,430
Android O device that's you know running 8.00 there so if you need to go into your virtual device manager

32
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:28,350
and make sure that you've got the correct die's device that you can build on that's what I've got on

33
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,100
the emulator here.

34
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,520
Ready to rock and roll.

35
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:34,180
So as this is getting going.

36
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:40,530
Let me just basically talk through these foregrounds and these backgrounds because we can choose for

37
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:46,110
these foregrounds and backgrounds to be actual image files like a PND or you can choose for them to

38
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,370
be for example here like just one solid color.

39
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:54,270
This is how to do an image but you can also have X-amount files that define what should be going on

40
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,990
there so there's all sorts of different ways that you can handle this.

41
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:05,880
But the first step for us is we need to go ahead and move into our manifest here and open up your Android

42
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,910
manifest.

43
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:13,880
So you can see right now it's showing for Android the icon is at this map map slash I.S. launcher.

44
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,970
So if we go ahead and go to our resources and we go to a map we can see oh look there's this icy launcher.

45
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,930
X also will go ahead and take a look at this.

46
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:30,690
And right now you can see it's using draw will I see launcher background and I see launcher foreground.

47
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:38,370
So if you want to know what those are about let's go ahead and open up see launcher.

48
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:44,130
Oh excuse me I need to go into the Drobo folder and then we're going to go to the background for example.

49
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,260
It's got all these options here.

50
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:49,380
It's basically doing a drawing here in the foreground.

51
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:53,130
Also it's got a drawing there as well.

52
00:03:53,160 --> 00:04:00,990
But so this is using the new adaptive icon but you'll notice also an MIT map here there's for example

53
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:06,990
like these I see launcher files and not only that like there's these round ones too if we go ahead and

54
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:11,110
click on these and this is not what we want to do we want to use the new stuff here.

55
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:14,840
So in order to do that we've got to go back to the Android manifest.

56
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:21,660
And because here right now this for the round icon is saying hey this is going to be using the icy launcher

57
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:22,590
round.

58
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:29,000
And if we go ahead and click on the launcher around here these are going to be working with you know

59
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:33,620
these particular images and stuff and that's not where we want to be going with that.

60
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:39,780
And so what we want to do is we want to go back to our manifest and we're going to change this from

61
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:47,820
going to map to instead we are going to say I see underscore launcher just like that so both of these

62
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,520
are going to be looking at the launcher.

63
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:59,860
And if we go ahead and move over to our draw bull excuse me or I.S. launcher here so now this is Exham

64
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:04,430
l file that we're going to be using instead of the classic background.

65
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,940
I guess let's just go ahead and run the app now so you can see what it looks like.

66
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:16,060
So go ahead and run this and again remember if this is your first time doing the 8.00 Appiani to make

67
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:21,210
sure you have a virtual device of 8.00 so that you can successfully run it.

68
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:28,420
But you know if not you should be able to go so will go ahead and give the emulator here a second to

69
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,700
open up.

70
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:31,380
All right so that finally opened up.

71
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:37,390
And if we go ahead and hit the home button here and then open up our apps we've got the adaptive icon

72
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:42,280
app if we click on hold we can get this on the desktop a little bit be a little bit easier to see.

73
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:48,400
So for example instead of this green background with the grid there if we go here and say rather than

74
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:56,260
point to that instead we want to do something like at color and we can choose something like color accent

75
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:59,430
which I think is that pink color we can see on the left.

76
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:03,500
You'll notice that that will now get a cool little pink background here.

77
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:10,910
So let's wait for the app to open up and here comes the app if we hit the home button back there boom.

78
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:11,550
Look at that.

79
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:16,380
Now we've got you know this little color here and you know same thing with the foreground.

80
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:21,660
We could change this to a solid color like primary dark it's going to be sort of this purplish color

81
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:28,110
this sort of defeats the purpose though because this allows us to the foreground is where you're sort

82
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:33,180
of doing the thing that's on top of it so the solid color in the background that's probably fine to

83
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,780
have it be a solid color.

84
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:39,000
But when we do it is the foreground will then you just have one solid color is your thing so that's

85
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,200
where we might want to control the back to that.

86
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:47,100
So we've made our Apso that everything looks at this icy launcher.

87
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:54,840
Ex M-L if you want to have different versions for the regular launcher and then also the round version

88
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:59,700
like you can see these are pointing to the same files I decided on Android manifest that we wanted to

89
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:04,830
have both of them point to the same one so that regardless we were using the same code there but that's

90
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:08,550
up to you about one wall how you want to handle that.

91
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:12,720
So again up to you how this all works out.

92
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:17,220
And again you can use like images so much good information here on the web site but wanted to give you

93
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:21,630
a quick intro into that so that you can see the future of icons and Android.
