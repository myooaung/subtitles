00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.020
So now that we were all set up with Android studio we're going to start editing our app.

2
00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:10.050
And then this year we're going to be focusing initially on text views text view is what we use to display

3
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.860
text in our app and as such it's a pretty fundamental user interface or UI element of view.

4
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:22.020
By the way is the word used to describe pretty much anything that we put on the screen so checkbooks

5
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.630
toggle buttons spin or any of these things would be views.

6
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.500
And that works the same with iOS development as well.

7
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.860
So if we tap on Hello world.

8
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:36.810
And by the way you'll need to be editing activity underscore main Torex M-L to be able to do that.

9
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:45.470
We can zoom in a little and you can see on the right here we've got some margins and some other settings

10
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.220
for the text view.

11
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.720
So the most obvious of those is the actual text content itself.

12
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.590
So I can edit it right there.

13
00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:01.260
Let's say I want to change this to Hello Rob and you can say it updates right there on the app.

14
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.960
Back on it.

15
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:11.290
And if we run our app and choose the same device that we created a couple of years ago you'll see that

16
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:18.730
straight away the content of the text view has updated on the abit self underneath that we've got this

17
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:26.200
new for Android Studio 3 option with a spanner next to the text and you can see what this is for if

18
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.770
you lose control space to get a list of options.

19
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:38.710
And essentially we can either choose a type of text so we've got examples cities avatars days of the

20
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.160
week etc. etc..

21
00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:50.970
Or we can choose specific strings or icons to display and there's a lot to choose from there.

22
00:01:51.010 --> 00:02:01.920
So if I choose say the copy string then in English that would be displayed as copy but we could change

23
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.250
the language of that very easily and it would update automatically to whatever copy is in the language

24
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.160
that our user is using so that can be very useful for certain types of text.

25
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.040
But we'll go back to hello Rob for now.

26
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.260
Then we can add a description if we want to our content.

27
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.930
I'm going to leave that blank.

28
00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:33.100
We can change the appearance so we can choose from a range of the different kind of standard styles

29
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.350
within Android.

30
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.190
Just put one on that a go which have certain sizes and whites and colors etc..

31
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.870
Again the advantage of using those is because our Android knows what sort of text that is.

32
00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.860
It will update and it will look nice regardless of the device that the user is on.

33
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.170
So I'd recommend using the default ones when you can.

34
00:02:53.320 --> 00:03:00.800
But if you really want to customize you can choose from a range of font families install your own phones

35
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.830
as you find out how to do later on in the course.

36
00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:15.060
And you can edit all of these can feel free to play around with font sizes line spacing to make any

37
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.470
difference because we've only got a single line then we can change colors.

38
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.850
And again we get a range of standard colors.

39
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:39.210
But if you want a very specific color and hover over the three dots until you get the button appearing

40
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.270
and then click you can take a couple of seconds to come up.

41
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.180
So be patient.

42
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.890
And again you can choose from all the standard colors or you can select

43
00:03:52.860 --> 00:04:01.800
from a range of different colors or once you've got a color you can edit it.

44
00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.960
To display however you like.

45
00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.060
So let's leave that as red as we go.

46
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.840
And you know just I've updated the primary dark color that so wherever I use that color it will now

47
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.460
be red bold italic.

48
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:28.900
And caps and alignment here which won't make any difference because we've chosen a layout with which

49
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.900
is rap content.

50
00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.130
Can't quite see the wrap there.

51
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.250
In fact as I was a bit more room

52
00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.680
that week so we can see the options.

53
00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:51.770
But if we change the width to match constraint for example that will then stretch out the text field

54
00:04:51.770 --> 00:05:00.620
to the whole width of the screen and then if we were to align the right for example or center that would

55
00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:01.790
make a difference.

56
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.970
And next we've got a whole range of attributes.

57
00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:10.360
So could a diva one of visibility that where we can

58
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.750
make our text be invisible if we like.

59
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.880
I'll keep it as visible for now and then we can view all attributes.

60
00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:28.590
And there's just a massive range of attributes that we can edit if we want to.

61
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.590
I'm going to just pick out a few that will be useful not only for text fields but also images.

62
00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.330
Any other type of content that you want to display within your app.

63
00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:42.690
So as with lÃº with we change that we can change the height as well.

64
00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.550
So if we want to make it full height we can do that.

65
00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.300
We can add constraints.

66
00:05:50.330 --> 00:06:00.690
So linking it to different parts of the screen so at the moment the bottom is matched to the bottom

67
00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:08.580
of the parent the parent in this case being the constraint lay out or the frame around the main content

68
00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.120
area of the screen.

69
00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:16.350
The left is linked to the left of that the right to the right of that etc. but you can change those

70
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.350
to customize the layout in many different ways.

71
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.990
We're going to look at that in more detail later in the course but feel free to play around with it

72
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.330
for now if you like.

73
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:31.730
We can add margins so let's quickly put a margin in.

74
00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.310
Again we can choose differe ones.

75
00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:39.540
So let's go for that.

76
00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:43.270
So now we've got a 64 DP margin.

77
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.690
DP is short for density independent pixel.

78
00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:52.000
And this is a quite clever unit which automatically adjusts for the pixel density of a device which

79
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.590
of course varies a lot from one Android device to another if you want to know more about how they work.

80
00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:57.770
Just Google Android.

81
00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:00.920
DP and you'll get a nice clear guide of exactly how they work.

82
00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:04.580
But for now you can just work with them as if they are pixels.

83
00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:06.160
So that's our margin.

84
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:15.830
Our padding we can type in a specific padding if we want lots of other options there.

85
00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:21.590
I'm not going to go through all of them now or you'd go mad but I will show you the alpha option.

86
00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:29.940
Alpha is a number between 0 and 1 that decides how opaque the text view is.

87
00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:37.110
So if we go for say no point five then you can say it becomes slightly faded.

88
00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:43.500
No one is very faded and 0 is essentially invisible.

89
00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:47.400
So that would be really nice when you're layering some text on top of an image.

90
00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:52.020
For example you can find that text out so that the image can still be seen through it and it's a really

91
00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:53.200
nice effect.

92
00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.210
Maybe using it a lot in the course as well.

93
00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:03.600
Another option that's worth being aware of is gravity scrolling down to gravity there and that just

94
00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:10.840
allows you to play with how the content of the text view floats around its container.

95
00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:18.240
So for example we can move it to the bottom turning it from left to right doesn't actually make any

96
00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.910
difference because it's centered.

97
00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:25.120
But if the text was free flowing that would then move to the left or the right.

98
00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:29.750
So gravity can be a really useful way to lay out your UI elements.

99
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:34.900
And then again if you want to stop and look at some of these You're very welcome to do so.

100
00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:40.870
But I'm just going to bring your attention back to the text options which we looked at earlier.

101
00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.440
So we can change all of those there if we want.

102
00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:49.970
And just one more to show you at the beginning but scrolling back up to the top is background

103
00:08:52.920 --> 00:09:07.130
and just like with whatever colors we can choose from a range of colors or edit our own color to act

104
00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:10.160
as the background for our text view.

105
00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:11.550
All right.

106
00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:16.310
So that was really useful and clear there's obviously a huge amount that you can edit there but we've

107
00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:18.500
just gone through the basics for now.

108
00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:25.570
If you want to return back to the Future Attribute view you can do that at the bottom at the bottom.

109
00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:28.100
But for now I'm just going to give you a little challenge.

110
00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:30.580
You'll find out do that a lot throughout all my courses.

111
00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:35.210
It's really important not just to sit and watch but to actually put this stuff that I'm teaching you

112
00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:42.860
into practice and at the end of almost every video there will be a little challenge for you to do exactly

113
00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.330
that.

114
00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:51.020
So you can say I just deleted that text for you then we're going to bring in a new text.

115
00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:55.420
And notice we've got range of different types of text views as well.

116
00:09:55.460 --> 00:10:02.530
If you want to use them for specific types of data I'm going to drag in the text view and you can see

117
00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:09.460
as we move it around these lines appear which just give you guides as to the layout.

118
00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:13.960
So we'll have a centered text VI and there we go.

119
00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:16.670
Notice that we've got an error there.

120
00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:19.070
And that's because this view isn't constrained.

121
00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:25.490
Remember the view is the text view itself and it's just floating around there we haven't decided exactly

122
00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:28.700
how it should be fixed on the screen.

123
00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:40.900
So one way to do that is to add in margins which we can do by plus plus plus and plus and the text for

124
00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:44.850
you is now constrained by those margins.

125
00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:51.600
So now I've shown you that let's get rid of this and give you your challenge which is to create this

126
00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:53.490
text view.

127
00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:57.470
So we want to align centrally and towards the top of the layout.

128
00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:03.660
It should say migrate app in green and bold and pretty large font and with a lovely orange background

129
00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:04.250
there.

130
00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:10.360
So it doesn't necessarily look beautiful but it will test that you know to edit and customize text.

131
00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:11.040
All right.

132
00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.170
So I'll leave that there for you as a guide.

133
00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:17.620
Time to pause the video and recreate the migrate app text view.

134
00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:18.610
Go for it.

135
00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:23.540
OK.

136
00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:24.190
Here we go.

137
00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:25.530
I hope you manage to do that.

138
00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:30.310
But I'm just going to show you how I would have solved that.

139
00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:34.310
So I will start by dragging in the text view towards the top.

140
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:39.590
And before I had the margins I'm going to have the content that I want for the text.

141
00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.330
So we'll change the text to

142
00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:48.750
migrate app and then we want to make it

143
00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:53.880
30 s.p.

144
00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:57.720
So I noticed that the text size is given in espies rather than the.

145
00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:05.440
And espie is a scale independent pixel which is essentially the same as a DP but if the user decides

146
00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:10.300
that they want all of their text on their Android device to be a little bit bigger or smaller for whatever

147
00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:13.300
reason they s.p will be affected by that.

148
00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:22.000
So generally you should use DP for design in general but espies for text size so that PSP looks about

149
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.500
right to me.

150
00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:26.560
And we can add bold

151
00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:37.900
and we'll change the text color to Dogberry every day.

152
00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:42.380
And I'm going to bring it back so centered.

153
00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:46.540
And finally I'm going to change the background

154
00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:54.540
to

155
00:12:57.310 --> 00:13:02.520
lovely light orange fantastic.

156
00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:07.660
Know the most beautiful title text for your app but it shows that we know what we're doing when it comes

157
00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:13.850
to changing the color and background size and font weight of our text V.

158
00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.130
So now that we've got it.

159
00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:22.700
Let's just get rid of all the attributes and I'm going to add in those margins.

160
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:29.660
So it should display at the top and center of my device.

161
00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:32.310
Let's just click play to make sure.

162
00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:36.930
And there we go.

163
00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:38.590
It's displaying where we want it.

164
00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:43.520
It is always worth running your app to make sure particularly in terms of layout that it displays how

165
00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:43.960
you want.

166
00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:48.950
Just because it looks right on the layout guide here doesn't necessarily mean that it will look good

167
00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:50.370
on the screen.

168
00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:51.220
Excellent.

169
00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:57.320
So now that we've learned how to customize and work with text views we're going to start making interactive

170
00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:02.810
apps and we'll do that by learning how to add buttons to our apps and writing a little bit of code to

171
00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:04.860
make those buttons interactive.
