00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.790
All right let's go ahead and kick off this Android Wear section by talking about what it is Android

2
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.730
Wear is a series of smartwatches that run a special version of Android called Android Wear.

3
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.250
How crazy is that.

4
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.480
Now we have watches that have operating systems on them.

5
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:18.780
Blows my mind.

6
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.370
I just think it's insane.

7
00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.640
But anyways Android where you can run apps on them that's what we're going to be creating.

8
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.330
Of course you can tell time so Android has their own stuff baked in but we can make apps that people

9
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.020
can use.

10
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.570
So you'll notice from this that there's different kinds of watches some that have a round face and then

11
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.460
some that have a square face.

12
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:44.220
I will say from all the promo material round seems to be the more popular one like as we scroll through

13
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.200
all these devices just round round round round.

14
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.540
And even as we come down here and we're looking at all these different watches like round round round

15
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.640
round round and eventually Oh look there's one square one round round round round round round round

16
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.500
and then oh there's another square one.

17
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.710
So those are the two different types of watch faces that we can create.

18
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.530
But you know we're going to talk about how to create both of them.

19
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.450
It's not too different between the two but there are some differences and we'll we'll dive into that.

20
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.860
But let's go ahead and start a new project I want to just create sort of a hello world application to

21
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.590
get started and learn about Android Wear So go ahead make a new project call it whatever you want to

22
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.580
call mine Android where demo and we'll go ahead and hit next now on this screen this is where we got

23
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:30.700
to pay attention.

24
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.370
We don't want the phone and tablet we want the where selected to say hey this is what we're trying to

25
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:36.140
create.

26
00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.840
Then you can choose your API level.

27
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.760
I'm going to go with API 23 Android 6.0.

28
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.380
You can decide whichever one you want.

29
00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.280
Well I would go higher than this if you want to select a different version.

30
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.300
I wouldn't go lower than this but at least have API 23 there.

31
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.120
And we'll go ahead and hit Next choose where you want to start.

32
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.280
I think we just want a blank where activity we're trying to do hello world and the default main activity

33
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.700
that's fine will go ahead and run with that.

34
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.120
And that's one thing that I'd like to emphasize here is that you're not going to see too big of a difference

35
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.940
between these Android Ware projects and your own projects like they have activities we can put things

36
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.710
like text views on them.

37
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.020
It's really quite amazing how similar the two are and obviously there's differences but there is a lot

38
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.860
of similarities there.

39
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.790
Now in order to get this started if we're going to test out the watch this you know app that we're making

40
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.690
we're going to have to have a device to simulate Adlon.

41
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.440
So go ahead and move up to the top here.

42
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.690
We want to go to Tools Android HVD manager.

43
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.740
This is where we manage all our virtual devices.

44
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:47.520
So if we go here we have some devices that we created before but we want to do a new one and go ahead

45
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.860
and select where here on the left side and there's a couple of different options here.

46
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.090
So we have you know a square one.

47
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.660
We have some round ones over here I want to see what the name is.

48
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.980
Oh the round with a chin.

49
00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.300
So let's go ahead and make both a square and a round one and let's start first with the square.

50
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.790
So we'll select square hit next.

51
00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.370
And looks like we're going to have to pick one of these systems to download.

52
00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.540
So let's just go for the latest and greatest.

53
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.250
Let's do Orio.

54
00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.500
I don't think I want the China version so I'll select this one.

55
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.710
We'll go ahead and grab that.

56
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.200
All right so just have to wait a second here for this to download.

57
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.500
So now that that's finished I'm going to go ahead and select Orio here say next.

58
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.250
And I'm just going to do all the defaults for this and I'll go ahead and say finish.

59
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.230
OK so this is going to make our square device which we want to test on.

60
00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.910
And well I think it is.

61
00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.800
We go that kind of bugged me for a second but let's go ahead and make a round once or when we go back

62
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.880
to HVD manager Scott R-squared device there.

63
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:59.840
But let's also go to wear and do this round on here so you can choose whether you get the Chinen or

64
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:00.130
not.

65
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.200
So the chin just kind of has this flat piece at the bottom.

66
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.540
But let's just go ahead and go for the full round on here so we'll select that.

67
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.440
And again I'm going to pick that same Oreo that we had just downloaded and we'll hit finish there.

68
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:13.420
OK.

69
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:20.440
So with these two we just want to see that we can at least get a hello world to show up and the Android

70
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.960
studio project that we've got actually comes with everything ready to rock and roll here so let's go

71
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:32.240
ahead and run our app and let's pick a device let's maybe start first with round go ahead and hit OK

72
00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.950
that's going to take a second to load up here.

73
00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:39.700
So while that's going let me just go ahead and walk you through what a project looks like here.

74
00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:47.960
So there comes the emulator popping up now something is going to look really familiar like there's an

75
00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.610
android manifests.

76
00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.540
You know looks very similar to what we had before with our other apps.

77
00:04:53.690 --> 00:05:00.140
If we go into Java there's a main activity you're like oh OK there's a main activity in here.

78
00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:05.090
Someone has a text view the way that we grab that still just fine view by ID.

79
00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.580
That seems just like what we've done before.

80
00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:14.190
But also if we go down to lay out we have this main activity.

81
00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:23.310
And so you can see down here we've got a string showing up that says Hello square world.

82
00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:24.430
OK.

83
00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.530
So that's showing up there and we're going to want to make sure that this can work on both square and

84
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:28.970
round.

85
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.640
We're going to talk about how to do that in a second.

86
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.700
But you know we've got all our different pieces here it's pretty similar to what we had before obviously

87
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:43.620
a few differences and it's a real shame that the layout out here doesn't show you what it would look

88
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.690
like on the actual device but what are you going to do.

89
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:53.580
So let's go ahead and give this one more moment here to finish running its course.

90
00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:53.970
All right.

91
00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.560
So we finally got that to show up and look we have this nice halo round world and you might be scratching

92
00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.050
your head for a second saying hey what the heck are string here said.

93
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.570
Hello squared world.

94
00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.920
Why is that saying hello round world on the round one like how does it know what I'm going to talk about

95
00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:08.380
that.

96
00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.670
But because it takes so long to get these emulators up and running.

97
00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:13.570
Let's stop the one that we have now.

98
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:18.060
Let's hit run again and let's change it now to the squared device so we can see what that looks like.

99
00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:22.140
We just want to confirm that this is working in both scenarios.

100
00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:30.030
So with this text view that we have here we go ahead and click back you can see that with the string

101
00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:35.730
it has this at string in front which means the actual value for the string is stored in a separate file

102
00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.440
which we can find in values here.

103
00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:42.390
And if you go to strings not ex-MIL there's two different versions so one is just a regular But then

104
00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:48.180
one says round so the round one this gets loaded when it's running on a round Android Wear device and

105
00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:50.990
then the square one gets run when it's running on a square.

106
00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:55.150
So you can see for the square one we have hello square world.

107
00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:58.140
And on the round one we have hello round world.

108
00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:04.230
So that's the way that it's able to sort of differentiate between the two and the real goal with Android

109
00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:10.080
where as far as you know the two devices goes the round in the square is that they want to make it easy

110
00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:16.260
as possible so that when you build an app that you don't have to you know do one complete app for square

111
00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.920
one and a whole separate one for the round one like they're practically the same shape.

112
00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:25.500
There are some differences between the two and they're going to allow you to design and write code for

113
00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:25.910
that too.

114
00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:31.790
But you know as much as you can make them both the same it's going to save you a ton of time as a developer.

115
00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:36.380
And look at that the square watch opened up and we have Halo square world.

116
00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:36.890
OK.

117
00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:41.190
So this is a great place for us to start we're now going to move on to talking about the two different

118
00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:44.790
watch faces the square in the round and how we can work with them.

119
00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:46.490
So let's go ahead and dive into that.
