00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.300
In this lecture we're going to be talking about list views and how we can use them with Android Wear.

2
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.550
And luckily for us it's extremely similar to how we do it with regular Android apps.

3
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:16.020
So let's go ahead and create a new Android project I'm going to maybe just call it we're where list

4
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.740
view and we want to make sure that we are using the where option here.

5
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:29.020
I'm going to go ahead with API 23 feel free to pick whichever one you'd like above that or at that level.

6
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.120
We'll go ahead and create this.

7
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.840
So the example that we're going to be using is we're just going to have a list of friends and we're

8
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.970
going to get it to show up inside of a list view I think we've done this example before but I want you

9
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.810
to see what it looks like on Android Wear.

10
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.940
So let's go ahead and go first into our class and we have some information right now for a text view

11
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.920
that's been showing up.

12
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.250
But you know we're not going to be using that text fusel Let's go ahead and get rid of that.

13
00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.130
This as well.

14
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.260
And now we'll go ahead and move back to the layout file here because this is where first we're going

15
00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.410
to want to be able to add a list view and then we'll go ahead and move forward from there.

16
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:16.280
So let's get rid of this text view that we have we'll go grab a list view.

17
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.790
Just drag that into the frame layout awesome.

18
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.560
So now we have this list let's give it a proper ID.

19
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.930
I'm just going to call it list view.

20
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.560
Kind of boring name but look at that fills up everything.

21
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.840
So now we can get access to this list view by just saying list view.

22
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:42.930
I'm going to call it lower caseless view is equal to fine view by id our DOT ID list view.

23
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.090
Excellent.

24
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.740
And then with this in place we're just going to do the typical things that we've done before.

25
00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.210
What we're trying to fill up a list view first we have to have an array.

26
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.890
So I'm going to make a string array of friends and I'm going to say that this is equal to let's add

27
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.560
some friends in here.

28
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.810
We'll have Joe.

29
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:11.740
Ralph let's put Sarah in there and maybe Jane.

30
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:12.590
OK.

31
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.820
So there we go.

32
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.960
And just to really show what a big list would look like I'm going to go ahead and copy these last three

33
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.340
names and just paste it in a few times so we can have a nice big list there.

34
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.190
So since we have that array Let's go ahead and make an array adapter and I'll just call this lower case

35
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.510
a re adapter and say this is equal to a new array.

36
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.010
Got my capital their new capital array adapter.

37
00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.010
It's going to pass and that's the end I have to do.

38
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:51.980
Lower case Android got our lay out symbolist item one and then we'll go ahead and pass the friends array.

39
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:59.190
So I'll pass that in to my semi-colon there and since we now have this array adapter it's just a matter

40
00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.900
of getting this set inside of the list view.

41
00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.130
So just say List View set adapter.

42
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.500
Go ahead and pass in the array adapter.

43
00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.970
And really that's it.

44
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.510
That's all it takes to get a list view up and running on Android Wear.

45
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.360
So let's go ahead and run this let's see what it looks like maybe on the square.

46
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.280
Watch here.

47
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.820
All right so the emulator finally finished up here and look at this.

48
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.990
We can scroll through we can see all the friends here in the list.

49
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.590
I mean this is just like a list view that we'd see inside of a normal lap and go ahead select one side

50
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.530
and you see we get the cool animations Well let's take it one step further let's make it so that when

51
00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.090
you click on one of these names we have a text message showing that user's name.

52
00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.260
So I think you're more than capable of handling this so go ahead.

53
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.790
Hit pause on this video and go implement that by yourself right now.

54
00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.490
All right.

55
00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:57.180
So hopefully that went well for you.

56
00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.070
But we need to do is set up an on click listener for the list view.

57
00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.710
So I'm going to say List View set on item click listener.

58
00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.180
That's going to be a new on item click listener.

59
00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.270
And then what we're going to do inside of here is we're going to make a toast message so we're going

60
00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:23.870
to do our capital toast make toast or make text excuse me and we're going to pass in our main activity

61
00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:24.930
up here.

62
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:31.880
So we're going to do main activity this and then we're going to go ahead and pass in a string which

63
00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.240
should just be friends array.

64
00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:41.660
And you know say whatever that position is sold to friends at the position there and then we'll go ahead

65
00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.740
and say how long we want this to show up.

66
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:49.760
And in this case I'm going to say short length and then we'll go ahead and show this.

67
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.250
Also looks like this was auto completed for me.

68
00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:58.620
But make sure you have a final string array here so that you're able to access it.

69
00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.750
And with that let's go ahead and see what this looks like on the round device.

70
00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.530
We'll go ahead and hit OK there.

71
00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:12.520
It's always fun to kind of compare and trust between the two I think and we'll see what this looks like.

72
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.750
So here comes our app

73
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.120
and look there's all our friends let's go ahead and tap on one of them like Jane and look at shows Jane.

74
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.410
I tap on Sarot sir.

75
00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.430
Ralph goes Ralph It took a second for the other one to disappear.

76
00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.410
But there you have it.

77
00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:35.200
So in a lot of ways Android Wear is very similar to making our own apps now in these next lectures we're

78
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.620
going to talk about some things that are very unique to only Android Wear.

79
00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.720
And I think you'll really enjoy these ones.
