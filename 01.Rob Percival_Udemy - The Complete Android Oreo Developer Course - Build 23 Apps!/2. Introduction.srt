Congratulations on making it to Section 9 of The Complete Android and develop of course now if you're

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:12,150
fairly familiar with Passover on AWOS I'm going to challenge you to build a clone of the popular taxi

3
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,050
app Uber.

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,430
Now this is rather more complicated than the Instagram app that we built before.

5
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:22,860
For two reasons the first of course it requires geo location and maps.

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:27,120
So we'll need to integrate the skills that we learned a couple of sections ago with what we know about

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:33,690
Passover but also will need to have two sections of the app one for writers and one for drivers and

8
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,110
then both of those We're going to need to communicate with each other.

9
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,970
I'm also going to expect you to do a little more of the work yourself this time around as you are fairly

10
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:48,780
familiar with as I say Passover and the geo location aspects of Android apps and the more you do yourself

11
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,320
the more you will learn.

12
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,870
But of course I'll go through the whole process step by step and you can watch me doing it if you'd

13
00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:00,780
rather learn that way at the same time be of course thinking how you might apply this to apps that you're

14
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:07,070
building and how you might work in both geo location and some social features using Passover.

15
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,570
So enjoy making the overclaim and I'll see you at the beginning of the next section.
