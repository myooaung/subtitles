Hello and welcome to the course on augmented random search.

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.830
My name is Carol Eremenko and along with the second instruction on this course at the London Treves

3
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:16.170
would like to extend a huge and warm welcome into this very first tutorial of this course on KRS and

4
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:23.010
this tutorial is designed to tell you a bit about the course and what to expect in the upcoming tutorials

5
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.660
so that you're better prepared and you're fully enjoying the journey and getting the most out of it.

6
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.740
So let's have a look what is augmented random search all about well augmented random search is a new

7
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.500
it's a brand new artificial intelligence algorithm that was published just recently.

8
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.060
So here I've got the research paper in front of us as you can see it was submitted to archive on 19th

9
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.790
March 2018.

10
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.920
It's a very very new type of artificial intelligence.

11
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.670
It's very simple.

12
00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.620
And at the same time it surpasses in many ways the AI algorithms that existed before it.

13
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.990
And that's why we jumped on top of this opportunity we discovered it for ourselves and we couldn't wait

14
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.380
to share it with you.

15
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:15.750
And here in this research paper you'll find all the details of the arrest algorithm how it works how

16
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:23.800
it compares on benchmarks such as Mujer go with other algorithms and what the algorithm is behind it.

17
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.460
So we're going to actually use this research paper quite a bit inside the tutorials but you don't need

18
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.610
to run and download it right away and get.

19
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.770
You don't have to go through it.

20
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.690
You can if you like if you would like to get to know the research paper beforehand then feel free to

21
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.940
do so but otherwise we will walk you through it.

22
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:47.700
We'll walk you through different parts of it in the upcoming tutorials and so that way the whole algorithm

23
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:53.520
will be broken down into bite sized chunks so that you understand exactly how it works and together

24
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.120
we'll learn how to use.

25
00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.770
Now going back to our presentation.

26
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.280
What is so exciting about Eris is that it performs really really well.

27
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.980
And so here we've got two examples.

28
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.210
There's a half cheetah and there's the humanoid.

29
00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.130
They're both in this.

30
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.520
In these cases driven by the arrows algorithm.

31
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.080
If you haven't worked with this environment before don't worry we'll definitely covered off inside the

32
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.320
course.

33
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:27.300
But basically what we're seeing here is the Apress artificial intelligence Algren's is has trained these

34
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.890
models on how to walk and run in this environment.

35
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.290
And that's just one of the examples of applications of Erris of course that can be applied in many different

36
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.200
ways.

37
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.200
However this is a very commonly used benchmark.

38
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:49.500
And on this benchmark Erris outperforms other existing algorithms up to it's up to 15 times faster and

39
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.480
gets better results.

40
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.330
So that's why it's so exciting so interesting.

41
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.220
And so now let's move on to a bit about how the Course is structured this course.

42
00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:06.900
Like many of our other courses has two main components it has intuition tutorials and it has practical

43
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:07.590
tutorials.

44
00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.620
So personally I take care of the intuition side of things and Adlon creates the practical tutorials

45
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.670
the coding section on the course.

46
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.920
So why do we have two parts to most of our courses.

47
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:27.210
Well the intuition side of things allows you to understand the main concepts behind a certain technology

48
00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.390
or a certain algorithm or something that we are talking about.

49
00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.530
And understanding these main concepts doesn't mean getting into them thematics and getting bogged down

50
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.970
with all this all these difficult complicated calculations.

51
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:48.160
Not at all it just means understanding philosophically or understanding on a on a very intuitive level.

52
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:55.830
How exactly a certain technology or certain algorithm works what is it at its core is kind of my favorite

53
00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:02.100
example is kind of like you don't need to know how a car works on the inside you don't need to know

54
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:08.090
all the how all the details all the little mechanisms inside of car work in order to drive it.

55
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.380
But you do need to know where to put the petrol what the gas does what the brakes do and you know what

56
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:14.310
the steering wheel does.

57
00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.350
Things like that so that's what the intuition is all about.

58
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:25.380
To give a very clear picture of what this technology is all about and understand the main concepts and

59
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:32.850
then we dive into the practical and learn crazy tutorials to help you learn how to apply all that theory

60
00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:39.050
that we learned all this amazing technology in practice and I'd learn you'll actually code line by line.

61
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:50.390
This Erris algorithm and you will be able to apply to specific problems in this major eco environment.

62
00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:57.870
So you'll be able to see how it performs on that commonly accepted globally accepted benchmark and how

63
00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.550
what amazing results you'll be it from them.

64
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.920
So together when you combine these you'll get both the theory and the practical application so you'll

65
00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:11.400
be ready to use it in other areas whether it be business or other challenges other benchmarks.

66
00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.070
So there we go that's how this course is structured from a high level perspective.

67
00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.770
Personally we can't wait to dive into the first tutorials.

68
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:25.860
We are very excited to walk through areas and break it down into bite sized pieces so that we can all

69
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.120
understand it and apply it to very exciting and interesting challenges.

70
00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.900
So here's to success and we await to see in the next tutorial.

71
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.550
Until then enjoy AI.
