1
00:00:02,076 --> 00:00:07,076
Okay, let's quickly check your development environment is set up correctly.

2
00:00:07,076 --> 00:00:11,076
We won't need our database and testing frameworks yet.

3
00:00:11,076 --> 00:00:15,076
So let's just focus on the essential tools for now.

4
00:00:15,076 --> 00:00:21,076
First of all we need a JDK or Java Development Kit.

5
00:00:21,076 --> 00:00:22,076
As I mentioned earlier,

6
00:00:22,076 --> 00:00:24,493
the prerequisites for this course is to have some

7
00:00:24,493 --> 00:00:26,576
knowledge of the Java language,

8
00:00:26,576 --> 00:00:30,576
so I'm assuming that you already have it installed.

9
00:00:30,576 --> 00:00:34,576
Then we need Maven, as we've just seen,

10
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:37,933
installing Maven is just a matter of downloading a zip file

11
00:00:37,933 --> 00:00:41,647
and then zipping it to your file system.

12
00:00:41,647 --> 00:00:48,076
Same for WildFly, which is our Java EE runtime environment.

13
00:00:48,076 --> 00:00:50,768
So here I've switched to the terminal.

14
00:00:50,768 --> 00:00:54,076
First of all, make sure Java is installed.

15
00:00:54,076 --> 00:00:59,743
So java -version will show you which version of Java is installed,

16
00:00:59,743 --> 00:01:05,461
here it's Java 8, and we'll make sure that Java is in your class path.

17
00:01:05,461 --> 00:01:13,076
Then Maven, we can do the same and go maven -version.

18
00:01:13,076 --> 00:01:17,621
Here it's written in red, I have Apache Maven 3.

19
00:01:17,621 --> 00:01:18,076
5.

20
00:01:18,076 --> 00:01:25,276
Finally, WildFly, you can see I've installed WildFly 10.

21
00:01:25,276 --> 00:01:26,076
1.

22
00:01:26,076 --> 00:01:30,876
The bin directory will have this standalone script,

23
00:01:30,876 --> 00:01:33,826
which bootstrapped the application server,

24
00:01:33,826 --> 00:01:41,076
so if I go standalone, you will see logs going through.

25
00:01:41,076 --> 00:01:46,076
That's when we bootstrap WildFly.

26
00:01:46,076 --> 00:01:48,576
Here it is, WildFly has been started.

27
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:55,576
To make sure it's up and running, we can go to the browser on port 8080,

28
00:01:55,576 --> 00:01:59,076
that shows you the WildFly home page.

29
00:01:59,076 --> 00:02:02,307
Let's click on the Admin Console.

30
00:02:02,307 --> 00:02:08,621
The admin console tells us that first we need to create an admin user,

31
00:02:08,621 --> 00:02:10,076
running the add-user script.

32
00:02:10,076 --> 00:02:14,076
So let's go back to the terminal.

33
00:02:14,076 --> 00:02:22,076
Here I use another tab and I use the add-user shell script.

34
00:02:22,076 --> 00:02:26,985
What type of user do we need to add?

35
00:02:26,985 --> 00:02:28,076
Management User.

36
00:02:28,076 --> 00:02:32,276
Now let's pick up a username, I use agoncal,

37
00:02:32,276 --> 00:02:39,076
and a password, are you sure your password is correct?

38
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:40,076
Yes.

39
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:42,076
Re-enter password.

40
00:02:42,076 --> 00:02:43,862
The groups, let's leave empty.

41
00:02:43,862 --> 00:02:48,167
Do I want to add this user to the management realm?

42
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:48,712
Yes.

43
00:02:48,712 --> 00:02:53,076
Do I need a remote connection for EJB?

44
00:02:53,076 --> 00:02:53,576
No.

45
00:02:53,576 --> 00:02:55,076
And that's it.

46
00:02:55,076 --> 00:03:01,362
So if I go back to the browser, and go down the page and try again,

47
00:03:01,362 --> 00:03:03,876
now I'm prompted with a username and password,

48
00:03:03,876 --> 00:03:17,000
I connect to it, and here I am in front of the WildFly Administration Console. We will use it in the coming modules.
