00:00:02,447 --> 00:00:03,953
Last but not least,

2
00:00:03,953 --> 00:00:09,497
we will need a browser to visualize our web application and interact with it.

3
00:00:09,497 --> 00:00:14,940
Of course when we develop a web application we need to make

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,705
sure it works well on the main browsers,

5
00:00:18,705 --> 00:00:21,725
Edge, Firefox, Opera, Safari, and Chrome.

6
00:00:21,725 --> 00:00:27,901
They all have their pros and cons and all more or less

7
00:00:27,901 --> 00:00:33,392
up to date with the latest HTML, CSS, and JavaScript version.

8
00:00:33,392 --> 00:00:35,673
I won't go into these kind of details here,

9
00:00:35,673 --> 00:00:42,059
but I will explain why I'm using Chrome in this course.

10
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:48,278
Chrome is a web browser developed by Google and was first released in 2008.

11
00:00:48,278 --> 00:00:53,902
It is one of the most famous browsers on desktops, but also on mobiles.

12
00:00:53,902 --> 00:00:57,480
The nice thing with Chrome when developing an Angular application,

13
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,415
it is Chrome development tools.

14
00:00:59,415 --> 00:01:03,859
The DevTools are a set of web authoring and debugging

15
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:07,227
tools built into Google Chrome.

16
00:01:07,227 --> 00:01:13,421
We can use the DevTools to iterate, debug, and profile our web application.

17
00:01:13,421 --> 00:01:16,249
Thanks to Google Chrome extension we can install

18
00:01:16,249 --> 00:01:21,436
development tools specific to Angular.

19
00:01:21,436 --> 00:01:26,200
Here I'm using Chrome to browse the DevTools webpage.

20
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,810
It says to open the DevTools pan with common option I on Mac,

21
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:35,037
if I press it, here it is.

22
00:01:35,037 --> 00:01:39,041
As explained in the documentation there are several

23
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:42,548
panels to manipulate the DOM, the console,

24
00:01:42,548 --> 00:01:46,058
source panels to check the webpage source,

25
00:01:46,058 --> 00:01:57,000
or the network panel to be able to analyze all the network calls. We will use these panels in our development.
