To finish implementing our BookRepository we need to

2
00:00:05.578 --> 00:00:07.076
implement transaction demarcation.

3
00:00:07.076 --> 00:00:13.350
Basically, it's just adding a transactional annotation on all our methods.

4
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.667
The REQUIRED strategy always starts a new transaction,

5
00:00:17.667 --> 00:00:22.003
that's the needed strategy for write only operation.

6
00:00:22.003 --> 00:00:29.684
SUPPORTS inherit from the caller transaction, perfect for read only.

7
00:00:29.684 --> 00:00:34.498
So let's add transaction management to our BookRepository.

8
00:00:34.498 --> 00:00:40.201
The create and the delete methods are write only data,

9
00:00:40.201 --> 00:00:46.445
so it's wise to use the REQUIRED strategy,

10
00:00:46.445 --> 00:00:47.351
REQUIRED.

11
00:00:47.351 --> 00:00:54.256
Let's import that so we only have REQUIRED.

12
00:00:54.256 --> 00:00:59.789
Copy/paste this line on the delete method.

13
00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.792
So now let's do the same thing but for the read only methods,

14
00:01:05.792 --> 00:01:07.686
the find, findAll, and countAll.

15
00:01:07.686 --> 00:01:11.194
But this time we don't use the REQUIRED,

16
00:01:11.194 --> 00:01:17.188
we use SUPPORTS, a different transactions strategy.

17
00:01:17.188 --> 00:01:33.000
We can copy/paste it on all the read only methods or we can just delete them and add the transaction strategy to the class itself.
