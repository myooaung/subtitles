1
00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:06,082
Angular CLI is the right tool to scaffold an Angular

2
00:00:06,082 --> 00:00:07,770
application and generate code.

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:13,827
But we will be using a second scaffolding tool, Swagger code generator.

4
00:00:13,827 --> 00:00:18,036
We've seen Swagger before when we created our JSON

5
00:00:18,036 --> 00:00:20,308
contract for our REST service.

6
00:00:20,308 --> 00:00:26,395
Swagger comes with different tools, such as the contract editor that we saw.

7
00:00:26,395 --> 00:00:28,348
As its name implies,

8
00:00:28,348 --> 00:00:32,959
Swagger code generator generates code from a Swagger contract.

9
00:00:32,959 --> 00:00:40,112
It actually generates codes in over 40 different languages including TypeScript.

10
00:00:40,112 --> 00:00:43,973
So we will use Swagger CodeGen to generate the TypeScript client

11
00:00:43,973 --> 00:00:50,849
stub directly from our BookEndpoint JSON contract.

12
00:00:50,849 --> 00:00:55,875
Being a common line tool, we need to install it in our computer.

13
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:58,232
If you click on the Download button,

14
00:00:58,232 --> 00:01:00,995
you get to the Swagger CodeGen documentation.

15
00:01:00,995 --> 00:01:03,223
In this documentation,

16
00:01:03,223 --> 00:01:11,461
you will find all the information about Swagger and also how to install it.

17
00:01:11,461 --> 00:01:23,000
Again, if you're on Mac OS X, it's just a brew command line. Make sure you have a few moments to install it.
