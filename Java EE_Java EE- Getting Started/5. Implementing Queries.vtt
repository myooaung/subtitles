00:00:02.238 --> 00:00:05.764
Let's go back to our IDE and do exactly that.

2
00:00:05.764 --> 00:00:10.665
Let's implement JPQL queries in our BookRepository.

3
00:00:10.665 --> 00:00:15.889
One query to select all the books ordered by title and

4
00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:21.269
another query counting the number of books.

5
00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:26.069
Okay so here we are in front of the BookRepository.

6
00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:33.691
So let's create these two methods, the first one let's call it findAll,

7
00:00:33.691 --> 00:00:38.166
which will return all books, a list of books.

8
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:40.932
FindAll doesn't take any parameter,

9
00:00:40.932 --> 00:00:45.502
and the other method that counts the number of books,

10
00:00:45.502 --> 00:00:51.561
so the number of books, it's a Long and the method is called countAll.

11
00:00:51.561 --> 00:00:56.808
Now let's create the JPQL queries.

12
00:00:56.808 --> 00:01:00.512
So we use the Entity Manager to create a query.

13
00:01:00.512 --> 00:01:07.522
This one will return books and then it's just a matter of typing the query,

14
00:01:07.522 --> 00:01:09.350
the JPQL query.

15
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:16.166
Select b, b being the alias of Book, ordered by b.

16
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:21.995
title, title being the attribute of the Book entity.

17
00:01:21.995 --> 00:01:27.172
This query returns a TypedQuery of type Book,

18
00:01:27.172 --> 00:01:32.843
let's call it query, and to get the result of this query,

19
00:01:32.843 --> 00:01:36.564
because it returns several lines, we do query.

20
00:01:36.564 --> 00:01:38.956
getResultList and return it.

21
00:01:38.956 --> 00:01:44.339
For the countAll, it's more or less the same thing.

22
00:01:44.339 --> 00:01:48.327
So we take the Entity Manager to create a query,

23
00:01:48.327 --> 00:01:53.307
this time it will return a Long, the number of books,

24
00:01:53.307 --> 00:01:59.367
and we type the query, select count b, and again,

25
00:01:59.367 --> 00:02:07.004
b being the alias for Books, so select all the books and count them.

26
00:02:07.004 --> 00:02:10.074
And that will also retype a TypedQuery,

27
00:02:10.074 --> 00:02:17.970
but this time of type Long because what we want is the number of books.

28
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:18.969
Query.

29
00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:26.631
getSingleResult instead of resultList because it only returns one number.

30
00:02:26.631 --> 00:02:37.000
Here we are. We can scroll up a little bit to have a better look at our BookRepository.
