00:00:02.527 --> 00:00:04.897
Now that you know a bit more about JPA,

2
00:00:04.897 --> 00:00:08.680
let's go back to the IDE and create a book repository.

3
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.765
We will implement a few CRUD operations,

4
00:00:11.765 --> 00:00:15.292
such as finding a book by its identifier,

5
00:00:15.292 --> 00:00:20.718
persisting a book into the database, and deleting it.

6
00:00:20.718 --> 00:00:27.204
All these using the Entity Manager API.

7
00:00:27.204 --> 00:00:30.018
So back to where we were,

8
00:00:30.018 --> 00:00:35.553
first let's create a new package and call it repository.

9
00:00:35.553 --> 00:00:48.706
In this new package, let's create a class, our BookRepository.

10
00:00:48.706 --> 00:00:53.693
So the BookRepository is going to deal with the Book entity.

11
00:00:53.693 --> 00:00:57.725
So first of all let's create a method that finds a book.

12
00:00:57.725 --> 00:01:04.909
So given an identifier of type Long, it will return a book.

13
00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.588
Then we want to create a book, so given a Book,

14
00:01:10.588 --> 00:01:17.951
we persist the book in the database and return the created book.

15
00:01:17.951 --> 00:01:21.351
And finally, deleting a book.

16
00:01:21.351 --> 00:01:29.129
Given an identifier, we want to delete one single book in the database.

17
00:01:29.129 --> 00:01:32.651
So how do we make that work?

18
00:01:32.651 --> 00:01:37.652
Well we need the Entity Manager from JPA.

19
00:01:37.652 --> 00:01:44.118
We'll call it em and we need to inject the persistence unit,

20
00:01:44.118 --> 00:01:49.595
so we use this annotation and now we need to give it the unique name,

21
00:01:49.595 --> 00:01:51.696
that's actually in the persistence.

22
00:01:51.696 --> 00:01:52.597
xml.

23
00:01:52.597 --> 00:01:56.203
Do you remember bookStorePU?

24
00:01:56.203 --> 00:01:58.594
So copy and pass that.

25
00:01:58.594 --> 00:02:01.941
Now that we have the Entity Manager,

26
00:02:01.941 --> 00:02:08.935
the way to find a book is just one method call.

27
00:02:08.935 --> 00:02:09.661
EntityManager.

28
00:02:09.661 --> 00:02:16.575
find, giving the class of the book and the identifier.

29
00:02:16.575 --> 00:02:19.249
And we return that.

30
00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:25.525
To create a book, also the one line, EntityManager.

31
00:02:25.525 --> 00:02:30.386
persist and we return the persisted book.

32
00:02:30.386 --> 00:02:37.322
Deleting, it's two method calls, first of all we get a reference on the book,

33
00:02:37.322 --> 00:02:39.754
so it's a bit like a find,

34
00:02:39.754 --> 00:02:53.000
once the book returned from the database we call the EntityManager. remove and that will remove the book from the database.
