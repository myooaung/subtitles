00:00:02,423 --> 00:00:06,527
Until now we've been using Maven to compile our Java code,

2
00:00:06,527 --> 00:00:09,434
package it, deal with dependencies and so on.

3
00:00:09,434 --> 00:00:12,393
But Maven is not suited for Java's development.

4
00:00:12,393 --> 00:00:18,256
We will have to pick up a different building tool for Angular frontend.

5
00:00:18,256 --> 00:00:22,506
There are several JavaScript building tools to choose from.

6
00:00:22,506 --> 00:00:25,081
Bower is one of the oldest,

7
00:00:25,081 --> 00:00:30,109
it is mostly a package manager so we just install the right version

8
00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:33,497
of the packages we need and their dependencies.

9
00:00:33,497 --> 00:00:35,134
Then comes NPM,

10
00:00:35,134 --> 00:00:42,465
NPM is much richer than Bower and perfectly suited for server side JavaScript.

11
00:00:42,465 --> 00:00:48,059
NPM was created in 2010 and it is so famous that it is

12
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:51,505
automatically included when Node JS is installed.

13
00:00:51,505 --> 00:00:57,359
Yarn is much younger, because it was released in October 2016.

14
00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:59,028
Despite its youth,

15
00:00:59,028 --> 00:01:07,530
Yarn is compatible with a public NPM registry and is way much faster than NPM.

16
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:12,520
That's why I've chosen to use Yarn in this course.

17
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,361
Yarn is a common line utility that interacts with the NPM

18
00:01:16,361 --> 00:01:19,223
registry to manage JavaScript dependencies.

19
00:01:19,223 --> 00:01:23,750
Using Yarn we can install library, packages,

20
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:28,298
and applications along with their dependencies.

21
00:01:28,298 --> 00:01:33,572
So it will perfect to install all the Angular libraries.

22
00:01:33,572 --> 00:01:39,746
but we will also use Yarn to execute scripts or transpile

23
00:01:39,746 --> 00:01:42,552
our TypeScript code into JavaScript.

24
00:01:42,552 --> 00:01:47,104
Here on the Yarn website you can have more information by following the

25
00:01:47,104 --> 00:01:53,327
doc links and learn how to install and execute Yarn.

26
00:01:53,327 --> 00:01:56,498
As you can read in the installation,

27
00:01:56,498 --> 00:02:03,993
installing Yarn on Mac OS X is again just a single common brew install Yarn.

28
00:02:03,993 --> 00:02:12,000
Here you can pause the course and install Yarn as we will be using it quite heavily.
