00:00:02.509 --> 00:00:04.259
As you've seen in the first module,

2
00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.509
the BookStore application deals with books and those books

3
00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:10.509
are stored in a relational database.

4
00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:13.509
I'm sure you know that there are few relational databases out there,

5
00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:19.509
from commercial to open source, and it's quite tricky to choose one.

6
00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:25.432
If we stick to the open source world, we have MySQL,

7
00:00:25.432 --> 00:00:27.442
MariaDB, ApacheDerby, SQLite, PostgreSQL,

8
00:00:27.442 --> 00:00:28.376
or H2.

9
00:00:28.376 --> 00:00:30.709
There are a few more,

10
00:00:30.709 --> 00:00:37.509
but I would say these ones are the most used in the Java EE development.

11
00:00:37.509 --> 00:00:42.509
We will use H2 in our BookStore application.

12
00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:44.432
H2 is a relational database,

13
00:00:44.432 --> 00:00:48.873
but its particularity is to be very fast and has a

14
00:00:48.873 --> 00:00:51.600
very small footprint of around 1.

15
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.509
5 MB.

16
00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:58.509
In fact, it's perfect for development because it has an in-memory embedded mode.

17
00:00:58.509 --> 00:01:03.509
This means that we won't be starting and stopping a database server.

18
00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:07.795
Instead, we will just depend on an H2 jar file,

19
00:01:07.795 --> 00:01:09.909
install our data directly in-memory.

20
00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.509
Of course, you shouldn't do that in production environment,

21
00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:19.509
but for development it saves us resources and deployment time.

22
00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:25.509
And like most of the tools we use, H2 is also open-source.

23
00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:28.134
Here we are on the H2 website,

24
00:01:28.134 --> 00:01:32.759
you can see at the bottom all the features and it

25
00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.509
compares H2 with other relational databases.

26
00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.509
On the website, we can see how to install it, but we won't actually.

27
00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.201
We will just add a Maven dependency on H2 and it will

28
00:01:46.201 --> 00:01:48.652
automatically be added to our class path.

29
00:01:48.652 --> 00:01:59.000
In the list of features there is the memory mode I was mentioning, very handy and fast when developing.
