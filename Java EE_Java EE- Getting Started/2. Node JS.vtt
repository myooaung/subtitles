00:00:02.395 --> 00:00:06.014
When we set up our Java EE environment in module 2,

2
00:00:06.014 --> 00:00:11.601
the first requirement was to have Java already installed on your machine.

3
00:00:11.601 --> 00:00:15.707
Java is a prerequisite for Java EE.

4
00:00:15.707 --> 00:00:19.227
Same for Node JS and Angular.

5
00:00:19.227 --> 00:00:24.063
To develop in Angular we need to have Node JS installed.

6
00:00:24.063 --> 00:00:28.560
Node JS is a JavaScript run-time environment for

7
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.761
executing JavaScript code on the server.

8
00:00:31.761 --> 00:00:36.382
Historically JavaScript was primarily used for client side scripting.

9
00:00:36.382 --> 00:00:43.347
JavaScript was embedded in an HTML page and executed on the browser.

10
00:00:43.347 --> 00:00:47.175
Node JS enables JavaScript to be used for server-side

11
00:00:47.175 --> 00:00:51.171
scripting and therefore to produce dynamic web pages before

12
00:00:51.171 --> 00:00:54.638
the page is setn to the browser.

13
00:00:54.638 --> 00:01:01.054
Consequently Node JS has become the foundation of the JavaScript

14
00:01:01.054 --> 00:01:07.706
everywhere paradigm and is mandatory for Angular development.

15
00:01:07.706 --> 00:01:10.050
Here is the website of Node JS.

16
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.300
Node JS is open source and is part of the Linux foundation.

17
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.263
If we click on Downloads,

18
00:01:16.263 --> 00:01:23.309
we can see that Node JS can be executed in most platforms.

19
00:01:23.309 --> 00:01:26.235
If like me, you own Mac OS X,

20
00:01:26.235 --> 00:01:31.255
you can either install the package or use the package manager.

21
00:01:31.255 --> 00:01:35.557
A simple brew install node will do.

22
00:01:35.557 --> 00:01:38.254
IF you don't have Node JS installed on your machine,

23
00:01:38.254 --> 00:01:47.000
you can pause the course now and follow the installation instruction for your platform.
