1
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:07,127
So we have Node JS as the JavaScript runtime environment and

2
00:00:07,127 --> 00:00:10,751
Yarn for compiling and building our code.

3
00:00:10,751 --> 00:00:14,547
We could even start coding right away.

4
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:19,386
But instead we will use Angular CLI to speed up our development.

5
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:24,602
Angular CLI is a common line interface tool to scaffold and build

6
00:00:24,602 --> 00:00:29,829
Angular applications using the Node JS style.

7
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:33,954
It gives us a set of commands to initialize,

8
00:00:33,954 --> 00:00:36,708
develop, and even maintain Angular applications.

9
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:40,852
So we won't need to handle all common tedious

10
00:00:40,852 --> 00:00:46,087
configuration files and directory structures.

11
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:50,105
The generated code just works out of the box.

12
00:00:50,105 --> 00:00:55,789
Think of it as a Maven architect on steroids.

13
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:58,680
When you go to the Angular CLI website,

14
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,731
you stumble a bunch of command that we will see later,

15
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:08,920
such as ng new, ng generate, or ng serve.

16
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,646
Angular CLI being written in JavaScript, we need to use NPM.

17
00:01:14,646 --> 00:01:17,331
If we click on the Getting Started,

18
00:01:17,331 --> 00:01:21,814
we'll have all the instruction to install Angular CLI.

19
00:01:21,814 --> 00:01:25,661
Angular CLI being written in JavaScript,

20
00:01:25,661 --> 00:01:41,000
we need to use NPM to install it globally. As you can see here, you can run npm install -g angular/cli to have access to it.
