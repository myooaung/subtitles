1
00:00:02,513 --> 00:00:07,431
Maven is able to compile and package our code into an archive,

2
00:00:07,431 --> 00:00:11,751
but then we need an application server to execute it.

3
00:00:11,751 --> 00:00:15,976
You can see an application sever as the Java EE runtime,

4
00:00:15,976 --> 00:00:20,430
it is a middleware that brings all the Java EE services,

5
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,846
such as data access, persistence, HTTP support,

6
00:00:23,846 --> 00:00:25,846
security, or monitoring.

7
00:00:25,846 --> 00:00:30,735
Again, we have several implementations to choose from.

8
00:00:30,735 --> 00:00:35,613
GlassFish is the open-source reference implementation from Oracle.

9
00:00:35,613 --> 00:00:40,513
TomEE from the Apache Foundation or Payara.

10
00:00:40,513 --> 00:00:43,713
JBoss and WildFly are both from Red Hat.

11
00:00:43,713 --> 00:00:53,513
In this course we will be using WildFly as it's very light and easy to use.

12
00:00:53,513 --> 00:00:58,513
WildFly is the community and open source application server authored by JBoss,

13
00:00:58,513 --> 00:01:00,436
a division of Red Hat.

14
00:01:00,436 --> 00:01:05,013
WildFly is written in Java and therefore runs on multiple platforms.

15
00:01:05,013 --> 00:01:11,205
The first version of this application server was developed back in 1999,

16
00:01:11,205 --> 00:01:15,513
so you can see how mature it is.

17
00:01:15,513 --> 00:01:18,913
Of course, WildFly implements all the Java Enterprise Edition specification,

18
00:01:18,913 --> 00:01:25,513
but thanks to its modularity it can achieve these and still be very lightweight.

19
00:01:25,513 --> 00:01:30,656
WildFly consumes very few resources and is fast to boot.

20
00:01:30,656 --> 00:01:34,513
Here we are in front of the WildFly website,

21
00:01:34,513 --> 00:01:37,430
with documentation, access to the source code,

22
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:41,695
and of course how to download and install it.

23
00:01:41,695 --> 00:01:45,942
Installing WildFly is as simple as installing Maven,

24
00:01:45,942 --> 00:01:51,513
you just download a zip file and unzip it into your file system.

25
00:01:51,513 --> 00:01:54,744
In this course I'm using WildFly 10.

26
00:01:54,744 --> 00:02:06,000
1 and because WildFly is written in Java, like Maven, you need the JVM installed to be able to execute it.
