00:00:02,016 --> 00:00:07,016
So let's start by answering this question, what is Java EE?

2
00:00:07,016 --> 00:00:09,743
Java EE, or Java Enterprise Edition,

3
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:14,238
is an extension of JavaScript Standard Edition to simplify the

4
00:00:14,238 --> 00:00:16,587
development of multi-tiered enterprise applications,

5
00:00:16,587 --> 00:00:20,016
thanks to its simple programming model.

6
00:00:20,016 --> 00:00:21,349
It is a standard,

7
00:00:21,349 --> 00:00:25,925
meaning it has been through the standardization process of the Java

8
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:31,016
Community Process and is implemented by multiple vendors,

9
00:00:31,016 --> 00:00:34,016
such as Oracle, IBM, or Redhat.

10
00:00:34,016 --> 00:00:35,516
In the early days of Java,

11
00:00:35,516 --> 00:00:38,516
if you were doing any kind of web or enterprise development,

12
00:00:38,516 --> 00:00:45,216
you were living in a proprietary world by creating your own frameworks or

13
00:00:45,216 --> 00:00:50,016
locking yourself to a proprietary or commercial framework.

14
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:54,516
Then came the days of open-source framework, which were not based on standard.

15
00:00:54,516 --> 00:01:00,683
So you were using open-source, but still being locked to a single implementation.

16
00:01:00,683 --> 00:01:03,183
Java EE is based on standards,

17
00:01:03,183 --> 00:01:09,616
this means that Java EE goes through the standardization process of the JCP or

18
00:01:09,616 --> 00:01:15,016
Java Community Process and is described in a specification.

19
00:01:15,016 --> 00:01:19,016
Open standards are collectively one of the main strengths of Java EE.

20
00:01:19,016 --> 00:01:23,516
More than ever an application written with Java EE

21
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:28,016
will be portable across containers.

22
00:01:28,016 --> 00:01:29,834
But documents are not enough.

23
00:01:29,834 --> 00:01:34,587
Once the specification is final, several vendors are then to implement it.

24
00:01:34,587 --> 00:01:38,683
This is often called a Java EE application server.

25
00:01:38,683 --> 00:01:42,683
The reference implementation is called GlassFish,

26
00:01:42,683 --> 00:01:46,198
is open-source and pushed by Oracle.

27
00:01:46,198 --> 00:01:50,016
TomEE is the Apache foundation application server,

28
00:01:50,016 --> 00:01:54,216
is also open-source, such as Payara.

29
00:01:54,216 --> 00:01:58,516
Redhat has two implementations, JBoss application server,

30
00:01:58,516 --> 00:02:07,000
open-source and supported in production, and WildFly, which is the community edition.
