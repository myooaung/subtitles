1
00:00:01,488 --> 00:00:04,929
Let's go to the AWS web console and check out a few things.

2
00:00:04,929 --> 00:00:08,910
First, we'll take a look at the cluster and registry.

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:09,098
Next,

4
00:00:09,098 --> 00:00:11,291
we'll check out the monitoring offered through

5
00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:14,427
CloudWatch for your AWS resources.

6
00:00:14,427 --> 00:00:16,783
Finally, we'll visit the billing section.

7
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:20,461
To access your cluster, search for EKS.

8
00:00:20,461 --> 00:00:22,779
Here you can see your EKS clusters,

9
00:00:22,779 --> 00:00:26,608
then drill into each one to find out additional information.

10
00:00:26,608 --> 00:00:33,102
Note that the EKS managed node groups are not shown in the AWS console.

11
00:00:33,102 --> 00:00:36,707
To access the container registry, search for ECR.

12
00:00:36,707 --> 00:00:39,525
Here we can see our demo repository.

13
00:00:39,525 --> 00:00:44,669
If we drill in, we can see the 1.0 and the 2.0 images that we've pushed.

14
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:49,143
To view your underlying instances, search for EC2,

15
00:00:49,143 --> 00:00:51,607
select Running instances,

16
00:00:51,607 --> 00:00:55,657
and here you can see the instances running in the cluster.

17
00:00:55,657 --> 00:01:00,107
You can also see the Auto Scaling group that is managed by EKS.

18
00:01:00,107 --> 00:01:01,603
Next let's go to CloudWatch.

19
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:05,859
CloudWatch will automatically gather metrics on your underlying AWS

20
00:01:05,859 --> 00:01:08,931
infrastructure such as the elastic load balancers,

21
00:01:08,931 --> 00:01:12,933
EC2 instances, disk and network.

22
00:01:12,933 --> 00:01:16,418
There are several different options including third-party integrations.

23
00:01:16,418 --> 00:01:18,591
We won't cover those in this course.

24
00:01:18,591 --> 00:01:20,875
Next, let's check out the billing.

25
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:24,904
Here we can see the charges from the Elastic Kubernetes Service,

26
00:01:24,904 --> 00:01:27,593
then our underlying EC2 nodes.

27
00:01:27,593 --> 00:01:35,000
There are several options available for creating budgets and managing costs, but we won't get into those because this is a new account.
