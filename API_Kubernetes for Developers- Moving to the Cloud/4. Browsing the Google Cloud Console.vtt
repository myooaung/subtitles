1
00:00:01.638 --> 00:00:03.831
We're going to go to the web console for Google Cloud

2
00:00:03.831 --> 00:00:06.484
Platform and check out a few things.

3
00:00:06.484 --> 00:00:09.140
First, monitoring for our Kubernetes cluster.

4
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.004
Metrics are automatically fed into Stackdriver so you can view

5
00:00:13.004 --> 00:00:15.731
charts and graphs for your GKE resources.

6
00:00:15.731 --> 00:00:15.959
Next,

7
00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:19.098
we'll take a look at the cluster and registry so you can see

8
00:00:19.098 --> 00:00:21.402
what those look like in the web console.

9
00:00:21.402 --> 00:00:23.844
Finally, we'll visit the billing section.

10
00:00:23.844 --> 00:00:27.050
Here is the Google Cloud Platform web console.

11
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.808
You can customize it with various widgets.

12
00:00:30.808 --> 00:00:32.005
We're going to check out monitoring.

13
00:00:32.005 --> 00:00:35.773
Scroll down to Stackdriver, then Monitoring.

14
00:00:35.773 --> 00:00:37.861
The first time that you go to your metrics,

15
00:00:37.861 --> 00:00:41.814
it may take a minute while it initializes with your data.

16
00:00:41.814 --> 00:00:44.618
I've made sure to select the workspace for the project

17
00:00:44.618 --> 00:00:47.481
that my Kubernetes is running in.

18
00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:53.018
Under Resources, Kubernetes Engine, you can then access the Kubernetes metrics.

19
00:00:53.018 --> 00:00:57.181
Here you'll find typical metrics that you would expect like CPU usage,

20
00:00:57.181 --> 00:00:59.839
disk IO, network traffic.

21
00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:04.563
You can drill in to individual metrics, then see it broken down by instances.

22
00:01:04.563 --> 00:01:07.488
Here you can see where we scaled the nodes down to 1,

23
00:01:07.488 --> 00:01:10.492
and two of the nodes were removed.

24
00:01:10.492 --> 00:01:12.976
There's a slight delay for the metrics to show up so we don't

25
00:01:12.976 --> 00:01:15.741
see the cluster scaling back up to 3 just yet.

26
00:01:15.741 --> 00:01:18.613
To access information about your Kubernetes cluster,

27
00:01:18.613 --> 00:01:22.314
scroll down to Compute, Kubernetes Engine.

28
00:01:22.314 --> 00:01:27.056
If I select the demo cluster, I can see additional details about that cluster.

29
00:01:27.056 --> 00:01:30.049
Most things that can be done from the command line

30
00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:33.017
interface can also be done via the web console.

31
00:01:33.017 --> 00:01:35.870
For example, if you wanted to add a node pool,

32
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.075
here's what it would look like in the console.

33
00:01:39.075 --> 00:01:43.574
You could select various options to enable, select the node type.

34
00:01:43.574 --> 00:01:48.974
How much you use the web console will depend upon your operating environment.

35
00:01:48.974 --> 00:01:50.902
If you're troubleshooting a particular node or pod,

36
00:01:50.902 --> 00:01:55.855
you could also drill down to get information about those.

37
00:01:55.855 --> 00:01:57.832
To take a look at the container registry,

38
00:01:57.832 --> 00:02:01.117
you can simply search container, then select Container Registry.

39
00:02:01.117 --> 00:02:04.575
This repository was created as part of the project.

40
00:02:04.575 --> 00:02:09.594
When we drill into it, we can see the two different tags that we've pushed.

41
00:02:09.594 --> 00:02:13.181
To access billing, you can find it in the menu or simply search for billing.

42
00:02:13.181 --> 00:02:15.949
There are several different features that right now we

43
00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:18.055
really don't have much data to show,

44
00:02:18.055 --> 00:02:22.083
but you could see the granularity of how things are tracked and how most of our

45
00:02:22.083 --> 00:02:30.000
things have had a 0 cost at this point due to either being free or part of the credits that were given when we opened an account.
