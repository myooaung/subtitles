00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.556
Hi.

2
00:00:00.556 --> 00:00:08.202
This is Craig Golightly, and welcome to Deploying to Azure Kubernetes Service.

3
00:00:08.202 --> 00:00:11.300
Let's go through the demo application on Azure.

4
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.588
We're going to open an account and show all of the

5
00:00:13.588 --> 00:00:15.698
commands step by step for creating, updating,

6
00:00:15.698 --> 00:00:19.532
and scaling your app on Kubernetes so you can go back and

7
00:00:19.532 --> 00:00:21.737
follow along in your own Azure account.

8
00:00:21.737 --> 00:00:23.884
We'll check out the Azure portal,

9
00:00:23.884 --> 00:00:27.225
including the monitoring and billing information you can get there.

10
00:00:27.225 --> 00:00:27.470
Finally,

11
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.761
we'll go through how to delete your cluster so you don't have any

12
00:00:30.761 --> 00:00:34.500
leftover resources adding to your monthly bill.

13
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.591
To open and Azure account, go to azure.microsoft .com.

14
00:00:39.591 --> 00:00:42.296
You can sign up with a Microsoft, Skype, or GitHub account.

15
00:00:42.296 --> 00:00:43.367
If you don't have one,

16
00:00:43.367 --> 00:00:46.278
you can create a Microsoft account as part of the sign-up process,

17
00:00:46.278 --> 00:00:51.218
and you'll need a mobile phone number to receive a confirmation for that.

18
00:00:51.218 --> 00:00:53.501
You'll also need to provide your name and address,

19
00:00:53.501 --> 00:00:57.226
as well as credit card information to verify the account.

20
00:00:57.226 --> 00:01:02.533
Let's switch to a web browser and create an Azure account.

21
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:07.588
Go to azure.microsoft .com, then select Start free.

22
00:01:07.588 --> 00:01:09.089
If you already have one of the accounts,

23
00:01:09.089 --> 00:01:12.709
you can sign in; otherwise select Create one,

24
00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:14.543
and we'll go through creating an account.

25
00:01:14.543 --> 00:01:17.245
We'll take care of email and robot verification,

26
00:01:17.245 --> 00:01:22.393
then provide your name, email address, and phone number.

27
00:01:22.393 --> 00:01:26.549
Note that it cannot be a VoIP phone number.

28
00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.457
Enter the verification code once you receive that,

29
00:01:28.457 --> 00:01:31.574
then finally enter the credit card information,

30
00:01:31.574 --> 00:01:37.065
accept the terms, and you're ready to go.

31
00:01:37.065 --> 00:01:40.435
Now that you have an account created, let's initialize the tooling.

32
00:01:40.435 --> 00:01:43.737
First, you'll install the Azure CLI.

33
00:01:43.737 --> 00:01:44.817
In the exercise files,

34
00:01:44.817 --> 00:01:47.031
I've included a link to installation instructions

35
00:01:47.031 --> 00:01:48.780
for different operating systems.

36
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.867
Note that the Azure CLI requires Python 3,

37
00:01:51.867 --> 00:01:54.137
and if you're installing on a Linux machine,

38
00:01:54.137 --> 00:01:59.463
the install script needs to call gcc, so be sure those are available.

39
00:01:59.463 --> 00:01:59.725
Next,

40
00:01:59.725 --> 00:02:02.543
you'll register some namespaces that are needed to

41
00:02:02.543 --> 00:02:04.555
perform certain cluster actions.

42
00:02:04.555 --> 00:02:05.854
Finally, you'll create a resource group,

43
00:02:05.854 --> 00:02:08.744
which is used to organize and manage related

44
00:02:08.744 --> 00:02:10.933
resources for your Kubernetes cluster.

45
00:02:10.933 --> 00:02:14.445
Make sure you have a version of Python 3 installed.

46
00:02:14.445 --> 00:02:19.384
I'm on a Linux system so I'm going to install using the installation script.

47
00:02:19.384 --> 00:02:24.355
I'll accept the default configurations for where they want to put the files,

48
00:02:24.355 --> 00:02:26.397
and now the installation is successful.

49
00:02:26.397 --> 00:02:27.559
To double check,

50
00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:32.264
I can run az -v and that will give me the information about this

51
00:02:32.264 --> 00:02:37.229
version of the Azure CLI that's installed.

52
00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:39.206
After the Azure CLI is installed,

53
00:02:39.206 --> 00:02:42.778
you'll run the az login command to associate it with your account.

54
00:02:42.778 --> 00:02:43.155
Next,

55
00:02:43.155 --> 00:02:46.265
you'll want to register some namespaces that are needed to

56
00:02:46.265 --> 00:02:48.822
create and monitor your Kubernetes cluster.

57
00:02:48.822 --> 00:02:52.282
This is done with the az provider register command

58
00:02:52.282 --> 00:02:54.491
followed by the --namespace flag.

59
00:02:54.491 --> 00:02:55.609
At the time of recording,

60
00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:59.116
there are three required namespaces that are not

61
00:02:59.116 --> 00:03:01.921
configured automatically: Microsoft.Network,

62
00:03:01.921 --> 00:03:06.605
Microsoft.Compute, and Microsoft.OperationsManagement.

63
00:03:06.605 --> 00:03:09.218
Registering these first will save you from several error

64
00:03:09.218 --> 00:03:11.921
messages that will otherwise show up several minutes into

65
00:03:11.921 --> 00:03:14.308
the create cluster operation.

66
00:03:14.308 --> 00:03:17.310
To create a resource group, you'll need to decide on a location.

67
00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.332
To see the available locations, run az account list locations.

68
00:03:22.332 --> 00:03:27.654
In general, you'll choose a location that is geographically closest to you.

69
00:03:27.654 --> 00:03:31.236
The command to create a resource group is az group create.

70
00:03:31.236 --> 00:03:35.493
You'll need to specify a name for the resource group and a location.

71
00:03:35.493 --> 00:03:43.221
In this example, the resource group name is kube-demo and the location is westus.

72
00:03:43.221 --> 00:03:44.493
When you run az login,

73
00:03:44.493 --> 00:03:49.878
you'll need to go to a browser to finish the authentication process.

74
00:03:49.878 --> 00:03:53.715
Copy the code shown, then enter it when prompted on the web page.

75
00:03:53.715 --> 00:03:57.704
You'll be asked to select your account, then when you go back,

76
00:03:57.704 --> 00:04:00.247
it should show that you have completed the login.

77
00:04:00.247 --> 00:04:02.504
Next, we'll do the namespace assignments.

78
00:04:02.504 --> 00:04:06.029
This is to avoid errors like this showing up several

79
00:04:06.029 --> 00:04:09.238
minutes into the create cluster process.

80
00:04:09.238 --> 00:04:12.750
We'll do Microsoft.Network and Microsoft.Compute.

81
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:20.000
With that information in place, I can now create the group. I'll call it kube-demo and have it in the westus location.
