00:00:01.605 --> 00:00:03.931
If you're finished with a cluster and want to clean things up so

2
00:00:03.931 --> 00:00:06.116
you aren't getting charged for idle resources,

3
00:00:06.116 --> 00:00:11.282
you'll first delete the service you created using kubectl delete service,

4
00:00:11.282 --> 00:00:12.742
then the name of the service.

5
00:00:12.742 --> 00:00:17.757
Next, you'll delete your cluster with gcloud container clusters delete,

6
00:00:17.757 --> 00:00:18.871
then the name of the cluster.

7
00:00:18.871 --> 00:00:21.300
If you're no longer using the images you pushed to the registry,

8
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.526
you'll want to delete those as well using the gcloud

9
00:00:24.526 --> 00:00:26.831
container images delete command.

10
00:00:26.831 --> 00:00:27.957
In our example,

11
00:00:27.957 --> 00:00:32.267
we pushed two images: 1.0 and 2.0 so we would delete both of those

12
00:00:32.267 --> 00:00:35.373
by passing in the full image name to the command.

13
00:00:35.373 --> 00:00:36.834
When you're ready to clean up,

14
00:00:36.834 --> 00:00:39.762
you'll need to delete the load balancer service first.

15
00:00:39.762 --> 00:00:43.683
Run kubectl get services to verify the service name,

16
00:00:43.683 --> 00:00:47.757
then kubectl delete service, and the name of the service.

17
00:00:47.757 --> 00:00:52.431
We can list the services again and verify that the load balancer was removed.

18
00:00:52.431 --> 00:00:52.748
Next,

19
00:00:52.748 --> 00:00:57.677
we can list the container clusters and see the demo cluster that we created.

20
00:00:57.677 --> 00:01:01.572
Write in gcloud container clusters delete and the name of the cluster,

21
00:01:01.572 --> 00:01:03.856
and then it will go through and delete this cluster.

22
00:01:03.856 --> 00:01:08.768
If we go back to the dashboard, notice that there are no clusters or node pools.

23
00:01:08.768 --> 00:01:11.738
The last thing that we'll clean up since we're not going to use

24
00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:14.065
them any more are the images that we pushed.

25
00:01:14.065 --> 00:01:20.097
Run gcloud container images delete for the 1.0 and the 2.0 image.

26
00:01:20.097 --> 00:01:26.630
A look at the cloud console verifies that we've deleted the images.

27
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.967
Congratulations!

28
00:01:26.967 --> 00:01:32.548
You can now use the Google Kubernetes Engine Managed Kubernetes service.

29
00:01:32.548 --> 00:01:35.593
You've gone through an entire application lifecycle: creating,

30
00:01:35.593 --> 00:01:37.696
scaling, updating, and deleting.

31
00:01:37.696 --> 00:01:40.375
Now you can try it out with your own app.

32
00:01:40.375 --> 00:01:42.896
If you haven't seen the modules on Azure and AWS,

33
00:01:42.896 --> 00:01:46.991
check those out so you can decide for yourself which cloud

34
00:01:46.991 --> 00:01:53.000
Kubernetes service makes the most sense for you. I hope you've found this valuable, and thank you for watching!
