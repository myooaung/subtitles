00:00:01.583 --> 00:00:05.367
AWS also offers a serverless option for your Kubernetes

2
00:00:05.367 --> 00:00:09.319
pods by using the AWS Fargate service.

3
00:00:09.319 --> 00:00:12.569
Instead of a node pool of EC2 nodes that you have to manage and maintain,

4
00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:16.703
your node pool is composed of Fargate resources that are

5
00:00:16.703 --> 00:00:19.563
automatically provisioned and will automatically scale.

6
00:00:19.563 --> 00:00:22.901
There are some pod limitations for what can run on Fargate

7
00:00:22.901 --> 00:00:26.043
so be sure to check the documentation for the latest

8
00:00:26.043 --> 00:00:28.782
information about this offering.

9
00:00:28.782 --> 00:00:31.012
We're going to go ahead and create a cluster using a

10
00:00:31.012 --> 00:00:34.358
Fargate node pool and show you how to deploy and scale the

11
00:00:34.358 --> 00:00:37.858
demo application on that cluster.

12
00:00:37.858 --> 00:00:38.915
When you create the cluster,

13
00:00:38.915 --> 00:00:42.875
you'll use the eksctl create cluster command the same as before,

14
00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:46.558
but you will add the --fargate flag.

15
00:00:46.558 --> 00:00:52.428
Notice also how it creates a Fargate profile for your cluster.

16
00:00:52.428 --> 00:00:53.785
When you run kubectl get nodes,

17
00:00:53.785 --> 00:00:57.439
you'll see the Fargate resources that have been allocated to

18
00:00:57.439 --> 00:01:00.513
run Kube Master in your infrastructure.

19
00:01:00.513 --> 00:01:02.891
At this point we have not deployed the demo app yet.

20
00:01:02.891 --> 00:01:07.725
You'll deploy the same as you did before with kubectl create deployment,

21
00:01:07.725 --> 00:01:11.156
and we can see the pod running.

22
00:01:11.156 --> 00:01:14.993
You'll also use the same kubectl scale deployment to change the number of pods.

23
00:01:14.993 --> 00:01:19.489
Let's scale it up to 3, and now we have 3 pods running.

24
00:01:19.489 --> 00:01:25.099
Notice how each pod is running on its own Fargate resource.

25
00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:28.588
We can look at the pods and the nodes and note that we have

26
00:01:28.588 --> 00:01:36.000
three Fargate resources for our three pods, then another two Fargate resources for the underlying infrastructure.
