00:00:01.403 --> 00:00:04.405
Let's go to the Azure portal and check out a few things.

2
00:00:04.405 --> 00:00:07.221
First, monitoring for your Kubernetes cluster.

3
00:00:07.221 --> 00:00:07.444
Next,

4
00:00:07.444 --> 00:00:10.376
we'll take a look at the cluster and registry so you can

5
00:00:10.376 --> 00:00:13.733
see what those look like in the portal.

6
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:16.064
Finally, we'll visit the billing section.

7
00:00:16.064 --> 00:00:18.934
Here is the Azure portal.

8
00:00:18.934 --> 00:00:22.802
To get information about your cluster, select Kubernetes services.

9
00:00:22.802 --> 00:00:26.095
We can see the demo cluster here and select it.

10
00:00:26.095 --> 00:00:28.257
Let's check out what's being monitored.

11
00:00:28.257 --> 00:00:31.609
Several metrics are gathered and displayed at various levels.

12
00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:35.947
Here is some information at the cluster level such as node CPU utilization,

13
00:00:35.947 --> 00:00:38.466
node count, and active pod count.

14
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:41.635
You can see information about your nodes such as containers

15
00:00:41.635 --> 00:00:44.332
running on each node and resources used.

16
00:00:44.332 --> 00:00:48.234
You can also see information about individual containers.

17
00:00:48.234 --> 00:00:53.293
There are also several preconfigured workbooks for things like disk capacity,

18
00:00:53.293 --> 00:00:55.469
disk IO, and network.

19
00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.471
Under Metrics,

20
00:00:56.471 --> 00:01:00.706
you can various metrics and have them plotted on the

21
00:01:00.706 --> 00:01:02.091
graph with various configurations.

22
00:01:02.091 --> 00:01:07.049
You can perform most actions via the CLI or in the portal.

23
00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.519
It really just depends on your requirements and your preference.

24
00:01:11.519 --> 00:01:15.391
For example, I could go to Node pools and adjust the number of nodes in the pool,

25
00:01:15.391 --> 00:01:19.310
or I could add a new node pool altogether.

26
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.197
Let's take a look at the container registry.

27
00:01:22.197 --> 00:01:25.048
You can access it from the hamburger menu or just do a search.

28
00:01:25.048 --> 00:01:28.566
Here's the container registry that we created in the example.

29
00:01:28.566 --> 00:01:31.718
If I drill into it and select Repositories,

30
00:01:31.718 --> 00:01:34.311
we can see the examples/demo repository,

31
00:01:34.311 --> 00:01:36.745
then the two different images that we've tagged,

32
00:01:36.745 --> 00:01:38.584
1.0 and 2.0.

33
00:01:38.584 --> 00:01:43.487
You can drill into each image to get additional information.

34
00:01:43.487 --> 00:01:44.787
Finally, let's check out billing.

35
00:01:44.787 --> 00:01:47.816
Since this is a new account running free services,

36
00:01:47.816 --> 00:01:49.630
there really isn't much here yet,

37
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.000
but you can see there are many different options to manage and track your costs over time.
