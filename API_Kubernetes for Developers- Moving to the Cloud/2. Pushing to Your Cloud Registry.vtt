00:00:01.652 --> 00:00:02.914
To create a registry,

2
00:00:02.914 --> 00:00:08.207
you'll need to run the az acr create command with four parameters.

3
00:00:08.207 --> 00:00:10.694
Resource group is the name of the resource group you just

4
00:00:10.694 --> 00:00:13.503
created and where this registry will be placed.

5
00:00:13.503 --> 00:00:16.713
Location is the location you chose for your resource group,

6
00:00:16.713 --> 00:00:20.171
name is the name you want for your registry.

7
00:00:20.171 --> 00:00:23.047
Note that it needs to be globally unique so don't be

8
00:00:23.047 --> 00:00:25.522
surprised if you have to try a few times.

9
00:00:25.522 --> 00:00:30.081
SKU or Sku is tied to the level of features you want for

10
00:00:30.081 --> 00:00:31.727
the registry and the associated cost.

11
00:00:31.727 --> 00:00:33.063
In the exercise files,

12
00:00:33.063 --> 00:00:37.395
I've included a link to documentation that outlines the different options.

13
00:00:37.395 --> 00:00:40.340
For this demo, the basic level is fine.

14
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.611
When you put it all together, it would look something like this.

15
00:00:43.611 --> 00:00:46.092
Note that several commands have a shorthand version of

16
00:00:46.092 --> 00:00:48.178
the flag to save you some typing.

17
00:00:48.178 --> 00:00:52.654
Az acr create -g, name of the resource group,

18
00:00:52.654 --> 00:00:59.211
-l, name of location, -n, name for the registry,

19
00:00:59.211 --> 00:01:00.501
--sku, Basic.

20
00:01:00.501 --> 00:01:03.096
When you run the az acr create command,

21
00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:05.509
you'll see in the output that it succeeded.

22
00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:08.690
Your Azure container registry is now created.

23
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.799
If the name you chose isn't unique, you'll see a message like this.

24
00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.075
In order to push an image to the Azure container registry,

25
00:01:16.075 --> 00:01:18.668
it must follow a certain format.

26
00:01:18.668 --> 00:01:21.998
Registry-name is the name of the registry you created

27
00:01:21.998 --> 00:01:24.745
where you want to manage the image.

28
00:01:24.745 --> 00:01:27.480
The host azurecr.io is constant.

29
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.566
Namespace is optional; you can use multiple strings with

30
00:01:31.566 --> 00:01:34.240
slash delimiters to organize your registry,

31
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.441
kind of like a file system.

32
00:01:36.441 --> 00:01:39.356
Image name and tag are whatever you want them to be for your image.

33
00:01:39.356 --> 00:01:51.019
For example, docker build -t demoregistry.azurecr .io /examples/demo: 1.0.

34
00:01:51.019 --> 00:01:54.306
indicating that the Docker file to build is in the current directory.

35
00:01:54.306 --> 00:01:57.472
You can also use the docker tag command on an existing

36
00:01:57.472 --> 00:02:00.194
image following the same format.

37
00:02:00.194 --> 00:02:04.944
For example, docker tag, image id, registry name,

38
00:02:04.944 --> 00:02:09.466
.azurecr .io /, namespace, / image name,

39
00:02:09.466 --> 00:02:10.275
: tag.

40
00:02:10.275 --> 00:02:13.016
Before you run a Docker push for the first time,

41
00:02:13.016 --> 00:02:16.946
you will need to run az acr login --name,

42
00:02:16.946 --> 00:02:19.464
then the name of the registry.

43
00:02:19.464 --> 00:02:22.955
Once you're logged in, you can simply push the image.

44
00:02:22.955 --> 00:02:32.921
For example, docker push, demoregistry.azurecr .io / examples.demo : 1.0.

45
00:02:32.921 --> 00:02:34.614
I'll make sure I'm in the directory with the demo files

46
00:02:34.614 --> 00:02:37.363
and the Docker file to build this app.

47
00:02:37.363 --> 00:02:43.930
I'll run a Docker build, and now I can see the new image with the 1.0 tag.

48
00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.007
Let's test it out just to make sure everything looks good.

49
00:02:48.007 --> 00:02:49.238
When I hit the address of this machine,

50
00:02:49.238 --> 00:02:52.618
I see the message and the counter incrementing.

51
00:02:52.618 --> 00:02:54.562
Next, I'll log into my registry.

52
00:02:54.562 --> 00:03:04.000
You can manage your Docker credentials however you need to on your system. Next, I'll push the image up to my Azure container registry.
