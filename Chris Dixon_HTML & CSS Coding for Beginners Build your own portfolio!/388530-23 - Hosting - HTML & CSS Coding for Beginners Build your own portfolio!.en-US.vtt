00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
Once you've finished perfecting your portfolio,

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.095
I'm sure you'll be eager to get it online for the rest of the world to see.

00:00:07.095 --> 00:00:13.120
Unfortunately, there is a really fast and easy surveys to do this called Netlify.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.855
You can go over to netlify.com where you will need to sign up and create an account.

00:00:18.855 --> 00:00:20.700
I'm already signed up with these,

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.335
but if you don't have an account,

00:00:22.335 --> 00:00:24.630
go ahead and create one now.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.225
You can sign up with various providers,

00:00:27.225 --> 00:00:31.620
such as your email and password or a service such as GitHub.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.685
You may also need to verify the e-mail.

00:00:34.685 --> 00:00:36.230
I've already done this,

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.810
and I had barcodes in Netlify and cancel any quickstarts which may appear.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.450
Once you've done this, you'll be taken to a page which looks like this,

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.980
and all we need to do is to drag over project folder.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.080
If you do have your project stored on GitHub,

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.790
you can also use this too.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:59.295
What you want to do is drag over the portfolio projects into this upload section here.

00:00:59.295 --> 00:01:01.110
After a short period of time,

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.605
we then get a test link which we can use,

00:01:03.605 --> 00:01:05.560
which we can see just here.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.750
This will generate a URL which you can click on or

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.540
copy and then paste in the browser to view.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.830
This will then give us a chance to test

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.205
our sites and see how it looks on a live web server.

00:01:21.205 --> 00:01:24.650
Unfortunately, ours seems to look exactly the same.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.435
We can also test the projects page.

00:01:27.435 --> 00:01:30.060
Check there is no errors on here too,

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.605
scroll down and everything is looking okay on this page too.

00:01:35.605 --> 00:01:41.105
We can also make a custom domain which is any path before the netlify.com.

00:01:41.105 --> 00:01:43.574
Back over to the dashboard,

00:01:43.574 --> 00:01:46.095
click on the "Domain Settings",

00:01:46.095 --> 00:01:48.150
then onto the "Options",

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.630
you can also edit the site name.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.860
This one is being randomly generated and you can change

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.060
this to be something more memorable if you prefer.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.360
Hit "Save", and then this will take effect.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.600
This will still have the netlify.com on the ends.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.155
However, though, if you do have a domain name which you want to use,

00:02:06.155 --> 00:02:10.070
if almost you already own or one you can purchase through Netlify.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.745
There is also a quick guide for doing this too,

00:02:12.745 --> 00:02:15.790
and you can click on this link to find out more.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.985
For now, this is how quick and easy is to get started with Netlify,

00:02:19.985 --> 00:02:23.900
and push your site to a live web server leaving you

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.680
with a fully live URL which you can now share with the rest of the world.
