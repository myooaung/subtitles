00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.620
We've used both margin and padding in our project so

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.165
far to apply space in it to our elements.

00:00:07.165 --> 00:00:11.550
If you are still not comfortable with what each one of these does exactly,

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.715
we're now going to take a closer look in this video,

00:00:14.715 --> 00:00:18.780
along with also discovering the CSS box model.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.995
If we just started to div or sections to

00:00:21.995 --> 00:00:26.750
a web page and some text inside using the P element,

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.800
we would end up with something which looked like this.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.220
This is obviously not great look at.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.615
One of the first things we may do is to add some spacing.

00:00:36.615 --> 00:00:40.965
We may want some spacing inside of the sections like this,

00:00:40.965 --> 00:00:45.445
so it's not as close to the edges and looks a little more readable.

00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:47.400
Remember, we said earlier,

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.865
the padding add spacing inside of an element.

00:00:50.865 --> 00:00:55.105
This is what we see here highlighted by the green section.

00:00:55.105 --> 00:00:58.965
This is the effect of the padding rule in CSS.

00:00:58.965 --> 00:01:03.270
It will default to adding the padding around all four sides.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.300
We also have access to padding at the top,

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.670
right, bottom and left, too.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.330
If we only wanted the spacing on certain sides,

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.960
well, what if we also wanted a space between the sections?

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.960
As we have just looked at,

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.235
padding only applies to inside of the element.

00:01:22.235 --> 00:01:25.085
Instead, we apply margin.

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:31.150
Margin add space in it to the outside of an element as we see with the orange section.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.445
Just like padding, the margin rule will apply to

00:01:34.445 --> 00:01:38.225
all four sides unless we tell it otherwise.

00:01:38.225 --> 00:01:42.820
This example, the first section would need to have a margin bottom

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.185
applied or we could also add margin top to the second element,

00:01:47.185 --> 00:01:49.475
which will do the same thing.

00:01:49.475 --> 00:01:55.420
Adding spacing like this does have an effect on the overall size of the element though.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.000
This is called the CSS box model.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.740
If we set the size of an element in the CSS,

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.620
such as 300 pixels, for example.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.740
This is generally the size we wanted to display in the browser.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.380
Let's say we added 10 pixels of padding around the elements.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.985
As we know, nothing is added to the inside of the element.

00:02:18.985 --> 00:02:22.015
This will add to the overall size,

00:02:22.015 --> 00:02:27.445
resulting in the width increase in it to be 320 pixels.

00:02:27.445 --> 00:02:31.465
As in a border in CSS will also have the same effect.

00:02:31.465 --> 00:02:36.110
If we add a one-pixel border all around just like this,

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.150
this will add an extra one pixel onto each side

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.980
increasing the overall width to be 322 pixels,

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.625
meaning we need to be careful when sizing elements to allow for this.

00:02:49.625 --> 00:02:53.770
However, since margin is added to the outside of an element,

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.530
this is not accounted for in the overall size.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.635
If we want to account for the padding and border increasing the element size,

00:03:02.635 --> 00:03:04.744
we have two approaches.

00:03:04.744 --> 00:03:08.885
We could either reduce the initial width of our content.

00:03:08.885 --> 00:03:14.330
Here, we could remove the extra 22 pixels and set the width to be

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.790
initially 270 pixels to account for this or instead,

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.760
we could get the browser to calculate it for us.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.480
This means whatever we set our padding and border sizes to,

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.075
the browser will always display our elements at 300 pixels.

00:03:31.075 --> 00:03:37.460
We can do this by setting the CSS box-sizing rule to be equal to border box.

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.580
This is something we can add it to our CSS if we are

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.790
having problems setting the size of an element.
