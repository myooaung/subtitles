00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:06.960
Hello. I would encourage you to keep learning about creating your own custom animations.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.410
Another great option to use is a pre-built library.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.480
In particular, the one I'm going to show you is called Animate on scroll.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.380
This library is going to allow us to add animations

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.535
to our elements as the user scrolls down our page.

00:00:23.535 --> 00:00:27.900
We can set different animations for different parts for our content.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.894
For example, we can set a flip effect on our top piece of content,

00:00:32.894 --> 00:00:35.520
which is like turning over cars.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.640
We also have many other effects too,

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.965
such as the content zooming in,

00:00:40.965 --> 00:00:44.810
we can have the content fading in or sliding in from off

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:49.285
the page from either the right or the left hand side.

00:00:49.285 --> 00:00:52.460
We also have further control options,

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.634
such as setting the delay,

00:00:54.634 --> 00:00:59.405
the time duration and we can also combine these effects too.

00:00:59.405 --> 00:01:03.895
Let's take a look at how we could apply this to our project.

00:01:03.895 --> 00:01:05.840
To include this library,

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.450
I'm going to search for animate on scroll.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.940
Now we need to go over to the GitHub link.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.635
This is the one we need, just here at the top, so click on this.

00:01:18.635 --> 00:01:21.020
Then as we scroll down the page,

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.600
we can see lots of different examples,

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.015
which is included with the library.

00:01:26.015 --> 00:01:28.100
We have some slide in effect,

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.315
we have fade in and if we [inaudible] go we can see more flip animations,

00:01:33.315 --> 00:01:36.340
where you can flip up down, left and right.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.799
We then have some zoom effects,

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.315
where we zoom in from different angles

00:01:41.315 --> 00:01:44.980
and we can also set the duration and the timing too,

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.840
make some really nice-looking effects on our page.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.565
To get started with this library,

00:01:50.565 --> 00:01:54.880
all we need to do is to include the CDN link down at the bottom.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.610
If you use things such as a node project,

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.125
this can also be included,

00:01:59.125 --> 00:02:03.020
with package managers such as yarn, bower or NPM.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.025
Since we are using a regular HTML project,

00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:09.425
we have the CSS and JavaScript links at the bottom,

00:02:09.425 --> 00:02:12.005
which we'll link to the required files.

00:02:12.005 --> 00:02:14.630
Let's start with the style sheets.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.450
I'm going to copy this link and then we can

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.325
include this in the head section of our index page.

00:02:20.325 --> 00:02:24.050
At list just above the link for our custom style sheets.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.055
Making sure our custom styles is the last one in the order.

00:02:28.055 --> 00:02:31.520
Next up we can grab the link to the JavaScript and this

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.345
can also go in our index page. Copy this link.

00:02:35.345 --> 00:02:40.820
I'm looking at this at the bottom of the body section just after our contacts.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.800
The final thing we need to do is to call the initialized script.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.960
So let's copy this. The page's just below.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.020
This will initialize the library to use in our project.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.700
This is all we need to do now for the setup,

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.740
we can start to use the effects,

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.905
simply by adding some attributes to our elements.

00:03:00.905 --> 00:03:06.220
All of these attribute names are the ones we see on the website which we just looked at.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.810
If we scroll up, we see the attributes such as fade

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.610
up and this is exactly what we do in our project.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.925
Let's begin at the very top of our home page.

00:03:16.925 --> 00:03:21.620
We already have some custom animations in the header section,

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.005
which were added in the last video.

00:03:24.005 --> 00:03:27.380
So I'm going to skip down to the parallax section,

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.160
where we can add some effects to these items here.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.599
By this am going to make use of the flip animation to these list items,

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.785
so that we have a flip in effect when we scroll down the page.

00:03:38.785 --> 00:03:43.475
Let's go over to our index and locate the parallax section.

00:03:43.475 --> 00:03:46.600
Inside here, for each one of our list items,

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.555
we can begin to add these attributes.

00:03:49.555 --> 00:03:52.520
The first one is data-aos.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.515
This is going to link to the name of the animation we want to use.

00:03:57.515 --> 00:03:59.850
I'm going to use flip up.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.870
As we've just seen on the homepage,

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.815
we can also set the delay and also the duration,

00:04:05.815 --> 00:04:08.690
which is the timescale for the animation.

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.220
So let's start with the delay which is data-aos-delay.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:19.510
We set this in milliseconds for how long it takes for the animation to begin.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.310
Once the page has loaded,

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:22.760
for the very first one,

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.815
I'm not going to include the delay,

00:04:24.815 --> 00:04:28.390
what will increase is for all of the rest of the links.

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.665
Next up the data duration,

00:04:31.665 --> 00:04:35.340
which is data aos duration and again,

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.170
this is in milliseconds,

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.725
with a value of 1000 beam one second.

00:04:40.725 --> 00:04:44.520
I'm going to set this equal to 800 milliseconds.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.139
This is how long the animation will take to complete,

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:52.860
copy this and paste this in the rest of the list items.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.259
We're also going to use the flip of animation for all the rest of the items,

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:03.355
but increasing the delay for each one.

00:05:03.355 --> 00:05:10.275
So 100, 200, 300 and then 400.

00:05:10.275 --> 00:05:13.880
The duration can take the same and you can also play around

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.270
this value and see which one works best for your site.

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.700
Save this and let's refresh the browser.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:29.280
Scroll down. We now have a nice flip in effect as we scroll down the page.

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.995
Now let's go down to our recent work section,

00:05:33.995 --> 00:05:37.355
where we're going to add some sliding animations.

00:05:37.355 --> 00:05:43.940
We're going to begin with the two project titles of pizza planets and also react trello.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.090
These titles are going to begin off the page and

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:50.575
then scroll into view as we move over this section.

00:05:50.575 --> 00:05:53.630
These added inside of our level four headings.

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.430
So let's locate the first one,

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.035
which is pizza planet,

00:05:57.035 --> 00:05:59.840
the name of data aos,

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.665
and this is going to be the animation called slide left.

00:06:03.665 --> 00:06:05.990
We can also add a duration,

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:11.740
just like we used above and set this field 1,000,

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.340
which is a second.

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.940
I'm going to grab this and move this down to the second title,

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:21.980
which is react trello paste this in and since it is on the opposite side,

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.065
we're going to slide right,

00:06:24.065 --> 00:06:27.175
keeping the same duration as before,

00:06:27.175 --> 00:06:30.495
save this and let's test this in the browser.

00:06:30.495 --> 00:06:39.165
Reload, scroll down, as our title slide it in and the same for the second one.

00:06:39.165 --> 00:06:41.705
Remember, this is your project and you can use

00:06:41.705 --> 00:06:45.260
any animations and timings which suits you best.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:49.075
But next I'm going to fade in the information just below.

00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:51.215
The section is just here.

00:06:51.215 --> 00:06:53.150
I'm going to fade these in.

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.285
To do this, I'm going to wrap all of the text into a div,

00:06:56.285 --> 00:06:58.340
which is going to act as a wrapper

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.650
and then am going to add the animation to this wrapper.

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:07.265
So we can grab everything from our visit site link all the way to just below our title,

00:07:07.265 --> 00:07:09.410
so cut this out, leaving a place,

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:11.075
our level for heading.

00:07:11.075 --> 00:07:12.770
We can then add a div,

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.695
which is going to be a wrapper,

00:07:14.695 --> 00:07:20.270
paste in all of this content and then we can add our animation to this wrapper,

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:22.865
the name of data aos.

00:07:22.865 --> 00:07:28.985
This is going to be fade in and the duration of one second.

00:07:28.985 --> 00:07:32.585
Let's also grab these two attributes and we can work

00:07:32.585 --> 00:07:35.995
with the project image, so just below.

00:07:35.995 --> 00:07:38.955
We also have this recent work image.

00:07:38.955 --> 00:07:42.090
Just after our class, paste this in,

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:49.560
I'm also going to keep the same fade in animation or increase the duration to be 1500.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:56.180
Reload the browser. We've accidentally

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:58.475
added this to the second one rather than the first one,

00:07:58.475 --> 00:08:02.930
but this is completely fine since we're going to duplicate this for both projects.

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:06.550
Let's do the same now for the first project.

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:08.345
We can cut out a place,

00:08:08.345 --> 00:08:11.015
all of the texts from visited sites,

00:08:11.015 --> 00:08:14.575
all the way up to just below our title,

00:08:14.575 --> 00:08:17.340
add a div as a wrapper,

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:20.085
paste the content back inside,

00:08:20.085 --> 00:08:23.050
then we can add our animation,

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:25.740
which was fade in,

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:32.475
the duration of 1000.

00:08:32.475 --> 00:08:37.705
Copy these attributes and then we can also add these to the image just below.

00:08:37.705 --> 00:08:39.875
The div which surrounds this,

00:08:39.875 --> 00:08:43.865
paste this in and keep this consistent with the other image,

00:08:43.865 --> 00:08:46.850
will increase this to 1500, it's a match.

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:48.605
Let's now test this.

00:08:48.605 --> 00:08:51.310
Scroll up to the top and refresh,

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:54.150
down to the project section.

00:08:54.150 --> 00:09:00.025
You see the slide in for the title and also the image on the text is now fading in.

00:09:00.025 --> 00:09:04.100
Finally down at the bottom, we also have the contact section,

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:06.775
where we can add some animations here too.

00:09:06.775 --> 00:09:09.835
I'm going to slide up the main heading of,

00:09:09.835 --> 00:09:12.470
don't be a stranger and then slide in

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:16.315
the two lines of text below over from the right of the screen.

00:09:16.315 --> 00:09:22.580
Over in the HTML, we can go down to the contact section and start with the heading.

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:26.490
The name this time is going to be slide up,

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:31.590
the duration, I'm going to set mine to be 1500.

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:33.375
Let's see how this looks.

00:09:33.375 --> 00:09:37.440
Reload the browser, then this now slides up.

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.740
We just need to work with our two lines of text

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:43.420
below and bring these in from over on the right-hand side.

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:46.950
We're also going to add a delay to this two animations,

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:49.425
given the head in at the chance to get to the top,

00:09:49.425 --> 00:09:51.615
if all these move across.

00:09:51.615 --> 00:09:55.365
Let's start with the text just below.

00:09:55.365 --> 00:10:00.730
Paste this in and the animation name is going to be slide left.

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:03.405
This one also needs a delay.

00:10:03.405 --> 00:10:08.580
This is data aos delay and 1000 milliseconds,

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:12.995
the duration we also going to increase this to be 150 too,

00:10:12.995 --> 00:10:17.390
and then grab this and we can add this for the last line too.

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:20.555
Paste this in as an attribute.

00:10:20.555 --> 00:10:23.875
We can increase the delay to be 200 milliseconds,

00:10:23.875 --> 00:10:27.355
keeping the same duration and animation name.

00:10:27.355 --> 00:10:30.665
Go to the browser and reload,

00:10:30.665 --> 00:10:34.290
leaving us with some nice animation effects.

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:38.755
There is one thing though to take care of before I wrap this video up.

00:10:38.755 --> 00:10:42.445
One of the things you will notice since adding in this animation,

00:10:42.445 --> 00:10:46.295
is we can now scroll to the right of the page when it first loads.

00:10:46.295 --> 00:10:49.870
This is because our animations, which slide in,

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:54.375
will start off the edge of the page and then slide into our view.

00:10:54.375 --> 00:10:56.890
Since the content started off the page,

00:10:56.890 --> 00:11:01.285
the browser now things that the page is much wider than it's intended to be.

00:11:01.285 --> 00:11:03.560
All we need to do to fix this is to tell

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:08.110
the browser to hide any content which overflows the page.

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:10.800
We can do this by adding a overflow on

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:16.500
the x-axis and we are going to do this in the body section of our style sheets.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:20.630
Let's scroll up to our global styles.

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:25.340
We can declare how we want to handle any overflow on the x-axis,

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:28.205
which is from the left to the right of the page.

00:11:28.205 --> 00:11:31.920
Change this to a value of hidden. Let's save this.

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:36.860
Now if we go back to the browser and scroll back onto the main content section,

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:43.230
hit reload and now this overflow property is stopping us from scrolling off the page.

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:48.470
We'll also add more of these animations as we progress through the course.

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:54.610
But feel free to swap out any of these animations with different ones to suit your style.

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:57.660
This is now our homepage complete,

00:11:57.660 --> 00:11:59.615
and in the upcoming videos,

00:11:59.615 --> 00:12:05.520
we'll begin to focus on our portfolio page to show off all of our skills.
