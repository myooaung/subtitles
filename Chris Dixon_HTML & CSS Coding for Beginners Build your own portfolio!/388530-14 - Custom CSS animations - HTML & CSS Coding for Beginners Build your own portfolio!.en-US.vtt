00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.330
We now going to take a look at how we can add CSS animations to our project.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.730
An animation is a way of changing CSS styles over a period of time.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.380
For example, over let's say two seconds,

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.665
we maybe want to fade an element in or we could change from

00:00:20.665 --> 00:00:25.529
one background color to another of a set duration.

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.020
We can also use this to apply any different CSS styling which we'll want to.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.500
I'm going to take a look at how we can include these now.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.785
Animations can really bring your project alive.

00:00:37.785 --> 00:00:41.105
I'm now going to use them in the header section.

00:00:41.105 --> 00:00:43.130
First by fading in the text of,

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.695
hi, I am Chris.

00:00:44.695 --> 00:00:46.760
Then after a short delay,

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.225
we're also going to fade in the text just below two,

00:00:50.225 --> 00:00:53.680
giving the user a smooth welcome message.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:00.080
This particular video we'll cover adding in our own custom animations using CSS.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.585
Then the next one we will look at how to use

00:01:02.585 --> 00:01:07.395
a animation library to add lots of nice effects when scrolling.

00:01:07.395 --> 00:01:10.650
To setup our own custom animations,

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.435
we need to setup what CSS we want to change using the key frames rule.

00:01:16.435 --> 00:01:20.480
The key frames rule is setup in the CSS file,

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.420
a bit like the media queries we looked up before.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.290
We can see an example on the right,

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.190
it uses the @ symbol just before followed by the name of our choice.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.230
Then inside of our curly braces,

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:39.304
we add in any CSS style name we want to apply at certain stages of the animation.

00:01:39.304 --> 00:01:42.380
At the most basic we have to and from,

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.860
which is the start and end state of the animation.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.400
Here, we change the background color.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.055
Then on the left we select an element to apply this to,

00:01:52.055 --> 00:01:58.880
link in our custom key frames name of change-bg to a property called animation name.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.690
If we want more control over the animation stages,

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:08.455
we can also apply different CSS at different percentages of the animation.

00:02:08.455 --> 00:02:11.525
We can apply any CSS which we want,

00:02:11.525 --> 00:02:13.235
not just the background color,

00:02:13.235 --> 00:02:15.800
which can apply at any stage.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.450
Over in our HTML,

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.945
we're going to add a custom class to allow us to do this.

00:02:20.945 --> 00:02:25.575
Over to our index page up to the header section.

00:02:25.575 --> 00:02:29.420
We're going to effect these two lines of text inside of our header.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.145
Let's add our class to these two elements here.

00:02:33.145 --> 00:02:36.990
The class name is going to be fade in custom.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.650
I'm actually going to apply it to our texts just below too.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.100
Over in our style sheets,

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.860
we can ask our key frames and this is going to

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.295
be right at the very bottom after our media query.

00:02:52.295 --> 00:02:54.805
We use the @ symbol,

00:02:54.805 --> 00:03:00.450
lets have our key frames by giving this a name of fade in.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.585
Then keep this simple by adding our from and our to rules inside of here.

00:03:06.585 --> 00:03:12.515
First of all, we're going to set the opacity to begin at zero.

00:03:12.515 --> 00:03:14.720
This is fully transparent,

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.215
meaning we can't see it on the page.

00:03:17.215 --> 00:03:23.360
We can then set the to rule where we're going to set the opacity to be one.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.060
Meaning this is now fully opaque and not transparent at all.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.615
Now we have our key frames setup.

00:03:30.615 --> 00:03:35.435
We can add this to our fade in custom class just above these key frames.

00:03:35.435 --> 00:03:40.020
Fade in custom which we just says inside of our HTML.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.355
We then set up our animation,

00:03:43.355 --> 00:03:46.700
passing in the name of fade in.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.180
Then we can set the animation duration.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.710
We want this to apply over one second.

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.670
Over the course of one second we'll go from

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.450
the opacity value of zero to the value of one.

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.700
We can see this by saving and going over to the browser, reload the page.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.190
This is fine and working as expected but we

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.815
can improve things even further by adding an easing effect.

00:04:12.815 --> 00:04:16.660
We can use easing to slowdown the start or the end,

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:22.470
making it appear smoother and more gradual and make an easy animation in or out.

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.090
We can add this over in the CSS just after our animation name.

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.405
We can select ease in,

00:04:29.405 --> 00:04:33.415
reload the browser and now we have a more gradual,

00:04:33.415 --> 00:04:37.265
smooth transition as our animation is starting.

00:04:37.265 --> 00:04:40.225
Remember though it's not just the opacity we can add,

00:04:40.225 --> 00:04:44.840
we can add in any other CSS rules which you want to apply.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.740
Next, I'm going to add a delay to the animations so

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.910
the second line of the text fades in after this first one.

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.235
Let's start by adding some custom classes to these two elements.

00:04:57.235 --> 00:04:59.075
For the level one heading,

00:04:59.075 --> 00:05:02.210
we can add to the class name of delay one.

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:08.585
Then the text below the class name of delay two over in the styles.css.

00:05:08.585 --> 00:05:12.815
We can now target these two clusters and set the animation delay.

00:05:12.815 --> 00:05:16.045
Let's start with the delay one.

00:05:16.045 --> 00:05:20.660
We can set the animation delay to be any value which we want.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.560
I want to begin by setting this to be 0.5 seconds.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.520
The delay two is just going to be a little

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.830
longer by setting the animation delay to be 1.5 seconds.

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.400
Let's save this and over to the browser, refresh.

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:43.910
We now see that the animations are working and there is

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:47.815
a delay but this is not working as expected.

00:05:47.815 --> 00:05:52.250
The second line is always there when the page loads but

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.900
we only want this line to appear when the first animation has completed.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.920
This is happening because of the way we setup our key frames.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.215
If we go back to our style sheets,

00:06:03.215 --> 00:06:05.480
once our page first loads,

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.340
since the animations are delayed,

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.315
the opacity will not be immediately set to zero.

00:06:11.315 --> 00:06:16.910
To fix this, we also need to set this in our animation class of fade in custom.

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.420
We set this to an initial value of zero.

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.840
This will take effect when the page first loads.

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.630
Let's try this now, reload the browser.

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.945
Things don't quite look as we expected it either.

00:06:33.945 --> 00:06:36.230
We see that the animation does have

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:40.655
a delay but they also disappear after the animation ends.

00:06:40.655 --> 00:06:44.765
This is because by default after our animation ends,

00:06:44.765 --> 00:06:48.040
none of these styles from the key frames remain.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:52.260
Which means that we are left with the opacity of zero at the end of

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:57.265
our animation rather than the volume of one which we expect here.

00:06:57.265 --> 00:06:59.420
The changes we can make use of

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:04.315
the animation film mode and set this to be a value of forwards.

00:07:04.315 --> 00:07:07.665
Inside of our custom animation class,

00:07:07.665 --> 00:07:14.620
we can set animation film mode and the value of forwards.

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:21.525
Reload the browser and this now works as expected.

00:07:21.525 --> 00:07:25.370
Setting the animation film mode to forward will mean

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:29.015
that these styles from the end of our key frames will remain.

00:07:29.015 --> 00:07:32.435
In our case, the opacity which is set to one.

00:07:32.435 --> 00:07:34.520
There is also a backwards too,

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.670
which will apply the CSS from the first key frame.

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:42.805
Also both two which will apply the styling from the beginning and also the end.

00:07:42.805 --> 00:07:48.665
Finally, we can also remove the from section of the opacity to be zero.

00:07:48.665 --> 00:07:53.575
This is because we already have this setup at the start of our animation.

00:07:53.575 --> 00:07:56.190
Let's just check this works okay,

00:07:56.190 --> 00:08:01.335
reload the browser and everything still works as expected.

00:08:01.335 --> 00:08:05.690
Animations can play a big part in how our website looks,

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:08.875
feels and also how it stands out too.

00:08:08.875 --> 00:08:13.925
Animations is also a really big topic so if you're interested,

00:08:13.925 --> 00:08:18.235
I would encourage you to take a deeper dive into the subject.

00:08:18.235 --> 00:08:24.424
Next, we're going to stick with the same subjects and include a animation library,

00:08:24.424 --> 00:08:27.990
which will give us a nice looking at scroll effects.
