00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.235
Welcome back. Our project is now taking shape and almost complete.

00:00:05.235 --> 00:00:11.760
I'm now going to finish things off by adding some more CSS styling and also effects.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.490
If we take layer, we're going to add a hover effect

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.715
onto each one of our projects inside the grid,

00:00:17.715 --> 00:00:21.550
which is also going to reveal the project's title.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.565
We're also going to make use of our animation library to on this page.

00:00:26.565 --> 00:00:31.170
First let's begin by removing the project title and then we're going

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.040
to re-introduce this later on when the user hovers over our projects.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.910
Let's begin over in our style sheets.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.415
If we take a look for all projects section or all projects page,

00:00:43.415 --> 00:00:46.745
we're going to add this at the bottom of the section.

00:00:46.745 --> 00:00:50.240
Make sure this is outside of any media queries,

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.025
since we always want this to apply for all screen sizes.

00:00:54.025 --> 00:00:57.290
We're going to use the class of hidden text.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.570
If you remember in the HTML,

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.305
we added this class to each one of our grid items,

00:01:03.305 --> 00:01:05.940
so we can make use of this now.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.885
The height of a text, what we're going to do to begin,

00:01:11.885 --> 00:01:15.545
is to set the display type to be none.

00:01:15.545 --> 00:01:18.260
This will then remove this from the page.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.745
If we hit refresh, we now see our title has been removed.

00:01:22.745 --> 00:01:28.100
Now we need a way to reintroduce this when the user hovers over our image.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.435
We're going to do this with a combination of classes.

00:01:31.435 --> 00:01:34.880
Remember that each one of our project is surrounded in

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.600
this grid item class so we can access this to begin.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.830
Then separated by a column,

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.800
we can use what's called a pseudo-class.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.980
A pseudo-class is used when we want to apply CSS for a particular state,

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.515
such as when a element is active,

00:01:54.515 --> 00:01:56.329
when a link is being visited,

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:57.545
or in our case,

00:01:57.545 --> 00:02:00.460
when we want to hover over the elements.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.480
When we hover over these elements,

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.840
we want to affect this hidden texts just above.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.295
Let's understand that just afterwards,

00:02:08.295 --> 00:02:11.660
now all the styles will apply to this hidden text class.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.165
Once we hover over our grid item,

00:02:14.165 --> 00:02:16.880
we have this display type of non adjust here.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.405
We want to reset distributed display type of block,

00:02:20.405 --> 00:02:23.975
which will then place this back into our HTML.

00:02:23.975 --> 00:02:29.135
Also the text-align to be in the center of our section.

00:02:29.135 --> 00:02:32.315
We can also play around with the font size,

00:02:32.315 --> 00:02:38.730
let's go for 4rem and also the font color of white.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:45.290
Over to the browser hit refresh and now when we hover over any of our images,

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.485
we see this large text appear in at the bottom.

00:02:48.485 --> 00:02:51.425
Now our texts disappear when the hover.

00:02:51.425 --> 00:02:55.190
But this is still taken up the space at the bottom of the div.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.290
However, we don't want this at the bottom.

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.785
We want this to be placed at the center of our section.

00:03:00.785 --> 00:03:04.910
The reason we see this at the bottom of our div is because by

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.265
default the element will take up space in the order they are in the HTML.

00:03:10.265 --> 00:03:14.575
It makes sense that we have our image then followed by our text.

00:03:14.575 --> 00:03:20.480
One way we can change this is to set the CSS position of the text to be absolute.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.140
Absolute, we'll remove the elements from the flow or the page,

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.325
meaning it effectively won't take up any space.

00:03:27.325 --> 00:03:30.935
We're then free to position this anywhere we want to.

00:03:30.935 --> 00:03:35.015
Let's go back to our style sheet and just after our color,

00:03:35.015 --> 00:03:40.150
we can set the position of this elements to be absolute.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.950
Let's see what effect this has in the browser.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.999
Now when we hover over our images,

00:03:46.999 --> 00:03:49.205
this now leads the text on the page,

00:03:49.205 --> 00:03:52.300
but it no longer takes up any of the space.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:57.080
We can see this because we don't have any of the gray background behind the text,

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.310
meaning it's no longer positioned inside of our div.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.775
It's obviously not in a good position.

00:04:02.775 --> 00:04:06.185
We can now move it using these CSS properties of top,

00:04:06.185 --> 00:04:08.345
right, bottom, and left.

00:04:08.345 --> 00:04:12.070
We can then use this to place it exactly where we want.

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.995
We want the text to be laid over the center of the image.

00:04:15.995 --> 00:04:21.305
It makes sense till you set this 50 percent from the top and 50 percent from the left.

00:04:21.305 --> 00:04:29.445
Let's say this and go for the left of 50 percent and also the same for the top.

00:04:29.445 --> 00:04:31.550
We can also as a temporary measure,

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.690
remove this hover, just so we can see what's going on while testing.

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.900
Over to the browser and let's see where we are now.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.210
We don't see any of the titles over our projects.

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.640
However, if we scroll to the top of the page,

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.000
we see that all of the titles are now placed in the header section.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.700
Why is this? Well, this is because when we take the textile,

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.530
the flow of the document using

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.210
absolute and then set the top and left values as we have just turn.

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.765
These top and left values are set from the browser's viewport.

00:05:05.765 --> 00:05:12.030
We've effectively set the text to be 50 percent from the top corner of the browser.

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.410
There is a way we can override this though,

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:19.105
and this is to set any of the elements that have a position of relative.

00:05:19.105 --> 00:05:23.815
Each projects which we have down below is wrapped in a div.

00:05:23.815 --> 00:05:27.025
This div has the class of grid item.

00:05:27.025 --> 00:05:28.640
If we go to our project,

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.895
this is the wrapper div just here.

00:05:30.895 --> 00:05:34.115
Now, if we set this to be a position of relative,

00:05:34.115 --> 00:05:36.710
this container will now be our reference point for

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.940
our text rather than the browsers viewport.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.610
Back over to our style sheet,

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:42.915
we can apply this now.

00:05:42.915 --> 00:05:44.585
It's about grid item,

00:05:44.585 --> 00:05:47.090
we already have this class just here.

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:50.560
Let's set the position to be relative.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.460
Over to the browser and refresh.

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:58.390
An OCD text is applied over each one of our images,

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:01.205
the text has actually been pushed over,

00:06:01.205 --> 00:06:04.550
for example, 50 percent from the left-hand side.

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.620
But it doesn't account for the width and height of the text.

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:14.860
Instead, we want the text to be we moved over 50 percent to the center of our text.

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:20.545
We can do this by moving the textbox by 50 percent of its width and height.

00:06:20.545 --> 00:06:24.860
Since we're making use of a percentage unit rather than a pixel,

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.880
this will also still center the text regardless of its size.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.435
Back over to our hidden text.

00:06:31.435 --> 00:06:35.515
The grid item hidden text and then just after our positioning,

00:06:35.515 --> 00:06:41.615
we can then offset our text by half of the width and height by using a CSS transform.

00:06:41.615 --> 00:06:46.110
A transform, which we want to add is going to be translate.

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:52.175
Then inside here we can offset this by adding a X and Y value.

00:06:52.175 --> 00:06:55.715
We want to add an offset of negative 50 percent,

00:06:55.715 --> 00:06:58.055
which is half the weight or the text.

00:06:58.055 --> 00:07:00.085
This is on the X-axis,

00:07:00.085 --> 00:07:01.550
which is left to right.

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:05.420
We can also do the same for the Y-axis, which is opened down.

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:08.100
Let's reload the browser,

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:12.125
and now all taxes being moved over to the left and top,

00:07:12.125 --> 00:07:15.020
50 percent of the total width and height.

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.760
To make our text now stand out,

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.845
we can add some hover effects.

00:07:18.845 --> 00:07:22.775
First of all, we need to re-introduce our hover pseudo-class,

00:07:22.775 --> 00:07:24.680
which we remove from before.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.840
The text will now only again appear when hover over our image.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.700
The next thing to do is to also target our image them

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:35.080
make it darker so the tags will stand out.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:40.520
Just as above, we could target the grid item when the user hovers over.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:44.060
But this time only apply our CSS to the image.

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:45.740
We're going to first of all, add

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:54.170
a filter effect in the brightness of our image and set this to a value of 0.4.

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:58.880
This will have the effect of darkening our image to only be 40 percent.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:01.555
Save this and reload.

00:08:01.555 --> 00:08:03.515
Now when we hover over,

00:08:03.515 --> 00:08:07.070
we've now reduced the brightness of each one of our images.

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:09.890
We can also add a small pop effect two,

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:14.395
which is going to make the image just a little bit bigger when the user hovers over.

00:08:14.395 --> 00:08:18.725
We're again going to make use of this transform property.

00:08:18.725 --> 00:08:22.535
But this time we're going to transform the scale.

00:08:22.535 --> 00:08:25.370
The scale is used to make the elements bigger or

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:29.585
smaller and one is the regular size of the elements.

00:08:29.585 --> 00:08:34.050
I'm going to make this slightly bigger by certain as to be a value of 1.01.

00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:38.685
The final thing I'm going to add is the opacity.

00:08:38.685 --> 00:08:42.960
Make this slightly transparent with 0.95.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:47.050
Give this a save and over to the browser.

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:49.490
When we now hover over our images,

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:54.935
we see a small increase in the size and also the opacity is reduced to.

00:08:54.935 --> 00:09:00.470
The last piece of CSS I'm going to add is to restrict the overall size of the page.

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:05.120
This will stop the images being overstretched on really big screens.

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:09.800
If we stretch the browser to as wide as it possibly can be,

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:13.475
we often have a maximum width,

00:09:13.475 --> 00:09:16.100
which we want the website to stretch too.

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:20.525
Then we can set the background color to apply on the left and right-hand side,

00:09:20.525 --> 00:09:23.425
once the browser reaches the size,

00:09:23.425 --> 00:09:26.870
we can do this by setting the maximum width up at

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:30.395
the very top of our style sheet in the body section.

00:09:30.395 --> 00:09:39.915
I'm going to set mine to be a value of 1,500 pixels and then over to the project.

00:09:39.915 --> 00:09:44.645
We now see that the browser has gone over the 1,500 pixels,

00:09:44.645 --> 00:09:46.730
leaving all of the content moved over to

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:50.720
the left-hand side and all our white space over on the right.

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:54.170
Generally though, what we want is the white space to be divided

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:57.575
up equally between the left and right-hand side.

00:09:57.575 --> 00:10:01.355
We can do this by setting the margins to be automatic.

00:10:01.355 --> 00:10:05.675
We will divide the spacing up equally on both sides.

00:10:05.675 --> 00:10:08.990
Let's do this back all the in the body section.

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:12.575
We already have the margin property set just up here.

00:10:12.575 --> 00:10:15.580
We can add this as a top and bottom value.

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:18.610
No margin will apply on the top and bottom.

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:22.099
But we can set the left and right values to be auto.

00:10:22.099 --> 00:10:26.040
Save this and now we should have equal spacing.

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:29.180
The final thing which I'm going to do to stop

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:33.230
the white space from the body flowing into the background color,

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:36.035
is to set some background colors for the body,

00:10:36.035 --> 00:10:40.370
which is the section which we see in between here and the HTML,

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:43.685
which is the background color on the left and right.

00:10:43.685 --> 00:10:48.620
First of all, the body section can have the white background color.

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:50.690
Then if we go up,

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:53.110
we can add to the HTML2.

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:57.975
Now HTML section will cover the white space on the left and right-hand side.

00:10:57.975 --> 00:10:59.720
Now what I'm going to do here is to set

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.480
the background color to be a slightly different shade.

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:05.070
I want to use eee.

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:10.930
This will stop our page that can really stretched on large monitors.

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:15.035
The final touch for this page is to add some animations to all projects.

00:11:15.035 --> 00:11:17.390
Use the animation library.

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:23.755
Let's go to the projects or HTML and we can add the attributes to all of our grid items.

00:11:23.755 --> 00:11:28.369
We do this by adding the animation name with data aos,

00:11:28.369 --> 00:11:31.805
an animation of zoom-in-up.

00:11:31.805 --> 00:11:38.040
To save time, I'm going to copy this and add this to all of the rest of the projects.

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:43.230
It can of course add a different animation if you prefer.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:46.910
To make sure this is on each one of the projects,

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:50.075
so this will zoom in when we scroll down.

00:11:50.075 --> 00:11:54.450
Below the browser, scroll down to

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:58.520
our projects and these now will zoom in as we reach them.

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:02.150
Congratulations for reaching the end of the course project.

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:05.675
First of course, feel free to extend it and make it your own.

00:12:05.675 --> 00:12:07.730
Once you are happy with your project,

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:12.930
you will be eager to get it online and this is what we're going to take a look at next.
