00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.500
We're now going to take a look at how we can nest concept more

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.420
deeply inside of our project and also include images too.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.545
We're going to be doing this by creating a recent work section,

00:00:13.545 --> 00:00:17.070
which is going to showcase two of our projects.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.704
This is also going to allow us to play around with some more complex layouts,

00:00:21.704 --> 00:00:24.775
and include in uneven size elements.

00:00:24.775 --> 00:00:28.740
For example, our first project will be on the first row.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.600
We'll have a large image,

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.630
and then some text about the project on the opposite side.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.515
We'll then reverse this for the second project on the row just below,

00:00:39.515 --> 00:00:43.960
where the image will be on the opposite side to the first project.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.270
These are also going to be inside of their own div,

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.945
which is going to be a section on these walls to be nested just like we've seen earlier.

00:00:52.945 --> 00:00:57.560
These CSS flexbox is going to allow us to create this layout,

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.395
and also create a different layout for the smaller screen too.

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:07.360
Let's get to work with adding the HTML for the section.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.740
Over to the finished version this is how this is going to look in real life.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.690
We're going to have our two rows,

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.170
and we're going to alternately the project on each row.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.250
Using the flexbox, this will also be fully responsive to,

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.155
so the layouts will change on smaller and larger screen devices.

00:01:27.155 --> 00:01:31.670
In this video, we're going to go ahead and add the HTML markup for

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.200
the section which will provide the content to work with in the next video.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.730
Where we'll add the flexbox to lay this out this out exactly how we want to.

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.340
The first step is to create a wrapper for

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.390
this section along with a recent work title at the top.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.255
Let's do this within the body section,

00:01:50.255 --> 00:01:54.510
which is below the parallax that we just recently created.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.865
Our section wrapper, opening and closing tag,

00:01:59.865 --> 00:02:02.950
and then inside we can create a level 3 heading.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.550
It's x is going to be Recent work,

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.360
and we can also add a class attribute inside of

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.930
the opening tag so we can target this with the CSS.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.125
Just after our level 3 heading I'm going to add a new element,

00:02:18.125 --> 00:02:20.195
which is a horizontal rule.

00:02:20.195 --> 00:02:24.620
This is going to add a line across our page, which you see just here.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.940
We used a similar effect in the CSS earlier on in this course,

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.550
where we used a border to create a line.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.775
But this time we're going to be using the horizontal rule to create our line in our HTML,

00:02:36.775 --> 00:02:39.990
you just scroll down, refresh the page.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.840
We can just now see our title and our line at the very bottom.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.290
We can then begin to nest our divs inside of

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.025
the section to create our two rows of content.

00:02:52.025 --> 00:02:55.160
To do this just below our horizontal rule,

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:01.060
we're going to create two new divs with the class of recent work.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.035
I'm then going to copy and paste this straight to our second row,

00:03:07.035 --> 00:03:10.955
but how does creating a new div create a new row?

00:03:10.955 --> 00:03:14.480
The reason this works is because generally most elements

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.115
are categorized as either block level or inline,

00:03:18.115 --> 00:03:21.840
and if div falls into the block level element category.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.250
I will consider this if we go over to the Mozilla website,

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.055
here I mean the block-level elements section.

00:03:28.055 --> 00:03:31.165
Which you can do a search for if you want to find this page.

00:03:31.165 --> 00:03:34.260
There is a lot of information and examples on this page,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.990
but the key thing to note is here in this box.

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:42.500
It says, "A block-level element will always start on a new line,

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.410
and also take up the full width available."

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.495
Meaning that for each div that we add this will always add on a new line.

00:03:50.495 --> 00:03:54.950
We can see some examples of block-level elements if we scroll down.

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.660
Here's our div tag,

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.910
and there is a lot more such as: the header,

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.610
the footer, and also the nav.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:07.385
We also go to the Mozilla website and take a look at the inline elements section.

00:04:07.385 --> 00:04:11.795
We can see here that the inline elements will not start on a new line,

00:04:11.795 --> 00:04:15.325
and it will only take up as much width as necessary.

00:04:15.325 --> 00:04:18.885
Things such as images are inline elements,

00:04:18.885 --> 00:04:22.130
this is why we can place the side-by-side across the page.

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.540
Once again, if you scroll down we have

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.665
our list of inline elements and we can see our image just here.

00:04:29.665 --> 00:04:35.985
We can also use CSS to change the default type too by using the display rule,

00:04:35.985 --> 00:04:41.005
and we're going to look at this in the next video where we're going to add the flexbox.

00:04:41.005 --> 00:04:45.894
Now that we have our two rows which you can break up into two sections,

00:04:45.894 --> 00:04:50.260
we're going to do this by nesting two more divs inside of each one.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.200
This is so we can add the image on one side,

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.290
and on the other side we can add the information about our project.

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.460
Our first div we can also add a class,

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.680
so we can use this in the CSS.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.935
This is going to be recent work info.

00:05:06.935 --> 00:05:09.110
We can duplicate this,

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.450
and this is for the recent work image.

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.380
If this looks confusing don't worry this is just the first row,

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:22.745
and inside we have a wrapper for the image and then for the information.

00:05:22.745 --> 00:05:27.610
We're going to do exactly the same for our second row just below,

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:33.290
I'm going to copy this and add this inside here so we have two matching sections.

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.000
These are just containers at the moment there,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.250
so is no content yet to show inside the browser.

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.570
You should have already gathered together the images which you would like to use.

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.240
If you've not yet done so now will be

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.500
a good time to gather together some images of your recent work.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.455
If you don't have any recent work images,

00:05:53.455 --> 00:05:58.195
you can download any sample Placeholder image which you would like to use.

00:05:58.195 --> 00:06:00.040
I already have my images ready,

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.530
so I'm going to add these to the projects.

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:06.265
We already have a Images folder setup inside here.

00:06:06.265 --> 00:06:08.200
I'm going to grab all of the rest of

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.755
the images except the background which you already have,

00:06:11.755 --> 00:06:15.440
and then drag these over to my Images folder.

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.370
Close this down, now we can go

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:25.090
ahead and add all of the content which we need for our two sections.

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.010
We have our image,

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:30.470
and then we're going to add some text on the opposite side.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.070
Let's start in our first row and within the recent work info

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:41.030
section inside here a level 4 heading which is going to be for the project title.

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.675
Mine is going to be Pizza Planet.

00:06:43.675 --> 00:06:47.220
Just below the p elements which is going to be the text

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:50.840
and I'm just going to add some sample text of Vue.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.435
js application for a and then dot dot dot.

00:06:55.435 --> 00:06:59.405
Of course you can add some more detailed descriptions inside here,

00:06:59.405 --> 00:07:04.985
a horizontal rule to separate the title and description from the rest of the features.

00:07:04.985 --> 00:07:09.155
These features I'm going to add inside of an another list.

00:07:09.155 --> 00:07:12.240
First of all, the title,

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:17.190
the another list, and then our list item

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:22.460
inside and this is going to be for each one of the features of our projects.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:27.920
Vue. js which is going to be the view library,

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:32.440
the Latest firestore database,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:44.860
Authentication, Routing, Vuex state management,

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:49.480
and then Real time updates.

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:55.030
Afterwards, we're going to separate this with another horizontal rule.

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:58.080
Then we're going to add a link using the a element,

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:01.850
which is going to be a link to a live project if you have one.

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:04.960
View text of Visit site,

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:10.545
then you can add the link or the URL for the life project if you have one.

00:08:10.545 --> 00:08:14.704
This is all of our information if we save and refresh,

00:08:14.704 --> 00:08:18.110
go down we have all of our texts in place.

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:22.600
The next thing to do is to add the image which is inside of this wrapper.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.165
We do this with the image element which is IMG.

00:08:26.165 --> 00:08:30.020
We add the source which is the file path to our image,

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.090
we have an Images folder.

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:35.140
This is images and then forward slash,

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:38.500
and the image which I want to use is going to be pizza-planet.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.420
png.

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:43.090
The alt texts of pizza planet image,

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:49.565
this is the alternative for things such as screen readers if the image is not available.

00:08:49.565 --> 00:08:53.365
Over to the browser and let's see this image on the screen.

00:08:53.365 --> 00:08:58.630
Good. The next thing to do is to repeat this process for the second project.

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:01.040
We want to do a pretty much exactly the same as

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.455
above we're going to create the same structure,

00:09:03.455 --> 00:09:06.100
but for the second project.

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:10.070
Let's begin with our level 4 heading on the project title,

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:12.080
which is React Trello.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:15.685
Again, inside of the recent-work-info section

00:09:15.685 --> 00:09:19.385
we then have a description inside of the p elements.

00:09:19.385 --> 00:09:28.484
We're going to say React js application in line with the hr elements,

00:09:28.484 --> 00:09:33.030
the features text, and

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:38.825
then our another list for all of our features wrapped in a list item elements.

00:09:38.825 --> 00:09:44.850
We're going to say, the React js view library.

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:50.980
This also has the Latest firestore database,

00:09:53.350 --> 00:10:00.070
Authentication, Routing.

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:04.599
This also makes use of the Context API,

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:08.565
and also Real time updates.

00:10:08.565 --> 00:10:13.130
Just as above underneath our another list we're going to again add

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:18.440
a horizontal rule and then a link to our live site if we have one,

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:21.630
and we text of Visit site.

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:26.510
If you don't have a live version to display you can also leave this off,

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:30.335
or you can come back to this later and add in the link.

00:10:30.335 --> 00:10:35.070
Which just leaves us with the image to add in the very bottom div,

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:37.730
and again we're going to add to the image elements.

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:40.685
The source is the Images folder,

00:10:40.685 --> 00:10:44.585
and then the image I've chose is going to be react-trello.

00:10:44.585 --> 00:10:49.740
The alt text of react-trello image,

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:53.145
save and then reload the browser.

00:10:53.145 --> 00:10:56.035
We now see our second projects.

00:10:56.035 --> 00:11:00.520
We now have the content in place for our recent work section,

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:05.780
and in the next video we're going to apply some CSS styling to not only improve

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:11.785
the look and feel but to also make it look better on different screen sizes too.

00:11:11.785 --> 00:11:16.430
To help with this we're going to take advantage of the CSS flexbox,

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:22.169
which will help with laying out of a content across one direction.
