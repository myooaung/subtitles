00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.920
Earlier when we setup our project,

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.829
we said that the head section contains information

00:00:05.829 --> 00:00:09.765
about our sites and also links to our files.

00:00:09.765 --> 00:00:13.480
But we're not going to link to a style sheet which is going to help

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.650
improve our styling and our layouts for our projects.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.275
First, we need a style sheet to work with so we cannot dissolve it in our projects.

00:00:23.275 --> 00:00:28.840
We can open up the sidebar and create a new file in the root of our projects.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.580
I'm going to call this the styles with the dotted CSS extension,

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.370
which we need for all regular CSS files.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.599
Since this is not a large project,

00:00:40.599 --> 00:00:45.155
I'm going to keep all of the styles for this course in a single file.

00:00:45.155 --> 00:00:50.585
For larger projects, you can use as many CSS files as you would like,

00:00:50.585 --> 00:00:54.155
and even organize them into folders too.

00:00:54.155 --> 00:00:59.690
Next we need this inside of our HTML file in the head section.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.260
Go to the Index.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.255
Then I'm going to link this just above the title.

00:01:06.255 --> 00:01:09.620
Remember earlier we said the head section is used to add

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:15.070
information about our sites and also links to our files.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.540
We can create this link, by default,

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.870
we have this relationship with style sheets,

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.880
which is exactly what we want.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.285
Then the same "href" attribute that we have for our links just below.

00:01:28.285 --> 00:01:33.830
Inside here we need to ask the file path to the file which you want to link to.

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.040
Since this file is alongside our index page,

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.800
all we need to do is to add the name of our file.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.690
If we organized our CSS into folders,

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.915
we would also need to add the "Folder Name" too.

00:01:47.915 --> 00:01:50.195
Just a CSS folder,

00:01:50.195 --> 00:01:53.890
and then forward "slash" into the name of our file.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.110
To test that this file is working properly,

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.370
I often do something obvious which will display in the browser.

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.560
If you go to the, "Body",

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.900
and sets the background color to the color of red.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.785
Let's save this and reload the browser,

00:02:10.785 --> 00:02:15.300
and this is clearly now linked so we can remove this file.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.805
Now I'm going to add to the top of this file

00:02:19.805 --> 00:02:23.720
some global styles which will apply for all the sites.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.840
I would also reset in some default styles which the browser adds automatically.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.300
Also to begin, I'm going to be styling the sites mobile first,

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.410
then later on, we can adjust our styling for large screens.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.100
Let's begin by shrinking it down to a small screen device.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.880
I'm going to place this alongside Visual Studio Code.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.030
Since we only use one CSS file,

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.320
keep this more organized.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.000
I'm going to add a comment.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.985
A comment is some texts which we want to add which is not displayed in the browser.

00:02:57.985 --> 00:03:02.665
We can typically use this to our notes for our self and our developers,

00:03:02.665 --> 00:03:07.615
where the comment in CSS with the forward "slash" and then a," star",

00:03:07.615 --> 00:03:10.450
and then we close it off when the star and forward

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.130
slash in between here we can add any text which you want to add.

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.330
I'm going to add this section as global styles.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:26.150
The first thing I'm going to do is to target the body by setting the font family.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.530
If we take a look at the auto complete,

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.545
we can see some of the available fonts we can add,

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:35.179
and I'm going to go for "Georgia",

00:03:35.179 --> 00:03:40.320
which go down "Times New Roman" and "Times New serif".

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.060
These are web safe fonts which we can use in your projects,

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.285
meaning they are safe to use across all browsers.

00:03:47.285 --> 00:03:50.885
We can also include different fonts from other providers,

00:03:50.885 --> 00:03:52.580
such as Google fonts,

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.940
the phenomenon to stick with one of these website fonts.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.520
Often when we declare the font family,

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.585
as we see here, there is multiple fonts.

00:04:01.585 --> 00:04:03.295
We have four just here,

00:04:03.295 --> 00:04:06.605
and this is in case the first one is not available.

00:04:06.605 --> 00:04:08.540
Georgia is not available.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.095
It will look for the Times New Roman font and fall back to the times.

00:04:13.095 --> 00:04:17.795
Then the final one would default to a generic serif.

00:04:17.795 --> 00:04:26.280
On the next line, we're going to set the base on size to be ten pixels.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.565
We'll see why very soon.

00:04:28.565 --> 00:04:32.260
The next thing we're going to do is set the margin to be zero,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.715
and this will reset any browser default.

00:04:35.715 --> 00:04:40.295
We can set the width to be 100 vw,

00:04:40.295 --> 00:04:44.000
which is 100 percent of the viewport width.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.810
This is because we are styling mobile first and we

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.545
want the content is span the full width of the mobile device,

00:04:51.545 --> 00:04:55.190
and also again, since we are targeting the mobile devices,

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.060
we're also going to center the content.

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.755
We can't override this later on when developing for larger browsers,

00:05:02.755 --> 00:05:05.735
and we'll do this using midi-queries.

00:05:05.735 --> 00:05:08.580
"Save" this and go to the "Browser".

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:16.350
"Reload". See the text is aligned into the center and the font size is now 10 pixels.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.505
Next week we're going to remove these bullets from our own order list.

00:05:21.505 --> 00:05:24.830
Let's target the unordered list elements.

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.265
We can remove these by setting the "List-style",

00:05:28.265 --> 00:05:30.115
to be equal to, "Non".

00:05:30.115 --> 00:05:32.060
"Refresh", the browser.

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:37.175
We can also see from our unordered list that this is not completely centered.

00:05:37.175 --> 00:05:42.680
This is because of some of the browser defaults which are applied to our unordered list.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.530
We're going to remove any margin,

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:51.765
which is the spacing around the outside of the elements and also any padding,

00:05:51.765 --> 00:05:53.580
we can reset this too,

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.075
and padding is any spacing which is added inside of the elements.

00:05:58.075 --> 00:06:00.975
Margin is outside, and the padding

00:06:00.975 --> 00:06:05.890
is inside.I want to take a closer look at these very soon.

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:09.225
Our links also have the underline.

00:06:09.225 --> 00:06:13.345
This is because these are surrounded with the a elements.

00:06:13.345 --> 00:06:19.505
We can remove the underline by setting the text decoration to be "none".

00:06:19.505 --> 00:06:22.655
Our links also have a different color.

00:06:22.655 --> 00:06:27.695
We can override this by setting the color value to be inherit.

00:06:27.695 --> 00:06:33.050
This means the links will inherit the color from the parent list item rather

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:38.350
than it need default in color, "save" and "refresh".

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:43.685
Most of this section is just browser overrides and some basic defaults.

00:06:43.685 --> 00:06:46.880
We're now going to move on to some specific headers value.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.965
We can also create a comment or two.

00:06:50.965 --> 00:06:54.440
Just like before, we can create our comments,

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.200
and this is going to be for the header section.

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.810
Our header is surrounded in the header elements,

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:05.915
and just like we see in the final version here,

00:07:05.915 --> 00:07:09.050
we're going to set this to be a light gray color.

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:12.755
We do this by setting the background property.

00:07:12.755 --> 00:07:16.055
I'm going to set this to be any color which we choose,

00:07:16.055 --> 00:07:20.610
which I'm going to go for the color of light slate gray.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:25.255
If you want to find out more about different colors we can use,

00:07:25.255 --> 00:07:29.450
you can do a Google search for HTML color picker.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:38.570
You can use the default one which appears in the search or select any of the links below.

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:41.000
If you are using a hex value, just like this,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.460
we also need to copy the hash and then we can replace this as our background color.

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.370
I'm going to keep mine as the gray color.

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:51.890
Then reload the browser.

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:55.310
I will see this now taking effect.

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:58.160
At the moment, all of our content is squeezed

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.950
up against the top and the bottom of the header.

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:04.025
Remember we've always said that we can add some space in,

00:08:04.025 --> 00:08:07.145
inside of our elements by adding padding.

00:08:07.145 --> 00:08:12.860
That's obviously now and I'm going to set this to be the value of 1rem.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:16.490
1rem is one times the size of our base font,

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:19.340
which we set up in the body size earlier.

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:22.550
So 1rem would be equal to 10 pixels,

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:25.940
2rem would be 20 pixels, and so on.

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:27.500
Reason we set this to be

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:32.975
a rounded 10 pixels is so we can easily work out the value in rem.

00:08:32.975 --> 00:08:37.880
So now if we say this, we should have 10 pixels of padding around the outside.

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:40.730
Next, we're going to set the height of the element,

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:45.635
just like we've seen in the final version with the full height of the browser.

00:08:45.635 --> 00:08:50.000
We can do this by setting the value of 100vh,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.120
which is 100 percent of the view-port height.

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:59.180
Next, we're going to move on to styling the navigation links.

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:02.795
These are being created using an unordered list.

00:09:02.795 --> 00:09:07.670
Let's set the font size to be equal to 1.2rem,

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:13.025
which is the equivalent of 12 pixels add in the unordered list,

00:09:13.025 --> 00:09:18.785
like this, we'll apply the font size to all of the unordered lists on our page.

00:09:18.785 --> 00:09:21.350
If you want it to be more specific though,

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:24.050
and only apply this to the unordered list.

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:26.480
Inside of our now section,

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:30.170
we could be more specific and add the nav in front,

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:32.840
just like this, meaning we are now free to

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:36.485
add different styling into different unordered lists.

00:09:36.485 --> 00:09:41.150
Next up we're going to set the display type to be flex.

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:45.095
We will look deeper into the CSS flexbox soon.

00:09:45.095 --> 00:09:49.775
But for now, this allows us to lay out content in one direction.

00:09:49.775 --> 00:09:53.915
Either horizontally, defaults or vertically.

00:09:53.915 --> 00:09:56.225
Save this and reload.

00:09:56.225 --> 00:10:00.590
We now see the links are laid out in a horizontal direction.

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:03.560
To push these links back into the middle of the page,

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.974
we can also use a flexbox property,

00:10:05.974 --> 00:10:10.920
which is justify content and the value of center.

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:14.735
These links also need some space in between.

00:10:14.735 --> 00:10:18.065
We can do these by targeting the list item.

00:10:18.065 --> 00:10:21.185
Again, we're going to be more specific and targets

00:10:21.185 --> 00:10:24.665
only the list items in this navigation section.

00:10:24.665 --> 00:10:26.990
We can do this by adding some margin.

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:33.109
When setting the certainly margin if we just type in a value such as 1rem,

00:10:33.109 --> 00:10:36.590
this will apply to all sides of our list item.

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:39.140
So 1rem of margin will apply to the top,

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:41.585
right, bottom, and left.

00:10:41.585 --> 00:10:44.660
We can also use a shorthand which is to apply

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:49.520
the margin to the top and bottom and also the left and right only.

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:53.405
So to begin, we can set this to be zero on the top and bottom.

00:10:53.405 --> 00:10:57.065
Then the second value is the left and right,

00:10:57.065 --> 00:11:01.445
reload, and now I have some space in between.

00:11:01.445 --> 00:11:04.460
Moving down to our level one heading.

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:07.640
Let's also add some font-size into this.

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:12.320
Again, we're going to be more specific and only target the level one heading.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.765
Inside of the header section.

00:11:14.765 --> 00:11:20.060
I'm going to set the font size to be 5rem.

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:22.625
Reload, and now it's much bigger.

00:11:22.625 --> 00:11:26.180
Moving down, we also have the p element below.

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:31.070
So this is header p. The font size,

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:34.010
I'm going to set this equal to 1.6rem,

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:37.535
which is the equivalent of 16 pixels.

00:11:37.535 --> 00:11:41.915
Some padding which is going to apply on the inside of the elements.

00:11:41.915 --> 00:11:47.915
So 1rem on the top and bottom add some space in between the rest of the text,

00:11:47.915 --> 00:11:53.360
and we don't need any padding on the left and right since our text is centered.

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:56.945
Let's take a look at this. Okay, good.

00:11:56.945 --> 00:11:59.450
If we take a look at the final version,

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:03.005
we also have this line separating things out.

00:12:03.005 --> 00:12:06.230
We can add this in using a hr elements,

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:09.560
which is a horizontal rule in the HTML,

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:13.190
or we can add a border on the bottom of this text.

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:16.190
Let's do this using CSS.

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:22.750
The border bottom, which is going to be in line with of one pixel,

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:31.800
a solid line, and the color of light gray semicolon at the end and refresh the browser.

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:35.555
The last parts of the header styling is to target the,

00:12:35.555 --> 00:12:38.150
I make things taxed at the very bottom.

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:43.865
So far we've been targeting the elements by the name such as header and p,

00:12:43.865 --> 00:12:45.500
which us we looked at earlier.

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:48.155
We can also use a class name to.

00:12:48.155 --> 00:12:51.770
I'm going to add a class name to rotate this element.

00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:57.965
Since we're going to reuse this across our page over in the index.html.

00:12:57.965 --> 00:13:00.980
Let's look for our level three heading.

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:05.465
We can add a class of rotate.

00:13:05.465 --> 00:13:10.040
This is because the text will rotate on the largest screens.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:16.040
So let's go back over to our style in which I targets a class with the dot,

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:18.710
the name of rotates.

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:23.105
Rather than simply using the margin property we looked at before,

00:13:23.105 --> 00:13:26.885
we can also be more specific and target a single side,

00:13:26.885 --> 00:13:28.715
such as margin top.

00:13:28.715 --> 00:13:31.805
I'm going to add a value of 2rem,

00:13:31.805 --> 00:13:35.225
a font size of 3rem,

00:13:35.225 --> 00:13:41.720
and the opacity, which is the see free value of 0.4.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:45.680
This will mean our text is 40 percent transparent,

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:49.580
meaning some of the gray background color will come through.

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:53.660
So this is how this text will look on the smallest screens.

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:57.800
Then later on, on the big screen we'll add the rotation.

00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:01.175
This is our first look at styling a web page with

00:14:01.175 --> 00:14:05.255
CSS and also taken a mobile-first approach.

00:14:05.255 --> 00:14:08.480
As you can see, we've covered quite a few CSS rules

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:12.320
here and there's also a lot more which we can apply.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:17.760
We'll discover many of these as we progress through the rest of the course.
