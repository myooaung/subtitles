00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:08.415
To build websites, HTML and CSS are the essential skills you will need to learn.

00:00:08.415 --> 00:00:11.130
You will also need lots of practice too to get the hang of

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.895
these skills and this is the aim of this course.

00:00:14.895 --> 00:00:19.560
During this course, we'll be building a portfolio project to give you the chance to

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.360
put your new HTML and CSS skills into good practice.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.950
You will also get the chance to showcase your skills by building a site

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:34.170
and also have a great looking portfolio to add to any future projects too.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.640
So who am I? Well, my name is Chris and I've been a web developer for

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.915
20 years and also teaching these skills to others for many years too.

00:00:43.915 --> 00:00:48.110
By the end of this class, you will have a great understanding of how websites are

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.080
built and also the role which both HTML and CSS has to play.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.785
Not only will you learn the essential skills for a beginner,

00:00:56.785 --> 00:00:59.300
we will also go even further by covering

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.185
more intermediate topics such as responsive design,

00:01:03.185 --> 00:01:06.115
layout using grid and Flexbox,

00:01:06.115 --> 00:01:12.075
animations and transforms, adding a parallax-style effect using CSS,

00:01:12.075 --> 00:01:14.205
and so much more.

00:01:14.205 --> 00:01:20.420
You don't need to have prior knowledge in HTML or CSS to get started and in fact,

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.040
if you are completely new,

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.265
a willingness to learn will get you a long way.

00:01:25.265 --> 00:01:29.795
We cover things from the ground up explaining everything you need to know.

00:01:29.795 --> 00:01:34.849
However, if you do have some experience building websites with HTML and CSS,

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:38.285
you will hopefully learn some new tricks along the way, too.

00:01:38.285 --> 00:01:42.155
By the end of this course, you will have the skills you need to build

00:01:42.155 --> 00:01:45.440
great looking responsive websites and also a

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.540
live portfolio online for the rest of the world to see.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.810
Thank you for taking an interest in this class and let's get started.
