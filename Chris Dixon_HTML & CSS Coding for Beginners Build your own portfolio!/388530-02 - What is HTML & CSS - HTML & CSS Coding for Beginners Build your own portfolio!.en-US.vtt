00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.600
Before we jump into our project,

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.585
if you are new to HTML and CSS,

00:00:06.585 --> 00:00:10.320
we're going to take a look at what these are in more detail.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.620
We're not going to go too deep since we'll be

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.950
writing a lot of HTML and CSS during this course,

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.735
but a little background will help you understand what we will be doing.

00:00:21.735 --> 00:00:27.180
Beginning with HTML, which stands for hypertext markup language,

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.885
and is the standard way to write web pages.

00:00:30.885 --> 00:00:35.660
We write HTML using elements and these are usually just a pair of

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.430
tags which will describe the content inside such as just here,

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.620
this is the p element which is for adding a paragraph of text to our web page.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.435
First there's an opening tag and then we have

00:00:50.435 --> 00:00:54.395
a closing tag which is indicated by the forward slash,

00:00:54.395 --> 00:00:57.425
and then we add our text inside.

00:00:57.425 --> 00:01:02.540
Most HTML elements have an opening and closing tag, however,

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:08.585
there are a few exceptions such as when using images which only have the single tag.

00:01:08.585 --> 00:01:14.300
This is because image tanks have no content inside, so just text.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:20.730
Instead we point to an image file and we'll cover this during the course.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.360
How do we go from this to a full web page?

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.350
Well, let's take a look at a typical example.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.770
It's because we're creating a HTML document that we're also going to

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.660
be using the HTML elements to surround our whole Web page,

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.000
this also has the HTML opening tag and also the closing tag

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.715
too which is going to surround all of the content we see on the Web page.

00:01:46.715 --> 00:01:55.160
To begin, we have the HTML tags and then nested inside here we have all the content for

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.610
our page and any contents which we'll see in

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:05.155
the next video that we want to display in the browser goes inside of the body element.

00:02:05.155 --> 00:02:10.020
Nested inside we have the body which is going

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.105
to be a wrapper for all of the images and all of the text,

00:02:14.105 --> 00:02:17.200
links and things like that on the page.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.905
Inside this body, we then have all of the elements which you see here,

00:02:21.905 --> 00:02:28.360
we may have a header so this is on the next level in,

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.095
and then inside of this header we can add further nesting too.

00:02:33.095 --> 00:02:40.085
Often we may want to add a logo or a site image at the top of the header,

00:02:40.085 --> 00:02:42.500
also some links for navigation,

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.975
or we could have our navigation just below as we see here.

00:02:46.975 --> 00:02:50.630
Inside of the main section we have some further nesting

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.590
too on the same level as the header.

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.875
We also have the main section,

00:02:58.875 --> 00:03:02.900
and inside here we can add further elements inside here too.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.120
We may want to add a image,

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.970
we may want to add some text,

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.695
or we could also divide this up further into multiple sections.

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:21.930
For example, let's say we had a new section inside here.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.505
This section could also contain some further nested elements,

00:03:28.505 --> 00:03:32.540
and these again go in between the opening and closing element.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.155
We could add some text inside here to this section,

00:03:37.155 --> 00:03:38.415
would then also contain

00:03:38.415 --> 00:03:43.660
the p elements and this is how a Web page is generally structured.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.930
This is how we get our content onto the page,

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.130
but how do we add styling and layout?

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.985
We do this using CSS,

00:03:53.985 --> 00:03:56.855
CSS is a way to change the look,

00:03:56.855 --> 00:04:00.085
feel, and layout of our Web pages,

00:04:00.085 --> 00:04:03.954
it does this by adding colors, sizing, spacing,

00:04:03.954 --> 00:04:06.320
and positioning to name a few,

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.375
and we can even use it for animations and transitions.

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:14.540
To do this, we need to target the HTML elements we

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.845
want to style and they're multiple ways which we can do this.

00:04:18.845 --> 00:04:22.855
Looking at this p element from earlier on the left,

00:04:22.855 --> 00:04:27.800
probably the most basic way to do this is by the element name.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.920
Both on the right is how we write our CSS,

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.460
we target the element by it's name such as p,

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:41.200
and write our style rules inside of these curly braces such as the font color, and size.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:47.315
This would apply the style into all the p elements on a page, however,

00:04:47.315 --> 00:04:50.870
if we just wanted to target born single element,

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.840
we could add a unique ID to the opening tag, like this.

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.555
This id name of text-red is totally up to us,

00:05:00.555 --> 00:05:04.910
and any extra information we add into this tag like this,

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.405
is known as an attribute.

00:05:07.405 --> 00:05:14.435
We'll link this ID to our CSS by its name with the hash prefix as we see on the right.

00:05:14.435 --> 00:05:21.170
Since an ID is intended to be a unique name targeting only one single element,

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:24.485
we also have the class attribute too.

00:05:24.485 --> 00:05:31.750
This class can be added to multiple elements resulting in our styles being more reusable.

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:36.420
Like the ID, we'll link it to the CSS by its name,

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:40.285
but this time we add a dot as a prefix.

00:05:40.285 --> 00:05:44.585
These are examples of what we call CSS selectors,

00:05:44.585 --> 00:05:48.980
and we'll cover some more advanced selectors throughout this course.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:53.695
This is just some basics to get us going with HTML and CSS,

00:05:53.695 --> 00:05:57.995
but I always believe the best way to learn is by actually building things,

00:05:57.995 --> 00:06:00.290
and this is what we're going to begin to do in

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:04.830
the next video where we setup our portfolio projects.
