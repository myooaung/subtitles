00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
In this video, we're going to add the final section of our homepage,

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.100
which is going to be a contact section.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.325
Along with also finishing off the mobile first styling.

00:00:11.325 --> 00:00:15.375
If we go to the final version which I have opened here,

00:00:15.375 --> 00:00:18.750
and then scroll down to the bottom of our index page.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.410
This is going to be the contact section which I'm going to create now.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.600
The HTML is pretty simple.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.489
All you have is some blocks of text and they can be styled with our CSS.

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:32.550
Let's begin by adding the hedge bar markup,

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.500
which is basically our new section,

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.000
and then some blocks of text.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.660
Let's go over to the index.html down at the very bottom,

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.895
but still within the body section.

00:00:43.895 --> 00:00:46.805
We are going to once again create our new section.

00:00:46.805 --> 00:00:50.820
This is going to have a unique ID of contact.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.240
We'll make use of this in the CSS very soon.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:02.980
Then inside we're going to have a nested div with the class of contact info.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.330
This section is going to be the wrapper.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.735
If we take a look at the final version,

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:13.475
this is going to be the wrapper for all of the horizontal text which we have just here.

00:01:13.475 --> 00:01:17.930
Then we'll create a level 3 heading with the class of rotate,

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.220
which we used earlier on in the project.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.775
Inside of our contact info we can add the first element,

00:01:25.775 --> 00:01:31.060
which is going to be a p element with the class of contact heading.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.705
We'll use the CSS very soon to make this a lot larger,

00:01:35.705 --> 00:01:38.874
the text of don't be a stranger.

00:01:38.874 --> 00:01:43.050
Let's save this and check this looks okay in the browser.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.560
Reload. We can just about see how text down at the very bottom.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.210
One thing we are going to do though,

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.570
is put the word stranger on a separate line,

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.375
just like we see in the final version.

00:01:56.375 --> 00:01:59.125
We can do this by adding a brake tag.

00:01:59.125 --> 00:02:01.815
A break tag is simply br.

00:02:01.815 --> 00:02:05.415
This will push our text onto the next line.

00:02:05.415 --> 00:02:14.620
After this, a second p element with the text of need a developer. Then let's talk.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.200
Then offered a piece of text inside here,

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.915
which is going to be our e-mail address.

00:02:20.915 --> 00:02:25.850
This now takes care of all of all horizontal text in our wrapper.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.630
Just below this wrapper, we're going to have the rotated text,

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.790
which is a level 3 heading.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.314
We're going to make use of the class of rotate,

00:02:35.314 --> 00:02:38.885
which we used earlier on in the course for our heading,

00:02:38.885 --> 00:02:42.150
which was the text of I make things.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.465
Inside here, all we have is the text of contact, save this.

00:02:47.465 --> 00:02:49.870
Over to the browser,

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.615
we see our horizontal text is pretty small.

00:02:53.615 --> 00:02:57.560
But we have some styles taking effect for our level 3 heading,

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.415
since we made use of the rotate class.

00:03:00.415 --> 00:03:03.200
Let's now fix this over in our style sheet,

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.200
starting off with our section id of contact.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.675
Remember when it using a id,

00:03:08.675 --> 00:03:12.340
we tag this in the CSS by using a harsh.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:19.890
To begin, now, let's create a section of contact to us.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.520
We target a id by using the harsh.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.765
This is also going to make use of the display type of flex.

00:03:26.765 --> 00:03:29.360
We can make use of the flex box properties,

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.775
such as the flex direction.

00:03:31.775 --> 00:03:33.800
Since we started mobile first,

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.115
this is also going to be in the flex direction of column.

00:03:37.115 --> 00:03:41.920
We'll override this later on when we have more screen space available.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.585
Let's add some padding inside of our section of 1rem.

00:03:47.585 --> 00:03:50.240
Also just like we did with the header early on,

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:56.550
we can also set the height of our section to be 100 percent of the viewable height.

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.960
We can set a background color,

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.160
and this can be any color of your choice.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:08.065
I'm going to use the hex value of B1E2D7.

00:04:08.065 --> 00:04:12.210
Visual Studio Code also has built in a color picker.

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.335
If we hover over this,

00:04:14.335 --> 00:04:18.125
we can then select any different colors from the screen here.

00:04:18.125 --> 00:04:20.120
Or make use of the color pickers,

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.385
which we looked at earlier in the course.

00:04:22.385 --> 00:04:24.680
So this will set the background color.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.830
We can also set the color of our text to be white.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.475
Let's see how this is looking.

00:04:31.475 --> 00:04:33.100
Reload the browser.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.260
We have all full height contact section,

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.205
our background, and our white text.

00:04:39.205 --> 00:04:42.455
Let's now get to work with the text on the very top,

00:04:42.455 --> 00:04:46.340
starting off with the contact heading of don't be a stranger.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.685
These are the class of contact heading.

00:04:49.685 --> 00:04:53.680
Let's grab this and make use of this in the CSS.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.965
This is a class, so we use the dot.

00:04:56.965 --> 00:05:03.725
We're going to set the margin to be zero and then make the font size a lot larger.

00:05:03.725 --> 00:05:06.190
I'm going to go for five rems.

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:12.155
Reload. Next we're going to target our p elements within the p section.

00:05:12.155 --> 00:05:16.240
The section has the class of contact info.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.710
We can then select the p elements.

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.955
That's the font-size, b 1.4 rems.

00:05:23.955 --> 00:05:26.150
Then to add some space in between these,

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.750
we can add some margin to the bottom of each element.

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.675
Since we have a plenty of vertical space to play with,

00:05:32.675 --> 00:05:35.290
I'm going to set this to be three rems.

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.950
Save this and reload the browser.

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.695
Now this leaves us with a small problem.

00:05:40.695 --> 00:05:45.170
This is because we've targeted all of the p elements in this contact info.

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:48.355
This heading is also a p element too.

00:05:48.355 --> 00:05:52.070
We have a few different ways of how we can approach this.

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:57.275
We could change this first p elements to be a different element such as a heading.

00:05:57.275 --> 00:06:03.210
Or alternatively, we could add a new class such as contact text.

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.810
Let's also add this to our e-mail.

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.270
[inaudible] to save.

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:14.685
Change this to be a contact text. Save and reload.

00:06:14.685 --> 00:06:17.760
Now our project is as it's intended.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:22.130
The final thing to do is this contact section at the very bottom.

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:26.615
We're only going to display this elements when we have more screen space available.

00:06:26.615 --> 00:06:29.075
For now in the mobile first view,

00:06:29.075 --> 00:06:30.860
we're going to select this.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.605
This is the new contact section,

00:06:33.605 --> 00:06:36.395
the class of rotate.

00:06:36.395 --> 00:06:40.580
Then all we need to do is to set the display type to be none.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.780
This will remove this from our page.

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:47.885
We can reinstate this later on for the larger screen view

00:06:47.885 --> 00:06:52.235
by resetting the display type to be something such as block.

00:06:52.235 --> 00:06:55.790
We'll discover how to do this later on in the course.

00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:00.560
This is the styling that now complete for the small screen view.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:06.260
First of course, do feel free to make any changes suites your look and theme.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:10.880
In the next video, we're going to take a look at CSS media queries,

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:17.310
which will allow us to do apply different CSS rules for different sized screens.
