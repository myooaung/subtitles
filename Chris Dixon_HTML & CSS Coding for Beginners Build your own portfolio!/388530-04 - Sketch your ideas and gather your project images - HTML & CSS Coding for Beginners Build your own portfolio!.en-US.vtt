00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.674
Before going any further with this project,

00:00:03.674 --> 00:00:06.630
there is two approaches which you can take.

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.595
You can follow along with me,

00:00:08.595 --> 00:00:10.995
and build the exact same project.

00:00:10.995 --> 00:00:14.145
If you just want to learn HTML and CSS,

00:00:14.145 --> 00:00:16.695
and this is completely fine.

00:00:16.695 --> 00:00:20.400
Or if you are feeling a little bit more creative or

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.045
want to build a real portfolio which you're going to use,

00:00:24.045 --> 00:00:29.200
now is the time to gather everything which you'll need for your projects.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.240
This is going to be the portfolio which I'm going to be creating.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.935
It has a large header section with an introduction about ourselves.

00:00:37.935 --> 00:00:39.570
If we reload the page,

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.480
we also have some fading animations.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.865
We have some vertical texts.

00:00:44.865 --> 00:00:46.320
Then as we scrolling we see

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.865
some flip animations including a parallax image in the background.

00:00:50.865 --> 00:00:53.960
Further down, we have a recent work section,

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.590
which includes two rows with some contents containing

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.405
information about a previous project which you want to showcase.

00:01:01.405 --> 00:01:04.505
These also have some sliding animations too.

00:01:04.505 --> 00:01:09.680
We'll also learn about how to lay these out using Flexbox and some other techniques.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.815
Down at the bottom we have a contact to section,

00:01:12.815 --> 00:01:15.670
and the site is also fully responsive.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.870
If we shrink the browser down,

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.960
it's also looks good on different screen sizes.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:27.385
Also the content adjusts and changed the layout to suit the new screen size.

00:01:27.385 --> 00:01:29.840
If we go up to the top section,

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.700
we have some links.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.495
Let's go to our projects page.

00:01:34.495 --> 00:01:37.905
We have the same header for the top.

00:01:37.905 --> 00:01:42.275
Then we have some recent projects using the CSS grid layouts.

00:01:42.275 --> 00:01:44.540
Again, if we shrink this down,

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.944
this will also respond,

00:01:46.944 --> 00:01:50.920
and changed to suit the screen size.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.500
If you want to just follow along with me,

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.580
this is totally fine.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.060
If you just want to change your name and the images,

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.170
using this simply as a learning experience.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.745
If you are planning on customizing,

00:02:04.745 --> 00:02:10.220
it would be a good idea to create a sketch or a mock up of how you would like it to look.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.140
You will also need to gather together any images you will want to use too.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.130
I have provided the background image to use with this course,

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.360
which is the parallax background image from the homepage

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.110
but you will need to provide some images to use in the portfolio.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.975
If you don't have many projects to use,

00:02:29.975 --> 00:02:32.810
you can find some sample images which you want to

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.795
include or also reduce the amount of projects you want to showcase.

00:02:37.795 --> 00:02:40.880
Take a few moments to gather all of the images

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.215
and ideas which you will need for your project.

00:02:44.215 --> 00:02:47.705
It may also be a good idea to resize

00:02:47.705 --> 00:02:51.350
all of the portfolio images which you are going to use.

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.885
This will make the grid layout much easier later on in the course.

00:02:55.885 --> 00:03:00.005
Once you've finished, let's move on to the next video,

00:03:00.005 --> 00:03:03.930
where we're going to begin by creating the header section.
