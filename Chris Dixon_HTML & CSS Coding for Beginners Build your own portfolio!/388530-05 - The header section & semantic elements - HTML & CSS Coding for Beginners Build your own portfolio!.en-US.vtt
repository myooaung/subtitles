00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
Before HTML Version 5,

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.950
a typical thing that web developers used to do to layout our content on a page,

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.685
would be to create lots of different div sections to surround our areas or our content.

00:00:14.685 --> 00:00:18.660
For example, we will create a div for our header,

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.570
our main section, our footer,

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.600
and also maybe a sidebar too.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.800
To distinguish between each one of these divs or sections,

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.215
we would generally add a ID,

00:00:31.215 --> 00:00:35.225
as we see here, such as the header or the footer,

00:00:35.225 --> 00:00:39.355
so we knew that each one of these sections was different.

00:00:39.355 --> 00:00:42.815
Now, though, since HTML Version 5,

00:00:42.815 --> 00:00:47.105
we have many more semantic or descriptive elements we can use.

00:00:47.105 --> 00:00:50.800
Many of these are pretty self-explanatory.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.600
We have one such as the header,

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.870
the footer, a navigation.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.650
We also have a main section for the main piece for our content on the page.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.790
Related to this main section,

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.470
we have the aside,

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.059
which is typically used for things such as a sidebar.

00:01:11.059 --> 00:01:15.605
We can then add standalone sections of content,

00:01:15.605 --> 00:01:18.799
or we can also have things such as the article,

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:22.175
which is a self-contained piece of information,

00:01:22.175 --> 00:01:24.910
such as a news article.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:30.470
We'll make use of many of these semantic elements throughout this course,

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.120
starting in the next video,

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.490
where we'll take a look at the header and the nav.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.745
This is the final version of the project which we're going to build.

00:01:40.745 --> 00:01:45.845
I'm going to get to work in the body section by creating this header.

00:01:45.845 --> 00:01:48.920
This will give us a chance to also take a look at

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.070
some semantic elements which we just looked at.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.849
We can make use of the header as a wrapper for the section,

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:59.150
along we're also looking at the nav element too.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.410
Let's do this over in the body section of our project.

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.140
Remember, all of the content which we display in

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.250
the browser will go in between these tags.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.475
We can start with the header,

00:02:11.475 --> 00:02:15.145
which is going to wrap all of the gray section which we've just seen.

00:02:15.145 --> 00:02:18.945
Starting off with the nav links up at the top.

00:02:18.945 --> 00:02:22.880
Our navigation links is going to be a hedge in my list,

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.060
or more specifically, a unordered list,

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.540
which we can create using the ul element.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.005
An unordered list will simply output some list items,

00:02:34.005 --> 00:02:37.165
by default with the bullet points on the left.

00:02:37.165 --> 00:02:41.495
We also have a ordered list which we can use with the ol element.

00:02:41.495 --> 00:02:43.820
This will create a numbered list.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.140
Inside here, we add each one of our links with the li tag,

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.545
which is short for list item.

00:02:50.545 --> 00:02:52.740
We need to add a home,

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.915
and also the project's link.

00:02:55.915 --> 00:02:59.795
If we save this, we can now open this up in the browser.

00:02:59.795 --> 00:03:05.975
You can even go into your portfolio of projects and double-click on the index.html,

00:03:05.975 --> 00:03:08.815
which will open this up in the browser.

00:03:08.815 --> 00:03:13.490
Instead, we can go in Visual Studio Code over to the tab.

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.275
We can right-click, copy the path,

00:03:17.275 --> 00:03:20.745
and then paste this into the browser.

00:03:20.745 --> 00:03:24.620
We now have our two links up at the top.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.730
If we click on these, they don't link to any other pages.

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.895
To do this, we need to transform these into a link using the a element.

00:03:34.895 --> 00:03:41.595
Let's temporarily remove the text that's inside the a elements,

00:03:41.595 --> 00:03:44.070
and then paste this between the links.

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.285
Now, we need to tell the browser where we want to link to.

00:03:47.285 --> 00:03:50.680
We do this by adding the href attribute.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.620
This is a whole link,

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.885
and we're currently on the homepage.

00:03:54.885 --> 00:03:59.125
We want to link to the index.html.

00:03:59.125 --> 00:04:02.845
Let's do the same for all projects.

00:04:02.845 --> 00:04:05.430
Paste this text back in,

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.095
and then the href is going to go to our project's page.

00:04:09.095 --> 00:04:12.100
We haven't created our project file yet,

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.200
but we can add this in for later on.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.590
Save this file, and then,

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.040
over to the browser and reload.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.115
We now see that these are transformed into links.

00:04:24.115 --> 00:04:26.150
If we click on the projects,

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.340
we're taken over to the project.html,

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.350
which, of course, we haven't created just yet.

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.565
Click on the "Home", and we'll remain on the index page.

00:04:36.565 --> 00:04:40.060
Next, we need to add the text into our header.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.585
First of all, we have the heading of "Hi, I'm Chris",

00:04:43.585 --> 00:04:45.880
some simple text below,

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.030
and then our vertical text at the bottom.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.030
We can add this within the header section,

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.965
but just after the nav element.

00:04:54.965 --> 00:04:57.120
The text of "Hi, I'm Chris",

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.805
I'm going to add in a level one heading.

00:04:59.805 --> 00:05:06.095
HTML provides us with headings we can use from Level 1 through to Level 6.

00:05:06.095 --> 00:05:11.160
Level 1 is going to be the biggest and also the most important.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:16.160
The size and importance drops down as the number gets higher.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.560
Add the text for your project,

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.780
and then below this we have the regular text.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.540
We add regular text in the p element,

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.660
which stands for paragraph.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:34.199
I'm going to surround my text in the tilde icons which you can find on the keyboard,

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:38.810
and the text of, "I am a web developer and course creator."

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:47.035
The final part that we need to add is the text of "I make things",

00:05:47.035 --> 00:05:49.835
and this is going to be our vertical text.

00:05:49.835 --> 00:05:54.960
The vertical text though is not created using HTML.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.445
The HTML is simply there to add the content to our page.

00:05:59.445 --> 00:06:03.040
We're going to add this using a Level 3 heading.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:08.095
This will appear in the browser at the moment just as a regular horizontal text,

00:06:08.095 --> 00:06:11.720
and we'll change this later on with the CSS.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.080
Just after our paragraph on here,

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:22.290
on the next line, the Level 3 heading with the text of "I make things".

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.620
Save this file and over to our "Project" tab, reload.

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.485
The content is now on the screen.

00:06:30.485 --> 00:06:34.160
Since we've currently only added the HTML content,

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.105
our project doesn't look as good as the final version just yet.

00:06:38.105 --> 00:06:43.050
We're going to change this in the next video by adding a style sheet.
