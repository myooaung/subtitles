[Autogenerated] Hi, I'm Andrew Morgan.

2
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.250
On Welcome to define a module of the course Introduction to Spring Cloud

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.300
contracts in this module will be expanding on what we've already learned

4
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.740
by building masses driven Robin in Haiti,

5
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.920
tp drove and micro Services.

6
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:21.950
First of all,

7
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.120
we're going to give a high level overview of why message

8
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.630
driven micro services still benefit from,

9
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.840
if not require, consumer driven contract testing.

10
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.060
After explaining this,

11
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.090
motivation will then introduce how spring cloud

12
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.000
contract functions with messaging.

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.880
This will include using it to verify, weaken shame messages correctly,

14
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.540
that we produce messages correctly and that we are able to

15
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:55.000
implement the import output pattern. Why the consumption of one message can cause another to be produced.
