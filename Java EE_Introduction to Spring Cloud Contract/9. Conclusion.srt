00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:04,240
[Autogenerated] that covers it for this module.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,160
We've managed to learn how message driven micro services

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,390
still benefit from unarguably need.

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,940
Consumer driven contract testing.

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,280
This is mainly being defeated,

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,340
a Coplin introduce by shared schemers and channels.

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,590
We've also learned how we can use the spring cloud contract DSL to

8
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:24,980
model the sorts of masses driven interactions.

9
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,550
This hasn't been too hard as it's being more or less the same as what we were

10
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:34,040
doing with hate TTP on the consumer side of our interaction,

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,910
we've used a stop trigger to test it.

12
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,540
We consume the messages in our contract correctly.

13
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,440
Onda on the provider side,

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,100
we've generated Messi's based contract verification tests

15
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,040
on learned tell to make them pass to.

16
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,920
We've also implemented a temper output pattern where consuming

17
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,700
one message causes another to be produced.

18
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,870
Andi, That's it for the course we've made it on.

19
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:02,960
We finally managed to learn spring cloud contract going forward.

20
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,690
We should be able to use it to test our own JV M

21
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:12,000
based mocha service applications. Congrats
