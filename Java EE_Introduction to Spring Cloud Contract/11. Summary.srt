00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,580
[Autogenerated] So in this module we've achieved quite a lot

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:08,830
following freely entire consumer driven contract workflow and

3
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:11,590
to end whispering cloud contract.

4
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:15,060
Taking this Finn sliced view everything has helped us build a

5
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:18,880
foundational understanding of how we can use it to develop

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,490
hates DTP based micro services.

7
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:28,010
We've learned how to define a hate TTP based contract using a DSL unseen.

8
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:34,350
How expressive it is an easy to use even without any prayer groovy experience.

9
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,710
We've also learned how to generate stops using

10
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:39,330
spring cloud contract verifier on.

11
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:39,820
Also,

12
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,680
we've learned about why mark on how it is why mark stubbed wrappings that we

13
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,430
generate to execute our stops in the consumer side tests.

14
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:52,980
We've used a stub runner demonstrating how simpler is to use virus,

15
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,930
spring boo or two configuration.

16
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,640
And finally, we've used the spring cloud contract,

17
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,420
verify a maven plug in to create provider side tests to

18
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:09,000
verify that we can play of the contracts and both to provide a side on the consumer side
