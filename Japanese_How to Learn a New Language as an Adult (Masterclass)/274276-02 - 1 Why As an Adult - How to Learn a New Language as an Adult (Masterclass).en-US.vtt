00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.050
So why,

00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.010
as an adult,

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.670
why are we learning a new language?

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:06.270
Quote unquote as an adult?

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.070
Well,

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.770
first of all,

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:08.520
we're told,

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.610
ever since we're young,

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.290
our pretty much our whole lives that Children learn languages a lot more easily than adults

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:15.680
But is this really true?

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:14.290
.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:16.370
Well,

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.910
there's been quite a bit of literature and quite a few articles writing on this subject,

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:20.940
and a lot of people are saying,

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:21.150
Yes,

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.850
it's true.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:22.200
No,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.050
it's not true.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.930
Or many times it goes down into the nuances like it says,

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.150
that Children seem to pick up languages more easily.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.020
But then adults retain more of it.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.490
Or maybe that adults can learn languages just as well as Children.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.460
But Children are better with the accent and with pronunciation,

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:37.900
etcetera,

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:38.450
etcetera.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.060
My approach to this is that,

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.100
quite frankly,

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.900
adults and Children learn languages in two different ways.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.020
First of all,

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.270
Children don't even think of it as learning a new language.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.710
Usually,

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.630
when a child starts learning a new language,

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.040
it's just because this child is surrounded by that language,

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.450
has friends who speak that language,

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:57.460
has other adults,

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:03.390
says people around who are speaking this language and so It's not thought of as a school

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.600
subject or an endeavor,

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.070
but just that something that's happening almost naturally.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.220
However,

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.830
this doesn't mean that right away we should give up.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.800
Adults do have quite a few advantages.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.890
First of all,

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.160
we know why we're learning.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.540
If we decide to learn a language,

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.820
it's our decision and we decided to do it.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.090
And we know what our end goal is.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.480
And this is very important because Children don't have this.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.520
Second of all,

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.840
we know what we're getting wrong and right if we make a mistake,

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.970
as adults were very conscious about it and Ah,

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.550
and we'll notice because we have a teacher,

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.450
we have a textbook or we just know that we're making a mistake.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.190
And so we know that we have to correct it,

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.380
and this very often is not the case with Children.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.130
We also know how to improve on any mistake we make because we know where we can look it up

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.590
and how we can look it up and where we can find the solutions rather than having to rely on

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:52.880
somebody else to correct us.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.000
At some point we can correct ourselves,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.330
however,

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.780
obviously there quite a few descent.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.200
Disadvantages as well when we're learning as adults,

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.720
first of all is the mistakes.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.390
And I said,

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.600
we're conscious about our mistakes,

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.990
but that could be an issue as well.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.920
We are adults,

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.570
and we're used to making decisions were used to being correcting.

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.250
Our decisions were used to kind of having some control and knowing what we're doing most of

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.340
the time released,

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.880
trying to act like we know what we're doing most of the time.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.090
And Children tend to not have this issue.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.680
Children are told all the time.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.150
Oh,

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.710
do this,

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:24.300
do that.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.500
No,

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.110
that's wrong.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.750
That's right.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.980
Don't.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.220
You're gonna be punished.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.600
You're gonna be grounded.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.320
Whatever might be for making a mistake and so Children and have no problem a making

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.980
mistakes and be kind of laughing it off and laughing at themselves.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.120
Adults are really not good at that.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.650
At least we tend not to be we.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.440
Usually if we make a mistake,

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.430
we're embarrassed about it.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.110
And that means we don't want to make mistakes in the first place.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.090
And so we tend to be very tentative or not wanting to speak because we know where X is

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.570
gonna be off.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:52.590
We're going to use the wrong word,

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.940
etcetera,

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:53.390
etcetera.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:54.640
This is also a big reason,

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.090
by the way,

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.100
why people say it's easier to learn a language while drinking or Ah,

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.930
or partying.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.740
Or either way consuming alcohol or something along those lines,

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.880
because you basically have lowered your inhibitions,

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.050
and so you don't care as much about mistakes.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.820
We'll get into all of this later because actually making mistakes is a big part of learning

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:12.340
a language,

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.040
and so it deserves its own section.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.230
But here I just wanted to mention that this isn't disadvantage,

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.260
usually for adults.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.420
Second of all,

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.540
we don't usually get as much exposure as an adult.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.890
If we learn a language as an adult,

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.750
we already have friends who speak our native tongue.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.970
And so we're gonna keep speaking our native tongue to our friends,

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.880
to communicate for work or to,

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:33.180
ah,

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.640
research stuff online,

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.120
or to look at videos or to read books or whatever it might be while a child.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.890
Very often,

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.920
the reason that a child is learning a new language is because the child is being exposed to

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.680
a whole new culture country or,

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.040
you know,

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.200
set of people who speak that language.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.420
And so it's very easy for a child to just go to a playground and suddenly be surrounded by

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.150
people who speak a different language and just start using it right away.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.840
As adults,

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.740
we rarely are in this kind of situation,

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.550
even if we're surrounded by people who speak a foreign language,

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.540
we still want to rely on our dictionary or,

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.870
you know something are trying to find someone who speaks our language or something along

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:12.610
those lines.

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:18.150
And lastly will last in terms of this advantages,

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.050
there plenty other ones.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:22.950
But last of the main disadvantages that we can have as an adult is our method of learning

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.230
if you think about it.

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:25.050
Most Children,

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.850
they start learning,

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:26.730
as I mentioned,

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:27.110
say,

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.760
on the playground or talking to other people.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:30.950
But most adults,

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:36.310
we learn through our textbook or our teacher starts teaching us vocab or how to write or

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.860
grammar.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:37.490
In other words,

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.100
we learn through writing and reading,

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.490
while Children tend to learn through speaking and listening.

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.120
Now we'll get to all the different components of language learning later on.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.810
But these are two very different methods for learning a language and because of this we

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.670
have a very different way of learning.

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:59.710
And many times when it seems like Children are making a lot of progress because they can

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.790
see a few words or few sentences.

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:05.720
This doesn't necessarily mean that they speak it that much better than adults,

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.360
who in the meantime have been learning a bunch of grammar and vocab but can't really

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.530
express themselves that well.

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.740
It's just a different method of learning that adults have been concentrating on the

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.790
textbooks and on the text itself,

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.220
while the Children have been speaking on the playground.
