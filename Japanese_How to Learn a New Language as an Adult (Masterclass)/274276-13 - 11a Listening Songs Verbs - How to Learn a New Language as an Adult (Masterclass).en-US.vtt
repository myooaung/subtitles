00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.020
There's also another interesting aspect about learning songs,

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.900
but this only applies to learners who are a bit more advanced because it has to do with

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:09.700
verbs.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.070
Now.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.560
I learned this,

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:10.820
actually,

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:11.450
for my mother,

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.240
who's an Italian teacher,

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.840
has been an Italian teacher for about,

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:15.350
I think,

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:16.380
more than 20 years,

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:17.350
definitely anyway.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.390
And she for some of her classes.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.750
She likes to use songs a lot because it really helps with learning the verb tenses.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:25.840
And she pointed this out to me,

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:26.360
and I've noticed,

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.800
is for several languages now.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.550
Usually,

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.210
if a song is singing,

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:31.530
say,

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.890
in the past tense or the past perfect or whatever tense it might be of a song,

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.910
it stays the same tents throughout the whole song.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.170
So if you're trying to learn verb tenses,

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.350
especially in some of these dramatic and romance languages that convey quite difficult,

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:48.850
then songs can be,

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:49.170
ah,

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.150
great place to learn them because they'll if they used to say the in perfetto in Italian,

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.490
they'll be using it throughout the whole song.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.980
And so we get to hear it applied to many different types of verbs.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.310
So try this,

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.410
especially verb tenses.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.120
An issue with the language that you're learning.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.270
It could be very useful to try to listen to songs and try to catch what the verb tenses

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.950
first of all,

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.140
and then try to see how it applies to all the different verbs being used throughout the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.550
song.
