00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.950
However,

00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:04.790
I highly suggest that when you plan on using language,

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.340
so if you know that you're going to travel to a certain country where they speak the

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.680
language or you know you're going to have to use it for a conversation or for business or

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:13.010
whatever,

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.130
it might be not to rely just on the trigger,

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:15.700
Sentence says.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:16.020
In fact,

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.400
what I usually do is if I know I'm going to travel,

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.590
say,

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.890
to Germany or Korea or someplace like that.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.510
I have a regimen that I put in place now this will depend on the level of my language.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.940
But what I try to do is I try to set a schedule ahead of time.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:29.530
For example,

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.110
if I'm going to Germany,

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.720
I will decide,

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.880
say,

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.300
a month ahead of time that I will start easing myself into German.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.120
So what does this mean?

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.910
This means that I'll start off light and this usually entails finding some music in German

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.910
,

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.340
maybe listening to a little bit of German radio online and stuff like that for a few days

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.060
during that time.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:52.160
Also search for some podcasts and I'll start using those and slowly but surely I'll start

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.850
easing into maybe reading a couple articles online and maybe finding some online courses or

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.660
something like that so I can ease myself back into German.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.620
So hopefully by the time I get there,

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.960
my German level is pretty much where I left off.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.140
Last time I studied it.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.020
I also have some old German textbooks that I can start looking over,

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.330
and I try to create a schedule so that by the time I go there,

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.050
everything is pretty much all set.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.530
I went to Germany recently and that was what I did.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:22.260
And in fact,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.630
before heading there,

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.590
I decided to call the restaurants I knew we wanted to go to and what not ahead of time

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.640
cycle practice,

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.450
using German a bit before we actually got to Germany.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.080
And so I called to reserve our restaurants and stuff like that just so I could start using

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.200
it and I suggest you do something similar.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.340
When I go to Korea,

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.180
I do the same thing.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.010
I start listening to some of the music and then the podcasts,

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.870
and I have my old Korean textbooks as well as my flashcards,

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.610
and I tried to look over and review what I have already studied,

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:56.160
so I can hopefully end up at exactly the level where I left off last time so I can hit the

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.680
ground running,

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.250
so to speak,

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.770
once I arrive in Korea.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:59.400
In fact,

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.320
maybe I could even advanced a little bit.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.630
I also do this by looking over past courses and videos and lectures and classes that I've

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:08.810
taken that are online,

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:09.900
and I try to,

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.050
especially toward the end,

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.370
speed them up a little bit because this is a review,

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.340
and so I should be able to speed through it once I get the language back into me and once I

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.290
get used to it again.
