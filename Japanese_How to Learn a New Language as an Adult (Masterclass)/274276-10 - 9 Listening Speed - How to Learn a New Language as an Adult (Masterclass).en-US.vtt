00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.820
Now.

00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:02.010
What about Speed?

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.760
A zai mentioned when people speak in,

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:05.420
ah,

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:06.110
their normal tongue.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:07.330
Very often it's very fast.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:07.820
In fact,

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:13.010
if you if you're taking a course and you hear the teacher speak to students or you here ah

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:13.010
,

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:14.150
you hear dialogue,

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.520
that's,

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.060
um,

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.470
that's done.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:16.880
As you know,

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.410
it is an example or something like that.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.600
It's usually very slow compared to the normal speed people use when they speak.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.130
And a good example is cartoons.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.000
Cartoons tend to have slower audio,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.950
and they get.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.400
They tend to speak a bit more slowly and more simply.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.780
They'll use simpler vocab and stuff like that.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.400
So if you're first starting out with the language,

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.070
that's why very often you start with shows like cartoons because they are slower,

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:40.720
more simple.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.060
Ah,

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.760
thing that I would recommend is being careful with cartoons.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.790
If you watch cartoons tryto watch cartoons that are from the country itself,

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.610
and not that have been dubbed into that language because unfortunately,

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.920
it happens quite often with cartoons and also with comic books that they are translated

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.360
from another language and translated somewhat badly and because not much thought has gone

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.500
into it or something like that,

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.250
and so it's kept very simple,

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.840
but sometimes it's done sort of badly or incorrectly,

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.190
and so that could be an issue.

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.200
Sometimes eso trying to go for cartoons that are from that country,

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.560
if you can.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.080
I mean,

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.270
if you can.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.940
Otherwise,

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.210
any type of cartoon is better than nothing.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.090
And once again you get a bit more simpler World Cup So it's easier to listen to now.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.220
On the other side of the spectrum,

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:28.530
however,

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.490
there's the news.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.880
In my experience,

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:31.240
at least,

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.550
the news is usually the fastest and most complicated type of language to listen to in any

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:38.110
language.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.740
In fact,

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.230
very often it's people's goal in a certain language,

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:46.890
to be able to follow the news and to be able to follow it in real time and the way it's

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.080
being spoken and be able to understand everything that's being said precisely because of

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.350
that,

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.440
the newest will end up talking about,

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.670
you know,

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.130
economic sanctions or certain standards of living,

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.100
or this ah,

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.170
GDP of that and ah,

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.170
certain other governmental structures of this other thing.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.390
I mean,

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.710
it's not simple stuff,

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.540
it's quite complicated,

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.650
and they usually race through it.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.810
So keep this in mind when you're following certain different types of audios and other

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:12.350
things.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.130
And don't forget that you can always slow down or speed up any pretty much any audio these

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.400
days.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.430
Any time you're listening to an audiobook or to a podcast or watching video,

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.050
see on YouTube or even here on you.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.460
To me,

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.830
you can make the audio slower or faster,

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.310
depending on ah,

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.190
on your level of understanding.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.220
And so keep this in mind if you're watching cartoons and it's a bit too simple than speed

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.430
it up a bit if you're watching the news and it's too complicated and slowed down of it,

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.030
and I do this quite often.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.420
In fact,

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.590
if I'm watching TV shows,

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.270
I need to slow it down a little bit because it's too fast for me or if I'm following a

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.470
class and maybe I find it a bit too easy.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.460
I tried to Ah,

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.180
in fact,

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.980
with most classes.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.000
What I tried to do is by the end of the semester from doing an online class by the end of

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
whatever online classes of semester,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.950
whatever you want to call it,

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.300
I try to see if I can speed up the video that they give us just to see if I've been able to

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.550
learn enough to listen to it a bit more quickly.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:12.560
Another aspect you should not neglect is dictations now.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.160
I haven't seen much of these,

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.870
let's say,

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.790
in recent years since I left school.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.770
But I think that could be quite useful.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.810
And especially if you have something like a private tutor.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.950
This might be something you want to ask them if they can help you out with or if they could

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.760
just give you dictations.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.150
And ah,

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.560
obviously this entails the teacher,

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.050
the tutor,

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.590
someone reading something out and you write it out.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.510
So this also has to do with writing.

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.300
But the main thing is,

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.940
you need to understand what's being said.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:39.860
Word for word,

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:40.420
which,

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.970
um,

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:41.240
you know,

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.660
goes a lot more than the gist.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.460
And if you're able to follow a dictation,

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:46.990
actually write down what's being said,

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.130
then you no,

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.950
that text released what's being said.

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.420
You know it inside it out,

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.800
and it's a good way of testing yourself as well
