00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:06.915
Okay, so here I wanted to talk a bit more about a translation of words.

00:00:06.915 --> 00:00:09.270
It's been said before that there's no such thing

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.850
as a real and true synonym because different words,

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.190
even though they can be a synonym of each other,

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.340
they're used in different situations with different connotations, et cetera, et cetera.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.970
And this is all the more so true when you have translations.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.600
So I wanted to show this with an example here.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.265
It'll be between Italian and English.

00:00:26.265 --> 00:00:28.830
I'm gonna use Google Translate just because it's easiest,

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.030
by the way, as a quick side note,

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.165
I should mention as a translator,

00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:35.580
using Google Translate can have quite a few problems.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.115
It's gotten quite a bit better recently in terms of translating things.

00:00:39.115 --> 00:00:40.910
But there are a lot of issues that in fact they have

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.700
a whole course on free lunch translation where I talk about all the issues.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.260
I won't get into it too much now.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.910
But just to know that by the way,

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.620
if you are translating anything that's

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.500
private or confidential or anything along those lines,

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.660
it can be very dangerous to use Google Translate

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.940
because the way it weren't Google doesn't translate anything.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.160
All it does is learned from texts that you input into this section here,

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.300
which means that it has ownership or at least it has access to any text you put in here.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.800
So if you do put confidential contracts are financials information like that.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.345
If you just copy it into IR,

00:01:11.345 --> 00:01:12.950
it's accessible by Google.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.135
So just something to keep in mind.

00:01:14.135 --> 00:01:15.845
Anyway, let's get into this.

00:01:15.845 --> 00:01:18.620
There are a couple of things that while they might

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.230
seem like a direct translation and seem easy enough,

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.655
they can constitute an issue.

00:01:22.655 --> 00:01:25.895
So one that's simple between Italian and English is this one here?

00:01:25.895 --> 00:01:31.025
Let's do but soon, uh, no smart person.

00:01:31.025 --> 00:01:34.130
So and this, this translation is correct by the way,

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.065
there's no, there's no problem with it.

00:01:36.065 --> 00:01:37.520
And I can attest to that,

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.175
that bits don't have photo bomb means smart person.

00:01:40.175 --> 00:01:42.380
But let's, let's do something interesting here.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.015
Let's take smart person and let's put it under Google images and see what pops up.

00:01:47.015 --> 00:01:48.410
We have Einstein, Einstein,

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.220
Einstein had in some other examples.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.095
But anyway, it's a very clear you can tell what's meant by smart person.

00:01:57.095 --> 00:01:59.030
You have, you know, the glass is,

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.410
you have the light bulb,

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.420
you have Einstein, you have all these things.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.830
Ok, smart person.

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.335
Now let's take persona for TBA.

00:02:06.335 --> 00:02:09.965
And let's do a Google image search for this and see what happens.

00:02:09.965 --> 00:02:12.110
Now right away we don't see Einstein,

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.420
but look what we do sinc, we see Fox.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.685
But so many foxes here.

00:02:16.685 --> 00:02:19.115
We see a fox and other fox and other FOX.

00:02:19.115 --> 00:02:20.750
So what's going on? Why?

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.030
And here we see, I mean,

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.970
I'm not sure how these could be smart people.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.980
And this May 1 be,

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.185
but the other ones, like it's a bit odd.

00:02:30.185 --> 00:02:31.460
And so what's going on here?

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.725
Well, the fact is while,

00:02:33.725 --> 00:02:37.010
but soon I fooled about means smart person and at time the connotation

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.300
here is actually someone who is smart,

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.220
but, well, think about it.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.155
What connotation does a fox have?

00:02:45.155 --> 00:02:46.640
Not necessarily being smart,

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.250
but being very sly, kind of sneaky.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.295
And that's exactly the connotation of persona fooled about hats.

00:02:52.295 --> 00:02:56.510
So while the translation is smart person is usually used as a derogation,

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.985
it's used almost to insult someone or, you know,

00:02:58.985 --> 00:03:00.950
to kind of talk behind their back,

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.675
as in that person is smart,

00:03:02.675 --> 00:03:04.675
but they're actually quite SLI,

00:03:04.675 --> 00:03:05.870
someone who can't be trusted,

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.350
someone who's sneaky, like a fox, someone who's SLI.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.200
And, and, so that's why,

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.910
and that's just a quick example.

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.085
Let's do another one that might be interesting.

00:03:16.085 --> 00:03:19.580
You take, that's how the coffee cup of coffee,

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.110
that's all that means.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.115
Now look at.

00:03:22.115 --> 00:03:24.170
What you have when you have that City Cafe,

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.840
which means cup of coffee here in case you don't believe me,

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.000
I can ask, although their cup of coffee there we go, right.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.310
With a check mark, so everything's fine.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.895
Now, he here, there's something interesting though.

00:03:37.895 --> 00:03:40.835
Here you see one espresso to express those.

00:03:40.835 --> 00:03:42.725
These I guess aren't expressed those.

00:03:42.725 --> 00:03:46.835
But here's definitely another espresso and other espresso, espresso, espresso.

00:03:46.835 --> 00:03:49.370
So close to 50% of these are espresso.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:50.945
This isn't espresso machine.

00:03:50.945 --> 00:03:53.165
And so you say cup of coffee,

00:03:53.165 --> 00:03:56.075
you have a lot of espresso is here.

00:03:56.075 --> 00:04:00.870
Now let's do this in English, cup of coffee.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.250
I count.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.430
These might be espresso is,

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.230
but they look a bit full to be expressed those,

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.435
but otherwise I count 0 expressed those.

00:04:13.435 --> 00:04:15.370
Maybe this because he can't really tell,

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.560
although it looks like it was full up to the brim.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.720
But here, right above the fold,

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.699
I don't see any espresso.

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:24.070
And here too, it's a big difference.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.530
That's the cafe means cup of coffee.

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.405
But if you ordered that's at the cafe in Italy,

00:04:28.405 --> 00:04:30.565
more often than not, you'll get an espresso.

00:04:30.565 --> 00:04:32.935
And so once again,

00:04:32.935 --> 00:04:37.165
this is just something to keep in mind when you do find translations,

00:04:37.165 --> 00:04:40.045
whether they be from something like Google translate

00:04:40.045 --> 00:04:43.525
to something like even the dictionary.

00:04:43.525 --> 00:04:46.390
You still need to keep in mind the different connotations.

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.405
And the best way to do this is to see how they're being used by the locals.

00:04:50.405 --> 00:04:52.670
And so anytime you do here an example,

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.665
and here's something being used in a sentence.

00:04:54.665 --> 00:04:57.245
Remember how it was used and what type of sentence.

00:04:57.245 --> 00:05:01.040
And so just be careful about this when you're using it.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.150
And by the way,

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:03.995
this also ties into another warning.

00:05:03.995 --> 00:05:10.580
Be very careful when you're making jokes and using vulgar or curse words.

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.815
In fact, as I mentioned before, do not.

00:05:12.815 --> 00:05:14.750
It's best just to avoid curse words,

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:20.930
avoid vulgar things all the time because these are very, even if, you know,

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.010
it's okay to use it,

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.070
say among friends and in a certain situation in

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.030
your native tongue and another language that can be very different.

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.100
So always be very careful about those.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.560
And as you can see, connotation situations,

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.135
they can all be very different.

00:05:35.135 --> 00:05:38.120
And look, all of these examples are between Italian and English,

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.460
which let's face it are not too dissimilar.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.990
You know, they have quite a few words and issues in common.

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.680
So imagine how different it can be between other languages.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.555
So just something to keep in mind.

00:05:50.555 --> 00:05:52.865
And in fact, anytime you learn a new word,

00:05:52.865 --> 00:05:55.610
it can be very interesting to do a Google image search

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.090
between that word in your native tongue and in your target language,

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:00.980
and try to see what the differences are.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.670
And that can sometimes give an idea as to how people view things

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:08.675
differently depending on what the word or the phrase is.

00:06:08.675 --> 00:06:13.250
And can kinda give you an idea as to how people see things differently.

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.910
And in fact, even the examples I give here might be interesting to see

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.495
because I realize I'm using Google image in Italian.

00:06:20.495 --> 00:06:23.480
So if I use the Google in English,

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.800
maybe it has something different.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.260
And in fact, I'm located now physically in Taiwan,

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.645
so I don't know if that has any effect on the results.

00:06:29.645 --> 00:06:33.780
So feel free to do the same thing and see what pops up when you try it.

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:46.670
By the way, just to kind of highlight the issues with Google Translate,

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:50.255
here's something else interesting you can do between Italian and English.

00:06:50.255 --> 00:06:52.565
Here if you have dd.

00:06:52.565 --> 00:06:59.090
So she veto vetoes civil right, which is correct.

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:03.485
And also here you have desktop era, which has right.

00:07:03.485 --> 00:07:05.180
Obviously these are two different rights.

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:06.380
So that makes sense.

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:09.785
One is the right as a civil right and the other one is desktop.

00:07:09.785 --> 00:07:11.315
But here's something interesting.

00:07:11.315 --> 00:07:15.125
When I, when I clicked here and did ito it has right as a civil right,

00:07:15.125 --> 00:07:17.089
but also has straight.

00:07:17.089 --> 00:07:19.025
Now why is that?

00:07:19.025 --> 00:07:22.490
Well, because if you remember,

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.230
the astra means right.

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:30.600
But straight is did ETOH.

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:37.369
But didn't we just have the DAW as right?

00:07:37.369 --> 00:07:40.775
So straight is DD, Toba is right.

00:07:40.775 --> 00:07:42.080
So what's going on here?

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.780
Well, I mean, if this doesn't get you confused,

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.280
I don't know what will but, you know,

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.680
that's some of the issues with translation.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:49.820
And unfortunately also, yes,

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:53.210
some of the issues with Google Translate because you don't know very

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:56.600
often which right is referring to or which did eat though it's referring to.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.490
And so sometimes things can get confusing.

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:01.170
Anyway, end parenthesis.
