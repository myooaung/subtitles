00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
so the first thing you should do is decide on your goal.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.660
If you worked on the previous section,

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.090
then you've pretty much already done that.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:08.800
But regardless,

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.480
even if you have done it or if you already know which language you want to learn,

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.410
you should decide upon your goal for this language because they're very many different

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.330
types of goals.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.140
If you want to learn the new language,

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.130
why do you want to learn it?

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.400
What is your ultimate goal?

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.230
And in this sense,

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.830
you should try to picture yourself.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.270
Picture success.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.770
Picture yourself being successful at whatever your endeavor is in learning this new

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:34.280
language.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.940
So what?

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.450
What does success look like?

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.400
Does it look like hang out with a bunch of friends and speaking in that tongue?

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.780
Does it?

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.430
Are you trying to learn a new language?

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:43.420
Maybe you're trying to learn,

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.130
say Spanish so you can read bore heads or Isabel Allende and the original.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.950
Or maybe you're trying to learn Chinese so you can conduct business in Chinese.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.200
Or maybe you're just traveling to a certain country.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.010
You want to learn enough of language to be able to travel without any issues.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.750
Maybe you want to be able to hold the conversationally evening.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.070
Maybe you want to.

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.510
I don't know.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.880
It could be any one of these or obviously any other.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.620
Whatever success looks like to you,

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.450
try to picture it in your mind.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.600
Try to picture yourself being successful in using the language the way you would like to

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.960
use it,

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.050
and this will give you an idea on your goal.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.730
And once you've done this,

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.350
try to break this gold down.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.550
So,

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:24.190
for example,

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.860
if your goal is hey,

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.370
I want to be able to hang out and hang out all evening with people in the in.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:31.980
Speak Chinese to them,

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:32.340
right?

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.880
That's my goal.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.240
With learning Chinese to be ableto hang out and have a conversation all evening over dinner

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.430
and Chinese Great.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.650
Can you break this goal into intermediate goals into smaller goals?

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.710
So instead of all evening,

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.340
let's say I want to be able to have a conversation for five minutes back and forth in

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.770
Chinese and be able to do that,

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.770
be understood and be able to understand everything.

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.990
And once you've done that,

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.510
tried to break it down even more say okay,

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.070
I want to be able to,

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.570
you know,

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.280
have a back and forth like I asked the question.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.010
Get a response,

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.930
Ask another question,

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:01.850
get a response or,

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:02.030
you know,

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.140
maybe have a question as to me and give a response.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.790
And that would be another breaking down of your goal.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.060
And once you've done that,

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.710
tried to break it down even more.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.200
Maybe you want to be able to ask a question and get a response and understand that.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.200
So in other words,

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.360
what I'm getting at is trying to break down.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.070
Whatever your goal,

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.320
whatever success is for you tried to break it down into smaller,

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.660
more manageable goals.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.360
Because what you can do then is try to achieve these smaller,

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.320
more manageable goals.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.290
And once you've achieved one,

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.830
then you can go on to the next and then to the next and then to the next.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:32.880
And before you know it,

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.550
you'll be successful and you'll have attained success.

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.730
Also,

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.690
you should keep in mind when you're setting these first goals to kind of set a range.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.230
Uh,

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.030
you don't want to be too precise,

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.480
you know,

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.230
if you decided that because of your goal,

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.990
you need to learn,

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.550
say,

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.800
50 new words a week.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.700
Make it say 30 to 50 new words,

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.350
because when you're setting up your system and when you're making your flash cars or

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.360
whatever might be for learning new vocab at the beginning Now you have no clue,

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.500
and you don't know how good or bad you're gonna be at it.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.550
So if you can,

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:07.870
especially for the first goals,

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.710
because later you can revisit that the next goals in the whole plan by the first goals try

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.960
to set a bit of a range because you don't know if you're gonna be on the lower end of that

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.090
range of the higher end.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.580
And so,

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:17.530
until you get an idea,

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.520
you're kind of gonna want a range once again.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.240
I'm gonna go through this more in detail later on when I go through my personal system that

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.830
I recommend.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:25.340
But for now,

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.260
I just want to touch upon the main aspects of learning a new language and how to go about

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.400
it.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.680
I should also mention that when I say you want to picture success and what your goals are,

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.640
this does not mean that you can skip parts of a language.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.080
As I mentioned before,

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.630
language consists in reading and writing and as well,

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:45.790
a speaking and listening.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.780
And just because you decide you want to be able to say,

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.920
speak Chinese with a bunch of people doesn't mean you can neglect the written language

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:53.670
altogether.

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.760
This is for various reasons which will get into later.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.760
And obviously,

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.140
once you've learned,

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.590
say,

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.440
the introductory level or an elementary level of reading language,

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.370
you can then concentrate a lot more onto the spoken language.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:07.250
If that's the case,

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.880
you should still learn a little bit at the beginning and not just neglected altogether.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.780
There are no real short cuts in that sense when you want to learn a new language.

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.330
And while you may be able to say sentences back and forth and you may even be able to hold

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.750
a conversation without learning any of the written language,

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.560
chances are you won't nearly get enough out of it,

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.510
and you won't be able to continue that conversation any longer than X amount without at

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.290
least having looked at the written language and understood it a little bit
