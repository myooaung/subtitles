00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920
now awarded to about flashcards.

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:02.400
First of all,

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.400
when you first start out,

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.730
you're not sure how it's going to go.

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.990
And so I usually recommend setting arrange for flashcards and in terms of memorizing new

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.720
vocab words,

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:13.230
etcetera.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.750
Because if you say I want to learn 50 vocab words per week,

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:17.890
you might fall a bit short.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:18.270
Likewise,

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.750
if you say I want to learn 30 that might be a bit too easy.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.280
So if you give yourself range of,

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:22.460
say,

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:23.490
30 to 50 I mean,

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.590
these were just rounded numbers,

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.020
but say 30 to 50 vocal boards per week.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.400
Then you can see after a couple weeks,

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.300
whether you usually end up on the low end of this or on the high end,

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.810
and you can adjust accordingly.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.110
And so give yourself sort of arranged to work with at least the beginning until you get

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.650
used to it.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.370
You should also try to be smart about flashcards.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:43.540
Now,

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:44.450
I've already covered this,

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.690
and this basically means that you don't have to look up every single word.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.870
You don't have to write down every single new word you come across,

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.110
especially at the beginning where you're going to come across very many new words,

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.110
So try to be a bit smart about this.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.000
As I mentioned,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.140
if you come across words that very often,

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.550
or you've become across words that you can tell are very important,

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.130
then you can write these down.

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:09.060
But you don't want to risk inundating yourself with way too many flash cards,

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.930
and you can handle.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.880
So try to get a feel for how many you can handle and what's and what works for you when

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.470
you're dealing with flash cards and not just go overboard as often is the case,

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.810
and many times people just start writing down any new word they come up with and they can't

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:23.210
keep up,

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.530
and they don't memorize them at all,

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.400
in which case of flash cards don't do much good.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.390
Now,

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.780
Anke Droid is an app that is,

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:31.080
Ah,

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.080
it's basically a flashcard app that you can use on your phone,

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.170
and it's a very useful I tend to recommend to make this a habit for your spare time,

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.310
though once again this ties into the fact that it doesn't let you write out the vocab.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:44.190
You can type it,

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.890
obviously,

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.480
but it's a lot better if you can write it down the old fashioned way.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.090
I still use Anke Droid,

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.460
and I think it is very useful.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.920
And I think when you are traveling or in your spare time or something is,

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.280
ah,

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.340
great that you can just whip out your phone and start looking at flashcards.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.930
So it's definitely something extra,

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.850
but I wouldn't make it my main source of flashcards.
