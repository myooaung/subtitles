00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.820
So as for the reading component,

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:05.500
there are obviously many ways that you can practice your reading and that you can get

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.210
reading done.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.790
You can keep a notebook,

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.880
and this lets you read all the notes that you write down.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.430
The same goes with shopping lists,

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:18.440
especially if you shop for more or less the same things every week that you start getting

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.620
used to reading all the same types of food or other things need to buying.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.240
This could be quite helpful there also many online games.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.010
Ah,

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.090
then you confined usually whichever language you're studying.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.850
If you can find all in games of that language that really helps with reading,

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.770
you can change your computer,

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.960
your phone to the target language to the language that you're learning so you can go under

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.490
settings in your phone or tablet or computer and change it so that everything changes into

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:46.240
that language.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.290
I wouldn't recommend this if you're just starting out because you might not understand what

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.020
you're looking for and then get quite lost in your phone and not access to the stuff you

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.350
need.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.870
But after a certain point,

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.850
it can be very useful and helpful.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.910
You can also find Children's books or adult books.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:03.610
Ah,

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.110
that are in whatever language you're learning,

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.340
and this will depend on your level as well.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.990
And just remember,

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.140
with obviously Children,

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.310
books or more simple adult books tend to be more complicated.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.050
Unfortunately,

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.900
many times Children books are just not interesting for adults to read.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.620
So what you can do if you're not ready to read adult books yet is to try to find comics

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.330
that are maybe geared more towards older young adults or even adults.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.470
You confined very often historical or political type of cartoons or comics,

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.130
I should say,

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.530
and ah,

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.270
and these types of comics tend to have more of an adult seem but are still written in a way

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.450
that's they have less text,

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.660
and it's more simple than pure books.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:52.070
You can obviously follow people online who speak whatever language you're learning.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.720
This is on Twitter,

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.350
on Facebook or anywhere else.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:00.060
You can also find a pen Pau Pen pal could be these days.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.300
They tend to be online over email or else the old fashioned way,

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.340
where you actually have to write down whatever words you're writing.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.100
Either one can be very helpful in terms of reading and also in terms of writing.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.650
Obviously,

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:14.790
flashcards once again are very helpful.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.540
I usually recommend writing down flashcards,

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.900
however,

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.920
in terms of reading they,

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.560
whether they're written down already for you or you write them down yourself or type them

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.520
up or whatever it might be,

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.180
they obviously help for reading as well.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.050
And so flashcards can be quite useful.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.340
And once again,

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.450
this list is absolutely not exhaustive.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.700
There many other places where you can practice your reading,

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.720
and this can go from anywhere you know,

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.290
slogans and road signs to your textbook to whatever else that might be.
