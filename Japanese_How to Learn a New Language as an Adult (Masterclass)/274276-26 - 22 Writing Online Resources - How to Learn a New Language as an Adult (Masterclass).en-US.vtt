00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700
now I should talk about online.

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.350
Resource is because I mentioned a couple,

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:05.100
and I'm sure you come across quite a few.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:05.940
Ah,

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.980
you should beware of these because a lot of the options for online resource is,

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.730
and a lot of the options I just mentioned for the writing component involved not writing

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:15.540
but typing.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.350
And you should be careful about this because typing can be very different from writing now

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:20.350
.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.310
This depends on the language you learn.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.250
If the language use the same alphabet that you're used to,

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.070
then there's not that much difference.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.690
So say,

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.960
if you speak English and you're learning Spanish,

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.920
then chances are you'll be typing using the same alphabet.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.580
Every now and then.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.680
There are some differences.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.340
As you know,

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.090
there's some letters that exist in some don't exist,

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.220
and also you have the various different accents until does and stuff like that.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.880
And this applies.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:43.480
If you're learning.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.870
Most say European Western European languages,

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:47.720
then the alphabet.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:48.580
It's more or less the same,

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:49.440
however,

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.560
if you're learning other languages that involve different alphabets,

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.490
say you use the Roman alphabet for your own language,

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:00.080
but you're learning a language with the Cyrillic alphabet or the Korean or Japanese

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.230
alphabets or cilla Berries or with Chinese characters,

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:03.530
say,

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.610
or Arabic or something along those lines,

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.310
then you should be aware of online resource is because typing is very different from

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.720
writing,

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.350
and especially at the beginning,

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.380
you should concentrate more on writing out stuff.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.950
Using a pen and paper.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.100
It might sound old fashioned,

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.530
and it might sound something that's not done much these days,

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.490
and that's true.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.850
Very often.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.110
When you go travel to these countries,

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.750
very few people are using pen and paper,

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.710
and they're all typing on their phones or on the computer.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.180
But it still helps when you're first starting out to actually write these out.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.760
So this applies for all the stuff that you're doing online or on the phone.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.760
And when you're when you find yourself typing rather than writing,

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.260
see if you can find an alternative that allows you to write down with pen and paper because

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.230
this will help make the alphabet or the characters or whatever you might be learning,

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:52.550
stick that much more
