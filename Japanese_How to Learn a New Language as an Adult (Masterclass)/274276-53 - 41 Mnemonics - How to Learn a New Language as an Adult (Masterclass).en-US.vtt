00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.050
so pneumonic snow Study of language learning is complete without no Monix.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.240
You hear this a lot When it comes to language learning,

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.150
you'll also hear terms like Memory Palace and stuff like that,

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.410
which makes it sound a bit more fancy.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.920
Um,

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:13.270
of course,

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:14.970
Memory Palace is a type of no Monix,

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.050
and it's a very interesting type.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.820
But,

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:18.400
um,

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.680
just briefly no Monix,

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.300
what are they?

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.750
Chances are you've come across them yourself,

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.380
and any time if you're an English speaker or if you're in the States say you've probably

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.890
heard,

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:28.960
Ah,

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.510
in 14 92 Columbus sailed the ocean blue.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:37.850
That's the type of pneumonic and and pneumonic is any type of system in order to recall

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.000
whatever it might be,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.310
you know,

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.150
a set of figures instead of numbers instead of vocab or anything like that.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.440
When it comes to language learning,

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.600
it's usually used for either vocab or grammatical rules or stuff along those lines.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.030
Another example I've come across is many times because the color gray can be spelled with

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.220
an A or an E,

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.600
and so how do you know which one to use well in England,

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.750
use an E E for England while in America using a A for America.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.270
That's a simple way to remember.

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.090
Great and great if you by the way,

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.100
any of you musical people there if you study music than probably something like every good

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.830
boy deserves fruit sounds familiar to you.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.770
All of these are pneumonic devices,

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.580
and they help you memorize something.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.740
They make it more simple for you to memorize something I'm not gonna go into detail about.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.820
No,

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:21.190
Monix,

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.390
but I wanted to cover more or less what it is,

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.080
and,

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.360
uh,

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.840
and how it could be used for language learning.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.380
First of all,

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.540
it should be personal.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.050
Now,

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.800
a lot of these work,

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.080
because they're very easy.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:37.180
And you know these little things that you say in 14 92 Columbus sailed the ocean blue.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.460
It sticks with you,

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.710
and it's very easy to remember.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.320
But some things might not work for you while they work for someone else.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.600
Whatever works for you,

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.830
that's what works.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.100
And so stick with that.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.230
Just keep that in mind also,

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.850
obviously,

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:50.830
this requires some effort.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:51.230
At the beginning,

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.900
you're gonna have to come up with the type of system to remember whatever it is you're

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.800
trying to remember and to recall it to be able to recall it whenever you need it,

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.680
and this will take some effort.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.360
And so just keep that in mind.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.190
However,

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.320
very often the African pay off later.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.080
Now,

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.480
as you can see for something like,

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:14.040
If you need to memorize a date for a test like 14 92 or if you need to memorize something

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.660
that use quite often like how to spell gray,

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.150
then that's fine.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.600
But if it's just for a certain type of word,

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.180
and if you need to come up with a different type of pneumonic device for every single word

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.610
you learn,

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.180
it could be quite tedious.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:34.220
So just keep this in mind when you're learning new vocab or when you're learning words that

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.690
this could be very good for problem.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.710
Vocab made for words that you can't remember at all,

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:39.950
and you're having issues with.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:46.530
But sometimes it's not that good for just standard vocab that you come across all the time

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.530
.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.120
It can also be good for rules that you need to remember,

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.960
and if they're certain grammatical rules or a certain rules in the language that you to

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:54.580
keep in mind,

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.530
then sure come up with pneumonic devices for those,

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:03.250
but otherwise it can be quite tedious and maybe not worth all the effort.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.450
For example,

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.650
I've heard before for Italian most masculine words and with O and most feminine words.

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.040
And with a and ah,

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.920
one device there is to picture the old as a head like you see the standard head when you go

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.380
to anything that could be divided,

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.160
male female say,

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.720
like the toilets or some like that,

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.250
and the always just around head,

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.980
while the a,

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.980
the lower case A could be the hair going in the back of the female's head and could

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.500
symbolise the longer hair.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.080
And this could be an easy way to remember.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.370
Oh,

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.820
for masculine A for feminine.

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.530
That's just one example.

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.170
There quite a few other ones we can go through a couple of them like,

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.800
for instance,

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.280
in Japanese to eat.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.410
It's debated away.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.110
To remember that that I've heard is a taboo sounds like table,

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.320
and the table is a place where you eat.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.440
And so if you remember that,

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.570
then you can remember Tab.

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:55.240
Another one that I've heard is ALF Gabin in German ALF Cabin means to give up.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:01.170
If you calculate that ALF sort of sounds like ouch and then gave it means to give that you

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.180
can picture yourself saying,

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.390
Oh,

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.110
I want to give this present to my friend,

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.780
but ouch.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.020
I hurt myself and so on.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.100
Now I can't give it.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.470
Oh,

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.820
well,

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:09.360
I give up.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.040
I won't give it.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.560
So,

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.860
ALF,

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:16.820
given you can remember it means to give up because you think Ouch giving Oh ouch!

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:17.560
I can't give it.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.750
Oh,

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.230
I give up once again.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:20.270
These are very personal.

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:22.110
And that's why if it works for you,

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:23.270
that's very good.

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.520
If it doesn't work for you,

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.450
then try something else.

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.360
Also remember that you risk remembering the pneumonic rule,

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.210
but not the vocab itself may be Remember that ALF stands for ouch.

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.760
But then you don't remember that the whole word is supposed to mean to give up,

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.390
In which case this means that it's not working well for you,

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.590
and you should find some of the system that doesn't work well with you.

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:49.420
And so these are all things to keep in mind when you're using the Monix and so I would

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:50.030
apply them.

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.650
If you see that they can work for you,

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.100
but don't try to force them just because they happen to be.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.610
Quite frankly,

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:57.990
they happen to be in fashion right now.

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.060
And I feel like I'm hearing a lot of people trying to use pneumonic stow,

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.970
learn languages.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:08.450
But I don't often hear very many instances of it working.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:13.450
And usually when it does work is for grammatical rules that can be applied very often or

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.290
for problem vocab that it's hard to remember for the person.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:23.270
Here's another example I came across just that I thought was interesting in Japanese to die

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:24.150
is she knew.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.400
And so an interesting way to remember that is because,

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.880
she notes,

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.050
sounds like she knew.

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:31.110
So you can remember.

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.100
She knew she was about to die or my preferred version is.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.510
Actually,

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:38.450
she knew what you did last summer or she knew what she did last summer or something along

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.910
those lines,

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:39.310
basically,

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.790
because it reminds me of that movie and that movie was all about killing and dying and

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:44.450
stuff like that
