00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.890
another quick and easy tip is to label objects in your home.

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.060
This is pretty much what it sounds like.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:08.830
You can take furniture,

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.130
paintings,

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:11.490
appliances,

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.210
whatever you might have around your home,

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:14.140
different rooms,

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.100
different types of fixtures and furnishings and whatever might be,

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.660
and just put posted notes on them or stickers or something and just label them.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.760
And this is obviously great for vocab because you get to learn all the objects that are in

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.120
your room,

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.510
maybe even your in your window.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:29.950
You want to put certain labels.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.430
If you see certain buildings or things in the scenery or outside your window,

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.880
why not put labels and just with the vocab for those words,

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.300
This just allows you to see it throughout the day.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:40.850
And,

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:41.250
uh,

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.670
the more often you see something,

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.090
the more often you get to practice it,

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.770
and the more likely you are to learn it.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.240
And I've seen this quite often.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.180
Language learners.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.050
When you go to their home,

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.370
they'll have posted notes were randomly around their house with on top of different objects

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:53.370
,

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.780
just so they can learn how to pronounce that object and how to say it in the language there

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:59.360
trying to learn,

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.650
and it's quite easy to do.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:01.610
Anyone can do it,

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:02.980
and so why not do it?
