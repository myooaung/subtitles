00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.170
I find an important aspect of reading is to reward yourself and to reward yourself for the

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:07.830
job you've done,

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.970
because reading is something that can take a long time no matter what you're trying to read

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:12.970
,

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.350
whether it seems like a short comic book or full book or anything along those lines,

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.350
reading kind of takes effort and you have to concentrate and it can take a while.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:27.580
So I recommend rewarding yourself for certain goals or milestones as you achieve them.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.140
Now this could be something like once you finish a book or a story or something along those

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.060
lines that you reward yourself with whatever award your choose.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.040
But it can also be something like having to look up fewer words.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.860
So if you are able to read a whole page without having to look up a word in the dictionary

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.860
,

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.710
or if you only have to look up so in so words per chapter,

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.540
whatever it might be ahead of time,

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.840
try to set some goals or milestones after which,

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.600
or at which point you can reward yourself.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.750
And this kind of keeps you moving along because it can be quite slow and it can be quite

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.370
TDs to try to keep reading something,

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.140
especially if you're trying to stick with and have to keep stopping all the time to look up

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.190
new words or expressions and along those lines,

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.420
my recommendation is not to look up too many words when you are reading,

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.740
if you can get the gist of it.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.190
If you can sort of understand what's being said or what's being talked about,

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.460
then try to keep going without looking up a word.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.340
And chances are you can still catch up and you don't need to look up every single word you

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.570
see that you don't recognize because every time you look up a word you're going to break

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:33.960
the flow of what you're reading,

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.030
and it really makes him more mature.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.830
Makes it more tedious than it has to be.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.250
So what I usually do is when I'm reading a certain text.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.950
If I see the same word repeated many times,

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.550
they don't market down and decide that I need to look it up.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:46.360
And likewise,

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.390
if a certain word is just pivotal to my understanding,

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.410
then I look it up and this usually happens.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:52.650
If I'm reading through something,

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.480
I decide to skip a word and keep reading.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.930
But I noticed maybe a couple sentences later that I really don't understand what's going on

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.710
because of that one word or expression.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.150
Then I'll go back and look it up.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.900
In other words,

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.660
I only look up words that seem important.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:06.170
Otherwise,

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.100
if I don't understand them,

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.850
I try to move on and keep going with it,

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.150
and usually I can pick up the gist of what's being said.
