00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
Now in terms of apps, which apps should you use?

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.970
Unfortunately, this really depends on your language combination,

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.910
on your level, and also what you want to concentrate on.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.045
However, there are a couple of generalities that can be said.

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:13.350
First of all, if you're a beginner,

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:14.940
there'll be lots of choice.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.075
And so my recommendation is to explore the free options.

00:00:18.075 --> 00:00:23.280
There are a lot of apps out there that teach you the beginnings of any type of language.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.010
And so you can just explore,

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.499
you probably know some of the main names like Duolingo,

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:30.000
Pixlr, et cetera, et cetera.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.620
Feel free to explore these and see

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.350
what options there are in the language you want to learn.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.555
However, as you improve,

00:00:38.555 --> 00:00:41.209
you'll notice that there's a lot less choice.

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:43.910
And this will depend also on the language combination.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.600
If you are studying a more common language like say Spanish,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.220
then there will be more choice.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.935
But if you're studying not very common language,

00:00:51.935 --> 00:00:55.985
chances are, you will find quite a bit of choice for the elementary level.

00:00:55.985 --> 00:00:58.580
But as he progressed, there'll be less and less choice.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.910
However, if you've been exploring the free options as a beginner,

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.130
you'll have a lot better idea as to what works for intermediate and advanced.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.010
And chances are you've come across one or two apps that

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.520
have lessons that keep going past intermediate level.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.880
Or you've found some other program or something like that,

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.315
that works just as well.

00:01:18.315 --> 00:01:21.400
So before you start paying for anything right off the bat,

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.445
These are some things to keep in mind and I just recommend

00:01:24.445 --> 00:01:28.345
exploring the free options at first until you get a better idea.

00:01:28.345 --> 00:01:31.495
Now, technically, this also applies to podcasts,

00:01:31.495 --> 00:01:33.670
YouTube channels, textbooks, et cetera.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.425
Once again, depending on your language,

00:01:35.425 --> 00:01:39.190
this means that it's very easy to find podcasts, YouTube channels, et cetera,

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.815
that teach you the elementary rules and grammar structure, et cetera, et cetera.

00:01:44.815 --> 00:01:47.065
But once you start getting intermediate or advanced,

00:01:47.065 --> 00:01:49.100
it's a lot harder.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.080
So try to keep this in mind as you're studying and when you do

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.870
find podcasts and YouTube channels, apps, textbooks,

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.850
what have you that deal with

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.420
more advanced facets of the language and keep those in mind for the future.
