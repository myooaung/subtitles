00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.790
This is fruit,

00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.730
those of you who are learning lesser known languages.

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:05.050
Now most of you,

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:06.640
probably Stickley speaking,

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.910
are going to be learning languages that are quite common.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:09.600
Spanish,

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.140
Chinese,

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:10.590
German,

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.000
Arabic,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.670
English,

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:12.790
whatever it might be.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.660
But of course,

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.890
many people want to learn lesson a languages for many different reasons.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:23.830
And these can be a whole different ball park because it can be a challenge to learn lesson

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:24.710
known languages.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:25.910
Very often,

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.100
you can't find people to speak in these languages.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.480
It's very hard to find courses in these languages very hard to find.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.220
Textbooks is very hard to find any type of resource in these languages.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.410
And let's face it,

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.240
if you aren't in the top,

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.440
say,

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.180
56 languages than it can be very hard to find.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.140
Some resource is to learn these languages.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.850
So what is some solutions?

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.310
Generally,

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.730
the lesser known the language,

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.900
the more you'll have to rely on the Internet.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.880
Thankfully,

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.280
nowadays we have the Internet,

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.400
and so we have all the information that's available.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.260
There are means thankfully,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.810
yes and no.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:57.930
But in terms of learning lesson,

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:58.710
no languages,

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.630
it actually gives us a lot of information and a lot of resource is that we wouldn't have

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:04.270
otherwise.

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:09.450
And so keep this in mind if you're learning a lesson on language that you will have to rely

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.960
a lot more on the Internet,

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.990
The good news is that with the Internet,

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.300
you can find resource is in pretty much any language.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.600
So the recommendation here is just to do research and research,

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.060
what you confined and how whatever you confined can apply to all the various language

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.560
components,

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.520
such as listening,

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.220
speaking,

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.010
reading and writing.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.810
Another thing you can do is try to contact professors who speak this language if you

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:36.440
confined,

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.820
whether being your school or any other school.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.220
If you can get in touch with a professor who speaks the language you're trying to learn,

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.080
frankly,

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.680
it can't hurt.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.730
There are no downsides.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.530
They'll most likely be very happy,

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.890
in fact,

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.480
to be in touch with someone who has some interest in learning this language just because

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.160
it's such a lesson,

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.050
a language that usually very few people are interested in it,

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.250
so feel free to contact someone.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.940
Obviously,

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.380
if they're very far away,

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.190
they on the other side of the country or the other side of the world that it may be.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.090
They can teach you,

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.040
but they will,

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.380
you know,

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.400
feel free to ask a lease for resource is or recommendations and to just engage them in

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.210
dialogue and see if they can help out along those lines.

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:18.200
Another thing you can try doing is contacting speakers of this language once again.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.530
Maybe you're trying to learn the language of a country that ah isn't very common.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.020
I don't know the Faroe Islands,

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.580
for instance,

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.460
but the Faroe Islands does have Internet,

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.600
so you can try to contact people who live in the Faroe Islands and see if maybe you can get

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.130
in touch with the future pen pal or somebody who could do language exchange over the

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.580
Internet.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.440
Try contacting people who just speak this language in their everyday life and see if maybe

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.970
you could make some new friends and try to find some help in that way.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.930
And finally,

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.550
try contacting others who have either been learning this language who are learning now or

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:54.730
have learned it in the past.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:55.270
Obviously,

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.690
these people have to go through the same thing you're going through,

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.250
and so chances are they'll have a lot of resource is at their fingertips,

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.060
and they'll have a lot of helpful tips for you.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.830
This will also ensure that you don't have to reinvent the wheel because they've probably

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.150
been through all the headaches that you will go through and trying to learn this lesson on

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.670
language.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.660
And they can tell you right off the bat was available and what isn't.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.620
So these could be a very helpful resource if you go and find whether it be through the

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.120
schools or forms or anywhere else,

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.520
you can just try Googling learning so in so language and see what pops up and see if you

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.050
can find other people who have been learning it.
