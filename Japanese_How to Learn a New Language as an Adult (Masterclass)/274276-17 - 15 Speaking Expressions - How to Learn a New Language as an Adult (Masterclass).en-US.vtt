00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.910
So in terms of expressions and idioms and stuff like this,

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.490
this obviously has to deal more with stuff like metaphors like similes,

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.280
innuendos,

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:12.650
etcetera,

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.900
etcetera and these air Definitely more for the advanced learner.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.100
Once you've got the basics,

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.350
once you have the basics of grammar vocab,

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.850
and you can string sentences together and have a decent conversation that you could start

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.210
concentrating on these other types of expressions.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.670
And so here I'm talking about stuff like having skeletons in the closet have an axe to

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:33.440
grind.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.530
Stick out like a sore thumb,

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:36.890
beat around the bush.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.970
All these types of expressions that might come very natural to you in your native tongue

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.150
but don't necessarily make sense if you hear them for the first time.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.250
In a different language,

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.980
however,

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.470
they're usually used all the time.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:49.400
Definitely used,

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.450
wouldn't slang,

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.150
and so they're useful to learn as well.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.230
First thing with these is to pay attention to the usage.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.260
You want to pay attention to the person using them the context in which they're being used

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.260
,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.190
and also to the reaction,

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.000
because it's very easy with these to say something offensive.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.580
You don't want to say something to informal to someone who is your superior.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.000
You also don't want to say you don't want to do the opposite and use something to former

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.720
with someone who's younger than you,

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.150
because it might just sound off.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.850
You also definitely want to make sure that you don't offend someone by using something in

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:23.830
the wrong context.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.920
So that's why I also this is for more advanced learners,

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.980
and you want to pay attention to this.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.850
You want to pay attention to the context in which they're being used.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:41.550
Now humor is even more advanced than expressions and idioms and metaphors and similes,

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:42.090
etcetera.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.550
Humor is very different for those of you who speak more than one language.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.600
You know that humor can be very different in every language.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.970
And even if you translate a joke correctly,

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.870
it does not necessarily translate well into the next language and isn't necessarily funny.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:05.380
I find that the best way to learn about humor is toe watch,

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.630
stand up comics in whatever language you're trying to acquire,

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.430
because these will obviously speak the local tongue and they'll also be conveying the local

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.000
humor.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.610
And they'll do so in a way that's very local.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:20.190
Unfortunately,

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.120
when you watch TV shows,

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.280
many times they're dubbed or translated or else they try to go for different types of humor

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.280
,

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.380
and it can be kind of fake,

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.840
depending on the act thing,

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:29.730
etcetera.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.160
And so watching stand up comics and comedy I find is very useful when trying to get to

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:41.990
understand the humor of the language or trying to acquire curse words should be avoided.

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:47.950
You should always of would curse words you should definitely and generally they're the fun

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:48.760
things to learn.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.650
And there's some of the first words that people learn a new language.

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:52.690
And when you're a bit younger,

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:53.710
it might be cute,

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.940
and or you can think it sounds cool just because you could say this word or that in certain

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:59.550
language.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:00.820
But at a certain point,

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.250
definitely what you're an adult,

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.380
you shouldn't be learning them at all.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.750
And the danger with learning them is that you get used to saying them,

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.800
and you might inadvertently say a curse word when you really,

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:11.650
really shouldn't.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:12.250
Now,

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.120
if you're learning a language and you don't speak it well,

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.920
then you're kind of given a pass because people assume that you were just taught the wrong

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.280
curse word under the wrong circumstances or something along those lines.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.190
But still,

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.520
it's definitely best not to risk it.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.350
Also remember that cursing isn't necessarily the same in every language.

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:30.670
In some languages,

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.390
it might sound like cool,

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.850
like what the cool kids are doing or the cool actors or singers or doing but another

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.100
language or in another country.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.400
It could be very different.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.570
And maybe it's what the ah slimy businessmen are doing.

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.790
Or,

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:45.390
I don't know,

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.750
curse words can be very different.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:48.510
Uh,

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.530
not only in what they mean or and how they're used,

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:52.570
which can be very colorful,

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:53.170
by the way,

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.790
but in how they make you be perceived by other people.

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.280
And so it's better not to use them at all until your in advanced learner.
