00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.350
Now,

00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.670
while we're studying another language,

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:02.630
it'll always happen.

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:02.830
I mean,

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:07.730
it happens very often that we feel de motivated and we feel like maybe we're not getting

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.560
ahead or we're not learning new stuff or whatever we're learning isn't staking.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.320
Resume working.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.990
And sometimes we need more motivation,

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.210
and I find that in those situations,

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:18.910
the best thing to do is to go back to your original goal.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:19.060
Now,

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.600
this was the one we covered right at the beginning,

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.720
and ah,

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:29.540
see what your goal waas when you want to learn this language and then build upon this goal

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:30.860
and try to help it out a bit.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:31.940
So let's say,

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.960
if you want to travel to so and so country,

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.760
and that's why you're learning the language well,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.510
then go a bit more into detail and explore a couple trips you can take and see where you

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.360
could travel and where exactly it could be.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.990
Learning this uses in its language and with whom,

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.900
or just if you wanted to use it in different situations,

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.500
try to explore a bit more of the situations you could be in while you are speaking this

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.930
language and what types of friends he could be hanging out with what types of activities he

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:58.600
could be doing.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.700
And just trying to find other things he could be doing with this language tried to explore

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.220
it a bit more because you remember your goal in your objective.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.210
It's pretty much what is inspiring you.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.470
What is motivating you.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.920
So if you need more motivation,

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.060
it makes sense to kind of explore this a bit more and see how far you can take it,

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.670
if you will,

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.090
and how much you will be able to do with the language once you learn it.
