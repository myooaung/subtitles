00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.830
now in terms of pronunciation.

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:04.140
Pronunciation,

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.290
as I mentioned before,

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.700
can be very difficult and there are many things to give in mind.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.550
First of all,

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:11.090
remember,

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.890
just because something is written with an N o.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.190
N o or in our doesn't mean it's pronounced the same as with your native talk.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.210
Are is probably the biggest example for those of you who have studied any pretty much any

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.280
other language than you've seen this,

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:25.930
you know,

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.850
and are as I pronounce that right now,

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.770
er is very different from the that you hear in Spanish or Italian,

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.930
which is also very different from the are that you hear in French or in German and even in

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:37.910
speaking German,

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.830
the are can be different with your in Switzerland as compared to,

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:42.010
say,

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.800
northern Germany and stuff like that.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.700
And so it can there many different variations of our obviously them.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.110
When you go to Asian languages,

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.780
they have you know that they have their own sound,

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.450
which is kind of a cross between Arnell,

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.960
especially Korean and Japanese,

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.780
and so are is this is pretty much a problem.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:00.240
Ah,

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.790
a problem letter and in pronunciation,

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:04.810
almost any language.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.320
But there are many other ones that you'll notice Oh,

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.170
can be one.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.350
And because you find,

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.790
oh,

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:10.870
the sound you find a well,

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:11.650
you find all.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:17.390
And this could be an issue even within the same country if you speak Italian and you might

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.740
have been two.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.460
Cuomo Cuomo is a place which is in northern Italy and in northern Italy.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.810
They tend to pronounce their vowels a lot more closed.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.290
So if you're from Cuomo,

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.320
you'll actually pronounce a cool so it can be more open.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.320
Which is how many foreigners are people from other parts of Italy will pronounces like

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.890
Cuomo.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:35.510
Or,

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:36.560
if you're from Cuomo itself,

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.910
It's almost like a you sound.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:38.590
It's Kool Moe,

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.330
so you can find it even within the same country,

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.710
but definitely with within different countries.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.190
And when you're learning a new language,

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.350
you find this a lot,

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.660
and I have End is an example,

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.110
because this happened to me personally when I was learning Korean,

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.590
I was taught that end was written in a certain way,

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.480
and so every time I encountered this character,

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.810
this syllable I pronounce it is and except I remember I was hanging out with some friends

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.810
and they kept saying a new got to got to go and sound to me like D D u G a or something.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:06.370
And I was like,

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.800
Oh,

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.260
you know what?

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.220
What does that mean?

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:08.470
They're like,

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:08.550
Oh,

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.770
it means who was like,

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.450
Isn't that new guy like movies sale?

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.040
And I don't know.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.790
And I heard this every now and then,

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.460
Like the end sounded a bit off until years later was finally explained to me that the n in

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.690
Korean usually is pronounced with like an end,

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.350
but with your tongue in between your teeth and which gives you that sound when you see

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.290
something like yoga,

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:35.270
it sounds like booga sometimes when you pronounce it that way and so and isn't necessarily

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.270
the same end that I was used to,

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:43.770
and you need to keep Dietz take this into account for many different sounds when you're

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.060
learning a new language because they can be quite different from your native tongue,

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:53.230
just because you use the same letter to spell it out doesn't mean it's pronounced the same

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.490
way.

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:59.000
I wanted to mention tones here,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.110
and the main thing to say about tones is that if you don't have them in your native tongue

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.110
,

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.760
and you're learning them in another language.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:05.730
They suck.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.190
They're very difficult to pick up.

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.340
Tones are the,

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.390
uh,

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.120
these air the tones that you hear in Chinese.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.210
Most people know that you have four or five tones in Chinese,

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:17.390
depending on how you count them.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.820
But if you're learning Vietnamese or Cantonese or tie,

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:20.630
you also have.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.950
In fact,

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.830
you have more tones in these languages,

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:29.150
and tones can be very difficult to discern for the ear that's not used to them.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.670
And so they could be very hard to pick up on first of all,

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.840
and then to pronounce and to remember for every single thing you say,

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.630
it can be almost impossible when you're first starting,

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:40.930
and it's very difficult to pick up.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.360
It's time goes by an inflection and intonation matters as well,

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.280
and this convey an issue.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.150
The most obvious example is when you ask the question in most languages,

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.120
not all languages but many languages.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.820
When you ask a question,

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.260
you kind of raise the tone toward the end of the inflection,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.750
I should say,

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.650
or the pitch is cold now is different from its cold Now.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:04.530
Basically,

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.380
you're questioning someone or something.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.360
If you say it that way,

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.380
however,

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:13.730
many languages just have him pitch inflection and different intonations just in general,

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.100
just the way the languages spoken.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.290
And so you need to take this into account when you're learning a new language as well,

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:19.800
especially with pronunciation.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.710
If you want to sound like a native speaker,

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:25.450
you want to sound mawr like someone who knows the language.

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:31.050
I find the best way to do any of this is to imitate native speakers,

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.250
especially when you're dealing with sounds that are a bit odd or,

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.250
you know they're a bit different from your native tongue.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.620
Then you should imitate speakers who are native in the language you're trying to acquire.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.350
So what do this mean?

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:43.140
If you're learning,

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.870
say Chinese and you're having trouble with the tones,

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.610
Then ask a native speaker to pronounce something.

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.190
And if you pronounce something and people have difficulty understanding,

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.650
you ask a native speaker to pronounce it may be recorded,

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.070
or at least keep track of it somewhere,

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.100
and so you can refer back to it so you can pronounce it correctly the same way as a native

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:09.060
speaker and usually this is the best way with when you're dealing with stuff like tones and

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.920
also inflections and different types of pronunciation.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.850
Because if you can hear the native speaker and imitate the native speaker,

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:17.890
then you'll sound more like a native speaker.

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:19.340
And slowly,

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.800
slowly,

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.820
you'll start getting more used to the native sounds until they come a bit more naturally to

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.930
you.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.750
And you don't have to rely on the neighbors speakers.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:33.560
Another thing you can do is record yourself,

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.320
and I try to do this,

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.500
especially if I say something and it's not understood correctly or someone has trouble

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:40.290
understanding me.

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:41.930
I try to record myself saying it.

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.560
If I get a chance to speak to a native speaker,

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.380
asked him about it,

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.880
then I can see what the mistake was and what I need to correct.
