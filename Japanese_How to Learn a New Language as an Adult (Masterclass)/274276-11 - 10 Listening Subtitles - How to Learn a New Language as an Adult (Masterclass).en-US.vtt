00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.270
now.

00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.710
Subtitles are quite interesting.

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.980
Watching a TV show or watching movies with subtitles is something that a lot of people do

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.730
when they're trying to learn a language and their several aspects to this.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:10.990
First of all,

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.710
when you are watching a movie in a foreign language,

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.450
then you can decide to turn on subtitles in your own language.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.720
So you can in the movie that will be speaking the language you're trying to learn,

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.720
and the subtitles will be in your native language.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.290
This.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:26.150
However,

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.410
as attractive as it might be,

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.840
it actually doesn't really help at all,

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.300
because you'll end up just reading the subtitles in your own language.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.420
And you'll hardly gain anything from watching the TV show or the movie in the foreign

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.940
language.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.820
The next step is to watch the TV show or the movie without any subtitles.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.540
And however,

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:52.060
the best option that there is is to watch the foreign movie or TV show with subtitles.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.350
In the foreign language that you're trying to acquire.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.340
This might seem a bit counterintuitive.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.720
In fact,

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.870
a lot of people would think that the order should be a bit different.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.930
The order should be first number one should be the subtitles in your language.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.430
But then number two should be the subtitles in the foreign language.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.590
And the best option should be watching without any subtitles.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.450
And although this might seem counterintuitive,

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.260
there was actually a study out of Spain recently that showed that this was not the case.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.750
They,

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.700
uh here they tested a bunch of Spanish speakers who were learning English,

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.650
and they would watch English TV shows someone Spanish subtitles.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:34.100
And here they saw an increase in ability of 0% and some washed it without any subtitles.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.240
And here they saw an increase of 7%.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.010
However,

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.630
the biggest improvement was in people who were watching English TV shows with English

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:42.280
subtitles,

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.650
and it was almost 17% improvement.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.190
And so this pretty much should apply.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.400
I mean,

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.930
until further studies are done either confirming or negating this this should pretty much

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.560
apply to any language you're studying.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.080
And I found that this is the case with the the languages I'm studying in.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.050
If you are studying any East Asian language like Korean,

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.700
Japanese or Chinese,

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.350
it's very common to have subtitles in the in their own language.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.030
For whatever TV show you're watching.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.310
And I found this to be a tremendous help,

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.620
and so I highly recommend it.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.960
Ah,

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.440
And to keep this in mind when you are using subtitles to keep in mind that if you subtitles

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.290
in your native tongue you are hardly gaining any improvement.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.590
And so you should try one of the other options.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.010
And the best option will be to have subtitles in the tongue you're trying to acquire.

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.920
By the way,

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.110
what you can do is when you're watching TV shows.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.750
If you absolutely need subtitles in your native tongue than what I try to do is every time

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.060
I watch one of these shows,

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.820
I try to listen out for new vocabulary.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.450
And so I try to be a bit active about it.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.130
And if I here word being repeated or being used,

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.810
quite obviously I'll jot it down.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.870
So at least I feel like I'm learning a new word for every TV show or every movie that I

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:53.450
watch
