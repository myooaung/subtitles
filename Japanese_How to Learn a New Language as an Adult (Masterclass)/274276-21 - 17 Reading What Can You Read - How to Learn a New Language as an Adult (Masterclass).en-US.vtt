00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.210
so with Children's books,

00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:02.030
I should mention this,

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.600
and once again,

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.400
I already mentioned this with cartoons.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.530
But you should,

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:11.710
if you can try to find local Children's books and not stuff that's been translated because

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:12.200
once again,

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.230
the translation sometimes can be a bit off.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:15.450
They try to keep it simple,

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.970
but sometimes the translations can be a bit odd,

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.150
and they aren't completely natural.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.330
So I usually try to find stuff that was originally written in that language,

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.600
not translated into that language in terms of other types of reading and confined.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.080
First of all,

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.160
you have classics.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.220
Classic books can be very useful because most classic books will teach you certain aspects

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.960
of a culture that locals take for granted.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.130
This is because locals grow up knowing these classics,

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.530
or even if they haven't read them for,

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:43.010
say,

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.270
they know the story is more or less think about.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.440
For an English speaker,

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.870
you could think about Shakespeare.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.340
Many people have not read Shakespeare,

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.790
and they might not remember the exact stories or this that and the other.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.630
But they they know the general theme.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.930
And if someone talks about Romeo and Juliet or most of the main themes from Shakespeare.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.860
They know what it's about,

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.540
and they know the imagery behind it and this goals for most local literature.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.690
If you confined classics in whatever language you are studying,

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.160
then it can teach you a lot,

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.590
not only about the language,

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.080
but about the culture itself.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.470
Plays can be very good as well.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:18.220
Usually,

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.650
plays are shorter than actual books,

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.010
and they're also written in dialogue.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.880
So there a lot mawr,

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.750
the way people speak rather than literary.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.070
So when you read plays,

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.340
the language you're gonna be reading is easier to go through,

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.590
and it also will be a lot mawr,

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.480
similar to what's being spoken.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.630
Short stories can be very useful if maybe you've already progressed past the comic book

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:45.110
stage,

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.560
but you're not ready to tackle.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.770
Ah,

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.980
full book or a full novel just yet.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.570
Short stories are away in between,

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.960
and so if it does take you longer to read the target language,

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.160
then it would toe a native speaker.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.050
And so maybe a novel would take you too long to read.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.410
A short story is usually a great compromise,

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:03.750
because it's right there in between.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.150
Another tip I would suggest is to find an author you like.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:10.680
When you're reading all of these.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.050
If you find it also you like,

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.320
then try to find all the other works that you can buy that same author.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.640
Chances are the author will not only write another work that you enjoy and that you like,

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.720
but will also tend to use a lot of the same expressions and idioms and a lot of the same

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.400
structure,

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.450
so you'll find it a lot easier to get started on the book right away and to be able to

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.920
understand everything that you're reading.
