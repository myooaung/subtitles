00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.900
so something you need to remember something you need to be careful about is application

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.530
mania.

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:06.110
Basically,

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.930
you shouldn't start going too crazy for APS applications.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.620
This is on your phone on your computers on your tablets.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:13.750
Because remember,

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.000
every time you have an app,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.090
you're just one click away from a whole bunch of distractions.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.740
And this could be chatting with your friends on your phone to scrolling through Twitter,

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.540
YouTube or instagram or obviously,

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:25.380
in your computer,

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.410
you've got a whole bunch of other things that you can waste time on.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.790
And so every time you have an app,

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.110
just be aware of this and keep this in mind.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.010
So I find the best thing is to hold yourself accountable.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.680
What does this mean?

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.120
Once again,

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.900
this means that you need to be your own teacher.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.130
You need to be their own boss,

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.650
breathing down your neck and making sure that you're actually getting your studying done

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:45.870
and not getting distracted.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:46.310
Look,

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.820
the main way that I do this is I tried to make it as difficult as possible to get

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.620
distracted and as easy as possible to get my language learning done.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.190
This means that on my computer.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.950
I have a various different applications that block time wasters like YouTube and stuff like

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.550
that when I'm trying to either get work done or get my language learning done.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.230
This also means that on my phone,

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.760
I try to basically do this at times when I know it won't be distracted.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.210
I have.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.750
Ah,

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.640
you can either use an extra phone if you have an old phone where you don't have y fire

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.050
Internet and you only have language learning APS,

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.920
Um,

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.770
or you can try to just block your WiFi or Internet when your language learning or something

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:25.490
along those lines.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.240
This will depend on each person's schedule and on each person's APS and what they have.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.780
Basically,

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.140
just in case you think you don't need to pay too much attention to it,

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.570
this is actually a huge reason why adults can't achieve success in language learning

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.860
because our first choice is to find something online.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.340
There's so many different options in there,

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.950
so many opportunities to use these APS and podcasts and videos and online courses,

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:52.340
etcetera,

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.950
etcetera.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.170
However,

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.920
if we don't have teachers support,

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.400
we don't have a language class.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.120
We don't have a tutor and we don't have basically other people to keep us in line.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.300
Then it's very easy for a study to become unstructured,

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.830
and so were the ones who have to do the structuring ourselves.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.890
So you need to keep this in mind,

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.480
and any time you use an app rather than pen and paper,

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.650
keep in mind all the various ways that you can't get distracted and especially during your

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:21.830
weekly monthly reviews,

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.250
try to look back and see if and how and when you were distracted.
