00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.025
Another quick tip and trick is that if you need to know a word quickly,

00:00:05.025 --> 00:00:09.075
and it's a simple word and you don't feel like looking it up right there.

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:11.310
You can always ask your AI speaker.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.890
Ai speaker obviously means something like Siri

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.850
or Alexa or Google Talk, et cetera, et cetera.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.665
And you can always ask something like,

00:00:19.665 --> 00:00:23.220
how do you say this word or that word and whatever language.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.460
And as long as as a simple word in one of the main languages,

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.540
your AI speaker can help you.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.120
Of course, if it's a more difficult word or expression,

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.310
you can also use your AI speaker to create

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.620
a reminder to look up the word if you can't do it right now.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.265
Like if you're in the middle of cooking or doing something else, you can always say,

00:00:40.265 --> 00:00:43.850
Alexa, Give me a reminder at 3pm to

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.630
lookup so and so Word or give me a reminder in half an hour to look up.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.070
So and so expression.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.320
So this is a simple way not to get bogged down in

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.555
case you can't think of a word or expression right away.

00:00:53.555 --> 00:00:55.325
And you don't have a dictionary handy.

00:00:55.325 --> 00:00:58.590
You can always use your AI speaker.
