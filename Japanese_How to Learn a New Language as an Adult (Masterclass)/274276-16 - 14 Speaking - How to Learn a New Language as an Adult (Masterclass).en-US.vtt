00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.960
so the next component is speaking.

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:02.450
Obviously,

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:04.590
you can practice it in many different ways.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:07.190
One example is with a language exchange partner.

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:09.880
This can either be face to face or online,

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.090
and they'll give you practice with speaking.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:12.860
Also,

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.220
you could just find people around town to practice with.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:19.790
This could be in your local pub or your local restaurant or whatever it might be,

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:20.670
Um,

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.350
and you can find people who teach that language online on DSO.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.050
This will give you a chance to either speak with them or to,

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.520
ah,

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:30.740
you know,

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.780
to listen to the pronunciation and be able to repeat on your own.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.100
And usually they have a way that you could test yourself.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.100
And by the way,

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.740
the these lists of for the different components like here was speaking is by no means

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:41.380
exhaustive.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.600
I mean,

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.500
there many other examples like you could go singing.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.180
Karaoke is a great place to practice another language as well.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.950
And you know there many other ways and opportunities that you can speak whatever language

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:52.950
you're trying to acquire.
