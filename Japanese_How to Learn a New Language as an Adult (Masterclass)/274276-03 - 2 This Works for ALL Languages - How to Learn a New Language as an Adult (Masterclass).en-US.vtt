00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.550
So I confessed that I really did not want to teach a course like this because teaching all

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:08.430
languages is well,

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:09.550
it's impossible.

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.760
But teaching how to learn all types of languages sort of feels like the same thing.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:14.770
Now,

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:15.830
as I mentioned,

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.400
I'm a translator and by profession.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.770
And so I talk a lot about translation and translation tips.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:22.120
In fact,

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.370
I've done courses and books on becoming a translator in a freelance translator.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.640
And there we have the same issue because there's so many languages that you can have a

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.290
different source.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.710
Language and target language and so many combinations that it's almost impossible to teach

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.070
translation per se.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.630
Likewise,

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:38.970
if you learn a new language,

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.350
you have your native tongue and then you have the target language language you're trying to

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.980
acquire,

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.770
and these could be all combinations.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.180
I could be an English speaker who wants to learn German or a German speaker who wants to

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.800
learn English.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.860
These are two very different classes that will be taught,

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.750
even though they both deal with the same two languages.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:57.530
Likewise,

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.230
I could be a Spanish speaker who wants to learn Arabic or a Chinese speaker who wants to

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.050
learn Swahili,

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:03.790
etcetera,

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:04.330
etcetera.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:04.880
Obviously,

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.500
there are all these different combinations,

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.840
and so it's very hard to come up with a method of learning languages that would apply to

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:12.440
everything.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.340
However,

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.590
there are quite a few things that come up with learning a new language,

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.610
no matter what the target or native tongue might be.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:20.470
The fact is,

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.150
if you're trying to learn a new language,

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.460
you're dealing with a different grammar structure,

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.690
different vocabulary.

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.570
You're dealing with different idioms and expressions and also different pronunciations,

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.310
and all of these are things that need to be acquired and need to be learned.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.180
And so there are certain systems and structures that can be put into place to learn these

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.550
new languages.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.840
Now these two languages could be quite similar,

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.020
like,

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.210
say,

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.250
Italian and Spanish.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.060
Or they could be extremely different,

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.540
like state,

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.060
Chinese and Arabic.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.870
However,

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.160
by following certain structures and systems,

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.870
it should be a lot easier to learn a new language.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.530
And by the way,

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:00.360
when I say easier,

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.040
I don't mean it's passive by any means.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.450
It has to be an active endeavor by anyone who wants to learn a new language.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.970
No one can learn a language passively,

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.550
But I mean easier in the sense that you don't start learning the wrong things or start

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.190
getting frustrated because you feel like you're like you're studying a lot,

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.450
but you're not picking up anything new or you concentrate all your efforts and something

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.410
that really doesn't give you many rewards,

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.770
etcetera,

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:22.290
etcetera.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.340
So when you're trying to acquire a new language,

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.620
there are certain systems and structures that can really help.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.730
And these are the ones that I want to touch upon that I wanted to talk about during this

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:31.260
course.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.530
I'm also obviously going to talk about a lot of tips and tricks that I've come up with her

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.490
that I've seen that I've encountered over the years.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:40.850
And at the very end,

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.090
I'm going to have my own method that I'm going to walk you through.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.230
This is after I talk about all the components of language learning and all the different

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.070
aspects of it,

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.290
and the different types of ways you can decide to learn a new language and how you can

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.410
continue it in different ways.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.660
You can schedule all this in all the different types of tips and tricks and advice that I

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:00.190
give you?

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:06.470
What I've created is basically consolidated all into one system restructure that I like to

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:07.560
use and I want to share that.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.430
But I'm going to share that at the very end after I run through all the let's say theory

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.650
behind it and all the various different options that you have when you're trying to learn a

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:17.440
new language.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.400
So if you're ready,

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.170
let's get started.
