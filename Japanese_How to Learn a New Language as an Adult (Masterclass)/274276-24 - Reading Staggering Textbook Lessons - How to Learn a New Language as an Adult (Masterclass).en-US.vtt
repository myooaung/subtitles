00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
Now speaking of textbooks and other thing you can do with textbooks is to

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.610
treat them not so much as a lesson per day,

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.950
but treat them more in a staggered way.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:11.910
So what does this mean?

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.720
This means that maybe rather than doing a full lesson on one day,

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.220
just do half the lesson.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.200
And the reason for this is the next day you can

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.615
come and finish the second half of that lesson.

00:00:21.615 --> 00:00:25.500
Plans start the first half of the following lesson.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.915
And this allows you to revisit the things that you learned in the lesson before,

00:00:30.915 --> 00:00:33.360
Plus start a new lesson,

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.565
which then you will revisit the next day.

00:00:35.565 --> 00:00:38.520
Usually with textbooks, each lesson is divided by

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.710
a certain rule or a new thing that you need to learn.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.900
So you learn one thing per day and it makes it much easier to

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.545
forget it after a day or two because you've only been learning it during that day.

00:00:48.545 --> 00:00:50.240
However, if you stagger them,

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.550
This means that you have to revisit it the next day

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.400
and you're that much more likely to remember it if

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.785
you actually spend two days visiting one rule rather than just having it all on one day.

00:01:00.785 --> 00:01:04.070
Many of your lessons might be divided into at first you'll learn the rule,

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.810
then you have exercises for it.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.285
Well, leave the exercises for the second day.

00:01:08.285 --> 00:01:11.360
That way you're forced to remember the rule at least 24 hours

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.695
later and then start the first half of the next lesson at the same time,

00:01:15.695 --> 00:01:17.300
and so on and so forth.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.740
And this is staggering the lessons,

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.065
rather than dividing it by less than one today,

00:01:21.065 --> 00:01:22.910
less than two tomorrow lesson three,

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.525
the next day you have less than 1.5 to 2.5,

00:01:26.525 --> 00:01:30.185
and the next day you have 2.5 to 3.5, et cetera, et cetera.

00:01:30.185 --> 00:01:32.900
Now in theory, you could do this with podcasts,

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.750
you could do this with YouTube channel or something like that,

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.660
but it's a lot more difficult and a lot more of a pain.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:39.860
And when you have a textbook,

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.170
it's a lot easier just to put a bookmark right?

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.720
Wherever you stopped and then continue on the next day.
