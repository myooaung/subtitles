00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.950
so the next tip here is one that might seem a bit odd,

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:06.060
but I found it very useful for myself.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:06.830
Unfortunately,

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.250
when you're trying to learn a language,

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.990
you find that it's quite hard to find other people to talk to anything.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:13.370
If you do,

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.170
you have to set up an appointment and maybe once or twice a day maximum,

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.180
you can find people to talk with.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.310
And this very often you find this isn't enough,

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.630
because if you want to once again immersed yourself and you want to become a bit more

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:27.750
intense with language learning,

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.670
it's hard to do so when you have to rely on others all the time.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:36.450
And so what I end up doing is not relying on others and just talking to myself.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.500
Now this can have many different meanings.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.300
It can mean something like,

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:41.550
say,

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.720
planning your day,

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.330
sending your agenda out,

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.450
say in the morning when you're deciding upon what to do.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.190
And I've used it for other things like,

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.350
say,

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.250
counting money,

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.590
complaining about stuff to myself or else just ah,

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.000
organizing what I'm doing extra commentary or stuff along those lines,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.150
and I know you don't want to risk sounding like a lunatic if you're just walking around

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.160
talking to yourself.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.440
But chances are you are by yourself quite often during the day,

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.140
and so you can afford to do so by the way,

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.730
this works,

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.200
even if you just do it in your head.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.280
You don't have to necessarily do it out loud,

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.550
but talking to yourself gives you the opportunity to use the language a lot more often and

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.250
because you can literally,

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.530
pretty much do it all the time,

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.780
as long as you're not in the process of talking to someone else.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:27.870
And,

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:28.270
uh,

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.440
so I'm one of the things that a lot of people mention when you mentioned talking to

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.000
yourself is the fact that no one will correct your mistakes,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.710
but I don't see this.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.050
It's so much a problem because chances are if you do make a mistake.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.730
First of all,

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.340
you'll know that you made a mistake,

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.390
and so if it does bother,

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.820
you can always look it up or jot it down so you can ask someone later on.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:47.970
And remember,

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.400
when you talk to other people,

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.240
they very often are not correcting your mistakes,

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.500
especially if you're having a conversation you're in the flow of the conversation and you

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.980
make a small mistake here and there.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.590
Many times they won't correct you at all because they're listening to your conversation.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.400
And so they understood what you want to say.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.420
You didn't say perfectly,

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.360
but that's OK,

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.310
so talking to yourself has way more benefits than disadvantages,

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.190
and so I generally recommend it as a very simple way to be able to use the language

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.990
whenever you want.
