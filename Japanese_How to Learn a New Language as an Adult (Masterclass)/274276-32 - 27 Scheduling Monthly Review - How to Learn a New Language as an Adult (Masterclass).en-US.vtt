00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.310
So here I want to talk about the monthly review a bit more in detail.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:04.290
I mentioned it before,

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.500
and I mentioned how it's different from the weekly review,

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.340
and but here I want to talk a bit more detail about how you can use this monthly review.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.460
You can use it once again to Rio to refine your schedule so you might find that difference

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.460
.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.290
Exercises each day might be counterproductive.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.440
You might find that an exercise that you've been,

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.020
ah,

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.700
working on every day or every other day or one of the exercises that you've committed to

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.830
actually don't help you much or interfere with one some of the other original exercises.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:32.990
There's something along those lines.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.520
Basically,

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.750
they don't work the right way.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:41.470
And so this monthly review allows you to pick the exercises that work best and also,

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:42.010
by the way,

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.840
the exercise that work best are the ones that you can sick to the best.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.900
So these exercises that you're reviewing and everything you're going through it it has to

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.280
be things that you can stick to.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.280
For example,

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.700
if you have been going through flashcards and podcasts and also a language exchange,

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.840
but you find that you're not really sticking to the podcasts,

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.830
and you're never listening to them or downloading them,

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:03.880
and you can't really stick to them.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:04.230
Well,

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:04.550
then,

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:05.740
that's not working out for you.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.630
And so you need to use this in your monthly review to ask yourself,

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.870
OK,

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.330
is there any way that can do it?

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.870
So it's easy?

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.130
Should I download them all at the beginning of the month?

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.420
So I have them accessible?

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.280
Should I find a different time to listen to them?

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.930
Or maybe I should get rid of them all together and find a different way to concentrate on

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.200
my listening or something along those lines.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:29.640
So the monthly review allows you to review this and make sure that a your schedule is going

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.390
in the right direction,

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.450
and B you're actually able to stick to the schedule.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:40.270
You should also ask yourself if there were any obstacles going back to the podcast,

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.730
where there any obstacles and listening.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.920
Maybe your phone is usually out of batteries or you don't have a chance to listen to your

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.760
podcasts for one reason or the other.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.880
Or was there anything that stops you from learning or keeping to a schedule,

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:53.910
whatever it might be,

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.820
you should think about what these obstacles are.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.510
Think if there's any way to avoid them,

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.550
circumvent them or maybe find an alternative so that you don't find these obstacles in your

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.890
way.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.130
You want to make it as easy as possible to be able to learn the language,

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.980
and it's difficult.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:08.710
That's possible,

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:09.600
too.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.330
Have obstacles in your way.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.750
And,

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:12.140
Ah,

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.610
so this will depend on each and every one of your different scheduling,

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.510
your different needs and the different points they're concentrating on,

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.930
but tried to identify any obstacles there that were there a lot of the times.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:23.330
By the way,

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.160
this could just be pure laziness.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.980
It can be procrastination or something along those lines,

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:29.990
but try to go a bit deeper.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.440
What made you lazy?

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.530
How did you procrastinate?

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.360
Where you just on YouTube the whole time?

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.980
We'll find a way to block YouTube then,

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.280
or were you chatting with Friends will then set aside a time where you get rid of your

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.080
phone and you don't chat with friends stuff along those lines.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.380
Another thing to remember during this monthly review is that may be your motivation has

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.920
changed Maybe your and goal has changed.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:52.920
Maybe at the beginning,

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.960
you wanted to do it just so you could chat with a bunch of friends in a new language.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:57.870
But now you've decided.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:58.120
Hey,

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.540
actually,

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.360
I'm pretty good at this.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.840
I want to do business in this language.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.180
I want to get a job in the new country or something like that.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.230
So keep this.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.580
Keep these changes.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.770
Even if they're slight changes in your goal,

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.870
keep them in mind as well for your monthly review,

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.770
because you might want to switch the direction in which your going and,

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:14.040
ah,

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.950
the direction of your learning based on any change there might be in your end goal.
