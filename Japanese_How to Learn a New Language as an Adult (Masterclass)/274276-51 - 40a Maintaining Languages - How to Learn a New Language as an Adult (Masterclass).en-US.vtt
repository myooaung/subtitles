00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.150
Maintaining a language can be a big part for language learning,

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:04.490
especially over the long term.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.580
And this is because learning language never ends.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:08.970
When you learn a language,

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.200
you can learn it very well or at whatever level.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.750
But chances are at some point you are going to,

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:14.250
ah,

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.890
stop taking classes or stop working with a private tutor or stop going through the lessons

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.740
yourself because life goes on and other things happen and you get taken away from it.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.990
So what happens if you learn the language to,

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.240
Ah,

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.060
great level and then you let it go for around two years,

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.670
and two years later you have to use it again.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:35.010
Well,

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.380
chances are you'll have lost quite a bit of it.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.000
Unfortunately,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.680
this happens.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.040
This happens with every language,

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.580
by the way,

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.250
including your native tongue.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.910
Now,

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:44.570
obviously,

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.430
losing your native tongue is something that is very rare because even if we go to a place

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.030
where a native tongue isn't being spoken,

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.030
chances are we still use that when we surf the Web and read stuff,

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.320
talk to friends back home over Skype,

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.530
read books,

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.730
think to ourselves,

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:00.090
etcetera,

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.610
etcetera.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.690
And so how do you maintain that over time.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:03.080
Well,

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.860
there are a couple things.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:04.360
First of all,

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.360
already mentioned trigger sentences in my intro now trigger sentences or something that I

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.350
use quite a bit.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.750
If someone comes up to me at a bar at a restaurant or on the street and starts wanting to

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.720
speak whatever language one of the languages I learned,

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.060
chances are I can't just switch to that language mentality right away because all languages

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.480
air different.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.600
They have different pronunciation.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.250
They kind of have a different mentality.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.310
A lot of them have completely different grammar structures.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.170
Korean,

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.740
Japanese and German have verbs at the end.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:35.540
While you know,

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.610
French has its own pronunciation,

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.920
Italian and Spanish of other similar pronunciations.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.340
But you know,

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.110
and all of them have their own thing going on.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.950
So what I use and this is a method that was taught to me by a friend of mine who work in

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:49.740
the State Department,

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.820
he had to deal with people who needed visas,

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.020
and so he would have a lot of people come up to his window and the languages he spoke.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.350
I think we're Russian,

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.190
Japanese,

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:00.580
Chinese and Spanish,

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:01.320
or something like that,

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.590
and So he you know,

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.200
these are very different languages to switch to and to keep talking.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.970
And so what he would do is he would basically ask them a question that he sort of knew what

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.500
the answer was,

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.720
more or less like where you from,

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.440
or something like that.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.180
And they reply.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.920
And then he'd ask another quiet kind of obvious question.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.860
And these three or four obvious questions with the obvious answers were enough to get him

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.450
back into the mentality of that language.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.510
And so he just memorized those questions and was kind of ready for the answers,

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:29.460
and by that point,

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.210
he had sort of switched his mentality over to that language.

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.030
And so I do something similar.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.220
What I do is I have these trigger sentences that I sort of memorized.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.850
And I mentioned a couple in the intro Ah,

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:40.760
for example,

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.040
in Spanish.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.000
I usually because,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.040
and I'll get into why I choose the sentences in a minute.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.870
But for Spanish,

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.380
I'll say something like Ah and gentleman,

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.070
Massimino told hospital hablo espanol muito Yanez ago and etcetera,

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.470
etcetera.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:03.640
Now the reason I do this is because when Spanish comes up out of the blue very often.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.560
It's because people know I speak Italian or else maybe they'll hear someone speak Spanish

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.150
to me.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.560
Or either way,

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.740
it'll be they'll say,

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.970
Oh,

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.670
you speak Spanish or they'll ask me Oh,

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:14.640
do you speak Spanish?

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.790
And so I kind of have to explain if I speak Spanish and how I speak Spanish and more or

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.860
less where my level is for Spanish.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.500
And so that's why I find that to be a good sentence,

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.880
because I could say something like,

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:27.260
Look,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.810
I understand more or less everything.

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.050
But my Spanish is when I speak it.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:37.790
I speak a very Italian sort of Spanish because I when I don't know the words in Spanish,

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:38.730
I use Italian words,

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.690
which works very often.

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:41.450
But anyway,

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.650
it's just a sentence that I find quite useful because that's the situation in which it

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:46.290
comes up.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.850
I also mentioned my Korean sentence that that I use the trigger sentence there and it's

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:52.410
usually sheep,

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:53.560
onion toe hunger,

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.770
okay,

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:54.620
said a soil.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:55.480
And then,

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.450
um and then I continue.

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:03.250
And the reason for this is once again if it comes up the last me o d speak Korean or you

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.640
know do you?

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.000
Uh,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.310
White?

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.830
How do you speak Korean or something like that?

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:07.180
Actually,

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.640
usually I'll start it off with how you might tell no tale.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:10.430
And then I continue.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.730
So hung.

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.720
My channel tail means I don't really speak Korean.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.320
And I find it better to be a bit too humble that not and quite frank with my crew,

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.390
my level of korean.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:19.590
I'm not being humble there at all.

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.380
But then I continue and I say,

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:22.350
0 15 years ago,

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.470
I lived in Korea or 15 years ago.

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.210
I lived in Korea for around two years,

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.430
but now I've pretty much forgotten everything.

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:29.700
And then I continue.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.290
So I have these trigger sentences,

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.200
usually 1 to 3 sentences that I sort of have memorized.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.060
And so when the situation arises,

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.400
I can use those right away.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.280
And hopefully those with the response I get from the person I'm talking to will be enough

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.500
to help me get into the flow of the language so I can start speaking it again.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.460
And so this is what I recommend you do as well.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:52.050
Uh,

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.900
when you when you've been learning your language.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.160
If you want to maintain a long term memorize a couple couple what I call trigger sentences

00:04:59.160 --> 00:04:59.160
,

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.380
sentences that sort of triggered in your brain.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:02.440
That and that help you out.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.870
And usually I suggest that you pick a sentence that somewhat useful.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:07.950
Depending on the situation,

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.810
it will usually have something to do with why you speak that language.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:11.970
If you speak that language,

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.200
how you learn the language,

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.090
something along those lines,

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.650
that's usually what people ask when bringing up a new language.
