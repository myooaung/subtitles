00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.850
So this section I just want to cover some other tips and tricks for language learning that

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.150
hopefully you can find useful.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.760
So the 1st 1 that I wanted to mention is immersion.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.580
I've already mentioned that the more you can immerse yourself in a language,

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.530
and the more intense the submersion could be,

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:15.830
the better it is usually.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.010
And obviously this means that if you can go to another country and keep using the language

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:22.090
with everyone there,

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.910
then that would be the best option.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:24.460
Absolutely.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.730
But very often too often,

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.510
usually this isn't the case.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.360
We just can't do this because we have a life wherever we live and we have to Ah,

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.960
live there.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:34.850
And we also have to work.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:35.910
And we have relationships,

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:36.270
etcetera,

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.640
etcetera,

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.840
and we can't just pick up and go toe our country of choice.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.630
So what else can we do?

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.150
And recently I didn't try this myself.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.810
I've tried various aspects of it,

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:46.430
but I was,

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.750
ah,

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.750
talking to someone recently who did try to do this as much as possible.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.920
He was in the States and he was learning Spanish,

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:00.300
and he wanted to immerse himself as much as possible into Spanish itself into the Spanish

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:00.870
language.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.520
And so he found a local community college that offered my classes Monday through Thursday.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.180
So he signed up for all the night classes Monday through Thursday so he could use it every

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.650
evening.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.430
They weren't offered on Friday,

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.800
Saturday,

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.240
Sunday,

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.590
he said,

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.050
which is the only reason why I didn't go.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.830
But he did find its OK.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.920
He found every Sunday they would have movies in Spanish,

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:21.630
and in fact,

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.930
I think they had two or three in a row and he would watch all the movies that were

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.110
available in Spanish.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.820
Obviously,

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.490
while there he is with a lot of other Spanish speakers and so he can talk to them.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:38.740
He also found Thea local consulate would organize weekly like get togethers or sessions.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.510
I don't remember exactly which consulate look at Spanish speaking consulate and just

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.860
attending all these events that they have,

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:51.880
and basically he was trying to find every single opportunity to speak Spanish that he could

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.700
in his town any time he could find,

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.940
say,

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.540
a barber or grocery store or anything like that with Spanish speakers,

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.120
he changed to that one and because he wanted to once again use it at any opportunity,

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.360
whether he's cutting his hair with his buying groceries or running errands,

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.980
etcetera.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.820
And so he was able to structure his life with as much immersion as possible,

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.770
even without living in any Spanish speaking country.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.310
And obviously this.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.300
If you live in the states in learning Spanish,

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.820
this is a lot easier than many other languages because Spanish is quite prevalent in the

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:23.280
states,

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.300
so it will depend on what language your learning and where you find yourself at this time.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:34.250
But it could be an interesting exercise to try to immerse yourself as much as possible into

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.250
a certain language,

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.200
no matter what language your learning.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.760
Just make a list of every single opportunity you have in your city in your town to,

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.450
ah,

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.300
to listen to the language,

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.760
to speak the language,

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:53.010
to read and write the language and try to maximize this quote unquote immersion even

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.720
without going to the country where they speak your language.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.450
Oh yeah,

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.330
and I should mention he also did all the usual tricks work.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.690
He said he changed his phone in his computer to all Spanish language,

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.260
and he would watch any TV show if he could find the Spanish language version.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.900
He was basically watching Spanish TV once again,

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.100
any opportunity he got to immerse himself,

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.870
he would do it a smudge as possible.

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:15.880
And then later on,

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.380
he was finally able to go.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.450
He was able to go to Mexico and he traveled a bit around Central America and he was able to

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.980
improve upon his Spanish even more after that.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.150
And then you worked in a local court as an interpreter in Spanish,

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.610
so he was able to use it quite a bit.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.700
But he credits this initial immersion that he went through in his own city as,

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:36.340
ah,

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.450
as really the catalyst.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.900
And we're really helped him learn quickly.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:40.310
Later on,

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.490
when he did get a chance to go to Central America because he already had the basis.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.650
He already had been having conversations with people,

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.750
and he already had quite a good level of this language.
