00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.085
Under this video, will work together on setting up

00:00:05.085 --> 00:00:10.305
the Bootstrap framework under our Angular project.

00:00:10.305 --> 00:00:16.320
So you can see that this framework is capable of interacting with jQuery,

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.875
React, Angular, and is based on no Bootstrap.

00:00:22.875 --> 00:00:27.780
So you have different capabilities to work with if

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.700
you are trying to integrate UI abortion for your system.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.580
So this is the main page and it has a bunch of components that i o,

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.710
I can show you here.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.360
You are free to interact with them and basically study them.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:55.670
And our focus is to install this and the bootstrap framework under our Angular app.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:04.320
So these quick installation guide will help us settings up together.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.000
So as a prerequisite,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.460
you need to have no GS and Angular CLI installed.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:21.320
We should skip this manual installation process and go beat

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:30.430
down and go under the section.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.830
So for the first step,

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.765
create new Angular project.

00:01:34.765 --> 00:01:38.605
Where do you handle this in the previous video?

00:01:38.605 --> 00:01:44.210
Where we created the front-end Angular project.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:51.670
And since we are using MDB angular version nine and later,

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.775
we need to install the angular CBK package.

00:01:57.775 --> 00:02:07.605
So let's do this on their project New Terminal.

00:02:07.605 --> 00:02:11.614
And this tau, this package.

00:02:11.614 --> 00:02:17.195
Of course MD bootstrap has free and the paid version,

00:02:17.195 --> 00:02:23.340
and we'll use the free version for our contact form.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.519
Okay, this package has been installed.

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:43.460
Now let us move back and installed the MDB angular three version of this framework.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:50.220
Let's copy this command pasted here.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.760
And of course run it.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:02.430
Wave for the corresponding packages could be installed.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:08.780
Now we need to update the app module.js to take into

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.120
account and the Bootstrap modal force we need to,

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.905
of course, import is module from Angular bootstrap MD.

00:03:18.905 --> 00:03:22.410
So I copy this command.

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:30.060
And under app mode two Ts just pasted.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.495
And of course under the import section,

00:03:35.495 --> 00:03:43.230
we need to copy this command and paste it here.

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.985
Now as a next step,

00:03:49.985 --> 00:03:55.850
we need to update the styles and scripts in Angular JSON, so forth.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.490
We copy the style section.

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:13.820
So on the Angular Jason can see those styles.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.155
Here.

00:04:15.155 --> 00:04:25.595
I remove this and paste specific section for taking into account the Bootstrap framework.

00:04:25.595 --> 00:04:30.240
And we need to do the same for the scripts section.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.330
Scripts are, is empty.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.560
And we need this to GIS files.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:52.340
Now, we need to install several low components on just chart Font, Awesome,

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.550
hammered GS, animate CSS

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.310
using the npm install command.

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:19.520
Okay, that's great. It has been installed.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.390
Now we need to review that under

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:32.410
packaged JSON Angular bootstrap MD in

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:39.800
place and all the other libraries that we setup using these commands.

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.820
And you see now that we have an issue over here,

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.545
in order to fix this,

00:05:45.545 --> 00:05:52.940
we need to restart the application and run the MPM start.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:06:00.480
For the Bootstrap and the Bootstrap model to be taken into account.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:11.480
Now, all data will be compiled and the project works as expected.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:20.280
We have the app works page in place. So we're good to go.
