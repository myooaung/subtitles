00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.875
Hi guys, and welcome to this programming class where we will build

00:00:04.875 --> 00:00:08.790
a complete contact form that can be integrated on

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.500
your website and is capable of sending emails.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.210
As part of this class will focus both on the front end,

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.524
building our contact form using Angular type script and a framework called MD Bootstrap.

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:26.955
But also on the backend side,

00:00:26.955 --> 00:00:30.990
where we'll greater Spring Boot based server that is capable of

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.955
sending emails using a predefined Gmail account.

00:00:35.955 --> 00:00:44.460
Of course, I will guide you on the step-by-step flow on welding this entire process.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:53.990
Let's take a look on a quick example of what exactly will build as part of this class.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:59.735
So we have a contact form in place where four different fields.

00:00:59.735 --> 00:01:07.310
As you can see, validation is automatically in place since we have those red lines.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.995
And if we set specific data for each of the four fields,

00:01:12.995 --> 00:01:15.530
so named John Carter,

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:22.174
valid email, maybe something more official for the subject.

00:01:22.174 --> 00:01:25.685
We can go with, reschedule the meeting.

00:01:25.685 --> 00:01:28.640
And as for the message,

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.110
let's do something like high loss, right?

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:42.350
To reschedule the meeting for next week and tanks.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.610
And now when we click on the Send button,

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.700
we see this informative message at the top.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.880
Unless move through the Spring Boot back-end server.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.150
You see that in male-centered success.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.740
And now let's navigate to our email

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.255
and you can see that we are able to receive the email.

00:02:14.255 --> 00:02:18.395
So the front-end to backend communication is done.

00:02:18.395 --> 00:02:24.770
And we are able to interact and receive an email is in our Gmail account.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:31.710
So let's move forward and see how we can build this entire functionality.
