WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
Now, since we have to type script file in place,

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:11.100
we need to focus on building the HTML part of our contact form.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.060
So we will build something similar to this.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:23.560
So let's go back to our project and navigate to contact component HTML file.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:34.120
And first, let's remove this contact works P tag.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:41.200
And we should also increase the visibility.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.165
And now let's start building the modal dialog.

00:00:47.165 --> 00:00:52.969
So div, MDB model,

00:00:52.969 --> 00:01:00.650
hashtag frame in dB monel.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:08.420
Please note that we intentionally set the frame over there.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.310
End should match the view child element as frame type script file.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.965
Using this approach were referenced.

00:01:18.965 --> 00:01:26.150
Modal dialogue from the Type script fall inside this HTML.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.730
Div tag plus modal fade

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:39.449
the left id frame.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.510
We need the tab index minus one.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:49.080
And for the roll dialog,

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.560
label

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:07.070
by or

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:14.880
frame area hidden true.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.510
And we close this tape.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.565
So inside this div,

00:02:19.565 --> 00:02:22.235
we need to construct the actual form.

00:02:22.235 --> 00:02:32.370
So let's start using the div class modal dialog, overall document.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:43.650
And inside this div class model content.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.470
And inside the modal content div

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.800
will need to set the div class modal header to construct the header.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.689
Text centered.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.250
H4 class modal title.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.625
Since many dot title for all dialogue.

00:03:10.625 --> 00:03:13.730
V minus 100.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.730
Font, weight bold.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.750
And for the title, let's go with a contact form.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.220
Now div class modal

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:49.560
body m x minus x3.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:55.770
We're building the body of our contact form

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:19.850
div class n deform,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.530
MV minus five.

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:35.980
Let's set in place an icon using MDB icon, icon user.

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:43.390
And of class prefix, gray text.

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.990
We close the MDB icon,

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.990
input type text ID.

00:04:53.990 --> 00:05:02.670
Let's set the form 34 class form control.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:15.245
Mdb input, MDB, validate, form control.

00:05:15.245 --> 00:05:20.885
And the validation should be made on the contact form model name.

00:05:20.885 --> 00:05:30.000
So this matches the contact form model name that we set in type script file.

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:46.190
We need to set the label for this input text.

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:51.170
So labeled for form 34.

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:54.750
And we'll go with a name.

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:04.865
And in case of any errors with a contact form model name,

00:06:04.865 --> 00:06:11.585
we need to just generate this using MDB error. Ng-if.

00:06:11.585 --> 00:06:15.930
Contact form model name invalid.

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:24.300
And the contact form, modern name,

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:35.340
dirty or contact form modern name touched.

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:44.669
Let's close this properly.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:57.245
And let's also handle the case where we didn't receive any issues.

00:06:57.245 --> 00:07:00.470
And validating the contact form model name.

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:08.060
So MDB success will

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:14.360
need to use the ng-if statement similar to the MDB error.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:19.340
So if contact form model name,

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:23.840
valid and contact form model name,

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:29.675
dirty or contact form model name touched.

00:07:29.675 --> 00:07:34.985
So it's set in place the input for the user.

00:07:34.985 --> 00:07:44.215
And we are handling also the cases where this input or receive any issues.

00:07:44.215 --> 00:07:51.290
So it was not validated properly or it was validated with success.

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:04.675
Okay, so it looks good now we have the name here,

00:08:04.675 --> 00:08:07.630
MDB error and NDP success.

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:11.720
So once again, we handle this particle far form.

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:27.860
We need to move to the second item in our form.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:33.450
So div class ND form

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:42.080
m a minus five will set an icon.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:52.740
And dv, I confess, icon, envelope, prefix.

00:08:55.900 --> 00:09:03.450
Great texts will close the NDP icon tag.

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:09.620
The input type will be email this time.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:22.539
Id form 29 plus form control.

00:09:22.539 --> 00:09:25.490
And the B input.

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:36.475
And we also need the MDB validate for the form control.

00:09:36.475 --> 00:09:43.945
And this time we need to validate the email corresponding input.

00:09:43.945 --> 00:09:46.030
Or this is called, if you recall,

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:47.550
in our type script file,

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:50.340
that form model email.

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:03.724
And let's copy this statement.

00:10:03.724 --> 00:10:06.470
Mvb add or an.

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:08.975
And the best success.

00:10:08.975 --> 00:10:17.970
Unless only change this contact form model name to contact form email.

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:28.560
So we will handle using this approach though error and also the success features.

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:34.319
While validating this email statement.

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:45.005
Now let's build the third element in our form.

00:10:45.005 --> 00:10:52.640
So div class n deform MB

00:10:52.640 --> 00:11:01.680
minus five MDB icon, icon.

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:15.110
And we'll use tag as prefix, great texts.

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:18.180
And DB icon.

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:30.420
Input type will go this time with text.

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:35.810
Ideal form. 32.

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:38.940
Form Control of course,

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:46.085
will set validation also for this field.

00:11:46.085 --> 00:11:54.720
So MDB input and DB validate form control.

00:11:54.840 --> 00:12:00.590
And the name is contact form model subject.

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:12.280
Let's set a label for it.

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:16.850
So labeled for form 32.

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:20.770
Name will be subject.

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:29.650
And once again, let's copy paste MDB error and MDB success corresponding tags.

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:33.475
And we will also need to change the contact form model,

00:12:33.475 --> 00:12:38.550
email to contact form model law subject.

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:45.660
So let's do this.

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:55.380
And also for the n dB success.

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:09.900
Okay, good. So the third field is created now.

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:23.480
Now for the fourth one,

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:29.750
div class and

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:39.080
deform and DB icon.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:41.279
Icon.

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:56.220
Oh, pencil out class prefix, gray text.

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:01.295
And let's close the.

00:14:01.295 --> 00:14:04.320
Db icon or tag.

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:18.215
Now we'll use the tectorial type of text ID as grow it.

00:14:18.215 --> 00:14:21.330
Form eight.

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:26.705
And for the class MD textarea,

00:14:26.705 --> 00:14:37.620
form control rows, one, MDB input.

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:43.410
And of course the validation should be set in place.

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:56.095
Form control of contact form,

00:14:56.095 --> 00:15:06.320
modal message, in this case, textarea tag.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.270
Now let's set the label for it.

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:14.060
So label for Form eight.

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:20.965
And we'll go with the message statement.

00:15:20.965 --> 00:15:27.495
Of course, we need to handle the validation here.

00:15:27.495 --> 00:15:31.610
So I copy pasted and we'll just change the contact form model

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:36.335
subject with conduct for modal message.

00:15:36.335 --> 00:15:39.960
So pasted here here.

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:44.640
And also for the NDP success.

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:59.880
Now let's save the file, compile successfully.

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:08.915
And you see that we encounter an issue,

00:16:08.915 --> 00:16:11.480
of course in template.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:16.955
So we have an issue related to the form control.

00:16:16.955 --> 00:16:20.730
And of course we need to fix this.

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:28.010
So in order to fix this,

00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:35.880
we need to navigate to the app module type script file,

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:39.845
where all our modules are.

00:16:39.845 --> 00:16:43.860
Register for our angular application.

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:53.060
Over here and under the imports statement.

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:59.130
Let's import actually though a reactive forms module.

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:04.415
Since we will need this for our form validation.

00:17:04.415 --> 00:17:08.880
And you see now that we compiled successfully the code.

00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:24.185
Now since we have all these four fields in place,

00:17:24.185 --> 00:17:33.800
it's time to also create specific button that we need to click on in our form.

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:36.630
So let's do this.

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:43.950
So div class modal footer,

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:56.610
d minus flex, justify, contents center.

00:17:57.010 --> 00:18:00.005
And let's close this div.

00:18:00.005 --> 00:18:03.755
And we need to set in place a button, of course.

00:18:03.755 --> 00:18:09.440
So similar to this button to actually respond to

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:15.780
art or for more submission process.

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:38.300
So this button will only be visible if the validating form is valid.

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:45.910
You seen in type script file that we have for more of

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:54.820
our Angular app set in place for the validating for more specific variable.

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:58.320
So we set a bunch of properties.

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:02.240
And the bottom color primary waves,

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:05.460
light, MDB waves effect.

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:10.355
And we'll also need an icon for this.

00:19:10.355 --> 00:19:16.470
So Python paper plane

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:25.020
plus ML minus1 and close the MDB icon.

00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:29.750
Let's compile the source code.

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:34.080
And of course saved this contact form.

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:39.480
Now let us see how this will look.

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:49.535
And in fact, we don't see anything.

00:19:49.535 --> 00:19:56.960
Since the frame is not visible in the UI.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:01.265
Since we don't have any specific logic to

00:20:01.265 --> 00:20:07.025
expose the frame where we navigate to the contact form.

00:20:07.025 --> 00:20:15.635
So let's use an Angular model lifecycle method and G After view init.

00:20:15.635 --> 00:20:21.035
So this frame modal show,

00:20:21.035 --> 00:20:25.630
since the frame model is the child element,

00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:30.385
that gesture nice though, contact form.

00:20:30.385 --> 00:20:33.610
And we have an issue here on the subject.

00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:43.850
So let's fix this to see what's the problem in the HTML side of our contact form.

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:54.235
So I am checking for the subject.

00:20:54.235 --> 00:20:56.770
So this is email.

00:20:56.770 --> 00:21:02.800
And for the subject on the class we missed the x,

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.630
so it should be prefix.

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:14.915
Kay, so the subject is fixed.

00:21:14.915 --> 00:21:19.400
What will also need to fix the email since we

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:25.200
forgot to basically add a label for the email.

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:27.800
So let's add this.

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:34.650
So labeled for form 29.

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:43.385
Let's go with email impulse successfully.

00:21:43.385 --> 00:21:45.725
And the form is in place name,

00:21:45.725 --> 00:21:47.705
email, subject and message.

00:21:47.705 --> 00:21:51.695
And we see that we don't have a button at the bottom.

00:21:51.695 --> 00:21:54.440
But if we complete all the details,

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.675
the bottom will appear.

00:21:56.675 --> 00:22:03.170
So you see that we have the validation already in place.

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:04.985
If we don't set our name,

00:22:04.985 --> 00:22:07.444
email, subject, or message.

00:22:07.444 --> 00:22:12.499
I'm talking here about the red lines.

00:22:12.499 --> 00:22:16.710
So let's add specific name.

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:22.740
We see that the red line turn to green.

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:30.750
If you don't want to add a valid e-mail.

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:35.360
This is also in the UI.

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:37.685
Now, using a valid e-mail,

00:22:37.685 --> 00:22:40.295
the red line turned to green,

00:22:40.295 --> 00:22:43.520
the subject and the message,

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:45.800
and you see the button appeared.

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:52.230
What we need to fix the label for the bottom.

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:58.860
The actual text that should appear on top of the bottom.

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:03.569
So let's do this.

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:11.880
So we're here to add a cent.

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:20.750
Let's do another text on our contact form.

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:30.935
So Alex, Alex, Alex gmail.com, subject message.

00:23:30.935 --> 00:23:35.580
And you see that we have another type over here.

00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:45.350
In this way, you will see how many errors you might get while working on a real project.

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:54.600
So we can fix this by changing the NDP icon from far too fast.

00:23:57.790 --> 00:24:01.010
So over here, the typo.

00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:04.415
And now everything should be in place.

00:24:04.415 --> 00:24:06.680
A final test.

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:15.170
So Alex, an email subject,

00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:21.005
and the message and the send button is in place.

00:24:21.005 --> 00:24:25.830
Using also the corresponding icon.
