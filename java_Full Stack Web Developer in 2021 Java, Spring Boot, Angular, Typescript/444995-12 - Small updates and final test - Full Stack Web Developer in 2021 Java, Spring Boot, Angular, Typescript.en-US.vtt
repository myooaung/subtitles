00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.475
Under this video, I would like to make some small improvements to our HTML contact form,

00:00:06.475 --> 00:00:11.755
such as when the user will click on the Send button and the form is validated,

00:00:11.755 --> 00:00:13.540
the name e-mail subject,

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.365
and message fields will become empty.

00:00:17.365 --> 00:00:22.690
And also, I would like to focus a bit on

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:30.430
the message that is displayed on the top to be removed after three seconds.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.080
So let's see how can we achieve this.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:43.369
So we're back to our Contact, the component ds.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.710
Let's see what we can do here.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:54.355
So our main focus will be under the contact service send email,

00:00:54.355 --> 00:01:02.515
corresponding method, since this will be the entry point for our Send process.

00:01:02.515 --> 00:01:09.025
So over here, if we are able to send the email with success,

00:01:09.025 --> 00:01:13.450
we will invoke the validating form reset method

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.160
to basically empty all the fields in the contact form.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:27.860
And in order to achieve the Frick seconds for message visibility,

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.255
we will use the setTimeout method.

00:01:32.255 --> 00:01:36.350
And inside this method,

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.380
let's do something like this.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.045
The informed message will become empty.

00:01:44.045 --> 00:01:50.639
And let's set 3 thousand milliseconds the interval.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:01.100
And of course we can copy paste dysfunctionality under

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:08.220
the north side of our forum interaction process.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:22.550
The data is saved and we can now do a quick test for this.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.250
So let's go with John Carter,

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.825
the name for the email,

00:02:31.825 --> 00:02:35.750
John Carter at gmail.com.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.685
For the subject.

00:02:39.685 --> 00:02:43.240
That's also make something more official.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.720
So let's reschedule the meeting.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.550
And for the message as go into hi,

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:57.480
I would like to rescheduled meeting for next week.

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.170
Please.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.675
Let me know if it's possible.

00:03:08.675 --> 00:03:10.805
And thanks.

00:03:10.805 --> 00:03:13.295
Let's click on the sand.

00:03:13.295 --> 00:03:17.810
We see that the form has been reset and after three seconds

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:25.140
that message has been removed from the UI.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.925
And on the Gmail,

00:03:28.925 --> 00:03:37.320
we were able to receive the email sent from the contact from in the UI.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.770
Now another thing that we need to focus on a small improvement that I

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.660
like to do is that you see that if I click outside the contact form,

00:03:52.660 --> 00:04:02.095
the contact form is hidden now and we are not able to get back to it.

00:04:02.095 --> 00:04:04.510
So in order to fix this,

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:10.195
we can use the closed event of our MDP model.

00:04:10.195 --> 00:04:14.290
And when the closed event is in place,

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.010
we will use this frame model dot show.

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.880
So the contact dialogue will always be

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:29.100
shown to the user even if he closes it by mistake or not.

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.990
So this contact form,

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.700
both front-end and back-end functionality is set in

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.740
place using validation and Gmail email integration.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.185
Thank you for attendance guys,

00:04:45.185 --> 00:04:50.010
and hope to see you on next class.
