00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.575
Now it's time to make use of the MD bootstrap framework under our Angular application.

00:00:07.575 --> 00:00:15.670
So for this, we will need to build contacts dialogue.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.320
So under MD bootstrap.com,

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.500
if we click on the left side of the screen,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.189
we can open this menu and select the modal forms.

00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:41.770
Since we will use this as a reference to build our contact form.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.480
See here under this page,

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.875
we have different types of forms,

00:00:48.875 --> 00:00:53.555
register form, subscription for.

00:00:53.555 --> 00:01:03.570
And we'll focus on this simple model contact form or build something similar.

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.970
And our, our application.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:15.305
And we need to focus first on the type script file.

00:01:15.305 --> 00:01:18.785
So let's increase the font size.

00:01:18.785 --> 00:01:23.400
And lambda are our contact component, ds.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.550
For sled. Let us set in place

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:36.230
a child element that will map to our modal dialog.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.300
So this will make a connection from our type script file to

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:48.815
our specific contact component HTML file.

00:01:48.815 --> 00:01:58.469
So the modal dialog will be called frame and will be of type of modal directive.

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:08.495
Now we need to set in place validating form of type of

00:02:08.495 --> 00:02:17.970
form group that will keep all our elements from the modal dialog.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.510
Now under the NGO onInit method,

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.575
we need to define the structure of our form.

00:02:33.575 --> 00:02:41.100
So this.tab value taking form equals new form group.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:52.325
And over here we will define a few elements such as contact form.

00:02:52.325 --> 00:03:03.210
Model name is will map to the user name.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:12.125
So you form control, EMT.

00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:15.935
And we'll also need validators,

00:03:15.935 --> 00:03:23.880
required statement so that we'll be able to validate the form.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.875
The second one will be contact form.

00:03:30.875 --> 00:03:33.540
Modal, email,

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:46.940
New Form Control, empty string here.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.695
And for this, we'll need to use two validators,

00:03:51.695 --> 00:03:56.610
1-4 email and one pore required.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.939
Okay.

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:13.475
Now for the toward the element, contact form,

00:04:13.475 --> 00:04:17.580
modal subject,

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.955
new form control.

00:04:25.955 --> 00:04:31.500
And of course the validators required.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.650
And the last one will be contact form,

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:50.375
modal message, new home control.

00:04:50.375 --> 00:04:55.625
And the same thing with validate those required.

00:04:55.625 --> 00:05:00.695
So we will have four elements in our form.

00:05:00.695 --> 00:05:09.695
And all of them will be validated automatically using this process.

00:05:09.695 --> 00:05:20.700
So that the user will not be able to submit them unless we have valid data for the user.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:32.720
Now for all these four elements in our form group,

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.469
we need to set in place getter methods.

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.090
So let's do this.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:48.695
So this getter methods will be used under our next video,

00:05:48.695 --> 00:05:55.860
where we will set in place the contact component HTML file.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:08.090
So we set in place the get contact form model name and thus were returned.

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:16.490
This validating form. Let's fix this.

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.820
So this validating form that

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:28.290
get and we are interested in the contact form model name.

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:42.870
Now the second getter method, contact form, email.

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:48.350
It turn this validating form that

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:55.980
get of contact form email.

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:10.589
Another method for the contact form model subject.

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:16.340
It turn this validating form that

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:24.019
get contact for modal subject.

00:07:24.019 --> 00:07:31.410
And the final one on top for modal message.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:44.150
Return turn this validating form of contact for modal message.

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:49.710
So we have this four getter methods in place.

00:07:51.700 --> 00:08:02.480
And each one of them will map the map actually an element form the form group.

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:06.980
So what we have so far or view child elements

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:12.350
to have a reference to our dialogue that will create in the next video.

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:16.640
Also validating form of time form group.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:26.240
These validating form has four elements with specific validators in place and also

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:36.540
will have this for getter methods to be properly used on Door, our HTML Component.

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:44.640
Now let's start the application to see if we have any issues so far.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:53.375
Behind the scenes, the NG serve minus minus o is executed.

00:08:53.375 --> 00:08:56.630
And the application will start.

00:08:56.630 --> 00:09:03.215
Now it's compiling and should be opened on there,

00:09:03.215 --> 00:09:10.745
our default browser and can be accessible on port 4,200.

00:09:10.745 --> 00:09:16.115
And you see that we still receive the contact works message.

00:09:16.115 --> 00:09:19.325
So we don't have any issues so far.

00:09:19.325 --> 00:09:22.940
And we're good to go in order to build

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:30.425
the actual HTML page for this contact form dialogue.

00:09:30.425 --> 00:09:34.380
So in the next video, we'll do this.
