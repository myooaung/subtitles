00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.850
So now we've seen how two sets of profile.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:09.040
Let's see how we can use it so we can go to this configuration objects which we have here

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:09.920
so app conflict.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.990
And currently this is the configuration for the whole application.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:14.880
In other words,

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.590
there's nothing environment specific about this configuration.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:18.490
In fact,

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.580
there's nothing in the configuration because it's just enabling component scanning

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.190
basically and reading in an application dot properties file.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:24.820
But nevertheless,

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.430
this application properties for which is here doesn't have anything that's specific to the

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:29.820
environment.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.810
Is just environment agnostic in that respect.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.450
So let's change the application to make it environment away.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.050
So we could basically change this.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.660
Found them here toe application,

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.550
local properties on just reflected that they also changes it here as well.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.050
And then we use this of annotation called profile.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:58.850
So now what this is saying is that the app config configuration being will only be enabled

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:58.850
,

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:59.420
in other words,

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.880
will only be actually instance created boy the spring consider itself when the local

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.850
profile is running get so if I go back now to app,

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.620
the local profile is running.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.530
So if I run this with control shift our then we'll see that it still works.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.910
The difference being is that it's actually picking up a property found are based on the

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.000
profile that's passed him.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.490
So let's make it a little bit more explicit that it's doing that and replaced his property

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.500
with something like,

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.560
I imagine you've got arrest service like service Not Best.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.870
You're L.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:28.500
For example,

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.570
seven.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.290
Starvation really equals If we look from them in a local profile.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.200
Imagine we've got some resting point running on the local machine,

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.400
which is available at this euro,

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.670
says the local host.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.190
You're all basically and imagine.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.750
Furthermore,

00:01:44.750 --> 00:02:01.300
just copy that that the service itself needs to have a reference now to make a Web service

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:07.950
call or arrest call So private string just a service issue a role.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:08.580
For example.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.370
We'll just use caps just to make it clear that it's not something that can change.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.450
Even that's not explicitly a constant.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.150
The use of it's a constant is used in a constant contexts.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.470
That's fine on that.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.450
If you just go down here,

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:33.850
we could just say Connecting to on Service Special.

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.860
So now what should happen just to recap is that we've got serviced up Bayshore Oh,

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.550
which is injected into this field here.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:51.450
This comes from this property here and this property file he's picked up.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.250
It's got this environment suffix on the profile suffix dash local.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.660
It's picked up because come pick has a local profile.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.890
And finally,

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.010
because the spring that proposed active it's set to local sort of the words were running in

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.800
that profile mud.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.800
So now if we control shifter,

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.730
we should see it connecting to local host,

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.160
or at least a message that says it's connected to a local host.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.710
Actually,

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:25.850
just need Teoh change its resolve with property placeholder instead,

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.300
that's my bad apologies and then rerun.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.970
And there you can see it's now you know,

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.260
in theory will be connecting to local host.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.850
Okay,

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:38.910
that's good.

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.270
That supports kind of like a local development environment profile if you like.

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:43.200
And in the next video,

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.650
we'll see how we can enhance that has supported production profile based on conditional

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:47.110
beans
