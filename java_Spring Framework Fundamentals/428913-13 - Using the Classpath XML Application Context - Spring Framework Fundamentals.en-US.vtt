00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
So now we've seen how to use the file based XML application context to configure Springs

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:06.880
container.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.460
Let's see now how easy it is just to convert that and to change the file based mechanism to

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.460
a class path based one.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.890
So here this is the application context which is loading from a file.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.050
We could change this and swap this out for a class path external application context.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.790
You know,

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.920
that import their control option on doing this now,

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.020
this would still work in exactly the same way before provided that it confined the

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.790
application context XML file.

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:30.850
So to do this,

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:31.900
it needs to be in the class path.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.810
So we need to have basically resources folder here.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:40.660
You probably know that in Nevin you have production source guard in source Main Java inside

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:41.620
that subdirectory.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:42.240
Similarly,

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.400
if you have a source Men Resources folder which will create now,

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:54.570
this is where you can place additional resources which need to be available and accessible

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.290
on the class path of the running application.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.990
So already to do now is to put this application context XML file into the resources folder

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:01.990
.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.680
So it's in there now on.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.780
This means that when we run it,

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.040
everything should run as it did before.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.800
So control shift are to run again and yet began.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:15.630
You could see it saying,

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.540
doing something important And if we actually have a look inside the target directory,

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.260
so in 11 or production source code that's compiled on any resources which need to be

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.700
available in a class path under the Source Men Resources folder Independence Target

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.000
Classics Subdirectory on inside here,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.870
you can see we've got the usual quest files would expect for the applications to update

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.290
class in my service Top class,

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:42.650
which is job a compiler.

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:43.450
Compile for us,

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.300
and we've also got this application Context XML on that you sits alongside alongside their

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.160
in effectively the rule of the class letter,

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.110
which is here under target classes.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.190
So that's how you get up and running with the spring container.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.720
As you can see,

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.560
it's not that difficult,

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.460
but there's a lot more to it and get much more sophisticated in terms of configuration on

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.950
the actual things that we can do with it.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.510
So we get to delving further in the next videos
