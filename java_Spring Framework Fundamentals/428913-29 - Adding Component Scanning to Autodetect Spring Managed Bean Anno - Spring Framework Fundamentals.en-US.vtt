00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.870
So what will it just being now with how the XML driven configuration works to configure the

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:06.650
spring container?

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:08.170
And now we know how that works.

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.780
Let's take a look at the annotation best way or being able to declare beans.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:17.090
So what I mean by this is when we created beans in XML way,

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.050
we did it with these tanks.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.340
So that was the being tag being elements so being element or being tag creates have bean or

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.670
bean definition mother so that we're gonna come to the concept of components scaling on

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.830
this is actually where we have to bring in a different scheme American reference,

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.650
which is part of spring context.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.100
So if I try now to its right context,

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.360
you see,

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.880
it's in red.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.600
I can't get any auto complete stiffs.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.750
Let's just fix that quickly.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.740
So we're gonna put in a new name space.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.010
How much chocolate context Intelligent is giving us suggestions.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.040
So we'll use this one.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.600
So you'll recall that basically,

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.860
each module has its schemer underneath this double double spring framework torque schema

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:54.280
path,

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:08.580
and then all going to do is to take this and we're gonna add that name's base on map it to

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.580
,

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.170
but corresponding schema,

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.550
which is on here.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.430
So now when we start to type context,

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.580
we can see we have the auto complete working for us.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.040
So now we're just one directive coal,

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.470
which is the components can,

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.400
which is part of spring context.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.990
We're going to enable what's known as auto wiring and whereas before we've manually wired

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.700
things together,

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.010
those of the bits where we've bean putting ref equals and then the name of the idea of the

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.840
being that we want to wire into another being seen that with the references that we just

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.520
used with auto wiring Spring does it for us on.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.260
All we have to do is to apply annotations for this to happen.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.500
There,

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.670
too,

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.190
can irritations auto wired and component Refuelers as well.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.030
But those are basically the key ones animal demo.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.480
How to do that in the next videos.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.560
So what components getting is going to do?

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.190
And what this directive does is we basically supply a base package.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.140
That's a package of job a package.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.320
But it's gonna look into Andi.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.190
It's gonna basically introspect that package,

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.620
look inside it and actually create being definitions corresponding to classes that we have

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.860
in there,

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.870
which have the special annotations auto wide and component,

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:14.410
which will see.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.450
So let's take the package name here.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.590
So if I do shift F six,

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.920
that's rename Commander Billy just enables us to crab that package from the dialogue to it

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:25.390
after type.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.850
It just popped that in here,

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.690
close it off and then were also two components scanning in the XML file,

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.350
which will delve into in the next videos.
