00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
So now we're still gonna leave the external configuration file in there.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.070
And that's just basically because in the application context XML this the thing that's

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.620
kicking off the components can weaken again.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.160
Replace that is what were the job or approach.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.790
But let's just take it one step at a time.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.050
So the only configuration we have now is its components can.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.880
So when the application context loads in this file,

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.510
it's gonna look inside this package here for anything that's annotate without component and

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.070
create instance of those beans and anywhere it sees at Auto Wired,

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.450
it's going to inject those beans that are available inside its context.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.940
So the net effect is it's gonna be exactly the same,

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.700
but it just clean up nice and delicate.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.840
So life would you control shifty to debug.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.720
Here we can see we've got the service.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.830
So on my service on a game,

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.080
we've got the repository as well.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:55.100
That's the same repository we get because it's still a singleton sculpt bean.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.810
That's all fine.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.760
Nothing changes for a Scots car is just basically a lighter touch way of being able to

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.480
configure the spring container with the beans that you want to have in it.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.580
But other than that,

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.450
everything should be exactly the same and completely identical.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.450
See if when I do f nine to execute the method,

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.850
then you'll see the same result we had from before.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.640
That's replacing the external way off,

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.960
creating being definitions with the annotation,

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.900
where of creating being definitions,

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.490
using these java annotations.
