00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.790
So then we have components getting set up.

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.870
Let's look at how we can adapt existing service and repository classes to use the auto

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:08.710
wiring mechanism,

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.320
which is available in the spring container.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.580
So if we're going to my service,

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:24.940
get rid of the center and we're gonna put at component into this class on what this is

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.600
gonna do is it's gonna save to spring.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.280
This is a bean declaring it as a bean,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.300
which means that spring is gonna be responsible for creating it,

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.300
and then it's gonna become a candidate for auto wiring.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.290
In other words,

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.820
it's gonna be injectable into other places,

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.500
which was a different annotation on the different imitation is also wide.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:52.350
So we just put the corresponding that component on repository as well,

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.650
and they just take a step back.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.700
So here we've got that being my repository,

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.910
which spring is gonna manage.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:01.900
It's the spring Bean.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:02.850
So that component,

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:03.910
that's what that means.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.300
They We've also got my service,

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.530
which is also Spring bean,

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.760
which springs gonna manage,

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.440
but it has a dependency which is gonna be injected in.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.720
It's gonna be injected in by virtue of the fact we've got this auto wired annotation here,

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.830
so you can see that's a lot less boilerplate.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.470
It moves the kind of configuration driven approach,

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.450
which is a bit verbose to prefer into a nice light touch,

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:26.970
annotation based approach,

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.100
which lives in the job occurred.
