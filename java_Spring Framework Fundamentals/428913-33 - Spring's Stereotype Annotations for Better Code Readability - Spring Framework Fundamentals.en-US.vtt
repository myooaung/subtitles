00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880
Now we can see here.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:10.540
We've got this act component if we drill into the in fact into a hierarchy on it,

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.930
this shows us that the components is the most generic way in spring off declaring a being

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:16.950
that's managed by spring.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.490
But we have these other annotations to here as well,

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.530
which enable us to be more specific about the actual role that the bean is playing in an

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:24.670
enterprise application.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:25.520
And specifically,

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.210
for example,

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.920
if we had a Web controller.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.280
So if we had a control in a spring NBC application,

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.390
we wouldn't use component,

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.710
which use controller.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.010
So it's a component would use that controller and similar as well from service in

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.750
repository.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.300
We should really be using those as well,

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.310
the more specialized versions.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:50.270
So if you do at service and 20 of imports to get rid of that on in the repository,

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.260
do you want repository instead,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.100
again tidy imports,

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.090
then they should still work in exactly the same way.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.070
I'll just run it this time.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.480
I go to the AP class,

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.660
but you will get rid of that is what we don't need this anymore.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:10.020
But if I run this now again,

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.060
it's exactly the same issues that we've effectively marked up.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.460
Well,

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.140
actually annotated the individual classes that were using with the actual stereotype all

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.590
the role they play in the application.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.990
And this is nice because,

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.490
for example,

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:22.220
if you want to,

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:22.740
you know,

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:23.340
do a search,

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.840
look at all services in a Web application,

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.380
you could just do research on that service.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.000
If you want to look at all the controllers,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.650
you could do a search and at controller on that kind of thing.
