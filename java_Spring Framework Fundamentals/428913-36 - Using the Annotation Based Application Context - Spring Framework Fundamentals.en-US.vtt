00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
So I've just had a nice introduction to moving towards the X and almost a way of

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.970
configuring your beans in the spring container.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.070
And there's another way now,

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.640
which I can show you where you can completely get rid of the external file or together.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:13.850
So to do this,

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.930
we'll take a sledgehammer to this on.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:17.450
Delete it.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.210
Clear some of these down.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.750
Keep things a bit Tidier.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.590
Get rid of this.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:27.150
Okay,

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.600
so now we don't have the file anymore,

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.280
so this won't work,

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:31.910
obviously.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.460
So we said previously,

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.210
we have three different application concepts we can use to create the spring container with

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.720
the file based maximal application concepts one,

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.220
the class.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.050
But the 1st 1 which is this when we see here.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.770
And finally we have the annotation based one.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.000
So this is annotation conflict,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.170
application context,

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.770
start of the imports.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.200
So when we look at the argument this takes,

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.280
you can either take based packages like this.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.480
So,

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:56.990
for example,

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.310
we could just do what we did before.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:59.590
So calm your copy.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:00.620
It separates.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.740
Good to hear Shift F six.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:03.650
Copy that,

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.800
and then go to here.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.600
Can we run?

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.940
So now this is doing a component scanning that we've seen before,

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.280
but it's just doing an entirely non external based way
