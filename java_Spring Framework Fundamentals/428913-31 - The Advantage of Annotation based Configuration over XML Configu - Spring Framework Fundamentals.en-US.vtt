00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440
very quickly Before we move on.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.100
I just want to point out that cost these annotations live with the source code that they're

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:07.580
about.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.300
It means that it's very easy than to be able to interpret what's happening without

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.670
reference an XML file,

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:13.920
which references beans from here,

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:14.670
there and everywhere.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.080
You can just look at this definition.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.510
Now,

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.910
look at this class definition on you can see instantly.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:19.150
Okay?

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.100
It's a managed component to spring bean.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.360
It's gonna have this repository auto widen.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.160
So this repository should also be a spring mirrors.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.280
What?

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.550
I'm being that component just nice and clean.
