00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.330
So now we've made the changes for the Ceta based dependence injection approach.

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.850
We to also change the external configuration from using the constructor style to the set of

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:10.120
stone.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.000
So let's do that now.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.700
So we're gonna change this and the Tagle use for this is property and we give the name off

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:24.670
The property that we're going to use on the name of the property corresponds to the name of

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:25.260
the property.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.710
So here,

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.980
Repository has defined by what's prefixed with the word sent.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:37.600
So I'm gonna use that and we have two options with another.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.950
Give it a ref or a value.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.610
So the difference between these two value is basically pretty much a primitive that you

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.290
want to assign on the property.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.930
So,

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:46.370
for example,

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.510
if I had a property which was called set name,

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.090
then value,

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.760
I could pass in a simple string find set age for value,

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.700
aka Passen again A string which which represents ah numeric like an interview or something

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.700
.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.970
That's the value on.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.700
But we're gonna use ref because ref enables us to provide a reference to an existing being

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:04.780
in the spring context,

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.070
just like we saw before with the constructor dependency injection.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:17.890
So here we've got ref equals repository on this repository here corresponds to this.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.600
This is the I D.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.170
Under which that my repository being instance is bound in the spring context on this report

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.170
It for here refers to this here the name of the property,

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.110
which is this We used Camel case when we're doing the setter,

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.220
but just know that it's natural field itself.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.570
The fields name that is using.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.930
So now we've successfully set up a set of dependency injection in the XML configuration.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.140
We can test it out and make sure it works,

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.200
which would in the next video.
