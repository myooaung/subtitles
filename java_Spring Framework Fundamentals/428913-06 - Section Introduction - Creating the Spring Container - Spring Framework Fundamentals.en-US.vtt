00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.740
So in the previous section,

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.840
we had an introduction to getting started with spring,

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.470
and now we have Sprint set up in our projects so we could get our hands dirty in this

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.440
section as we start to use it in this section.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.270
Then we're going to look at the so called application context.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.120
There are few types of application context available,

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.620
which allow us to create and configure the spring container.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.360
That's the spring run time in which your spring managed beans will live.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.560
There are different ways of configuring.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.880
This,

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.540
as we'll see on in later sections,

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.240
will get into topics such as dependency,

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.480
injection and also wiring.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.250
But for now,

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.240
let's give our projects of spring container so that we can be up and running,

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.660
ready to put a card in there and have spring manage it for us.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.600
So let's get to it
