00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.040
we've seen how we can configure beans with the XML application context and through auto

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:06.350
wiring,

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.980
with annotations at components and at a little wired.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.820
Another way of configuring the beans is to use a job,

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.950
a configuration class which will explore now.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.750
So if I copy this to my clipboard for a second,

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.950
and then if we creates a new classical colleague,

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.350
come pick.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:29.050
And if we use this special annotation,

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.760
which is configuration,

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:37.730
then what we can do is we can pass that class into the annotation conflict application

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.900
context on it will basically use reflection to look inside this class itself to configure

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.750
the application.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.080
We'll see more of this in a second when we get to look at the at being annotation on the

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.410
job of this way of getting beans.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.360
But for now to continue with the components coming,

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:58.250
we could at this annotation here at components can on either person best packages equals,

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.270
and then I'll base package.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.430
So control shift.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.060
I will show that running that's fine.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.260
Or alternatively,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:12.690
we could make it a bit shorter and just use the default value for them and again control

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.150
shift our runs and shows everything is running as well.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.650
So now at this point,

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.300
we've completely removed the XML based configuration,

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.840
which is gonna like the old school way of doing things we've now moved into the annotation

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.100
best way of configuring Spring on.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.580
We're doing this entirely through annotations on the job of classes that are gonna be

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.610
spring manage beans.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.100
And we're doing that viral configuration class itself,

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.050
which we can also use.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.140
And we'll see this later as a factory to be able to create being instances.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.810
And this is really the modern way to be able to configure spring applications.
