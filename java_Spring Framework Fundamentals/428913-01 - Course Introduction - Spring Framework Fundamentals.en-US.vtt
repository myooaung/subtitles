00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.460
Welcome to this course on the spring framework where we cover the court acknowledges of the

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.250
spring container firsthand from the ground up in the first section.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:11.180
We're getting started,

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.260
so we'll get spring installed into our projects so we can start using it on point out,

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.060
some of the key resources you need to know is a job,

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.910
a spring developer.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:18.910
Next up,

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.060
we'll explore how we can create the spring container.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.610
This will get us into looking at the application context,

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.660
which is the heart of any spring application,

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.250
which gives us access to the main features of spring features,

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.310
such as dependency injection on auto wiring,

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.130
which formed the core of the IOC container.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.460
Then we're going to get her hands dirty with quitting spring managed beans and see how we

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.950
can work with the container to integrate our code toe living there on how we can retrieve

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.090
our beans back to use them in our applications.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.400
After this,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.630
we're at a point where we can get into dependency injection,

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.310
which is an absolutely fundamental concept you need to know about in today's world of

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:50.020
modern Java,

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.960
will explore the different types of dependency,

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.360
injection and see how spring facilitates this on what we need to do on our side to make it

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.820
happen.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.410
Once we have an understanding of this weaken jump into auto wiring,

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.700
this is where the spring content can automatically connect our beans together for us again

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.700
,

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.550
understanding this is a core skill of any spring developer.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:08.540
Finally,

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.200
we're going to take a look at Springs Property Management and discover how we can configure

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.110
our applications on the all about springs profile system.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.110
Now,

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.850
I'm very excited about this course because this is a living course on.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.660
What I mean by that is I'll be adding more sections to it to shape it into the way you want

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:24.160
it to be.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.230
So please leave suggestions for other topics,

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.250
which would like to see,

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.650
and I can look to add those two.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.560
So I'm excited to teach you all about the core concepts of spring.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.570
Let's jump in now,

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.850
then and get started as we learn all about the spring framework together
