00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.950
right.

00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:02.310
We're making good progress now.

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.670
We now know how to install spring into our projects on programmatically create the spring

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.720
container which could manage your objects for us.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.690
This is great.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.250
So these objects,

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.840
this is what this section is all about.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.890
These objects you put into the spring container we refer to these has beens on what spring

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.750
will do is manage our beans for us.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.100
So specifically,

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.620
instead of doing what we're used to doing and creating instances of our objects ourselves

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.170
passing them around in our applications themselves to where the objects which need them

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.590
that kind of thing instead of that The big idea behind spring in any inversion of control

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.540
framework is that we don't do this anymore.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:35.400
Instead,

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.730
we passed that responsibility to the spring container itself in this section.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.340
Then we'll see how to do just this.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.610
We'll see how we can create,

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.720
retrieve and use these spring managed beans.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.870
So let's jump in
