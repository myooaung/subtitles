X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.530
So let's just see how we can add properties now if we're using the X and all based

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:07.150
application context configuration.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:14.450
So I came back into here into context property placeholder,

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.810
location equals class,

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.450
birth complication,

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:28.150
don't properties and then quickly put in an application properties file.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:45.680
My not name equals Matt inside the service.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.740
Something is,

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:57.790
before we could do that value off my name doing business Logic four.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.430
And then And then,

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.010
of course,

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.350
we need to have a the field two stolen him.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.780
So let's do that now.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.050
If we go to you run configurations,

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.240
it's just remove these extra beom options,

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.910
which we did when we demoed last time.

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:15.830
Come here.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.830
Those go back to app on,

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:21.260
then run.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.040
Okay,

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.450
so you see here it says my dot name.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:34.790
And the reason for that is because I didn't give a property placeholder expression to

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:35.250
resolve.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.700
So that's how I did it.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.450
With the coal on the curly braces and everyone that should work.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.550
It's an APP run.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.330
Yes,

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.530
money.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.060
We could see you doing business logic for months.
