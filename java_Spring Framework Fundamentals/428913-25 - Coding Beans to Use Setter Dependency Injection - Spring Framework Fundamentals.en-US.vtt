00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
so the other thing we can see now is set a dependency injection.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.560
So we've set a dependency injection.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.450
It's slightly different instead of the container using the constructor to pass in the

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.660
dependency to the bean,

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.290
which it will do when the beans created.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:15.890
Which is,

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:16.300
by the way,

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.480
the more preferable way of doing things because it means the bean cannot live,

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.140
can't even exist without the dependency or its dependence is that it depends on which is

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.380
nice.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.700
So there's no momentary lapse where basically that being could be in a state.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.330
What it doesn't have everything that it needs to operate,

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.200
and you might get an exception,

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.830
for example,

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.870
so always go for constructive based dependency injection wherever possible.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:35.790
But the alternative?

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.300
It's set a dependence injection.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.190
So let's see this now.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.550
So if I remove,

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.650
I shall remove the whole constructor because we don't need this anymore.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.680
And so if I now add a set of method see,

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.910
probably familiar with the job of being naming conventions for projects plain old Java

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.860
objects so you can have a getter and setter which together on define a property on a job,

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:55.250
a bean.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.990
But in springs case for set a dependency injection,

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.820
we'll need to supply the set of method of the property itself.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.560
So we're just gonna have a set repository method basically safe a new command end to water

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.130
generator setter and then intel.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.910
Ajay looks into the class and says,

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:09.440
OK,

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.950
there's a repository field there,

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.970
but you could use I'm gonna use that,

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.260
which is the only one it can do do.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.680
OK,

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.210
And now we have this set repository method here.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.930
So set repository is going to set that repository onto the service class and that's all we

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.710
need to do to be able to convert constructed dependency injection to the setter dependency

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:29.540
injections now.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.290
But of course,

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.590
we also need to adapt the XML configuration file to use settle injection,

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:34.850
and we'll do that in the next video.
