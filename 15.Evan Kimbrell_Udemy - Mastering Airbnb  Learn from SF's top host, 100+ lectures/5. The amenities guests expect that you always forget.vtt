00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:10.140
Want to do a quick run down of water all the amenities you're going to need before you can take on your

2
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:11.320
first guest.

3
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.220
I am putting this in this section for getting everything ready because I think that it's more important

4
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.350
that you do it now before you actually take bookings and take guests.

5
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.930
It makes a lot more sense to do this way in advance and it also will affect the photographs that you're

6
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:35.310
taking some of these things that you are functional items that I think you need to go and get and those

7
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.690
functional items should be included in the photographs so then someone seeing it they can see like how

8
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.380
well thought out this is and that there's not going to be anything missing.

9
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.920
There are a lot of different things that say are listing a spare space in your apartment or your home.

10
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.190
You might think oh you know someone has to stay in that room and it's you know work for that person

11
00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.490
and you might think that since someone or lived in it it should be ready to go.

12
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.060
Well travelers have different needs than say a tenant that already lives there.

13
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.130
But if you are a hotel what types of things would you put in there so that guests don't ask or don't

14
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.190
have to ask for it.

15
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.250
One of the things that you'll find hosting guest is that they rarely ask for something they need.

16
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.940
And a lot of times the first time you hear about it is in their negative review they just don't ask.

17
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.490
They just kind of assume that you need you anticipate their needs.

18
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:36.710
And earlier I talked about how when your property's price rises you're going to be taking in a different

19
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:43.140
group of people the cheaper it is the more they will assume that they're supposed to be independent.

20
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.740
The last they'll assume you're going to be providing for them and as you slide up the price scale you're

21
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.450
going to start finding people who are going to expect that you're anticipating pretty much all of their

22
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.520
needs needs that they can't even articulate beforehand.

23
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.270
If you've traveled anywhere what are the basic things that you needed.

24
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.580
And I'm trying to here to save you a lot of time.

25
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.520
I did this through trial and error and these are things I just never thought that I would need.

26
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.920
And then all these things that I bought piecemeal I bought one thing at a time added it to my room or

27
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.590
added to the apartment and I kind of just knocked them out and one afternoon just doing a shopping trip

28
00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.190
and they had just come in one after the other.

29
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.260
You know one person had asked for something and they asked to lay and then a second person asked you

30
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.420
something and I said OK something's here.

31
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.420
Something to that so I bought it.

32
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.480
The third person asked for something else.

33
00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.020
So here are some quick ones that I think that a lot of you probably skipped over.

34
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.530
Do you have an alarm clock.

35
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.180
Someone is coming to visit.

36
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.300
They're probably on vacation or they might be on a business trip.

37
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.390
They might need to wake up a lot of people use their phones or alarms.

38
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.530
But it's good to put an alarm clock.

39
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.470
That's also a nice thing to put in the photograph and you share the bedroom.

40
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.510
The bedroom is that space for everyone.

41
00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:02.980
You know they go to sleep and it also has some kind of functionality to it Hotel.

42
00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:08.010
You would always expect to have an alarm clock or to be able to schedule a wakeup call.

43
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:15.120
Stat. You know if you don't have a desk it's not realistic for everyone to accommodate but if you do

44
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.200
have a desk or you do have an area that you can designate that they can use to write.

45
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.370
I found that putting basic stationery helps a lot.

46
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.760
It's just really it ends up being paper and pens.

47
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.170
It kind of depends on the age group.

48
00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.050
But do people do end up using that and they do find it quite helpful.

49
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.560
You don't want the person laying down in bed and going Man I wish I had something to write on.

50
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.270
Well I'm just not going to say anything about it because they're either going to do is they're going

51
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.180
to internalize that and it's going increase the likelihood they're going to get a negative review.

52
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:51.460
One thing that we run into with older guests nightlights or night desks that's something that I didn't

53
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.780
realize existed.

54
00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.230
I guess I'd realize it existed.

55
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.770
I just didn't have any idea why people use them.

56
00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:02.650
They're the tiny little shoulder tables that you put at the side of a bed because late at night if you

57
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.130
want to get up you might need to reach for something or put something down.

58
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.780
And so that creates a problem for people who are getting up in the middle of the night to go to the

59
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.960
bathroom or to move around.

60
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.270
They won't be able to put something down that kind of segues and the other thing.

61
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:20.260
It's nice to have a lamp next to your bed because a lot of people there just will that's what they used

62
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.090
to like to turn off the lights turn on the lamp read go to bed and you know I always see when I say

63
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.540
these things and a hundred percent of people do these.

64
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.970
But you know it's a good 30 percent of people would expect something like that.

65
00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.760
You don't really want to alienate that 30 percent blow dryers.

66
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:40.860
That's incredibly helpful because a lot of times you have people who are coming and going to be going

67
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:46.260
out at night or you have women and girls coming and they don't want to wait all day for their hair to

68
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.970
dry and a blow dryer is not something that is too typical for them to travel with.

69
00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.390
So a lot of times of the do is ask in advance do you have a blowdryer and that's how they term it if

70
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:55.630
they should bring a blow dryer.

71
00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:56.850
Blow dry is very cheap.

72
00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.240
You can get a $10 one at Walgreens or Target.

73
00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.250
That's something you can add very quickly.

74
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.120
That is something that people are very pleased to find cause a lot of times they don't anticipate it.

75
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.320
They ask you the day of oh you know there are blowdryer and you kind of save the day when you say yes

76
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.730
there is.

77
00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.070
I've anticipated that need.

78
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.350
Basic toiletries.

79
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:20.190
This is something that obviously you should have and this is separate from your standard supply that

80
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.390
you get to maintain.

81
00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.040
I mean things like sometimes people forget toothbrushes and toothpaste.

82
00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:30.500
So you can always bring those travel size pack ones and to be honest if you buy one tube of toothpaste

83
00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:37.520
and some disposable toothbrushes you might break five dollars and that five dollars will last you a

84
00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.830
year because you'll have three or four guests you know have to use it but it's one of those saying That's

85
00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:50.040
great to have breakfast foods is another thing you're not typically the person who stocks breakfast

86
00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.240
food on the regular.

87
00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.730
That's something definitely we're getting.

88
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.920
Especially if it's something that you can include and you take a photograph of your kitchen you can

89
00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.810
show it like hey you come here.

90
00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.690
These are some of the breakfast items that you can get if you're not a coffee drinker.

91
00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.870
I would suggest getting a coffee maker.

92
00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.140
You don't even have to get a coffee maker.

93
00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:11.100
I mean get a French press a French press or you can get one on line for $20 maybe 25 30.

94
00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:17.940
They get pretty expensive but they're much more reasonable much less unwieldy than a physical large

95
00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:19.930
drip coffee machine.

96
00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:22.380
That's the thing I've realized when you get older.

97
00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.790
They really do want coffee.

98
00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:30.090
Younger guests won't absolutely require it but they do find it a bonus that they can make coffee in

99
00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:30.760
the morning.

100
00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:36.810
And that's something that I've experienced roughly 50 percent of my guests expect coffee will vocalize

101
00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:38.450
that they want coffee.

102
00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.230
I found that it's very helpful to have basic things like wine openers.

103
00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:46.470
You know what time you'll get Honeymooners couples or groups who are going to go out to dinner or they

104
00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:48.240
might use their kitchen if that's an option.

105
00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:53.430
Having a wine opener is something that's very helpful because a lot of times they'll bring wine extra

106
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:54.030
blankets.

107
00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:55.860
That was one thing that I did not anticipate.

108
00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:01.500
First if you ever have swings of temperature it's always nice to have extra blankets.

109
00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.710
It's a bank is also help in the case that guests show up with extra gas to tell you about.

110
00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:08.050
That's something that happens quite often.

111
00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.300
Also in San Francisco it can get cold at night.

112
00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:14.830
And we have heat and we tell them how to use heat.

113
00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.000
But the problem with gas is they just won't.

114
00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:19.010
Sometimes they know how to do it.

115
00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:22.150
They won't do anything about it and then they'll complain about it later.

116
00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:26.040
And then there's things you just have to anticipate you cannot anticipate that every gas is going to

117
00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.830
take the initiative on themselves.

118
00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:31.830
You almost need to coddle them in the sense that you need to show up and make sure that you have this

119
00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.410
extra thing that's planned for any given situation.

120
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:41.270
One thing I found is really helpful is putting a water out that makes them feel like they've really

121
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:44.420
kind of thought through things that I could possibly need.

122
00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:50.460
And really I just took a cough which is a fancy word for a bottle with a thin neck and you kind of has

123
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:51.860
a pop top on top.

124
00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:55.600
And I just killed it up with filtered water and I put it out on the table with some classes.

125
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:56.890
Probably half of them used it.

126
00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:57.980
But they definitely enjoyed it.

127
00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:59.750
It's something that's very nice when they come back to you.

128
00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:03.500
They can drink water and it stops them from having to go in and raiding your kitchen right after they

129
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:08.510
get back someone to hang their clothes was another one.

130
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:12.910
I didn't actually have a place in my space that I had converted.

131
00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:18.990
I ended up putting small hooks on the wall and I use plastic hooks that were pretty much invisible so

132
00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:23.880
when you look at them they don't really stick out but they are actually there and you can end up hanging

133
00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.110
up some things on the wall.

134
00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:26.700
You don't have closet space.

135
00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:31.290
That's not a big deal but it would be nice to offer at least some space because you will get again older

136
00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:37.770
guests who are going to a wedding and they might actually need to hang up a suit or a shirt and that's

137
00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:40.560
going to be kind of painful for them if they don't have anywhere to put it.

138
00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:44.680
All other things obviously that you're going to need basic things.

139
00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:50.010
I mean cleaning supplies toilet paper paper towels sweaters is something that I always suggest because

140
00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:54.480
you can always clean it right before they come and the sweater kind of has this effect that it makes

141
00:08:54.480 --> 00:09:00.260
it look shiny like it's going to the wet surfers sheets and extra sheets.

142
00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:04.250
Make sure that you have extra sheets and you have extra sheets for your extra sheets.

143
00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:09.630
They'd have a very short lifespan specially when you're having guests coming in and out.

144
00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:16.090
So anticipate that you know if something happens such that they put lipstick on your white sheets you

145
00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:23.260
have backup sheets and make sure that you have things like Stain or mover's like always if you guys

146
00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:28.690
have questions put it in the group discussions mean a private message if you think of any other supplies

147
00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:32.920
or small things that made a big difference or could make a big difference or you want to know whether

148
00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:37.270
or not it's worth it for you to buy something posted in the group discussion we can talk about it if

149
00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:40.670
there are enough things that I miss that would be really helpful.

150
00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:43.690
I'll definitely come back and make a new section and we can go over those two.
