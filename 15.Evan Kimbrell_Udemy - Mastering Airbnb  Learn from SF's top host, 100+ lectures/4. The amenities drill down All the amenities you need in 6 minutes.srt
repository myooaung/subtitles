00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,610
Let's talk real briefly about the amenities checklist that you're going to run into when you're listing

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:13,770
your space on air B and B they want you to check off every box for every amenity that you have in your

3
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:19,650
space so that anyone who is going through the listing can see kind of immediately what do you have.

4
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:26,640
It's important from the bookers standpoint to know exactly what you have because a lot of times there

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,000
are deal breakers in terms of amenities.

6
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:34,020
I had guests who are very interested in the space but they find out I don't have a TV and so they don't

7
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,010
want to stay.

8
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:40,170
Now whether that means that they wanted to watch a sporting event or something on TV or maybe they just

9
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:45,200
traveling with old parents or something and they don't really want to leave the apartment.

10
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:50,080
But you can kind of tell very quickly that these are kitchen obviously is very straightforward.

11
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,200
You either have a kitchen or you don't.

12
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:57,870
It's worth noting that when you list this out everything that you do not have is going to be listed

13
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:59,600
with a strike out.

14
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:04,260
So it's not just going to list whatever you have to confusing because then people would know what you're

15
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,330
missing.

16
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,410
It's been a list pretty much everything.

17
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:08,840
There's Internet and wireless internet.

18
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,420
If you're one of those people that only has wired internet then you need to say Internet and you need

19
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,540
to not say wireless internet.

20
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,920
Then you need to explain that in your listing.

21
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,800
We'll talk a little bit later about trying to be as upfront as possible because the more truthful you

22
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,720
are and the better you set your expectations the less likely to get bad reviews and less likely you're

23
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,360
going to have issues.

24
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,520
If you look at the amenities list a couple of things I wanted to point out that are flexible generally

25
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,880
when you want to fill this out you want to think about casting your net as wide as possible again so

26
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,190
try to incorporate as much as you can and really think about each one whether or not you're comfortable

27
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:44,920
with it.

28
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,420
If you have a washer and dryer consider letting them use it because then you can say washer and dryer.

29
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,000
That's usually a big plus.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,340
One thing I will mention is if you live near a washer and dryer kind of center you can also check these

31
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:01,020
you'll need to mention it very quickly in the House Rules or in the description saying like oh it's

32
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,970
a block away or two blocks away.

33
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,190
It's this free parking on premises.

34
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:11,310
In my case we had two hour parking in front of our street so that technically counts whether you rent

35
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,030
out a garage space and let's say it's.

36
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,840
And then give it to the gas free.

37
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,030
That's something you can do.

38
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:17,940
That's up to you.

39
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:23,040
I typically would say you want a list and then mention it in your listing to things that you might be

40
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,790
a little confused about.

41
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:28,310
Breakfast breakfast is not necessarily mean that you have to serve breakfast.

42
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,440
This is not like a traditional bed and breakfast.

43
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:37,020
Some people run it like that but that's by far the exception that's being allowed.

44
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,410
That's something that I think you should consider.

45
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:46,340
It's frequently the case that people bring small animals small dogs small cats if you're OK with that.

46
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:51,420
I mean I would really kind of look into it because that's something that you know it only happens maybe

47
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:55,900
three or four percent of the time but that's very much a deal breaker for other listings.

48
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:02,610
And so if you're capable of allowing small pets in your house it'll give you a decent boost and give

49
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:05,640
you a little bit of an edge against the people around you.

50
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,300
In my experience you know no one is going to travel with their cat.

51
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:14,040
It's usually they're traveling with their Chihuahua or small dog a couple times I've had people with

52
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,400
special needs that have like sight dogs they're usually very trained.

53
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,040
And it's just something like for instance in my listing all I would say is if you're bringing animals

54
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:24,580
let me know because it really depends.

55
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,350
You bring up a very large animal.

56
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,340
They have the potential of scratching up our hardwood floors.

57
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:34,260
You know when you say let us know the animals this is the opportunity where they will take it upon themselves

58
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:39,240
to explain why the dog is trained and why it's a well behaving animal and you know that they've taken

59
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:43,070
in other places they don't kind of help you put your nerves at ease and you can always say no to.

60
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,950
I mean you could just say I don't think this is a good space too small.

61
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,720
I think there might be potential for damage.

62
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,080
Smoking Allowed.

63
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:57,280
And I know Sarah made a point about this later in the course of her space she is it doesn't even see

64
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,830
the point of listing that because she just doesn't allow it.

65
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:02,990
I don't allow smoking inside my apartment either.

66
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:06,970
I illicit smoking out as possible because they can smoke outside.

67
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:11,540
And that's another thing that I kind of need to point out and I've listed that on the space.

68
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:16,330
If you're afraid of people saying like oh we can smoke outside but you know the host is going to be

69
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:19,330
there so we can smoke inside and they won't ever know.

70
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,630
You know you have a deposit.

71
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,730
So I would make sure that you use that deposit.

72
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:28,580
It's not particularly hard to tell if someone's been smoking even after the fact.

73
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,770
But if it's something you're legitimately weary about then maybe it's something you don't want to do.

74
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,620
In my case you know of a backyard so it's not completely accurate to say that you can't smoke at all

75
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:44,200
family kid friendly Sarazen to talk about that later how do you tell thier faces child proof or family

76
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:44,800
proof.

77
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,270
When we talk about the listings and what you can say and things you can add you can always think of

78
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,800
adding small things that would make it more kid friendly and make it something that's more attractive

79
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,760
towards kids.

80
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,790
There are a lot of small subgroups of guests who are looking for very specific things and if you can

81
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:05,700
accommodate more and more of them you can really put together a block of people who are coming a book

82
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:10,060
like for instance in my apartment people looking for parking that were in families that want kid friendly

83
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,870
spaces that was a very big market for us.

84
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,340
It's the case that those types of groups are in our group to have more purchasing power.

85
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,020
They end up spending more money.

86
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:23,580
They're OK with the premium and I get away with charging a little bit more.

87
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,180
So it kind of sweetens the deal.

88
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,720
One other thing I to put in here is the gym and I'll talk later about this as a quick tip about how

89
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,500
you can approach the GM has an amenity.

90
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,120
We live near a gym.

91
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:36,930
We don't have a gym in our space and they don't.

92
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,300
They leave that kind of open to interpretation so it could be in your space or not in your space and

93
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:47,190
that you should be checking smoke detector carbon monoxide detector fire extinguisher does it pretty

94
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:52,230
much just standard in and sees those crossed out those that assume that there is some kind of an error.

95
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,600
He has so many other questions that there is any other kind of technicalities I missed this post some

96
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,190
in the group and I can get back to you.
