1
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:13,900
Tip number four this is called towels and linens when you do end up taking in gas and running out your

2
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:14,770
space.

3
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:22,210
You do realize hopefully by this point in the course that you need to offer your guests linens you know

4
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:23,240
previously the hosing.

5
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,500
I don't even know what linens were.

6
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,290
I thought it was some kind of a fabric or something.

7
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:32,430
But what it means is the bedding that goes on your bed.

8
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:38,210
It also means that you know and then when I say towels towels or for your gas when I shower you're going

9
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:43,580
to want to present them towels that are specifically theirs unless they have a private bathroom in which

10
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:50,010
case you can put their towels in their bathroom what you need to know about towels and one ends and

11
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,740
Sarah talked about this a little bit earlier does that white always looks better.

12
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,760
That always looks more professional.

13
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:02,770
The second thing I'm going to say is try not to go completely cheap on your towels and linens.

14
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,430
You might think oh I need to save money but that doesn't particularly make sense especially considering

15
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,560
how much money you could potentially charge for your space.

16
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,560
It's going to wash away all of the maintenance costs.

17
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:20,250
And what I mean by that is say you have a choice between getting really cheap fixtures really cheap

18
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,350
amenities and maybe it only cost you five to $10 per guest.

19
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:32,430
The difference between a very very good post and a mediocre post could be several hundred dollars a

20
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,320
night.

21
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:38,550
I don't think you're ever going to spend more than $20 agast per reservation.

22
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:44,190
So it's not a wide range of money they're going to be spending 10 to 20 dollars but the difference is

23
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:48,710
if you go for higher quality you're going to have better reviews and better experiences and eventually

24
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,190
are going to be to charge more.

25
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:56,910
So it actually ends up being that the costs are very negligible sorrow's saying White does look a lot

26
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:01,800
more professional It does look a lot cleaner too when you just see why you kind of assume everything's

27
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,670
clean.

28
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:05,840
The flip side of why is that it's harder to keep clean.

29
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:13,290
And so this is something that's worked pretty well for me is that I just plan on doing that I'm going

30
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:19,770
to have what I called towel attrition meaning that over time since air white towels and white linens

31
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:26,340
people are going to put their makeup on them people are going to stain them in some way they're going

32
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:31,590
to get ripped especially because you going to be doing a lot of white load's bleach and you can put

33
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,950
it on high heat because you want it to dry out.

34
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:38,550
And so over time it's actually the tick take cheap towels they will end up ripping.

35
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:44,260
So I just kind of plan on knowing that a lot of my stuff over time isn't going to make it.

36
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:47,160
And so I just plan on picking towels.

37
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,960
I know we're going to last the longest.

38
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,670
Per how much I'm spending on them and I don't want to go for the cheap towels because I fall apart very

39
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,870
quickly and they don't really look as nice.

40
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,260
Plan on your towels and your linens just being destroyed.

41
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,620
And so always keep extras.

42
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,150
I had three beds to Bath.

43
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:12,000
I just had a set packet of towels that I would buy every month or every say like 15 reservations and

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,690
that package you know is only 25 bucks 30 bucks or something and gave me an extra three towels.

45
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,740
Sorry like you know three or four towels.

46
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,800
But if you just plan on it.

47
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,540
Figure out how you can do this very easily and might be the case.

48
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,830
You can use Amazon Prime and you can order towels and order linens repeatedly but just plan on them

49
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:31,940
getting ruined.

50
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:36,860
And this is going to prevent you from having kind of an a like an oh moment when you know guests are

51
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:41,780
coming and that you did not realize the last second to the last guests actually ruined someone ends

52
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,180
and you don't have anything to cover.

53
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,360
The third better the second better whatever.

54
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,260
Always have these as backup.

55
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:53,630
And so just buy a lot of them and can keep purchasing them in regular intervals knowing that they're

56
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:56,640
going to get ruined linens.

57
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:01,840
Sarah did mention this at the end of the day they are paying for a good night's sleep and Lenins can

58
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,690
make a huge difference and that if you spend more it's going to feel a lot better.

59
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,900
As one of the things I put a lot of focus on.

60
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:14,320
I knew that over time certain things might break down or it might not look as nice or you know maybe

61
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:19,520
my check in process was not fantastic that I can always make up for it with a comfortable bed.

62
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,720
And so I put a lot of effort into that.

63
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:26,380
And Sarah saying that if you purchased linens that have very high thread counts then people kind of

64
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:30,850
associate that with high class expensive hotels.

65
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,900
They want to kind of put it in the same category.

66
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,250
You know what you're trying to charge them for and that's ideally what we want to get to we're going

67
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,280
to get to the point where you're are charging a lot of money because that's where it really starts to

68
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,030
get sweet.

69
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:43,350
And that's something that's kind of the limit if you take cheap linens.

70
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:50,500
I come from kind of a cost angle in the sense that you can spend hundreds of dollars in bed sheets and

71
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,050
you can also go as low as $20.

72
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:57,250
The problem is that you know if you spend $20 in bedsheets you're going to change them every single

73
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,570
time because they're just not going to last.

74
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:03,270
And at the end of the day you know you spend a lot more than that.

75
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:07,660
Plus how much time and effort you spend having to swap them out because you didn't realize that they

76
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,350
got ruined.
