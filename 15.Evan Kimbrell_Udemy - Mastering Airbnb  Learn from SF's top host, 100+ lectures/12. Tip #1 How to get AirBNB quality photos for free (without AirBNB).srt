00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,020
Here's a tip that I thought was worth sharing.

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:12,600
This is something that I used that really helped me out of the gate with my Air B and B listing some

3
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:18,960
of you will laugh a little bit at this but this is an idea around what are the simplest cheapest ways

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:26,950
of getting the best outcome on your arab and B listing earlier we talked about how Airbnb does free

5
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,930
photography and their photography is phenomenal.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,540
If you look at an RV and be photographed it makes the location whatever room they're shooting it makes

7
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,010
it look phenomenal.

8
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:42,160
The saturation of the image is quite high.

9
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,170
You can notice because the colors are much richer.

10
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:48,980
They also seem to increase the contrast of their images quite a bit.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,070
So one of the things that was kind of a problem when I started my Air B and B was that when I first

12
00:00:54,070 --> 00:01:00,040
put up the listing I only had the capability to take photographs with what I had on me which was an

13
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:06,670
iPhone you can apply for their photography but it does take some time for them to come out and take

14
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:07,930
the photographs.

15
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:11,310
Depends largely on how long you've been a member.

16
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,510
Obviously it doesn't make sense for them to send photographers out.

17
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:18,700
If you've only been listed for a day they want to see if you're going to stick around it's quite expensive

18
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:23,620
for them to get someone to go out and take the photographs even though the photographs do they do them

19
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:27,110
very quickly they will just run right through your apartment.

20
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,130
So the question is how do you get decent photography.

21
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:34,720
How do you make your apartment look really good without the air being be photographed because there

22
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:40,810
is going to be a window where you put up your listing and it's going to be listed with whatever camera

23
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,890
you had.

24
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:46,660
And there is a huge difference in the air and the photographs and the photographs you have especially

25
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:52,180
if you're in a competitive area it's really hard to compete with somebody who already has the beautiful

26
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:58,240
bright saturated images that Airbnb takes and you're trying to compete and you're new and you're trying

27
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,270
to show and your photographs are from an iPhone.

28
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:07,000
IPhones have a very decent camera but they're not going to capture the same quality high resolution

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,260
image that a SLR camera is going to capture.

30
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:18,610
What I ended up doing is I had my own that certain places that stocked cameras had returned policies

31
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,660
specifically Costco.

32
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,600
I had known it because I've always been a shopper at Costco and if you live in a big city you probably

33
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,170
live near a Costco somewhere even if you live in a mid-sized city you can still drive to one.

34
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,500
They have a lifetime return policy and all their items with the exception of electronics and their electronics

35
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:41,550
is a 30 day return policy that return policy is any reason any time.

36
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:45,100
What I ended up doing I went and I bought the nicest camera they had.

37
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:50,980
And then I went to Best Buy and I bought the fanciest wide angle lens.

38
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,740
This is an important detail wide angle lens.

39
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,670
And they also had a return policy.

40
00:02:55,670 --> 00:03:00,730
There's a little stricter 15 days and I did show the receipt I took those two things the camera I bought

41
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:06,490
at Costco is something like $4000 you know $4000 in a bank account just put it on a credit card or something

42
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:09,550
like that because you know you're just going you're turning it the next day.

43
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:17,260
I did a photo shoot day I took all the photographs that actually bridged the gap between what an iPhone

44
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,850
photo and Airbnb photos going to look like.

45
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,150
The difference in those two are immense.

46
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,080
Huge.

47
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:30,340
I think that when you first Lister listing a lot of people are going to be timid about booking say paying

48
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,480
a hundred dollars to stay in your living room.

49
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,350
If you take the photograph with an iPhone it just doesn't look professional.

50
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,950
And you're asking for money that implies that this is professional.

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,020
So that's how I kind of got around it I just knew that while I can go get a nice camera and I can just

52
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:44,980
return it.

53
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,910
It did a very good job.

54
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:52,210
One of the things I would suggest and you will pay yourself over the head when everybody shows up and

55
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:56,860
takes photographs because you didn't think about this is that they use flash that attached to the top

56
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,390
of their cameras and they point them forward.

57
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:04,660
And what that does is it shoots a blast of light right at the area that they're taking a photograph

58
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:04,950
of.

59
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,040
Making it artificially bright.

60
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:11,230
So if you look at the Air B and B photos you'll notice that they are artificially bright There's just

61
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,100
no way that room looks at that.

62
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,510
Right.

63
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,740
And that's because they use this flash.

64
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,160
I'm sure if you've seen professional photo shoot see something very similar but they shoot it against

65
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,570
like an upside down umbrella.

66
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:25,660
And that's so they try trying to prevent it from having these streaks from the light hitting whatever

67
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,020
they're taking photograph of.

68
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,750
That is something also you can get.

69
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:33,590
You can buy that at the same places you can buy that at a Best Buy and just end up returning it.

70
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:39,310
If you do that it will bring your photographs up to a point where they're actually quite passable and

71
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:43,810
it's a very good bridge to the point where you can actually get an Air B and B photographer coming out.

72
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:49,900
When I listed my listing I had inquiries with in something like seven eight hours and I took my first

73
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,350
booking within something like 12 hours.

74
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:56,750
I believe a large part of that was that my photographs looked really good.

75
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:00,610
They are not nearly as good as an Air B photograph but they were acceptable.

76
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,950
They were still high resolution.

77
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:07,000
They didn't have the same brightness because I don't have the technical skill of one of those professional

78
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,270
photographers but it actually ended up working out.

79
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:14,350
I think one of the things that's really important is that when you first put up your listing to not

80
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:19,240
get discouraged I believe that if I had put up iPhone photos and I had not taken some time with the

81
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,470
photographs then that might have actually been quite discouraging because I'd magine that I wouldn't

82
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:27,970
have gotten as many inquiries and wouldn't have gotten that instant validation that I did when I did

83
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:31,150
end up listing my apartment for real.

84
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,470
The alternative to this.

85
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,460
Just ask your friends.

86
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:37,470
Maybe one of your friends has a DSL or Seems like it's pretty common that people have DSL.

87
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:42,430
Now the price has gotten down and even the thousand dollar cameras are still quite nice.

88
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:46,900
Seems like amateur photographer is a big thing now and if you notice on you Dimi it's one of the more

89
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:51,730
popular courses how to take user DSL and how to take photographs and travel photography etc..

90
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,900
Chances are your friends probably has one.

91
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,510
So that's another way of doing that.

92
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,900
See if you can borrow their camera you only need it for a day.

93
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:03,300
Honestly if you plan it out beforehand it only takes maybe an hour later in the course.

94
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:06,980
We're going to talk about how to take the photographs.

95
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,980
What do you need in the frame.

96
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:09,670
What do you take.

97
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,440
What's the point of each photograph.

98
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,930
What do you want to highlight.

99
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:16,300
And that's almost as important as I'd say the quality of the image.

100
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,620
Obviously that feeds into what we consider a good photograph.

101
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:24,010
That's something not obviously to neglect don't just assume hey I got a great camera I can take photos

102
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:29,050
of the floor or take photos of every single angle of every single room and that's all I need.

103
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,800
That's not the case.

104
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,730
You need to put some thought into taking the photographs but at the same time you don't need to be a

105
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:35,170
professional photographer.

106
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:39,280
It is something I did and I am I have very few artistic skills.

107
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,550
If you guys have any questions post them in the group discussion.

108
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,360
And I am more than willing to answer them and help me through any of the problems you guys are having.
