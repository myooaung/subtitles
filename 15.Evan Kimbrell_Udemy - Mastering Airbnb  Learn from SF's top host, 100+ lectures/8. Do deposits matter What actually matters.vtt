00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:10.890
Another feature you've probably noticed on the air B and B listing page is the ability to set a deposit.

2
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:17.130
How this works is when someone wants to book your apartment you could say that you want to set a deposit

3
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.780
for $500.

4
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.100
What are B and B is going to do is they're going to authorize the other person's card for five hundred

5
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.820
dollars in addition to the total booking amount and then two days after they leave and nothing's been

6
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.920
reported as stolen or broken then they're going to turn the security Pozza to the person who booked

7
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:35.300
it.

8
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:42.750
A beginning kind of standpoint your strategy should be to limit your security deposit.

9
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.940
But I think it's completely rational to require one if you're doing a private room rental typically

10
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.330
your deposits going to be smaller if you're doing a full apartment.

11
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.670
It's going to be quite a bit larger.

12
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.350
How do you tell if the amount that you're asking for is reasonable.

13
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:05.810
I would say that a reasonable deposit just varies on the condition of your apartment and the value of

14
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.380
the items in it.

15
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.440
Usually what I do and I do this in my case I just kind of looked at the things around my apartment.

16
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.230
I figured what's the absolute worst case scenario.

17
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.750
And then what's kind of a reasonable scenario.

18
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.570
Say I managed to rent out to someone who just has tons of people over and they throw a party and things

19
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:24.570
get broken.

20
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.540
You know I do have a lot of priceless goods do I have a lot of really nice items and that's kind of

21
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.090
how I came to the conclusion that for for apartment rentals my deposit I believe is seven hundred.

22
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.110
That is a reasonable amount of money considering how much I charge per night.

23
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:48.240
What you don't want to do is say rent your spare room for $100 and have a deposit of 300 400 dollars.

24
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:55.040
That's not particularly reasonable because a lot of people don't want to book one night or two nights

25
00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:02.060
and then have this huge outstanding authorization on their card when it's so much larger compared to

26
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.550
how much they're paying to stay there.

27
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.750
So there's not a lot of magic to this feature.

28
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.700
I suggest you put it there just because it's going to cushion any problems.

29
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.560
In my experience I've only had one episode where I had to use the security deposit.

30
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.570
And it really wasn't even contentious.

31
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:25.910
I had one person who tried to glue together a suitcase and the glue had tripped onto my hardwood floors.

32
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.530
They didn't notice it but it ended up actually corroding a hole on the floor.

33
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.930
And I did end up having it buffed out and then the stain which was quite expensive and of charging him

34
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.610
$300.

35
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.050
It's worth putting a security deposit.

36
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.810
In retrospect if something happens you'll be much happier about it.

37
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.760
But keep in mind there is an insurance policy for Airbnb So it is something that is excessive.

38
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:55.320
They do burn down your house you have a massive insurance policy from them that you can call on this

39
00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.610
current deposit and a lot of ways is redundant so don't go crazy with it.

40
00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.640
Don't make multiple thousand dollar security deposit unless you're running out your space for $2000

41
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.100
a night or a thousand dollars a night.

42
00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.080
Believe it or not if you play around on ebay you can find some properties like that.

43
00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.260
If you guys have any questions of the security deposit let me know and this is a brief lecture.

44
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.890
There are some details to the security deposit that you can kind of dive into but I don't think are

45
00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.350
necessarily worth going over in a short lecture on it.

46
00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.660
I personally just don't see it as a huge feature.

47
00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.000
I don't really see it as a big thing that's going to deter someone from booking or invite them to book.

48
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:36.890
Only problem I see is that people put excessive deposits and you know like the pricing strategy we discussed

49
00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.950
I always suggest start with a small but reasonable deposit and then you can increase it to get more

50
00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.450
comfortable as there is more demand and it's more social proof period property.

51
00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.150
When people are looking at a property they know tons of people have stayed here.

52
00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:52.580
They're much more likely to say oh it's fine.

53
00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.580
You know there's a $500 deposit.
