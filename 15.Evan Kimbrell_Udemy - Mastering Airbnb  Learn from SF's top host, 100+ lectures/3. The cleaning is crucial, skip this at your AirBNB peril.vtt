00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:11.850
Let's talk about cleaning your space that's not particularly exciting but it is a very important part

2
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.940
of how you get the best guest experiences.

3
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.370
And it's one of the most common tripping points I've noticed with new house and it's something I definitely

4
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:21.800
tripped up on.

5
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.230
The cleaning is crucial.

6
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.420
That's the title of this lecture because it is absolutely crucial.

7
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.000
A lot of you think like oh my space is clean.

8
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:40.240
That's the biggest problem is that the vast majority of people don't know what to clean absolutely is.

9
00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.640
Now when you're running out your space you're going to be competing with hotels you're competing with

10
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.290
people who run professional bed and breakfast.

11
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.320
When you say clean do you mean clean as in my friend could stay over for the night.

12
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.080
And they wouldn't complain about the mess.

13
00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.760
Or do you mean this is as clean as it would be in a hotel.

14
00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.620
You need to be in the second category.

15
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.990
When I first started cleaning my apartment what I would do is I would vacuum I would wipe down the counters

16
00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.530
clean out the bathroom put in new toilet paper clean out the kitchen clean the dishes that I thought

17
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.720
was everything I needed to do.

18
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.400
I could not have been more wrong.

19
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.380
That is about 50 percent of what you should do.

20
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.870
Now what I recognize is that if people even get the slightest feeling of grungy ness that's going to

21
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.830
often result in a low review for your cleanliness rating and possibly a bad review.

22
00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.310
What you want to do is you really really want to go all out when you do your cleanings I suggest you

23
00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.050
make a list of everything that needs to be cleaned and listed out.

24
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:48.250
I also suggest that you find someone else to clean your apartment because over time if you do every

25
00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.170
single cleaning it's going to drive you crazy.

26
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.510
Because I think because the attention to detail you need to have a space that's going to maximize the

27
00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:56.440
guest experience.

28
00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.760
It's kind of insane and it's not something that you really want to deal with once you get to a point

29
00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.530
where you're charging a lot of money.

30
00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.560
It's very easy for someone to learn how to clean your space and to do it professionally whether or not

31
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.260
you choose to use a service is up to you.

32
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.140
You're going to pay more but it's going to be more convenient if you want to work with one individual

33
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.220
person you might need to spend a couple hours with them showing them how to clean it properly.

34
00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.170
But they're going to be cheaper and possibly less reliable depending on the person.

35
00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.860
Now when I go back and I clean my apartment I do everything.

36
00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.810
This is a word that I want you to keep in your mind detailing.

37
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.210
You are literally going after the details of your space.

38
00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:41.260
I wipe not just the countertops I wipe the legs of my coffee table all white the corners of the bed

39
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:46.750
the wooden part of the bed I'll vacuum and then I'll use a sweeper because a wet sweater on a hard floor

40
00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.800
makes this kind of shine look to it.

41
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.660
You don't just clean the dishes you then clean the sink itself.

42
00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.770
That was something before I said oh no dishes while somebody is coming in they're going to want it to

43
00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.230
look like it's brand new so clean the sink as well.

44
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.780
Have you ever been to a real estate open house.

45
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.270
You want to make it look as close to that as possible.

46
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.610
That's why I suggest when you do have problems like scuff scrapes or things and break try to fix as

47
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.630
quickly as possible and try to figure out a cheap easy way of doing this because it's probably going

48
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:17.800
to happen in the future.

49
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.470
This is just something that a lot of people really underestimate.

50
00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.870
And this is one thing that I experienced over and over and it took me the longest time to learn was

51
00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.210
that a stray hair will ruin your day.

52
00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.980
Have you made a mental catalog of every single piece of hair in your apartment.

53
00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.360
I'm not saying you absolutely have to but if one of them slips your mind and a guest goes into a space

54
00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.960
that had a lot of money for and they see a hair.

55
00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.440
I've never seen some of the reactions I've had of guests what you would think is ridiculous but for

56
00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.160
them that's absolutely a no no deal breaker.

57
00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:59.000
Even if everything was pristine the ivory on your toilet was just shining if they see a hair that makes

58
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.460
them think that they're staying in a frat house.

59
00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.060
That's one thing you need to look at individual details.

60
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.600
Now Sarah suggested using white sheets because white sheets look professional they look clean and also

61
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.900
said that the flip side of this is that white sheets also get dirty much more quickly.

62
00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.400
So you need to figure out a way of remedying this.

63
00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.750
One tip I love using is for your pads use a lint roller.

64
00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.620
So what you can do is you can wash your sheets the dryer should remove the lint when you put it up.

65
00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:30.800
You might have some stray Fuzzy's a Lent roller if you just run it over it it'll grab it and even if

66
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.870
you run it over areas you don't even see land you'll still end up grabbing a ton of land and you just

67
00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.020
think to yourself Wow I just save myself a lot of time.

68
00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.810
You need to be a lot more anal than you think.

69
00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:47.510
Or you need to find someone who's really specific about the space to give you an idea when someone says

70
00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.070
oh I'm going to clean your space.

71
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:56.270
They say I was going to take an hour an hour is roughly how long they should spend in say a 400 square

72
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.510
foot space.

73
00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.250
My apartment is about 3500 square feet tall 200 square feet.

74
00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:07.400
And so I expect in order to do a good job they need to do about three hours three and a half hours so

75
00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.160
it might seem to you like oh you know just throw stuff over here and you are safe over here.

76
00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:14.410
And that's done just run the vacuum over it.

77
00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:19.170
It's not like going through the motions you need to look at it and think does it look like the colon

78
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.030
unless you'd expect it of a hotel.

79
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.130
Is this like the cleanliness I expect out of a professional space that's used to rent out to people.

80
00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.240
I remember paying a lot of money.

81
00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.540
When you do the cleaning please put a lot of thought into who you use to clean it.

82
00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.150
And if you're doing it yourself make sure that you go over every detail.

83
00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.740
Tiny things like organizing things.

84
00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:43.890
If you have a desk organizing the paper and the pencils on the desk will make a huge impression.

85
00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.940
Think about the way that you fold the sheets on the bed.

86
00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.510
Think about the way that you present the pillows on the bed.

87
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:54.590
Really small things like this that at first it takes some thought but once you get it down you'll just

88
00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.710
know that these are the things you have to hit.

89
00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.820
And this is the quality that you're going to have to match in order to get good reviews so don't be

90
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.890
surprised if you put in a half cleaning you're going to get a bad review.

91
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.410
Please don't expect that you're going to have to spend three hours yourself every time you switch someone

92
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.690
out get someone else to clean it for you.

93
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:19.970
I use a service I pay $60 for three hours I pay them $20 an hour I pay them extra because I want them

94
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:26.840
to care more about the job and I want them to really be invested in making this very clean when I give

95
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:32.720
them extra time and I make sure that they stay for that amount of time because I outsource it like that.

96
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.440
I don't actually have to spend any time on.

97
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.890
So if you work it will work out fine.

98
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:41.190
Just keep in mind that you need to try to retain the utmost cleanliness.

99
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.640
Absolutely no foreign hires.

100
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:49.300
I can't say that had enough any questions just post in the group discussion send me a private message.
