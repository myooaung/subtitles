00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:11.520
So when you talk about some of the alternative services that you can use for quote unquote home sharing

2
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.430
there are two that I'm going to bring up.

3
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:24.130
One is V.R. below and the other one is room or Ramah the RBO stands for vacation rental by owner.

4
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.800
So now that finally makes sense.

5
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:32.470
And you're not going to be saying very bow everywhere and rumor Rahma it's room or omma not room.

6
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:38.630
Ramah so I'm going to talk a little bit about the reason why they are worth knowing is that they are

7
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.440
alternative sources of bookings for your apartment.

8
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:51.250
I personally consider Air B and B the main dish and the RBO room aroma as the side dish is a side note.

9
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.970
If you've heard of home away home away is a connection.

10
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.320
It's kind of the same thing as V RBO I believe is the same company.

11
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.680
Usually I suggest looking into Villarrubia and room Ramah at the end.

12
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.820
Once you're done once you've figured out the system that works for Air B and B the reason why I say

13
00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.160
that is because Air B and B is the most comprehensive of the systems.

14
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:19.460
They have the best user interface they have the best user experience they have the most listings and

15
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.240
the most booking.

16
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.460
So you want to spend the majority of your time optimizing for Air B and B and then everything you've

17
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:32.000
done for Air B and B will transfer over to RBO and room Marama you're going to be taking the same photographs

18
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.950
figuring out your own system figuring out the best listings to get the best bookings.

19
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.100
There are some eccentricities with the RBO and room drama that are worth knowing but you're not going

20
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.530
to spend more than an hour adjusting your listing for each one.

21
00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.720
Technically and this is the reason why I do this is a separate one section lecture on these two.

22
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:59.830
It's that Air B and B is disproportionately more popular than these other two combined.

23
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:06.100
Typically when I take a booking or reservation I get probably eight bookings before I get one on room

24
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.020
drama or one on the RBO.

25
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.990
Think about it as a supplement to your air PNB experience and I believe that most people do it that

26
00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.820
way.

27
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.500
RB NBC is going to bring home the bacon and Villarrubia and Ruma drama are good if you are interested

28
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.060
in one having more options.

29
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.390
So it might be the case that over a weekend you know you want to travel for the weekend.

30
00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.470
So wants to rent it but they only want to run it for one night on Airbnb.

31
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.650
And you're thinking well I'm not going to maximize my money while I'm gone.

32
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.420
It might be the case that Villarrubia or rumor Ramas someone else has made an inquiry for two days of

33
00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.170
that month.

34
00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.140
You know it is obviously hypothetical but it's it's very possible.

35
00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.010
You want to cast your net as widely as possible for these types of situations.

36
00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.930
The second reason why I think it's worth posting on there is if you're the type that is looking to get

37
00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.120
the most bookings say you're going to travel for a month and you want the whole thing filled.

38
00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.430
It's very helpful to have these because they're going to help you cap off your rental.

39
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.160
The difference between having three weeks filled and having four weeks filled it is actually surprisingly

40
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.610
high.

41
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:07.580
It's a big difference.

42
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.610
In the case of my apartment that's difference between pulling and $10000 a month or $14000 a month the

43
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.360
extra 4000 is purely profit.

44
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.910
It doesn't go into the fixed costs and it's not as if my variable costs are that much higher for those

45
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.950
who are not familiar with those terms fixed costs means costs that do not fluctuate with the amount

46
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:27.900
of bookings you have.

47
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:33.760
So $3000 rent that's a fixed cost variable costs would be things that costs that go up.

48
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.970
The more bookings you have in this case more bookings It means more cleaning my fees for cleaning might

49
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:40.490
go up.

50
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.950
For maintenance and repairs might go up.

51
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:50.400
So a little bit about each one V.R. be so it's more of a vacation rental service vacation rental by

52
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.170
owner.

53
00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:57.030
If you go to their website they work entirely different than air B and B you have to pay a fee upfront

54
00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.550
just to get onto their Web site.

55
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.080
You have no idea if it's worthwhile or not.

56
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.280
They have tears.

57
00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:11.640
So I believe there is a bronze and silver and gold tier and it starts at I believe $300 a year and it

58
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.540
goes all the way to a platinum which is twelve hundred dollars a year in what they promise you is the

59
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.950
more you pay the more visibility you get.

60
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.050
Very hard an equation to balance if I pay an extra thousand dollars listing and be RBO how many more

61
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.120
booking inquiries am I going to get any more bookings.

62
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:33.280
I can tell you right now that generally it's going to be worth it not necessarily getting a twelve hundred

63
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.890
dollar package but on a dollar to a dollar value it's always going to be worth it.

64
00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:44.010
If I rent it out for one night on the RBO and I spent $300 a year I broke even on the RBO and that's

65
00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.300
the way I look at it and it's not realistic to think that they're not going to get you any bookings

66
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.510
at all and they're at least going to get you inquiries and after they get you increases up to you.

67
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.880
So if the RBA has this paywall to get into it you can go and check it out.

68
00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.280
And I'm sure you guys are looking at it right now and I can put up a screenshot on this so you can see

69
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.540
it.

70
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.930
It's not nearly as pretty.

71
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.460
The biggest difference here you'll notice is that a lot of the people listening are not actually people.

72
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.600
They're vacation rental companies.

73
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.330
And that's an important distinction.

74
00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.040
It's not really the home sharing experience you get an Air B and B it's not that you're going to get

75
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:25.620
real a chatty experience with the host and you're not going to get a lot of tips and tricks and what's

76
00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:31.980
the best thing to do in my city it's more like a we own a summer home and we'd like to put it up and

77
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:37.590
rent it out and at least get some occupancy the RBO.

78
00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:44.070
Typically I see it more popular with groups and families they see it as more professional more of a

79
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.690
standardized experience inside the app.

80
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.980
They make a lot of their money from you paying to promote your listing when you're on TV RBO you'll

81
00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.130
notice that it's actually quite difficult to find different listings.

82
00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:00.020
It's not as well-designed as Arabs can be.

83
00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.110
Their search function is kind of confusing.

84
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:10.550
And typically this is what happens when people pay to have more visibility skews it towards well.

85
00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:15.350
Am I seeing the most popular property or my seeing the best funded property.

86
00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:20.870
That's one of the reasons why I ask you a way from the RBO and towards there being BE THERE A B and

87
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.610
B is going to rank you based off of the customer experience quality.

88
00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:30.090
And so when you see it apartment it's already rated as the best apartment for what you're looking for

89
00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:36.450
and the best whole experience not who pay it the most because typically in my experience vacation rental

90
00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:38.630
companies know exactly what you're getting.

91
00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.450
It's not even particularly that much different than a hotel.

92
00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.040
People have a little bit extra money to spend.

93
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.510
Would like to have a kitchen attached to their hotel.

94
00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:49.760
Not a huge different value proposition.

95
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.820
In my opinion from hotels a goofy side story.

96
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:59.700
I live in the Fisherman's Wharf area of San Francisco and there's a coffee shop that I used to always

97
00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:06.210
squat at because I am a caffeine addict and I would always have sort of the same window always looking

98
00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:07.740
at the same Duplaix.

99
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:12.330
One of the things that kind of occurred to me over time was that that Duplaix never had anyone coming

100
00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:16.960
out of it what is going on with this duplex is no one lived there I've never seen the lights on.

101
00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:19.140
Kind of crazy considering the occupancy rate.

102
00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:20.780
SAN FRANCISCO It's insane.

103
00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:24.680
There's no unused space unless it's purposely being held off the market.

104
00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:31.920
One day I found that duplex on the RBO what ends up happening is I think that the owner just came up

105
00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:35.880
to a vacation rental company and said hey this is my space please run out for me.

106
00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:37.200
That's my guess.

107
00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:43.020
I think that's a silly decision because why would you outsource the management of your apartment when

108
00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.720
it requires such little upkeep to begin with.

109
00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:51.800
And I'll talk more about how this really is quite passive income when you're running out and home sharing.

110
00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:54.430
It's not as much work as you think it is.

111
00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:55.500
It's on the RBO.

112
00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:58.330
It's not an Air B and B and no one's ever coming out of it.

113
00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:00.550
Meaning that's just never rented.

114
00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:05.100
So I know obviously they would've taken it down off the RBO if it wasn't getting them enough money to

115
00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:06.120
cover their expenses.

116
00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.870
My guess is they probably just own it so they don't really have that much expenses besides property

117
00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:10.830
taxes.

118
00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:12.020
It's worth checking out.

119
00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:17.460
They have account managers that can answer a lot of questions about the RBO And if you guys have questions

120
00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:21.250
about my experience there you can always just post are in the group discussions.

121
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:24.620
I mean from message I could tell you a little bit more about it a little bit of warning.

122
00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:26.560
I don't have a ton of experience with it.

123
00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:30.720
My experience was that the inquiries you get are more skittish and this is something you get in a room

124
00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:36.050
or Ramas while they're hit and runs is what I call them they message you they are interest in the property

125
00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:39.400
you respond because you're a great host you respond within an hour.

126
00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:45.700
And if they don't respond nothing happens that's kind of a feature of the substandard home sharing Web

127
00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:46.800
sites.

128
00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.670
One thing you need to understand RBO.

129
00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:54.240
They do not work like Airbnb in the sense that when someone books your property they don't take their

130
00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.930
money from them at that point.

131
00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:57.880
Why is that important.

132
00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:02.940
Say you have someone who wants to rent it for a week in the summer on air B and B and you want someone

133
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:05.480
who wants to run on V RBO for a week in the summer.

134
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:10.380
You'd think they're equal right home sharing services have the same price on both of them will end up

135
00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:15.580
happening is that with the RBA they book it they don't really pay for it.

136
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:20.640
So what they'll do is they'll show up that week look at the property and then they actually have the

137
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.200
option to say no I don't want to stay here.

138
00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:25.250
That happens your apartment's empty.

139
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.970
You just wasted a week of listing your property.

140
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:33.210
If you have a nice apartment and you advertise it correctly I don't think that's something that's going

141
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:34.520
to happen all the time.

142
00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:39.210
I mean it seems odd that that would ever I'm going to talk a little bit about another property in our

143
00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:39.700
space.

144
00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:45.860
They would use the RBO and they had a huge problem with people showing up and saying no not interested.

145
00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:48.830
You know that $5300 booking that we made.

146
00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:50.780
Sorry we don't want to do it.

147
00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:55.410
That's something you need to take into consideration Air B and B has a cancellation policy the RBO does

148
00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:59.850
as well as A B and B has the ability to enforce that cancellation policy.

149
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:06.140
So when all things equal I would always take Air B and B so that's another thing yet I think about the

150
00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:10.700
RBO they show up and see the apartment then decide if they want to stay.

151
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:14.380
That means that if you're out of the country and you want to rent this out.

152
00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:18.630
Who's going to show off your apartment getting a little bit less passive.

153
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:24.270
The more you think about it because we have to be there to show the keys to have to wear a suit do have

154
00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:26.760
to smile a lot when I talk to them.

155
00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:27.500
How does that work.

156
00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:29.100
Take that into consideration.

157
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:34.500
That's a weird feature of them and the way that they do it is once they decide to book I believe they

158
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:41.150
give you a code and once you put that payment code in RBO they've established that that person wants

159
00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:42.070
to pay.

160
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:46.550
That's the most efficient way of telling whether or not someone wants to book your apartment is by a

161
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:49.600
secret code they keep in their pocket and they give it to you.

162
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:54.350
So that was my experience and typically I kind of shy away from the RBO.

163
00:10:54.440 --> 00:11:02.460
They have similar ways of establishing who is a responsive host to guest owner I'm the owner.

164
00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:05.180
And their situation they're not really hosting them.

165
00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:09.830
You're not going to get people who are really going to be engaged in the area that they're traveling

166
00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:10.130
to.

167
00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:14.990
That also means that they're going to be less forgiving when it comes to reviewing you think about Airbnb

168
00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:19.340
as they come in and you tell them everything you love about the city and you give them all sorts of

169
00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:25.970
tips and tricks and if their toilet breaks or your stove light stops working your pilot light in your

170
00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:29.750
stove is not working they're going to give you the benefit of doubt that they know the day they're going

171
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:34.670
to think of you and then think oh I don't want it you know trash this person's review if you RBO they

172
00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:35.960
don't know you.

173
00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:41.410
They are used to having real estate agents show them the properties where they rent them.

174
00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.380
If anybody has had experience of the RBO I would love to hear about it.

175
00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:50.360
Put it in the group discussion say Hey Evan you're not right I'll use the RBO and it's everything to

176
00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:52.160
me it saved my marriage.

177
00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:52.840
Let me know.

178
00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:55.370
I mean maybe some of them around other people have figured this out.

179
00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:59.960
And if you guys want more information on the RBO that's something you can also ask in maybe it's something

180
00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:05.570
I'll add it's additional lecture later on when I can do a little bit more research and explain more

181
00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:12.770
of the centricity that are involved with the service so quickly over to room drama and please forgive

182
00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:19.240
me if I sound unduly sarcastic about rumors but rumor omma the way I see them is they are RB and B's

183
00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:23.040
ugly unfriendly and just generally unpleasant to be around.

184
00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:30.150
SR they are a company that if you go to their Web site it looks like it was designed over the weekend.

185
00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:32.300
Maybe they've updated their website.

186
00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:36.950
I just recently looked at it and it looks like they've figured out hey maybe we should make our buttons

187
00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:37.790
work.

188
00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:41.590
My memory room drama is that it just doesn't look professional.

189
00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:47.210
And you'll notice when you go on there they just kind of went after this flat design which I think is

190
00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:50.920
a bit lazy but they've been really imitating a lot of it.

191
00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:52.430
SBN does.

192
00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:54.450
At the same time they're not Air B and B.

193
00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:57.620
When you book the room drama it's the same thing as the RBO.

194
00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:03.170
Chances are that house is not going to be nearly as responsive or nearly as engaged in your stay.

195
00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:07.730
One thing you'll notice on the room a Rama is that most of the listings on there are also an Air B and

196
00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:08.930
B.

197
00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:12.830
The one thing you'll notice though is that the rates there typically will be higher.

198
00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:14.260
Why are they higher.

199
00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:20.240
I believe it's because there's a little bit more risk with room drama and risk in the sense of it since

200
00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.440
the site is so ugly.

201
00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:27.320
It's going to take a lot more effort to get people to look which means that your time spent on their

202
00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:31.220
Web site is getting more time for less bookings.

203
00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:37.250
Also one of the bigger things I think and this is another thing of the RBO is that the insurance policy

204
00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:42.650
and I'm going to have a separate lecture talking about the insurance policies because it's very important

205
00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:48.150
for you to understand to understand how your B and B handles complaints damage things like that.

206
00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:50.470
How do you deal with homeowner's insurance.

207
00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:54.230
Every single one of these home sharing sites has a different way of doing it.

208
00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:59.240
The biggest difference that I'm going to condense in just a couple senses rumor Ahman the RBO do not

209
00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.320
offer as much insurance.

210
00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:04.030
The RBO is $50000 room or Omma.

211
00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:10.760
I'm not sure I'll look it up and I'll include it in a tax file and the references M.B.A. $1000000 covered

212
00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:13.960
for anything that could be associated with the stay.

213
00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:17.880
That's a much bigger liability pool to draw from.

214
00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:22.870
And the other ones not so much more risk you need more reward.

215
00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:28.910
Typically prices are going to be higher than that room Ramah works for us and one of the RBO you trade

216
00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:31.450
payment keys to get paid.

217
00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:36.630
Past that I mean you'll notice when you on the Web site it looks scarily like Airbnb the rumor omma

218
00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:40.040
has one of these interesting features that some of you might enjoy this.

219
00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:41.530
I did not have a great experience with it.

220
00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:43.490
They have these things called shout outs.

221
00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:47.310
They shout out is the reverse of how someone bucks an apartment.

222
00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:50.030
Usually you come on the Web site you say I want to stay in this area.

223
00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:50.810
I like this price.

224
00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:54.800
I like this person I will message them hello I'd like to see your apartment.

225
00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.310
Rumor has it the opposite way.

226
00:14:56.390 --> 00:15:01.310
They have a feature where you can go on and say hey I'm coming this is how many people there are this

227
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:02.110
is my budget.

228
00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:05.760
Hey why don't you come pitch me as a consumer maybe that's kind of cool.

229
00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:10.850
As a house that's I think a waste because you have to think about the mentality of someone who does

230
00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:16.070
that you don't get a shout out and you're saying I want to stay for five nights for a thousand dollars

231
00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:22.880
and $500 usually what that means is that one you didn't take the time to actually look in other areas

232
00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.710
to see what you wanted to see if that fit your budget.

233
00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:32.690
And if they did do that then it's number two which is that their budget probably doesn't fit into a

234
00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:37.760
budget mismatch generally or it's an effort mismatch maybe they're just like hey I'm just going to throw

235
00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:38.340
this out.

236
00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.750
Maybe someone will come and say yes.

237
00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:45.900
Stay at my beautifully appointed apartment and you can stay for $50 a night.

238
00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:47.930
Maybe that will work right.

239
00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:51.470
That's kind of my experience with a lot of these shout outs will come out and they'll just completely

240
00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:52.690
unrealistic.

241
00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:55.070
They don't even know what sometimes when they're coming.

242
00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:57.830
Maybe that's something you guys can work to your advantage.

243
00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:03.140
I love if any of you guys have experience with this you just figured out a way of it everybody gets

244
00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:03.910
him a shout out.

245
00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:08.820
And you made your best friends from it let me know because I'll come back and change my opinion on this.

246
00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:09.930
It's never worked for me.

247
00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:15.620
I think maybe because room drama is again like I get probably one inquiry per 10 that I get on Air B

248
00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:19.310
and B so I never really put the effort into figuring out their system.

249
00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:21.390
I don't particularly think it's worth it.

250
00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:26.720
Generally what I like I said you focus on Air B and B then you put it on these other outlets you checked

251
00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:30.290
in every now and then but they're not going to be a game changer for you.

252
00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:35.630
I think they're definitely going to move the needle in the sense that you could very easily get an extra

253
00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:41.420
10 percent fill rates in your apartment or maybe you're lucky and you get different offers between the

254
00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:42.020
two.

255
00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:47.390
Like I said DRPA and ROMERIL in my experience very skittish hit and run kind of inquiries hey I'm interested.

256
00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:51.830
Hey I'm gone whether or not you can turn that into people saying I don't know.

257
00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:56.810
Like I said if you guys I'm going to go more into depth on these two services I definitely will I at

258
00:16:56.810 --> 00:17:01.120
this moment do not think they are worth spending a lot of time on.

259
00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:05.710
No offense to the gentleman and to women who made these sites.

260
00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:07.020
Arrington is the big one.

261
00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:14.280
And if the market share Manges in the future I would imagine Airbnb has probably 90 percent of the bookings.

262
00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:19.040
If that changes then it might help to have a little bit about ROOM know a little bit of room around

263
00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:19.850
and be RBO.

264
00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:21.720
The mom and I just don't think it's worth it.

265
00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:27.500
If you are running out a spare home or a spare apartment a lot of people do that you know they own the

266
00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:30.040
building and they live in one unit and they have another unit.

267
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:35.220
The RBO is going to be good for apartment rentals seating the drama.

268
00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:36.490
Good for apartment rentals.

269
00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:43.310
They do offer shared spaces but why would you book off room drama on a site that just looks like a Nigerian

270
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:44.840
scam artist designed it.

271
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:47.380
Why would you choose to go to air B and B.

272
00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:52.220
These are all my opinions don't sue me if you work for these companies but I'm trying to point you in

273
00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:56.510
the right direction as to what's worth spending your time on because that's what this is all about it's

274
00:17:56.510 --> 00:18:02.970
taking the small amount of effort and getting the most income game changeability out of it.
