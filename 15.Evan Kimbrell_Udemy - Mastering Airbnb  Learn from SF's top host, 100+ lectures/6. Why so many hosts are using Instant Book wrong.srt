1
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:10,280
Let's talk about the feature called Instant book if anyone's noticed this when you're filling out your

2
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:16,190
listing there's an option where you can turn on instant book and then you can set different parameters

3
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,660
for which you can accept instant booking when you're searching on air being me.

4
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:25,570
For those of you who don't know what this is you can see on the thumbnails.

5
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:31,180
A lightning bolt if there's a lightning bolt that means the host has enabled instant booking.

6
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:35,960
If they don't have the lightning ball that means that in order to book that property you would have

7
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:43,210
to send a message to the host and have the host pre-approve your dates and then book with them.

8
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,470
If you don't have instant book it requires that the guests message you telling you why they're coming

9
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:52,940
maybe a little bit of information about themselves and they give you the dates beforehand and the amount

10
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,830
of guests and then you get to choose whether or not you approve them.

11
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:03,410
Now you'll notice this when you're searching on air B and B in most big urban centers most of the properties

12
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:09,820
are going to have the lightening bolt logo meaning that they have instant book turned on.

13
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:14,690
I would imagine in smaller markets it's probably the case that a lot of them don't have instant book

14
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:17,780
turned on but it's probably 50 percent.

15
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:22,280
If you walk in San Francisco and just take a quick search that's roughly about probably 75 percent have

16
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:29,810
this turned on in sin book allows the host to say I can take gas to whenever and I don't need to pre-qualify

17
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:31,050
them beforehand.

18
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:37,520
And it also allows you to basically say I'm OK with what Air B and B does in their pre-fall qualification

19
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:38,300
system.

20
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,090
I'm ok with E-Verify.

21
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:44,750
I'm OK with the phone and e-mail verify and that's it.

22
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:49,850
The rest of the way that goes kind of mitigate any type of risk in that case is just using a security

23
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:50,890
deposit.

24
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:56,480
Since this is under the section of the setting out and starting out at first the reason why I bring

25
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,400
this up is because it's something that you might be tempted to do.

26
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:05,900
Arab and B does push people towards using instant booking in the actual administration panel you're

27
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,370
setting up your listing.

28
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:13,400
They usually list something out saying consider Ansun book you'll get an extra 20 percent bookings.

29
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,380
In my experience and experience in the house I've talked to you this is absolutely true.

30
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,150
It is true that you get a lot more bookings with instant book.

31
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:27,410
However you have to consider the fact that at first he put on instant book that means anyone can book

32
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,520
you know and it is at a time when you're not completely used to the system.

33
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,720
So you need to think about it.

34
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:39,770
Typically with instant book is it something that experienced host to use and it's something that I strongly

35
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:42,430
suggest you don't use at first.

36
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:47,510
Now at first it might hurt you in the sense that if you see two properties one has Ansen book and one

37
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:48,380
doesn't.

38
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:51,190
You might have the case where someone just goes with the Ansin book.

39
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,540
They don't have to deal with the process of messaging the host waiting for the host to respond.

40
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:59,440
Waiting then to send preapproval then to book.

41
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:03,620
And that might be the case that they'll get more bookings but at first I don't think it's worth it.

42
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:08,060
And if you listen to the previous lecture we talked about how important it is that you're first say

43
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:15,770
four or five ghast have a positive experience and positive reviews you'll get why I say that instant

44
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,280
booking is risky.

45
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:21,950
It means that you have a space that's always available.

46
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,630
Say you have a space and it's empty to night.

47
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:29,300
That means that someone could literally go to the page book it for tonight and they could book it at

48
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:35,270

49
7:00 p.m. which means that by 8:00 p.m. or 9:00 p.m. when they show up it needs to be clean and it needs

50
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:37,590
to be ready for someone to move en.

51
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:43,250
And that might not be conducive with your schedule at first and it's usually something that over time

52
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:50,130
once you've hosted say 10 15 people you get used to it and then you know how to handle this whole system.

53
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:54,710
If you turn on and in a book it's also going to require that you are closer to your phone or closing

54
00:03:54,710 --> 00:04:00,700
your computer more often because you really want to know at the exact moment when someone books.

55
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,890
And the reason why is because they can do these last second bookings.

56
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:10,140
They can also do bookings on weekends that you haven't necessarily thought out yet.

57
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:15,320
And then I can give an example in my apartment I haven't seen book set up because I've done this enough

58
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:19,870
times and I'm comfortable with people booking without messaging me and introducing themselves.

59
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:26,900
But what ends up happening is because I don't update my calendar every single time that something changes

60
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:31,820
or anything in my schedule updates say something happens that I know is a week and three months from

61
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:35,140
now that I can host I don't immediately take that down.

62
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,290
Now there's a small chance that someone can get on and book that weekend.

63
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:42,200
And then what ends up happening is you have to have a really awkward conversation with the guests saying

64
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,460
oh sorry I can't actually host you then and you have to end up usually canceling and what that does

65
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:50,060
it posts on your listing saying that you cancel on the ghast.

66
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,660
That's something you never want to have happen.

67
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:56,120
Inevitably if you have instant book on it's a possibility.

68
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,340
Now if you're listening and listening and you have say like a shared room inside of a full apartment

69
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:06,200
that could create problems as well because what happens if you have instant book on both of them.

70
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:11,030
You go to bed you have two people book say they're in Europe because they're you know six to nine hours

71
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:17,360
ahead of us said a book the private room and then the full apartment gets also booked by someone as

72
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,850
well right afterwards.

73
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:21,830
You can't possibly fulfill both of those bookings.

74
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:26,410
So you have to end up canceling one of them and having an awkward kind of exchange.

75
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:31,310
So usually when you do instant book you kind of have to be comfortable in the system you've created.

76
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:36,760
You need to really be like a hawk on the schedule especially if you're doing multiple properties then

77
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:41,060
it's very easy for you to forget and not notice when there's an instant book and then all of a sudden

78
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:45,170
say the weekend's coming up and oh wow you have to find a cleaner to clean it right now.

79
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:50,570
So I think at the very beginning it's not worth doing but after you get comfortable and you get used

80
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:55,910
to have a routine going down then it's something I definitely think you should look into and eventually

81
00:05:55,910 --> 00:06:01,490
start using because it's going to get to a point where even if you're in a small market as more people

82
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:05,960
start hosting and more and more people start staying on Airbnb it's going to become normal that people

83
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:10,700
start instant booking and offering instant booking if you're the one person who isn't offering.

84
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:16,420
It's going be a significant downer for how many inquiries you get and how many bookings you get you

85
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:19,150
guys have any questions is posted in the group discussion.

86
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:21,120
If you have any questions about.

87
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:26,320
I've hosted five guests six guests I think I'm pretty confident and ready to do instant book.

88
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:29,320
You can post it also if he goes on experiences with instant book.

89
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,390
You can post it.

90
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,560
Typically I call it a pro feature it's something that you should hold off on until you're much much

91
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,850
better and more experience with this whole process.
