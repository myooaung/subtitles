00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:10.430
So I want to talk a little bit about how do you determine whether or not your space is good enough to

2
00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:11.740
home share.

3
00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:18.080
This is different than the lecture I did before about whether or not you have the right environment

4
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.190
to participate in or be in being in home sharing.

5
00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:27.610
Before we talked about whether or not your market is strong enough because that is a larger pre-qualify

6
00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:34.850
or then whether or not your space is good enough is similar to my thoughts on whether or not your market

7
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.700
is good enough I think in the case of your space again it's something that you should look at optimistically

8
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.920
in the vast majority of cases.

9
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.570
You can rent out your space and it is actually possible.

10
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:54.960
I think that in some cases you might need more effort to make it to a point where it's ready to be rented.

11
00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:02.600
But I've rarely seen situations where it's an absolute no you can't run out this space as long as we've

12
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.280
established that there are people looking for spaces in your town and people are actually booking then

13
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.540
it's just a question of what are you going to run out and whether or not you have the correct set up.

14
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.770
And like I said it's not particularly strenuous to meet these requirements.

15
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:24.470
I think it's very much an oddity when I see a space that cannot be rented out at all.

16
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:31.670
The first thing I want you to do is imagine just kind of in your head do you want to rent out part of

17
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.800
your space or do you enter the entirety of your space.

18
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.470
Now when you take in consideration with this is that if you're running out part of your space you're

19
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:40.550
going to be hosting.

20
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.270
You're going to focus more on the experience with the guests.

21
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.480
It's going to be a little bit more active but at the same time you get to live in your apartment while

22
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.940
this is happening so you don't have to relocate or you know have to plan this around the time that you're

23
00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:56.840
gone.

24
00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.760
I think it goes without saying that in these types of situations you obviously cannot charge as much.

25
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:09.020
However you still live in your space so you don't have to incur the cost of finding someone else to

26
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.300
stay.

27
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.920
The flipside of this is well what if you want to rent out your entirety of your space it might be the

28
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.300
case that you travel frequently or you would like to travel more frequently.

29
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.670
It might be the case that you know somewhere where you can stay for free and you can rent out your space

30
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.030
when that's available and pocket the difference.

31
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.290
That's also quite common.

32
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:35.730
The most common combination of this that I see are people who are interested in both.

33
00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.590
They would like to rent it out while they are there and they'd also like to bring up the entire thing

34
00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:40.960
while they're gone.

35
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.520
Typically Also I'd like to suggest that if you are interested in running the entirety of your apartment

36
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.090
also consider running out a section of your apartment.

37
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:56.120
And I'll talk about that later in the strategy section but it has to do with the fact that you may not

38
00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.130
get a 100 percent fill rates on your entire apartment but to call your apartment is high enough you

39
00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:07.730
can actually make the rate for an individual room high enough to cover your rent expenses or whatever

40
00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.050
fixed expenses and still make it worth it to run out the entire place like that where at least you know

41
00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.670
then make a decision at the moment whether or not you want to stay.

42
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:22.590
Now if you're someone that fits into the first category there's a certain set of guidelines that you

43
00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.880
should take into consideration when you're thinking about whether or not you can rent out your space

44
00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:34.580
the number one thing I would point out is that you need to take into consideration how you see the interaction

45
00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.650
between you and your guests.

46
00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.590
Typically when you share a space there is going to be usually limited interaction.

47
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:47.210
There's a very a larger chunk of interaction when you first meet them and then it tapers off throughout

48
00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:48.320
their stay.

49
00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.970
Staying longer than perhaps you'll talk to the Morial have more interactions with them what you want

50
00:03:52.970 --> 00:04:00.710
to consider first and foremost is how do you envision their stay being and I mean that in a sense they're

51
00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:03.870
paying to stay at your apartment.

52
00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.580
So there is a certain level of privacy that they're going to expect.

53
00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:14.540
There's a certain level of amenities that they're going to expect and not necessarily just amenities

54
00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.790
that are available period amenities that are going to be exclusively theirs.

55
00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.760
So we're you're looking at your space say it's a spare bedroom.

56
00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.730
Let's say it's a room attached to the side of your house.

57
00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:30.470
What's going to be available to them and what's going to be available on a shared basis if it it's such

58
00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.460
the case that they have a room that is separate like an efficiency.

59
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:41.330
You know they have a separate entrance and they have their own like an efficiency would have it have

60
00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.410
their own amenities they have their own sink bathroom so you have enough bathrooms or house you can

61
00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:46.820
assign a bathroom to them.

62
00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.920
That's an ideal situation because they can have the privacy that they want but they can also have the

63
00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:57.380
option to interact with the host if they actually decide that that's what they want and it's really

64
00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:02.240
going to depend on the personalities some people are introverted some people are much more extroverted.

65
00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.740
Some people do not want to interact as much.

66
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:10.970
Some people see the interaction of the house as a byproduct of getting a cheaper room whereas other

67
00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:17.180
you know extroverted guests see it as a benefit to getting air B and B and so if they don't have the

68
00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.610
interaction they actually see that as a negative.

69
00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:24.440
Typically what I would say is you need to imagine whether or not someone can stay in the section of

70
00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:30.330
your house apartment condo whatever and have the option to engage with the host.

71
00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.530
But also the option to not if they don't want to.

72
00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:39.410
So if you think this is a situation where it's ideal in the sense that they can be as reclusive as they

73
00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.620
want but also a social as they want.

74
00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.610
That I think you're in a good situation.

75
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:47.740
It gets trickier when you're talking about running out of room in a smaller apartment.

76
00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.490
So if you have a one bedroom and you really want to rent it out because you you know you really want

77
00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.090
to get rid of your rent payments.

78
00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:55.660
This is a little bit trickier.

79
00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.290
I would say and then you know the case that it's a smaller apartment that means more interaction.

80
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:05.750
That means that you're going to need people who are more social to feel comfortable and if you get the

81
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.800
occasional person who was under the impression that they're going to have some privacy it might be a

82
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.030
little bit harder.

83
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.290
This is the least ideal situation there in one bedroom and you want to give the guests your living room

84
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.230
or your bedroom.

85
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.230
Here's something to take in consideration.

86
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:21.700
Say you're going to rent out your bedroom and you're going to take the living room.

87
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:24.110
It's the assumption that you're sharing everything.

88
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:27.580
We have one bedroom one bathroom and only one kitchen.

89
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:28.450
That's fine.

90
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:32.980
But do they have to pass through your living room to get to these amenities.

91
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:39.290
That makes a huge difference because if they're living in your space and they don't have to walk across

92
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:44.330
your living room that means they have the choice to not interact with you if they don't want to they

93
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:49.140
can you know go about their day maybe that a long stressful day and they don't want to talk.

94
00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:51.480
That's something you have to take into consideration.

95
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.070
Can they have the space if they want the space.

96
00:06:54.230 --> 00:07:00.020
So if you're in a situation where it's unavoidable that you both live in the same space without crossing

97
00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:04.180
over each other that's going to limit how many people are going to find this appealing.

98
00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:08.480
Now like I said at the beginning you have to look at this from an optimistic point of view.

99
00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.450
I don't think that precludes you from listing your apartment.

100
00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:16.820
What that does is it's going to make it such that you probably have a cap to how much you can charge

101
00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:17.860
for that space.

102
00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.710
You're going to have to lower your price.

103
00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:21.260
That's the magic of the system.

104
00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.800
If you don't think your space is good enough.

105
00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:24.430
Wow.

106
00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:25.900
There's a way of determining that.

107
00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:32.240
And the price will determine that your space is not nice enough the price will go down until eventually

108
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:36.710
gets to the point where this is worth that for the person staying one of the things that I'm going to

109
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:43.730
touch on later in this course is that there's a general kind of rule you'll notice with regards to what

110
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:46.560
you're charging and the type of person that attracts.

111
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:50.960
Generally when you charge $50 or less you're going to get the type of person that's going to give you

112
00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:51.850
the benefit the doubt.

113
00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:57.200
They know they're going into a shared space opportunity and they know that this is going to require

114
00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:01.850
interaction because they're getting a deal and they're fine with that they're fine with things not working

115
00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:03.120
perfectly fine.

116
00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:08.720
So if you're in a situation where you are a one bedroom and you want to run out your side bedroom it's

117
00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:14.840
going to be tough for you to break out of that first category of the $50 or less because you're going

118
00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:21.470
to need that people who are flexible who are perfectly fine with the fact that this is not an ideal

119
00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:22.670
situation.

120
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:27.610
Generally when you start charging more like $100 people are going to start expecting amenities that's

121
00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:31.470
going to be the point at which shared amenities are no longer acceptable.

122
00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:34.510
That might be a limitation on your space.

123
00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:37.300
So these are things you want to take into consideration.

124
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:42.370
In general though and I think this applies to running out one side space versus the entire apartment

125
00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:46.650
you want to look at basic things like what's the quality of your furnishings in your apartment.

126
00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:51.700
Are they things you found on Craigslist that have holes in them and could possibly be infested.

127
00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:54.300
You know I think college students call that eclectic.

128
00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:58.570
Or is it the case that you actually have some high quality goods inside your apartment.

129
00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:04.290
How new are your fixtures do you have anything that is obviously broken.

130
00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:05.740
You have a hole in your wall.

131
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:07.980
Do you have a faucet that doesn't work.

132
00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:12.210
Do you have a bathroom that doesn't work are there basic things like that that are not working.

133
00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:15.350
If that's the case you might want to look into fixing those.

134
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:19.080
Otherwise I think you're still going to hit a cap on how much you can charge.

135
00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:23.130
The beauty of Air B and B and I talked about this in the previous lecture was that there's the minimum

136
00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.650
assumption of quality.

137
00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:30.780
And so since there is no minimum assumption of quality here and mintage in the last lecture FBN beers

138
00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.870
have a much lower expectation.

139
00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:37.920
And if you have a place that's unfinished that you think would be crazy to charge for.

140
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:42.210
Chances are if you lower the price enough you'll find people who are willing to do that because they

141
00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:46.650
come to Air B and B you're going to get people who are more willing to look the other way and give you

142
00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:51.720
the minute that now and just now that they're getting a deal and that's how they preface this entire

143
00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.400
experience is is a deal.

144
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:58.140
I'm perfectly fine with the fact that I might get splinters when I walk across the unfinished wooden

145
00:09:58.140 --> 00:09:59.190
floors.

146
00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.360
Just look at the general status of things.

147
00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:05.210
One of the things I've noticed is how cluttered is your space.

148
00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:09.480
A lot of people you know you don't run out your home but you've lived in it for 25 30 years.

149
00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:14.620
You can always take that stuff move it off to the side minimize how much stuff you have that if it's

150
00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.260
the case that you're running out an apartment you have dogs.

151
00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:23.640
You cannot separate the dog care from every piece of your apartment slash house that might be a little

152
00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:24.470
bit trickier.

153
00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:29.250
Again every time I say this is a bad thing or it's trickier it's just reflected in your price.

154
00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:33.720
So I'm just trying to make you understand the more of the things you correct the higher you can charge

155
00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:38.190
the more money you can make the more choosy can get with guests the more opportunities you have to travel

156
00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:40.590
eccentric cetera back to clutter.

157
00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:47.430
When I'm talking about clutter I mean you know family photo albums and things across the entire place

158
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:53.220
that make it look more like a residence and less like a place that you pay to stay at your hotel.

159
00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:58.290
I'm not saying that you have to depersonalize every single aspect of your apartment but it does help

160
00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:02.950
to minimize some of these things or at least you know keep it to a reasonable level.

161
00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:10.080
I have stayed in urban bees that are overwhelmingly the case that every single trinket every single

162
00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:14.090
what we call vignettes of photography are dedicated to the people who live there.

163
00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:18.480
That is a bit strange especially when you rent the entire apartment now when you're running out your

164
00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.520
entire PO Moore apartment.

165
00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:25.950
There are different guidelines that you're going to want to go by what I was saying about broken fixtures

166
00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:31.170
unfinished parts of your apartment on clutter you know cluttered and that absolutely applies but with

167
00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:36.000
entire homes and apartments you don't have to take into consideration things like the availability of

168
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:36.900
privacy.

169
00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:39.960
That's not something you have to worry about because they're running the entire space they're going

170
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.130
to have privacy.

171
00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:46.410
Now you have to think about it when your own apartment the entire space and think about it from the

172
00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:48.100
reverse angle actually.

173
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:50.210
What about the privacy of your neighbors.

174
00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:57.540
Are you running this out in an apartment complex apartment complexes are less ideal in the sense that

175
00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:01.680
they are less genuine they're less unique.

176
00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:08.730
Typically they do feel almost two hotel ish for someone to be interested in it but also the density

177
00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:14.250
of the residence often creates problems because if you're actively running it out they are gone a month

178
00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:17.250
and you don't have long term rentals you have two day Reynolds three day rentals.

179
00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:22.830
Not only do you might have a problem with your H-2A or homeowner's association you might also have a

180
00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:23.940
problem with your neighbors.

181
00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:27.310
People don't like living next to transient hotels.

182
00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:31.410
Do you have to take that in consideration that he's going to be a lot of footwork and a lot of people

183
00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:33.510
coming in and a lot of people coming out.

184
00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:37.100
I think people have a tendency to overestimate this as a problem.

185
00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:42.780
People have a tendency to think that because people are running the space coming in and coming out that

186
00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:47.660
they're gonna be making a lot of noise if you're renting out a one bedroom in an apartment complex.

187
00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:52.500
First of all you obviously do want to check with your neighbors and this is fine but at the same time

188
00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.860
it depends on the frequency at which you're renting it out.

189
00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:58.530
It depends on how long the length of stay is.

190
00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:01.020
And it also just depends on the people you're getting.

191
00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:06.480
The vast majority of tourists are going to come in and out once a day and it's not going to be any more

192
00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:12.630
disruptive than if you're doing it yourself or you had friends over so it's not an increase in disruption

193
00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:13.850
to the other person.

194
00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:19.290
There is an exception to this if you are running out a two or three bedroom and you're focusing on groups

195
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:20.940
and you're letting groups come in.

196
00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:26.070
Now that could actually be obnoxious especially if you're running it out to people of the aides that

197
00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:30.900
might be going out on weekends coming back drunk again if you're the type of person who has lots of

198
00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:32.370
friends and you do that anyway.

199
00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:37.800
That's not going to be a huge difference but it is worth considering how close you live next to your

200
00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:41.330
neighbors and how many shared spaces you have.

201
00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:45.060
If you're running something like a tenant in common that may be something to consider.

202
00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:45.750
Right.

203
00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:52.380
You might have to share a backyard or share the ping pong table or a swimming pool just things that

204
00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:53.910
take into consideration.

205
00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:58.550
Typically I don't think it's as big of a problem if you do enough.

206
00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:02.460
Greening of your the inquiries for people to stay.

207
00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:08.640
So if you look for people who look like they have are respectable or have a predictable schedule they're

208
00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:14.610
not going to be creating a problem then you should be fine although you should always kind of plan for

209
00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:17.840
the worse it could be the case and you do get some bad apples.

210
00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:22.500
A lot of the people coming through Airbnb don't have reviews yet so you should know that that could

211
00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:23.390
happen.

212
00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:29.880
Other things to consider when running out a full apartment and as well as an apartment that you share

213
00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:33.840
location how easy is it to find your apartment.

214
00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:36.860
How close are you to the mass transit.

215
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:39.130
How convenient is it to get around.

216
00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:42.410
Where are the points of interest if you're in a tourist destination.

217
00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:47.820
You can create a rubric out of this and I might make that as a as an addendum to this course and I can

218
00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:52.530
put it on there and you guys can grade your spaces but these are all things that just get reflected

219
00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:53.130
in the price.

220
00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:56.680
The more things you have going for you the more you can charge the more money you're going to make.

221
00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:02.080
But if you don't have a lot of things going for you it is long as you're not having a deal breaker.

222
00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:05.120
I think that you are still going to be able to rent it out.

223
00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:07.920
It's just that you're gonna have to experiment more with price.

224
00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.860
You'll still be able to make money.

225
00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:16.780
You might have to rent it out more often to meet your rent or meet whatever profit goals you have.

226
00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:23.130
A good way of judging your space if you're trying to rent out a full apartment full home is by thinking

227
00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:24.580
about your space.

228
00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:28.170
Imagine it completely uncluttered completely clean.

229
00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:35.610
And now imagine if you yourself did not live there and then imagine whether or not you could see this

230
00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:39.280
place you're staying in as an alternative to renting a hotel.

231
00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:40.950
That's the way I like to think about it.

232
00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:47.850
If you could legitimately see yourself saying yes I would stay here over a hotel leave out the price

233
00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:53.050
equation because as long as you get yourself saying yes then it's definitely rentable.

234
00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:56.100
Then the question is would you say to yourself after that.

235
00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:57.820
Yes it is cheaper than a hotel.

236
00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:03.130
Or do you see yourself saying after that yeah I could do this over a hotel now in general Arab bees

237
00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:05.250
are much more attractive than hotels.

238
00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:08.090
I mean it's not for everyone but the majority of people.

239
00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:15.240
If everything else was the same would probably pick a apartment that has more character that has more

240
00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:20.880
thought put into it that has more amenities it has a kitchen you know and it's has actual some uniqueness

241
00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:21.180
to it.

242
00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:22.760
Most people would do that.

243
00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.300
You're always going to get that bump.

244
00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:26.900
So as long as you can get yourself to the point you'd say yeah.

245
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.380
Someone who would pay to stay here and I could set it up such that someone would come here and pay to

246
00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:32.140
stay here.

247
00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.830
Then you're in a very good situation.

248
00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:40.230
And again price will always determine the quality and over time you can get better at the hosting experience

249
00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:44.540
better at the decoration and you can start charging more.

250
00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:51.390
Another way I think that would help you look at this is go to the front of your apartment and if you're

251
00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:57.510
thinking about running on a single room go into that one specific room and imagine just being there

252
00:16:57.510 --> 00:16:59.820
had you rented that space.

253
00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:07.080
And I think this helps people grasp the concept of yes people do pay to live here and it's not like

254
00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:10.660
you're running it out to your friend who's just there on the couch.

255
00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:15.120
Your friend doesn't care if there's newspapers on the table your friend doesn't care if you know your

256
00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:19.920
dogs knocked over the food ball and just strung water all over the apartment they don't care because

257
00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:20.480
it's free.

258
00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:23.530
But now imagine you live there you don't know the other person.

259
00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:27.240
Is this something that you could foresee paying for.

260
00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:31.850
Typically yes shelter always has a value to it.

261
00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:36.840
It's just a question of how much she can charge whether or not that amount is going to be worth it for

262
00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:37.060
you.

263
00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:39.740
Again the vast majority of cases.

264
00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:41.450
Yeah it's definitely worth it.

265
00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:47.070
But I think if you walk yourself through your apartment and imagine you are a renter that would definitely

266
00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:49.260
help because you can see the experience.

267
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:51.740
You live in a big apartment building and you have to walk.

268
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:57.240
There's some really ugly flights of stairs to go through an ugly hallway with like rats running across

269
00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:01.520
it to get to a door that barely works and then you get in the apartment that might be a problem.

270
00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:04.750
You know that might preclude how much you can charge for it.

271
00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:06.750
You might be stuck in that $50 range.

272
00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:10.680
We previously talked about these are things that take into consideration you know if you have your own

273
00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:15.770
apartment your own home you have your own park and you live near lots of points of interest.

274
00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:22.560
Could you see a family parking in your garage staying in your home and then actually going out and using

275
00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.660
as a base to explore her city.

276
00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:28.350
Chances are if you live there it's probably a decent location.

277
00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:32.560
It's not a huge difference between the reasons why people who work in a city pick their location.

278
00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:34.620
Reasons why tourists pick it.

279
00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:40.370
I live in Fisherman's Wharf of San Francisco which is the touristy area ends up being perfectly fine

280
00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:41.830
we're close to everybody else.

281
00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:44.470
Many other people live in the same area and commute to work.

282
00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:46.300
Same value system.

283
00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:47.490
In my opinion.

284
00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:53.340
So yes take into consideration all of these things that I've said I don't think there's a definitive

285
00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:56.790
answer to yes or no it's a spectrum.

286
00:18:56.790 --> 00:19:00.570
If you have a lot of things going for you like I said you're trying to rent out a private space and

287
00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:06.420
your space is very private man they have their own amenities say you have a two bedroom two bath you

288
00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:08.040
can rent out a bedroom plus a bath.

289
00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.440
That's going to make a big difference in how much you can charge.

290
00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:14.820
That's going to make a big difference in how it work that this is for you.

291
00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:20.190
At the end of the course you're going to see a list of tax that's going to include all of the main talking

292
00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:26.870
points from every single lecture and I'll include thing on there as a kind of a question set.

293
00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:32.270
You can read off and will say things we talked about all your furnishings about the finish of your apartment

294
00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:36.530
clutter things like that and you can use that as kind of a way to gauge whether or not you're ready

295
00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:41.210
to rent out your space or whether or not there is something that is a deal breaker in terms of how much

296
00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:43.890
you can rent out your space more and whether or not you can rent it out period.

297
00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:50.450
Like always post any questions in the group discussion I will do my best to help you out to turn in

298
00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:52.040
when they're in your space is ready.

299
00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:53.100
It's very subjective.

300
00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:56.670
It's not something that is purely set in stone.

301
00:19:56.670 --> 00:20:02.190
There's no yes no for every single issue that could arise it's also something that you can figure out

302
00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:04.320
over time trial and error.

303
00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:08.520
Chances are if you're comfortable with your space someone else can be comfortable with your space and

304
00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:11.760
you can get it to the point where they'll rent it out for money.

305
00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:13.050
Just be positive.

306
00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:14.350
Be optimistic.

307
00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:16.860
It's definitely something that's worthwhile doing.
