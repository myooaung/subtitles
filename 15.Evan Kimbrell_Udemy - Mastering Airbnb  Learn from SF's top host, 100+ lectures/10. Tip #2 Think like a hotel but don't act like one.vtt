00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:13.140
Hosting Tip Number 8 I call this the Think like a hotel but don't act like a hotel.

2
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.650
What I mean is you want to think about costs.

3
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.260
You want to think about how what to pay is $200 to come stay.

4
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.540
How much are you spending on them.

5
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.670
How much time are you spending.

6
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:29.910
What type of items do you have that might need to be replaced each time you want to think organisationally

7
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.640
that's going to help you in the long run.

8
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.810
That's going to help you prevent this from turning into a hairball that's going to make it much easier

9
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.930
for you to handle if you have more organization you're going to be happier.

10
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:48.660
But don't act like that because people who look on Airbnb are looking for more of a home you feel they're

11
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.640
looking for uniqueness.

12
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.850
They want to share experiences and it's more about connecting with locals connecting with the actual

13
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.210
city they go to.

14
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:05.280
And last about having this sterile cotton Rawhi very easy to understand efficient service that gets

15
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.690
them in and out.

16
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.690
How do you reconcile the two.

17
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.430
You know when I communicate with agast and this is kind of where I differentiate this obviously my place

18
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.030
doesn't look like a hotel even though I give them hotel like amenities when I communicate with them.

19
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.490
I make sure that I don't ever speak like that hotel earlier in the course we talked about don't be.

20
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.770
Matter of fact that never particularly works.

21
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.720
So whenever I message them if I need to give them instructions I always make sure that it comes across

22
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:42.600
not as you need to do this and it comes across has you know this is generally what I like or this is

23
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.450
how this works and here's why.

24
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.010
What I'm doing is establishing more of a friendly tone more of you are staying at my space at the same

25
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.990
time getting the same information across.

26
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:58.580
So as opposed to saying check out at 11 a.m. sharp I say typically we will check out at 11 o'clock because

27
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.900
the cleaner needs to get in at 11:00.

28
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.750
Guests typically need to get in or around to and then I say after that is there are gas coming the next

29
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.650
day then you're more than welcome to stay later.

30
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.250
That doesn't sound like a hotel that sounds like a human being who's being flexible.

31
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:20.040
Is not saying that this is absolutely the way it is in your house rules you don't need to make it sound

32
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.610
like boot camp.

33
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.610
You don't need to say absolutely this absolutely that and you know put them in numbered lists and things

34
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.560
like that you can just list them out and bullet points you need to be more casual because you want a

35
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:39.410
more casual atmosphere that's going to translate into better views better guests a lot of times you'll

36
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.420
find people who are very hot and dry and they just don't have the same kind of candor and their views

37
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.060
you find that people are view them but they end up treating you like a hotel.

38
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.860
The biggest downside of gas treating you like a hotel is they start demanding a lot more.

39
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.640
But there are also a lot less forgiving.

40
00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.910
They're going to give you a bad review because they think that they stayed at a hotel.

41
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.990
They want to sum it up try to be as efficient as you can but also make sure that you're adding a personal

42
00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.890
human touch.

43
00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.480
Any time you interact with your guests.
