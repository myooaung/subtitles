1
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:08,340
Here's another bonus tip this is cater towards differentiating yourself from the pack.

2
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:15,900
But it also you know it could fit this into the how the guest experience this was huge for my apartment.

3
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:22,250
It's parking Why is parking so important in San Francisco.

4
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:28,440
There's not a lot of parking but there are plenty of people trying to drive their car into the city.

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,360
That's largely the case in a lot of other places.

6
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,840
Any big city is going to have parking problems.

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,040
People really don't want to have to deal with the option of not being able to park.

8
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,870
And a lot of times they want to come visit your city but they do and are in a car.

9
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,880
But the idea of parking bothers them so much that they don't.

10
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,500
And that actually hurts their experience.

11
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:52,920
What I did was I went and found parking my apartment doesn't have parking we have street parking but

12
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,280
it's a two hour parking and they will tow you if you stay for two hours.

13
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,840
What I did is I went and just looked at Monkley parking spots.

14
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:04,500
If a monthly parking spot cost me $150 a month how many guests do I need to book to break even on that

15
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:11,300
for me that was half a guest ought to do is give me a half agast booking with me to break even where

16
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:15,700
one guest in my living room and all of a sudden now is a good investment.

17
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:21,330
When I first originally listed my apartment I did not parking and I noticed this and this is something

18
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:26,520
that you might have noticed when back when we were doing the looking for gaps and looking for things

19
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:32,630
that people can't offer in your area meetings were things I noticed was no one could offer parking and

20
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:35,810
because no one is offering parking no one even thought to offer parking.

21
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,600
Parking was huge.

22
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:43,850
Once I added parking I got double the booking inquiries that I had before and the way I noticed this

23
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:46,760
was people were asking me hey I'm interested in your space.

24
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,690
Do you have parking and it's say no parking obviously.

25
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:54,110
I'd say a lot more than that and make it a little more gracious but didn't they respond or they'd really

26
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:57,310
be on the fence and was really having trouble booking because people really wanted parking.

27
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:01,330
What they ended up doing is getting a place out in the suburbs that they could park at.

28
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,700
Consider this strategy does this work for you.

29
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,840
Do you not have parking.

30
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:06,230
Can you add parking.

31
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,840
No I can't add parking of course you can add parking.

32
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,570
You can find someone who has a parking spot they don't use.

33
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:15,090
You can find a parking garage that offers parking you find a lot that offers parking.

34
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:19,310
Doesn't really matter doesn't matter if it's that close to your apartment doesn't need to be a block

35
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,350
from your space.

36
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,140
Mine's four blocks away four blocks and sound like a lot in San Francisco.

37
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:29,780
It's almost like a ten minute walk but that's enough I mean it technically counts as parking.

38
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:34,940
And once they see that you have parking they're not going be considering how far away it is because

39
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:40,400
it's included and you can put in your listing saying this is the cost of what it would cost to park

40
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,730
otherwise in a cheaper city maybe it's only 10 bucks or something.

41
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:48,730
Here I was like $40 $30 so this is how much I'm saving you for free.

42
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:53,210
If you come and stay with us and it's something that no one else has really capitalized on literally

43
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:57,970
in my listing it put at the very end of it in the header title of the listing parking.

44
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:01,590
Capital P A R K I N G.

45
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,770
Something really does bring in interest.

46
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:08,750
It's one of those hacks that I've found that really really made it a big big difference.

47
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,210
Look into it if you offer parking and that's something the other people aren't offering.

48
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:18,000
Then you make sure that you really make a focal point out of this that you don't have parking.

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,240
No one else is doing parking see if he can go get to space.

50
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,790
It might be worth it.

51
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,560
Probably will be worth it.

52
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,890
Try it for a month if it doesn't work and no one uses it.

53
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,790
Throw it away it doesn't really matter.

54
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,750
It's another service you can add.

55
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:35,140
You can offer to tear gas and like anything else it has a return on investment.

56
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:39,800
A way that you can tell whether or not it's worth it to the $100 for a parking spot and you charge $100

57
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,360
a night.

58
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:44,940
One person uses that hundred dollars you can probably conclude that without the parking.

59
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,580
There's a good chance they didn't book with you and you didn't get that hundred dollars.

60
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:53,570
Think of a lot of strategies that can differentiate you from other people but parking was a big one

61
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,760
so please consider it.
