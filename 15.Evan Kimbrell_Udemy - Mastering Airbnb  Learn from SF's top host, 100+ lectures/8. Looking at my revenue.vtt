00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:07.470
Hey guys I just wanted to pop in and give you guys an update on everything that I'm doing.

2
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.930
Everybody who's in the course you have been following along with my new adventures with Airbnb but everybody

3
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.080
else I wanted to give you a little bit of a preview of what I'm doing as well.

4
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.590
So a little bit different in my life.

5
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.230
I'm actually planning a trip coming up and so I decided to put my place up on Airbnb.

6
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.340
It's been an extended trip.

7
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.880
I decided to do it for a starting April 1st and do it for three months.

8
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.520
I'm actually going to be going to Thailand.

9
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.840
So if anybody's in the area and wants to meet up let me know.

10
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:42.520
But so I decided to do a trip and do this quite often because Aramean B allows me to do that.

11
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.860
And I just wanted to show you guys what's been happening over the last five days.

12
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.150
It's been a huge kind of shock to me.

13
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:57.000
I've always had a popular profile enlisting them but this has been pretty much blown me away.

14
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.230
So in five days I have made in bookings nineteen thousand six hundred and forty dollars that is over

15
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:11.710
18 bookings and I've gotten 800 page views so it's pretty insane.

16
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.290
I have just been under an avalanche of inquiries and I will show you what my dashboard looks like.

17
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.260
So as you can see here I still have some bookings that are on the ropes right here.

18
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:33.540
So put it up on the third one from 179 views and it's getting 143 133 93 and then just today something

19
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:41.430
like 248 as you can see here is literally I booked five out of my 10 inquiries book Nine out of my four

20
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:49.030
book 11 and my three eccentrics that are really making bookings because I opened up three months.

21
00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.000
Now keep in mind guys I don't have the entire calendar open like most airplane because I only have a

22
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.220
three month period and it's short notice.

23
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.820
And this is how many inquiries and reservations I'm getting.

24
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.740
What I love about this is since I book Nineteen thousand dollars for every single one of my page views

25
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.250
it ends up being like $20 or $22 a page view.

26
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.670
So every time someone hits my page making theoretically $22.

27
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.940
So and also it's interesting right here is that as this has progressed my calendar started to fill up.

28
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.710
So I'm still getting so many page views but actually my calendar has been showing fewer and fewer dates

29
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.470
should actually this explains why it went down and that today had a big burst.

30
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.260
One of the things I'm really proud about right now is I can show you this.

31
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:41.010
So just pick a day in San Francisco that my property is available and I know if top of my head that

32
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.610
it's available for June 1st to the 3rd there's not a lot of dates available right now.

33
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:53.790
I can pick three guests and and right there I am number one in San Francisco.

34
00:02:54.210 --> 00:03:01.620
So my listing that's out of 5000 listings airplane started in San Francisco it's headquartered in San

35
00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.480
Francisco.

36
00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.810
This is like their flagship city.

37
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.960
Host here I've been hosting for five six years even and I'm number one as long as you look for three

38
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:13.830
guests.

39
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.390
That is awesome.

40
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.300
And I honestly I just got to this point by using the techniques in this course I use a lot of the advanced

41
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.700
techniques that I've been posting in the last month like turbocharging you're listing and like for instance

42
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:33.210
hyper charging your reviews and ways that you can jump up in your search rankings really quickly especially

43
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.850
when you know there's a big block that's coming up.

44
00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:42.000
I have all these sorts of techniques for getting rid of book ins and maximizing how many reservations

45
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.310
you can get within smaller spaces.

46
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.160
All that stuff that's on the course.

47
00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.820
Obviously you you want to see how I've done this check it out.

48
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:58.150
We can take a look at my calendar.

49
00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.830
So I started it on April 2nd.

50
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:02.570
And here we go.

51
00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:10.270
This is in five days and then may again five days of posting this with a limited calendar.

52
00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.540
This is what it looks like.

53
00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.360
So pretty incredible.

54
00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.750
I would imagine in the next two weeks I fill up the vast majority of this.

55
00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:25.520
And so then I'll post another update when it's some other astronomical number I'm assuming it's going

56
00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.650
to start to slow down because there's not as many large blocks where people are searching for him but

57
00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.150
so far guys it has been a rush.

58
00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.720
Really enjoying it guys I'm loving the discussions that we're having in the group.

59
00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.610
If you are thinking about posting your listing get up there and post it.

60
00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:48.890
It doesn't matter if you necessarily have a fantastic property or a fantastic space.

61
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.020
We address all of this in the course.

62
00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:57.200
So honestly if you just if you just focus on some basic tenants and you use some of the advanced skills

63
00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:02.750
that we go over throughout this entire course there's no reason you cannot maximize your space.

64
00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:08.110
You'd be really really surprised at how much money you can make with your space.

65
00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:13.550
You just have to get out there list your space and start using the techniques in this course and it'll

66
00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.730
start to snowball and you'll get up there pretty quickly guys so I will see you guys in the next lecture.
