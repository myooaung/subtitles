1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,960
Tip number one for creating the best guests experience I call it the guidebook.

2
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,900
Now this is something you'll notice in a lot of hosts do and most the hosts that do this are more experienced

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,840
probably make a lot more money than you.

4
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:24,870
The guidebook is something you probably heard about sometimes you know hosts give preference the guidebook

5
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:31,410
or maybe you see a picture of a guidebook in a listing what it is is a lot of hosts will go and create

6
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:38,130
a booklet or maybe it's just a piece of paper or laminated sheet that gives off all the information

7
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:45,090
about the apartment that the person who is staying needs to know and also includes information about

8
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:50,730
what to do in the area how to get around how to get to points of interest how to find basic necessities

9
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,220
or what to do in an emergency how to contact the host.

10
00:00:54,330 --> 00:01:00,180
Anything you could possibly think of when you first start listing out your property you might not have

11
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,460
enough information for this.

12
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,450
You might not know everything that the guests want and you might kind of just have a script in your

13
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,380
head that you verbally go over with each guest.

14
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:13,860
You want to get to the point where you don't have to do this every single time and you want to standardize

15
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,580
the quality that each guess gets.

16
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:22,350
Think about creating a guidebook I'm going to include as an attachment to this some text where I listed

17
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:28,860
off some places where you can very cheaply and very quickly create very professional looking guidebooks.

18
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:36,110
You can get this done for $20 interrupta up you know $100 if you want a professionally bound book.

19
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:41,100
There are mobile apps that you can download and you can actually make these on your iPhone.

20
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,590
You just pick a background image and then you pick text.

21
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:49,140
So the background image is the actual image of where you think the person is going or maybe it's a picture

22
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,910
of your apartment or maybe it's just happy clouds it doesn't really matter and you just throw some text

23
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:54,860
on it.

24
00:01:54,870 --> 00:02:01,050
In my experience this works extremely well and what I have done is I've used my guidebook to not only

25
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:05,230
crowdsource recommendations but crowdsourced reviews from each of the guests.

26
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,030
I made it kind of like a guest book too.

27
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,970
So at the very end they can write nice things about their stay.

28
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,780
Thank us for allowing them to stay in their apartment.

29
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:18,350
Thanks for the recommendations and also allow the guest to say this restaurant was great.

30
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,440
This event was great.

31
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,180
Really you should go and do it.

32
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:26,520
Anybody who's staying in your apartment at least who's coming as a tourist is probably wondering in

33
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,010
their heads what's worth doing and what's not.

34
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:30,780
Everybody's taste is different.

35
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:35,670
But it does really help when they can see reviews from guests who have come in the past who can say

36
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,010
this is great.

37
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,200
It is in San Francisco.

38
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,780
Go see Alcatraz.

39
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,090
That's really cool.

40
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,660
And certainly people will put things like.

41
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:47,100
Alcatraz is not worth seeing and that's something that might help someone who's on the fence who wasn't

42
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,500
sure if they wanted to do it because it is quite kind of expensive to do.

43
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:57,290
Think of this as something that it's your comprehensive guide to everything about the experience.

44
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,360
It's nice to spend a lot of time on it.

45
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:04,950
But as you can see in kind of the resource guy that I've attached you can actually do these quite effortlessly.

46
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:11,080
You can really create these on the fly and they look really good and ship them directly to you.

47
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,760
It's really easy to do.

48
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,180
And I think once you actually have a guidebook and then in the guidebook you can put things like the

49
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,150
rules of the house how to get around how to operate things.

50
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:26,730
It's really a godsend because you don't have to explain to the ghast every single time they forget how

51
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:33,420
to do something or if you forget to explain to them how to turn on the heater What's the why fi password

52
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:38,430
or any of those tiny little minutia that's associated with hosting.

53
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:43,770
They have this guidebook and as all of it end there it's going to significantly reduce the amount of

54
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:47,010
conflicts you have or issues you have with guests.

55
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:52,110
And also it's going to package together everything that you could possibly say for them to do and there's

56
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:57,140
really no excuse for them to saying like the host didn't help out because they have it right there.

57
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:02,280
Don't use this as a way to avoid interaction with the guests because the more interaction you have your

58
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,850
guests the more likely they're going to give you a positive review.

59
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,650
I think that guidebook is kind of the cherry on top.

60
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,660
It make sure that you get the same information to everyone and they don't have to call you at 3:00 in

61
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,850
the morning if they need something.
