00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.250
So what is air being be for those of you who are not familiar.

2
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:14.380
I'm going to give you a really quick three minute crash course on how it works what it is.

3
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.360
I'm sure you've heard of it at least especially if you're taking this course.

4
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.530
Maybe you're familiar with someone who has hosted most likely or familiar someone who stayed on air

5
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:30.380
B and B but it's a service that allows ordinary people like yourself to rent out their homes spare rooms

6
00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.560
even their couches to other people who traditionally use hotels.

7
00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.930
It works very much like a hotel.

8
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.900
People pay per night to stay in your space.

9
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.710
Now Airbnb handles the entire process for the people who want to host.

10
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.430
All you have to do is sign up on their website and list your space air B and B collects all the payments

11
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.310
they hold all the security deposits they advertise your listing for you.

12
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.390
You don't need to do any promotion outside of their platform.

13
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.340
They will bring you a steady stream of leads for people who want to stay in your apartment.

14
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:09.590
They handle all of the messaging and communication they have conflict resolution teams that are available

15
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:16.790
24/7 and they also offer an umbrella policy that covers up to a million dollars in damage or any type

16
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.850
of instant Dental in your space.

17
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:25.700
Now on top of that urban bee has a review system where guests and hosts review each other and that's

18
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.760
how you can tell whether or not the host the person listening space does a good job.

19
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.170
And that's also you can tell whether or not the guest is someone that is a good candidate to stay in

20
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.040
your space.

21
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.610
Airbnb the company that started in 2007 and it's been about seven years since they started.

22
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:49.070
Over the course of that period of time they've grown exponentially in popularity.

23
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:57.220
So it's 2014 and the last attested I had heard was that in 2012 they had already booked 10 million nights

24
00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.190
on their website.

25
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:08.080
Now I think they advertise that they have 800000 listings That's 33000 cities that's in 192 countries.

26
00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.610
And 2014 they said that an Airbnb gets booked literally every second.

27
00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:20.920
Airbnb also got a lot of press because they were well known for running out really quirky and cool spaces.

28
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.820
You probably seen this.

29
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:30.990
They have over 3000 listings that fit into the category of Cassell's TBS Eagle news treehouses avise

30
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.570
and private islands.

31
00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.280
How can the NBA change your life.

32
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.420
Well the statistics are very well established.

33
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.250
If you live in San Francisco for example the average renter.

34
00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.690
And this is across the entire board of people who rent couches spare rooms and apartments.

35
00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.820
They make $700 a month on average.

36
00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.740
Now that average includes people who've posted their listing and never hosted a single person which

37
00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.830
is a large portion of people.

38
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.780
So the people that actively work on Airbnb and rent out their space they probably make on average probably

39
00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.420
around double that.

40
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.370
And then people who put a lot of effort into their platform end up making a lot of money.

41
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:18.340
Like I said in the promotion video I made last year about $60000 and that was off of casual renting

42
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:27.320
that was off of Sirius renting had I rented it out every single day or did it more like a hotel service.

43
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:33.610
Easily could have made anywhere between a hundred and $200000 a year for an example in New York City.

44
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:39.640
There's actually a big group of people that are making over half a million dollars a year in renting

45
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.190
out their spaces.

46
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.470
Now that's not the exact idea behind the space that people are going to rent out multiple properties.

47
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.940
However a lot of people have used their platform to make a very thriving business.

48
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.730
Can anyone rent their space on air and be absolutely anyone can rent their space.

49
00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:04.060
If you have a couch if you even have a studio apartment and you have space next to it you can rent your

50
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.430
space out an A or B and B give a private room if you travel to go visit your family or you know go on

51
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:15.690
a business trip you can rent out your space Herbie and B has changed the way that millions of people

52
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:23.590
view their homes now all of a sudden you don't have to waste space and you don't have to waste their

53
00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.350
apartment or your home when you're on vacation.

54
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.370
You can turn that into serious money.

55
00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.770
I ran out my apartment when I leave for vacation for $400 a night.

56
00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.780
It's a three bedroom apartment.

57
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.250
People that have a one bedroom apartment they can rent out their space easily for $200 a night.

58
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:48.990
So if you want to learn about Airbnb and you want a comprehensive course on how you can really get the

59
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:55.650
most out of this platform and how you can get to the top 10 percent of earners on B and B take this

60
00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.510
course follow my advice participate as much as you can in the group discussion.

61
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.760
I want everyone to kind of pile in together we can make this the best experience possible.
