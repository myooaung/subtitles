1
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:10,170
Now if you've been spending a lot of time looking at other Airbnb properties and looking at their views

2
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:16,050
you might notice that there are some properties that have much better reviews and those reviews really

3
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:17,530
really go into depth.

4
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:24,360
Sometimes you have these reviews that are far you know 300 words describing every single aspect of it

5
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:29,170
and they are very very positive about the House and the space.

6
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:36,370
And then other places you look at they might be as positive but they're also shorter listings that have

7
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,590
really really positive reviews.

8
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:43,030
People are just gushing when they write them they're going to get a lot more people booking because

9
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:46,090
they look and they say wow this person is an amazing experience.

10
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:53,500
I want to replicate that if they look and I see only positive views but they're short removes that additional

11
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:59,260
kind of premium that people will associate with a property that has fantastic reviews that you might

12
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,360
be wondering to yourself.

13
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:02,840
How do people get those reviews.

14
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:09,070
How do you get these people that just go on and on and on about how great this space and hosts are.

15
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:13,110
I call this lecture mastering the warm and fuzzy.

16
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:16,350
This is something that I'm not the best at.

17
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:20,260
We have good reviews but they're not absolutely fantastic.

18
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:26,590
Some of the reviews if you look on the smaller individual spaces in my apartment those are much better.

19
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:31,300
Typically when I read out my full apartment I'm not going to have fantastic reviews because I checked

20
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,720
out I'm not there when I run out of space.

21
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:39,220
I have much better reviews because I actually spend time with the guests and you can see that I post

22
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,030
a link.

23
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:44,150
The reviews of what I have on my other spaces within my apartment.

24
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:48,190
How do you master the warm and fuzzy some Are you guys going to be much better than I am at this but

25
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,980
I can give you my two cents.

26
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:55,170
The way that you get better reviews is just going to be how do you communicate with your guests.

27
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,730
How thoughtful are you when you communicate with them constantly remind them that you're there to help

28
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:06,100
them that if they need anything don't hesitate to ask and then go a step farther.

29
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,350
Make sure that they can communicate with you.

30
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,020
Make sure they have your cell phone.

31
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,690
Send them a text saying just how are you enjoying everything.

32
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,140
Check in with them.

33
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:20,920
The more of those gift strategies like a bottle of wine the basket of goodies the chocolate things small

34
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:27,760
things like that those things really add up and people will start feeling more positive about you and

35
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,850
your space and they'll post in your reviews.

36
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:33,850
You see on some of my reviews a lot of people mention the wine bottle not something they really thought

37
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:34,870
was great.

38
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,890
I think I found a winner on that one.

39
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,370
Just be as nice as you can.

40
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:40,720
This isn't a hotel.

41
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,790
You know if someone says your question you can't accommodate them.

42
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,350
Don't just say no I can't do it.

43
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,200
Period.

44
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,180
Always try to cushion whatever you're saying something negative.

45
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:54,050
You can always say yes it's not this but unfortunately but here's something I can do that might meet

46
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,330
you halfway.

47
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:59,600
The more you go out of your way to do things for them the more likely they're going to mention those

48
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,300
things.

49
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,630
In general the more time you spend with your guest the more likely you're going to get these types of

50
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,680
reviews.

51
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,090
I know a lot of people.

52
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,740
Their most favorite thing about Aramean be they get to meet people they make friends and they really

53
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:17,660
do like to spend a lot of time with their guests and so their guests really do go out of their way to

54
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,780
reward them and they post these fantastic reviews.

55
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:25,960
I think it might be a problem if you later try to like press on the brake a little bit when you want

56
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:30,560
to pull back and not spend as much time with each cast but it's still an asset to you.

57
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,150
Every good review is something going forward that will make their may be better for you and you'll get

58
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:42,250
you more bookings and more inquiries and that's what we want you to get to how you get the best reviews.

59
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,700
It really just comes down to a thoughtfulness.

60
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:49,130
Sarah has very good positive reviews because she's very thoughtful about the guests.

61
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:54,650
The more you customize and the more you spend individual time with each guest the better your views

62
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:55,900
are going to get.

63
00:03:55,990 --> 00:04:01,810
Sarah had someone I think it was gluten free or she is vegetarian and she left out food for them when

64
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:04,740
they came in late because she knew that they were going to be hungry.

65
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,690
Really simple things like that.

66
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:12,290
I had a guest that really wanted to go to Alcatraz but they didn't have any time.

67
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:17,650
So what I ended up doing was purchasing it for them and they paid me back and I you know it was easier

68
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:21,640
for me because I was walking somewhere in San Francisco and I passed by one of the places where they

69
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,390
sell the tickets.

70
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:28,150
And so it was very easy for me to pick up anything like that that can really make you kind of an accessory

71
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,760
to them having a good experience.

72
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:36,250
Death really going to pay off really basic things like asking if they have any nutritional requirements.

73
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,850
That's something that really helps and then if you spend a little bit of money getting a couple of things

74
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:43,750
that they can you know for instance breakfast foods if you know someone is gluten free you might want

75
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,980
to grab a gluten free bowl of cereal.

76
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,620
Really small things like this.

77
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,980
There's one thing you want to come away with this.

78
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,020
Be thoughtful.

79
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,980
Be as warm as you can.

80
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:59,230
You should really be enjoying this process is something you might get better over time and you'll get

81
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:03,310
better reading gas and you'll get better at knowing what they need and what they want but eventually

82
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:08,650
you get to a point where I think you can really elicit the types of positive reviews that you see everywhere

83
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:09,610
else.

84
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:15,030
Don't take it personally if you don't get these long gushing reviews from people.

85
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,360
It's a skill.

86
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:20,290
It's something that you get more comfortable with and once you become a really good host that's when

87
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,460
these things start popping up.
