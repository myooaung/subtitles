1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:10,540
Here's an idea to differentiate yourself from your hosts and mentioned this before just a little bit.

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,050
There was a host that I had seen in San Francisco who was doing quite well.

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:18,590
She had one property and then she had two and she had three.

4
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:20,280
And I think she ended up with four.

5
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,640
So clearly she's making a considerable amount of money.

6
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:27,240
Not that she can even expand it into other spaces.

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,020
Whatever she's doing was working.

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:34,560
One of the things I had noticed from her property was that she took photos of gift baskets that she

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,840
makes for guests.

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,630
This is a very good idea.

11
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:44,510
When you think gift basket I'm not talking about a basket full of chocolate and expensive fruit.

12
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:50,700
I'm talking about flowers or edible arrangements necessarily what I'm talking about would be something

13
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:57,810
like a small basket full of very small things that you can purchase in bulk assemble and have available

14
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:59,940
every time a guest comes in.

15
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:05,280
Imagine if every single gas that came into your space you gave a gift basket to.

16
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:09,720
Chances are that person's going to mention that in the reviews and it's going to be very hard for that

17
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:16,200
person to give you a negative review or at least it's going to raise the bar in terms of how bad their

18
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,980
experience must be to get a negative review.

19
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:24,960
And this is something that I consider a kind of an experience smoother in the sense that a gift basket

20
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:29,100
for someone else moves out the experience that they have bumps in their stay.

21
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,780
Something went wrong something broke.

22
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:31,920
I don't know.

23
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:37,150
And those things happen it has the effect of smoothing out those bumps.

24
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:41,270
They're less likely to notice them because in the grand scheme of things are going to say well at least

25
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,700
I got this free gift specifically gift baskets.

26
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,220
Here's an easy way of putting this together doesn't seem need to be a guest basket to give me a tray

27
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:54,060
it could just be something you could wrap up in thin wrapping paper because it looks like a gift.

28
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,490
Everyone loves a gift.

29
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:01,000
Can you imagine going to a hotel and they have a personalized gift for you.

30
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,610
You don't always want to go to that hotel.

31
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,630
I mean you think I can't do that I rent my space for $75.

32
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:10,900
I guarantee you you can make a gift basket for $5.

33
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,950
It's very very simple.

34
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,390
Here's one thing you could do.

35
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:17,860
Put a welcome to my space card.

36
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,990
How do you make a card.

37
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,170
How is that cost effective.

38
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:26,300
Well you can go to Vistaprint or any of those big print companies and they can literally print free

39
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,970
business cards for you and you can even design it in their app.

40
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,720
You could spend 15 minutes designing this card.

41
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,980
Do it in a little funky cursive font.

42
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,370
And they're free.

43
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,470
You just pay for the shipping.

44
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:42,350
You can get several hundred for maybe $10 is going to take a very long time for you to get through 100

45
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:43,340
guests.

46
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:47,840
Other things you know I live in San Francisco and I live near cheere a deli Square.

47
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,770
They have chocolates that are famous for so I like to include some chocolates in and maybe that's a

48
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:54,760
dollar per each because I bought them in bulk.

49
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,120
Small Things.

50
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,230
Eminem's those are 99 cents.

51
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:02,420
You can put a small packet one of those Halloween sized ones in it for you know 20 cents.

52
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,060
Literally anything you can put in it.

53
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,440
Earlier I brought up a tip of making a guidebook.

54
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:13,490
This is a great place you can put the guidebook in it or on top of it if you give them a tray and you

55
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:17,420
put on top of the tray the items that you want to give them you can put the guestbook inside of that

56
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:24,250
the guidebook or guest book and you can buy postcards as postcards if they're a picture of your city.

57
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:27,980
Think about the reason why they're coming up they're typically tourists you can work with that and put

58
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,360
it inside of it.

59
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,570
There's a lot of things like even tiny little figurines or something like that.

60
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:39,370
Remarkably cheap $5 even if they run it for 75 bucks or in our case 200 to 300.

61
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,180
What's five dollars.

62
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:47,480
It's something that would automatically put the beginning of their experience off on a good footing.

63
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:54,170
If you guys have any tips for this what you've put in your gift basket and I'm going to include a photograph

64
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:58,660
of one of these gift baskets if I can find the house that I was referencing earlier.

65
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,720
If any of you guys have tips for things that are cheap and easy to put in there you guys are going to

66
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,730
go crazy with it.

67
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,990
It could just be a couple of things that are really nice.

68
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,310
Everybody loves chocolate.

69
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,090
That's a great one.

70
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:10,060
Popcorn or popcorn.

71
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,680
Now everybody loves a welcome card or just a little piece of paper that gives your contact information

72
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,240
again.

73
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,380
They feel like they're being taken care of.

74
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,070
The more valuable the more likely you're going to get a good review.

75
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,650
But obviously keep in mind that you're running it out for a certain price and so you don't want to spend

76
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:25,730
too much on it.

77
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:30,630
If you do it I guarantee you're going to have 90 percent five stars.

78
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,960
Positive ratings.

79
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,700
You know maybe spend 30 minutes thinking about it 30 minutes putting together ordering the supplies

80
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:42,590
and then it adds an additional minute to your prep before each guest but it will make a huge difference

81
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:46,960
in terms of the guest experience that's going to translate into better reviews.

82
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:50,440
That's going to translate into more bookings and a happier experience for you.

83
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:52,550
Happier guests well make you happier.
