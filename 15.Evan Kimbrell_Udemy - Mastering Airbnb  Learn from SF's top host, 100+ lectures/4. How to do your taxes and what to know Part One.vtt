00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.790
All right guys so I'm here with Derek Davis he's with shared economy CPA.

2
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.680
He's made a bit of a little thing for himself working with people that do share economy stuff like Uber

3
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:43.940
and Airbnb.

4
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.930
He's got the lowdown on what you should know about your taxes what you're doing wrong with that what

5
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.240
you're doing right.

6
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.740
He can walk you through kind of the details because it's pretty confusing so.

7
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.370
Hey Derek thanks for doing this.

8
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.680
And thanks for having me on.

9
00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.470
So tell me just a little bit about how you got into doing shared economy stuff.

10
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:10.250
Yes so I would say about May of 2014 no uber driver and I realize that you kind of have no idea what

11
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:16.790
to do about his tax situation and it was really really startling and also depressing that there's so

12
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:23.070
many kind of great tax saving opportunities that he could take with he was simply missing you know.

13
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:30.330
So yeah I quit my job in corporate America in September of 2014 and kind of never looked back from it.

14
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.310
Cool so how often do you work with Airbnb host.

15
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.580
I would actually see the bulk of our clientele.

16
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:43.010
I would say 85 percent or even the host primarily because everybody is pretty confusing.

17
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:48.680
We have a lot of clients and have listings in multiple states so the multiple state filings they have

18
00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.170
you know they'll have a rumor to write it out with an entire home.

19
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.020
So you have some tricky application methods.

20
00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.030
A lot of our clients also appreciate their home too.

21
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.590
So that is kind of a lot of tocks technical content that goes in to filing your tax journals and everybody

22
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:08.430
knows.

23
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.060
Gotcha.

24
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.700
Yeah I know that it's complicated from my experience.

25
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:19.300
I could guarantee that I did my taxes wrong and my airplane last year so I'll pay attention to details.

26
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.930
So I'm not someone to pull up to Eric's PowerPoint.

27
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:29.480
He's just going to talk through it at the very end then I'll just ask questions and we'll do it like

28
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.900
that.

29
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.810
So I work for you.

30
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.150
Yeah sounds good.

31
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.510
OK.

32
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:33.200
Awesome.

33
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:43.110
So all right guys so this is the start of his PowerPoint Here's his name what's your Web site.

34
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:50.720
So I have two companies one is a shared economy CPA dot com and the other one is try tabby dot com tries

35
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:56.540
to use a mole that will keep track of all your tax deductions for you so you don't ever have to worry

36
00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.630
about taxes and missing out on money saving opportunities.

37
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:02.460
Cool.

38
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.990
All right.

39
00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.390
So I'll start right here and then just let me know when you want to go next slide.

40
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:07.320
OK.

41
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:14.660
So yeah so just to briefly cover 299 is a tax payment between two third parties.

42
00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:22.950
So this is the tax form that you are getting from B and B what really does is they send a one time line

43
00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.090
to you as well as 1099 to the IRS.

44
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:34.730
So it's really important that that whatever you're reporting on your tax forms will line up directly

45
00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.310
with what's reporting what's being reported on there.

46
00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.910
And then you die.

47
00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:48.530
So quick little snippet to know is what's shown in your dashboard is that of these fees.

48
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.450
And what is shown on your 10:49 is the total amount.

49
00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.670
So you also want to deduct that commission amount that everybody is taking.

50
00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.950
So on the next slide.

51
00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.150
So yes this is just kind of a review of the tax form.

52
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.920
You know it clearly shows who you are who paid you.

53
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:17.670
So for example is this the end or B and B and then also now those paid in like I said in the previous

54
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:23.480
slides really make sure that both those numbers line up are likely because the IRS will do it so quickly

55
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.150
we can tie that to the two figures.

56
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.990
And if they don't match you will be you'll be receiving the letter.

57
00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.900
OK so is on the next slide.

58
00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.300
Is that the biggest audit trigger you've seen as if the 10:19 just doesn't match the number you claim

59
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.460
on your own taxes.

60
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:40.100
Yeah.

61
00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.240
It's almost an automated chalk figure.

62
00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:49.960
So it's usually it's you know if it's if it's showing less than what's on the menu.

63
00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:56.500
Generally speaking if you're reporting a lot more than that was reported on the then obviously you're

64
00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.080
reporting more incomes of that that's good for errors.

65
00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.000
And so the tonight 9:00 does that that gets automatically filed with the IRS.

66
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.790
Right you're just getting a copy from Eric BND correct.

67
00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:08.360
Copies.

68
00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.730
Yeah.

69
00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.550
From everybody's perspective two copies of it's M-L OK.

70
00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:19.000
Gotcha.

71
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.900
So this is kind of one of the biggest hurdles that we work with for every client.

72
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:32.440
And in this kind of determines what is material participation and whether or not are poor on Schedule

73
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:43.050
C or scheduled the Schedule C is an active income and that means like it's like if you're in if you're

74
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:48.590
right writer you'd want to put all your income on a schedule C schedule either for passive income you

75
00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:49.050
know.

76
00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:54.900
Historically speaking when you see you go Anscar on schedule eases rental income.

77
00:05:54.910 --> 00:06:01.910
If you own your home and your you have a full time rental client you don't put it on there.

78
00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:11.200
And if you have you know passive income so stocks bonds things that you don't you know you don't actively

79
00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.210
engage in but you're saving money from

80
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:22.780
oh so what does how does that actually work with like Air B and B management companies like pelo which

81
00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:27.940
used to be air and B if you use one of those services and they handle all of your management and bookings

82
00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:28.970
and everything like that.

83
00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:33.060
Is that a good enough reason to claim that it's passive.

84
00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:34.870
Yeah so.

85
00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:42.490
So you know really feel like I've got on situation but if you have a management company in all your

86
00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:48.460
area B and B say you are in Europe and you do have an area of your property in New York and you have

87
00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:54.100
someone willing to do it for you and all you do is receive the paycheck that would generally be considered

88
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:55.470
positive.

89
00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:56.750
OK.

90
00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.540
Which is scheduled to be done.

91
00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:04.960
If that's the case you're European and you have an American property you're going to end up paying taxes

92
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:09.670
to the American government on those on the income of that property right.

93
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:13.260
Yeah it also really depends on the jurisdiction you're in.

94
00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:20.900
Everything we know for Cisco for example is starting to collect occupancy tax but that's about as of

95
00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:21.970
today's date.

96
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:26.050
And you know this may or may not be relevant a year from now.

97
00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:28.670
You know the tax code is always cheering me on.

98
00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.600
And they're they're they're constantly kind of do.

99
00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:37.580
So as of today you know some additional taxes being paid or don't.

100
00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:44.840
And so I have one actually question that I know is relevant to a lot of people that my course is that.

101
00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:50.140
So what happens if you're American you have a property and you're traveling abroad renting it out because

102
00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:51.640
I do that frequently.

103
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:56.750
But the reason why I love doing that is because of the tax exempt 90 K on your income.

104
00:07:56.890 --> 00:08:02.170
If you are brought over I think it's like nine months you get to write off a certain amount off your

105
00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:03.630
income.

106
00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:09.130
How does that play with your Airbnb property yeah that's really good question.

107
00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:14.890
And you know I don't really know off the top of my head I would have to look into that.

108
00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:24.500
I do know that with the words of foreign tax credit I believe it's it's it's the exemption is with regards

109
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:30.510
to income that is sourced outside the U.S. But you're telling me activity source within you.

110
00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:37.010
So I would I would think that you would still do that that the the exemption wouldn't apply because

111
00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:38.900
your source in income within the U.S..

112
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:41.610
But like I said before I would have to double check.

113
00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:43.050
I don't know for certain.

114
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:44.630
OK cool.

115
00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:45.320
Next time

116
00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:55.960
so kind of the biggest kind of overview is with an SEC schedule see you you're paying self-employment

117
00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:02.310
tax and schedule e you're not in kind of the real one thing that we look for to determine whether it's

118
00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:07.680
a Schedule C or scheduled activity is whether you provide substandard services or not.

119
00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:15.560
So you know do you clean the guest room every night or every morning after after they've slept in it.

120
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:17.500
You know do you provide food.

121
00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:23.510
You provide no additional services beyond just renting out your room.

122
00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.170
And if you do.

123
00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:29.770
Generally speaking you may be considered Schedule C actually.

124
00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:37.390
But like I said before you know taxes are very fact specific industry so.

125
00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:42.790
So there's virtually no blanket answer I can I can give for this.

126
00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:45.500
So this is kind of just a hypothetical example.

127
00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:55.310
If you are on schedule C for your B and B income and you'll see that you go approximately and this is

128
00:09:55.310 --> 00:10:02.140
assuming that you made 35000 young income and you are a single filer and this is for f y.

129
00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:05.490
Fiscal year 2014.

130
00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:14.330
So you know approximately five thousand self-employment tax as was another 3000 in personal income tax

131
00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:14.820
so.

132
00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:19.730
So the total taxes that you're paying is a little south of $8000.

133
00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:25.910
And this is assuming that you know business expenses are going on on the next slide.

134
00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:36.960
It's really really important for all airbed in the homes to keep really clear cut and thorough of business

135
00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:45.330
expenses because as you can see in the two scenarios scenario one you know you're not paying you know

136
00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:48.300
keeping track of business expenses is new to you.

137
00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.300
Arguably charged business expenses.

138
00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:57.720
So you know it's really important to keep track of business expenses because it will greatly reduce

139
00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.630
the amount of taxes that you go.

140
00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:07.080
So I was going to say in your experience is this scenario to a is that realistic that you would have

141
00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:11.160
two thirds of your income claimable as expenses.

142
00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.820
You know it really really depends on the timing of the business.

143
00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:20.670
You know if you're just starting out a business this could be this could be somewhat true because you're

144
00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:26.670
carrying a lot of expenses that you wouldn't normally include as it's your first year of business.

145
00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:36.990
But maybe if you're more mature and you're just collecting more revenue then yes this may not be as

146
00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:44.640
common per say but it well depends on on the type of business you're engaging in as well as the lifecycle

147
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:46.520
of the company.

148
00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:47.100
Yeah.

149
00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:52.170
So one of the things I've noticed with everybody is that the different scene in our being in a vacation

150
00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:53.250
rental property.

151
00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:58.470
Is that a vacation rental property everything you're buying for it is specifically for the apartments.

152
00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:03.990
Or when you put up a RBO typically people then go out and spend thousands of dollars on furniture or

153
00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:08.240
is Airbnb here using assets that you already had for personal uses.

154
00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:09.800
So how do you.

155
00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:15.450
Is it hard for you to distinguish the line between hey did you buy your couch or the couch cover for

156
00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:20.590
Air B and B or did you buy that for yourself and then you discovered Airbnb.

157
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:22.080
Yeah.

158
00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:27.990
Yeah that's a good question and I think kind of the best analogy to draw to that is that you know I

159
00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:32.560
think one of the most overlooked tax deductions for an area in the host is their cell phone bill.

160
00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:38.070
So say for example you're always talking to potential hosts you're you know you always get pinged when

161
00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:46.170
and when they want to register or you know say so you know say for example 40 percent of your cell phone

162
00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:54.570
bill is used for talking to one potential guest or your converse or conversely said you're you're using

163
00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:57.640
your phone 40 percent of the time to talk to potential guests.

164
00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:04.920
So you know you wanted to talk 40 percent of your of your monthly or annual bill.

165
00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:08.970
How specific do you have to get when it comes to recording stuff like that because I know that I would

166
00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:14.990
be a total pain if you had to record every single phone call that was being be related and how every

167
00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:17.030
single one those text message related.

168
00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:20.190
I mean how specific is the IRS when they audit you.

169
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:24.880
You know it definitely depends on the age and it's an agent Agent basis.

170
00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:31.420
And you know the better documentation you can show in the clear documentation you can show.

171
00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:37.200
And this is personally speaking I think the quicker they'll they'll come to a conclusion.

172
00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:42.460
But you know if you have a bunch of expenses and you can you know support.

173
00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:45.840
It's really not going to help your case.

174
00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:50.030
So is going on the next slide.

175
00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:54.990
So examples of business expenses you have food for for you guys.

176
00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:02.680
You know you have yourself on your computer if you drive to the store you know to buy goods or you know

177
00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:06.100
bedding or any sort of shoots for your TV host.

178
00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:09.130
You know you can you can deduct the mileage.

179
00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:15.550
Generally speaking for everything because the standard mileage might be more beneficial but if you have

180
00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:21.120
really clear records the actual cost indefinite copyright awful law.

181
00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:28.190
You know it's important to note that the home office deduction as well as if you're deducting your rent

182
00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:36.100
or your mortgage it's important to note that according to a 2006 tax court really that you're entering

183
00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:39.350
the room has to be exclusively used for business.

184
00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:47.000
So what I mean by that is that if you have a three bedroom apartment that you run out one of the bedrooms

185
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.970
exclusively that can be considered deductible.

186
00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:58.970
However if you have a room or your room that you will run out on occasion when you go out of town that

187
00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:03.930
that cannot be considered deductible because it's not exclusively listed.

188
00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:06.420
It's just one thing to know.

189
00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:12.810
And then other costs related to your everyday property you want into.

190
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.880
Yes sir can you give us an example of one like the most commonly overlooked deduction and into what's

191
00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:20.560
an inappropriate deduction.

192
00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:25.710
So inappropriate deduction would be.

193
00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:32.340
I mean anything that doesn't really to be in the business so if you are going to Vegas and try to write

194
00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:39.840
off table services something are going to fly with the IRS because the that that in no way pertains

195
00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:47.580
to everybody but I think it commonly overlooked induction persons because when you were talking to potentially

196
00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:53.250
host over over drinks or dinner or you meet up with a friend who's thinking about to intervene and they

197
00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:56.070
wanted to pick your brain about it.

198
00:15:56.250 --> 00:16:01.620
And I think what I've realized is that a lot of the urban in the hosts that I met are really passionate

199
00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:08.010
about being they love to talk about their friends and you know they live want to kind of tell stories

200
00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:13.040
about how they are able to supplement their income and so you know when you have a business meeting

201
00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:17.490
and specifically for being be you know make sure to keep track of that.

202
00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:24.450
The only important thing to kind of keep in the back of your mind is deducted as a meal entertainment

203
00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:26.030
expense by our guests.

204
00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:32.370
You have to kind of clearly show what was expected business outcome of that.

205
00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:37.410
So for example if you're going to meet up with a friend and talk about Air B and B the potential business

206
00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:43.750
outcome will be that you're hoping to get them as a host and you don't have to keep minutes of that

207
00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:45.160
conversation do you.

208
00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:52.870
You don't have to keep minutes you have to use up to clearly say who was with you you know in that business

209
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:53.740
meeting.

210
00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:55.030
Is it like one of those cases.

211
00:16:55.030 --> 00:17:01.540
I know that when you want to deduct business meals it's like you can take a cab to the restaurant and

212
00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:03.830
because that's to the restaurant you can deduct that.

213
00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:08.920
But if you take a cab backwards to your place you would have returned home anyway so you can't deduct

214
00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:09.220
that.

215
00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:10.550
Is that the same kind of thing.

216
00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:16.740
That I really pretty about that in particular.

217
00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:22.600
So I certainly can't comment on that but I do know that you know you can't write off your mileage going

218
00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:24.780
to from your your work.

219
00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:34.330
So that may be kind of relevant but I always got a question which is why it is important to bring up

220
00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:37.010
is can I write off my trip to and from work.

221
00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:38.200
And the answer is no.

222
00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:45.040
Q So if I take out a guest I have a gas and I take them out for lunch or coffee or something like that.

223
00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:48.370
Is that deductible.

224
00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:54.360
Well the purpose of the lunch or coffee.

225
00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:59.510
I guess it just be part of like the hospitality service because therapy is all about being the best

226
00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:00.940
hosts you can possibly be.

227
00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:03.290
Yes.

228
00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:12.830
So if you are you know your host in conjunction with your baby listin and you know say for example your

229
00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:20.660
expected bad business outcome is that you want them to come stay more at your your place if they come

230
00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:23.890
back into town and that can be considered deductible.

231
00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:25.270
OK.

232
00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:32.240
How do you handle like deductions on say if you have a property that you rent or you have a mortgage.

233
00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:34.870
So say you rent it out for an entire month right.

234
00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:38.000
And you say this month I'm exclusively renting it out.

235
00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:45.530
What happens then when you go and deduct your rent or your mortgage can you only did Doc that the quantity

236
00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:49.730
or like your rent or your mortgage for the days that it's rented out within that month or can you actually

237
00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:52.170
deduct the entire month because you set it aside.

238
00:18:52.580 --> 00:19:00.900
So according to the IRS or excuse me according to a 2006 tax court ruling they hide a bed and breakfast.

239
00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:08.600
And what the host did was that they had this bedroom that I think 20 percent of the time it was rented

240
00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:09.140
out.

241
00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:16.460
And then the other 80 percent it wasn't and they disallowed all of the all the proportionate expense

242
00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:19.300
on that property.

243
00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:27.670
So for your example you're running you out one twelfth of the year in line with that tax court ruling

244
00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:30.720
they wouldn't allow you the dog and both of the.

245
00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:31.430
All right.
