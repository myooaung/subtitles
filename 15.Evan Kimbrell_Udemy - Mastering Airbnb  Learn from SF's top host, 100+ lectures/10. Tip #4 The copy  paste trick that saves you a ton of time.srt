1
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,790
Tip number two I call this the copy paste.

2
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:15,930
So I'm sure a lot of you are wondering how can I minimize how much time that I spend on each booking.

3
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:21,170
I think at the very beginning you probably shouldn't focus on how to maximize your effort when it comes

4
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:22,450
to the guest experience.

5
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:27,200
Eventually down the road you're going to get to the point where saving a little bit of time here and

6
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,400
there is really going to make a huge difference in your quality of life and how much you get out of

7
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:37,640
hosting on air B and B what you can do and this is something that a lot of experience has to realize

8
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:45,290
is when you're talking on Airbnb to guests they all start to ask the same questions.

9
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:51,200
In my experience it really kind of boils down to really only four or five things that I get responses

10
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:56,750
usually it's asking about parking asking whether or not they can fit an additional person asking about

11
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,710
dates asking about price.

12
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,780
That is 90 percent of the interactions that I get.

13
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:09,770
So what I ended up doing was I started making written responses that I could essentially copy and paste

14
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:15,170
back to the people that I'm responding to what I would do in the first Suttons is I would answer the

15
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:20,540
question very succinctly and then I would copy and paste it kind of a tag at the end of it and that

16
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:24,860
tag was in the paragraph and it all I would say is something along the lines of you guys have any other

17
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,300
questions let me know.

18
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:32,420
And then I would say I have plenty of recommendations or things that I think can really make your vacation

19
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:33,350
awesome.

20
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,660
I'd love to have you guys in the space something like that.

21
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:39,020
And that's going to increase your conversion rate on your.

22
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:42,060
And how many inquiries you get people are asking about your property.

23
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,610
The more enthusiastic you are the more helpful you are.

24
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,130
That always is going to make them more likely to book in and make them more interested in booking.

25
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,070
How much time does it actually save me.

26
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:57,170
Not a ton of time but if I had to write it out every single time maybe that's a little bit of a pain.

27
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:03,860
More importantly though what I started doing was writing very long question and answers for once someone

28
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:09,340
does book or say they're going to book because a lot of times they'll book and it'll send them information

29
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,050
house rules about the apartment.

30
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,150
Again they all ask the same questions.

31
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,650
I just want to confirm that this is your address.

32
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:21,380
Or how do I swap out the keys or when can I check in all this is included in the e-mail they get.

33
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:26,480
But I'd say probably 40 percent of people would ask again and a lot of times you get people who are

34
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,310
coming in and three months yet they want to know everything today and they kind of start freaking out

35
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,350
if they don't hear anything within a week.

36
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:39,950
I have several folders where I just have responses and I just copy and paste very long answers and every

37
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:44,300
single time I'd copy and paste an answer and someone asked a question that's not on there I add it to

38
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:48,400
the master list and then I copy and paste it every time that I have to respond.

39
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,310
It never comes off as robotic because they don't know.

40
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:55,550
It looks like you did actually write it that way doesn't you know unless you set at the top on copy

41
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,940
and pasting this.

42
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,640
So don't worry about it coming off as genuine.

43
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:03,950
I think if you explained it to anyone that you ever got found out they would just say yes that makes

44
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,910
sense considering how many people book your apartment and come in and come out.

45
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:11,270
Does it make sense to type it out every single time.

46
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:14,150
Also this is something that's going to lower a burnout factor.

47
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:18,590
You don't want to type out every single response unless you really do enjoy doing that.

48
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:24,110
Personally I don't like to respond to every single person because it does kind of get to a point where

49
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:27,560
it will be a little bit of a headache because a very large portion of the people that you're interacting

50
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,820
with are people who just simply didn't read the listing or simply don't you know they'll ask you what

51
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:35,640
the price is for your apartment when it's displayed very prominently on the page.

52
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,640
Do you have any questions about this is posted in the group discussion.
