00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:10,270
Here's a bonus strategy that I thought would be worth outlining and I touched on it a tad bit in the

2
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:13,510
last lecture talking about pricing strategies.

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:23,840
One way that you can almost guarantee yourself bookings is what I call the hotel strategy go and look

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,780
at the hotel space around you.

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,110
This is especially true in markets that don't have a lot of air be in BS.

6
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,170
You can do the same exact thing you did with Air B and B and you're scoping out the area.

7
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,710
You can do that with Priceline.com Orbitz or Expedia.

8
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,690
They'll do the map and they show a map of what it cost to say the hotel around you.

9
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:47,630
And then in general what the price range is don't look for hotels that have Olympic sized swimming pools

10
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,730
or offer large amenities sets.

11
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:55,650
Look for the standard what a holiday and goes for something in the middle like a Marriott or whatever.

12
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:58,710
You don't necessarily have to go up to a Motel 6.

13
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:01,790
It makes more sense to look for something that's mid range.

14
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,720
This almost works without fail.

15
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:09,020
If you have a one bedroom or even a two bedroom look at the hotel price.

16
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:14,930
Make the calculation in your head and then just offer roughly the same or more and then list your price

17
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:16,870
at the same or less.

18
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:21,710
Typically what happens is when people are coming in there's a large contingent of people and I got this

19
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:26,630
information base of speaking to a lot of my guests that look for hotels first and when they don't like

20
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,500
the prices look for Airbnb.

21
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:33,290
Or they at least do both searches before they book on air B and B.

22
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:38,210
So if they're coming in and they're looking for a hotel they'll see the hotel and say it's $100 a night

23
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:44,480
and then they look at your space and it's slightly better and it's $80 a night that's kind of an automatic

24
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,130
win unless they're fly by night.

25
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,320
Somebody just came in wanted just find a place to crash and leave because they are being is not typically

26
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,600
great for that.

27
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:56,980
We'll talk a little bit more about how you should probably use the instant book strategy in general

28
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:01,280
but the couples with this strategy that if you want to compare yourself to a hotel you probably want

29
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,690
to be doing instant book.

30
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,270
We'll talk about that book later if you don't know what that is.

31
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,050
Don't worry.

32
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:07,010
We're going to cover it.
