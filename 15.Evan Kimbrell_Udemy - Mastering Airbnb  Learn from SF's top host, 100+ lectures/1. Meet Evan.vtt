00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:06.130
Hey Guys welcome to the course.

2
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.650
I'm Evan bro.

3
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.150
I'm going to be their guide to this entire course.

4
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.080
I'm going to show you how you can take that space that you're in that apartment that you're not using

5
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.580
when you're gone that extra space on the side of your room and how to turn that into a lot of money

6
00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:21.830
as you might have read in the description.

7
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.150
I'm Evan Kimbra.

8
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.760
Let me tell you a little bit about my story with their baby.

9
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.580
So about two years ago I moved out to San Francisco and I don't know if you guys know this but San Francisco

10
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.710
is ridiculously expensive.

11
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:39.940
When I moved out two years ago it was about I want to say a one bedroom costs on average about twenty

12
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.090
eight hundred dollars.

13
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.950
And now that I'm recording this updated video the average now is $3200 for a.

14
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.980
That's the median for a one bedroom apartment in San Francisco.

15
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.780
So two years ago I moved out and I rented a place I rented it for about $3000 a month.

16
00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.340
And honestly I was totally freaked out.

17
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:07.070
Every month I spent $3000 and it had to be deducted out of my account on the Fourth and I didn't really

18
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.920
know how I was going to pay it every month.

19
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.140
I'm self-employed like a lot of you out there.

20
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:17.300
And so my fortune kind of goes up and down kind of depending on how the month is I have my own clientele

21
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:25.250
and so I really was not sure how I was going to be able to afford $36000 a year in rent only about a

22
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.050
month after I moved in I actually discovered what therapy and B was and I started hosting on air B and

23
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.380
B and honestly I've never looked back.

24
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.110
I've been in this apartment for about 22 months and I have not paid rent in 22 months.

25
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.120
I rent it out all the time and it covers my rent every single month and in most months I actually get

26
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.010
paid on top of that.

27
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:52.160
Last summer I actually took a three month trip to Indonesia and it paid for literally everything in

28
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.780
my trip.

29
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:53.420
Flights.

30
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.050
Lodgings.

31
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.510
Food.

32
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.010
And then I had money on top of that.

33
00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.680
Last July I rented it out for a little south of $11000 for the month.

34
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.100
Again my rents $3000.

35
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:11.090
I spent literally 20 plus months doing trial and error with every single thing I can think of with Airbnb

36
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:18.950
and I've packaged every single thing I've learned hacks tips tricks secrets techniques into this course

37
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.770
so that you can skip that trial and error process and go from having your space to renting it out for

38
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.600
a maximum amount of money.

39
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.410
Don't do it.

40
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.060
I don't just jump right into it with no experience no idea what you're doing.

41
00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.900
You take this course and you can learn literally everything about how I did it and what I did the work

42
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.290
that I did that didn't work.

43
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.180
What were the big game changers.

44
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.950
I provide primarily a tech background.

45
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.900
And so what I like to focus on are things that have really high RMI return on investment.

46
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.470
I focus on kind of the hack's the things that are really simple minimal effort that can give you a very

47
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.660
large return.

48
00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.610
I look for ways that are easy simple cheap repeatable so you can guarantee things like high reviews

49
00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.410
and guarantee that you maximize not only the money you get from this but the enjoyment you get from

50
00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:07.670
this.

51
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.220
And as you can see I'm actually filming this in my air being me right now if you just saw that there

52
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.810
was a cable car going past it.

53
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.940
I want this course to be as interactive as possible if you guys are looking at the course right now

54
00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:20.990
thinking about joining in.

55
00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.100
Please do join.

56
00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.170
And we have a very vibrant community of people participating with a lot of those saying what's worked

57
00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.680
for them what's not working for them.

58
00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.350
Well a lot of people posting their links and are analyzing them running a lot of fun and everybody's

59
00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.730
learning a ton actually right now as I'm speaking.

60
00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.180
My property is number one in San Francisco.

61
00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:48.020
If you search for properties over three plus guests that's insane Airbnb started in San Francisco and

62
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.020
they have over 5000 listings.

63
00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.640
So everybody's been the absolute game changer for me to change the way I do everything.

64
00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.940
It's giving me all this free time to focus on my businesses focus on anything else I want.

65
00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.710
And it's made it such that I can travel whenever I want to.

66
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.820
So again I'm Evan Kimbrough.

67
00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.620
I'm the instructor for this course.

68
00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.720

69
00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.090

75
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.850
That's something that I want you to have as well.

76
