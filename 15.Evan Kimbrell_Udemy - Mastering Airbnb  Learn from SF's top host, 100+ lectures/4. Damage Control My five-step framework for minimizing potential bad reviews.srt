1
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:11,490
I want to talk a little bit about what are you going to do in the case that the worst happens the worst

2
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,360
being you have a guest and they leave you a bad review.

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:22,220
So I'm calling this lecture damage control what you can do to minimize the damage from a guest of a

4
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:23,640
new bad review.

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,410
Inevitably I think that if you do this long enough you will have someone that will give you a negative

6
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:34,230
review and it might be slightly negative or it might be very negative.

7
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:40,550
I've had a couple where they were making side comments side glances in their review saying it's great

8
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:47,160
but and I've gone through about 100 guests and only about one or two that had the intention to literally

9
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,200
leave a bad review.

10
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:55,710
So I want to talk you through what to do and give you a five step plan to turn this around.

11
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,780
If you follow these steps I think you can minimize the damage.

12
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:06,230
And if you're lucky you can completely remove the damage and completely sidestep this whole kind of

13
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:06,990
nightmare.

14
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,440
First off this is before you even start.

15
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:13,060
Need to establish what went wrong.

16
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,090
Sometimes it's not immediately obvious.

17
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:20,940
Sometimes I just put little weird snippy things in there review and you're not entirely sure what happened

18
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:21,490
he said.

19
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:25,110
He said that had a great rapport with the guest.

20
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,550
You know I verified that it was perfectly clean.

21
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,130
What happened.

22
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:34,570
First you can look at the five star ratings on your listing and see if you've noticed something move.

23
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,270
If someone gives you a significantly negative review you might see something new.

24
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,960
You might see a cleanliness go from a four point five star to a four star or something like that it'll

25
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,630
be pretty obvious meaning that they gave you maybe a one star.

26
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,330
That's her first hint as to maybe what their problem was.

27
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:54,120
And if you're lucky and they say in the review what the problem was then you know exactly what the problem

28
00:01:54,210 --> 00:02:02,330
is this is how I tackle negative reviews and I try to minimize the damage Step one you need to message

29
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,250
the guest.

30
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:08,560
You need to message them and you need to apologize for whatever it is that they had a problem with.

31
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:09,690
You need to be careful.

32
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:14,840
You don't need to be accusatory you don't need to say that it's you know it's actually their fault.

33
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,560
They never asked for it.

34
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:22,460
It's OK to mention things like Had you asked I would have fixed it for you but you'd never want to make

35
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,760
it sound like it's their fault.

36
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,640
They're paying you to stay in your apartment.

37
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,940
So that's the last thing they want to hear.

38
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:33,950
The entire point of messaging them is to see if they can change their mind to only use valid excuses.

39
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:38,700
Don't really try to make some contrived excuse for you know if they say it was cold or they say that

40
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:45,250
the heater was broken don't say oh it works fine when I'm there kind of thing because that's too subjective

41
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,450
we don't know we can't verify that.

42
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:50,170
You probably weren't even there to check it when it happened.

43
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,930
But if it is legitimately the case that you showed them how to change the temperature and they forgot

44
00:02:53,930 --> 00:03:01,630
how to do it you can mention that what I always do is I tell them outright I'm going to fix this.

45
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,230
And you be specific.

46
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:07,700
Don't just say oh well OK I'll make sure the next guest doesn't have this say I have some coming out

47
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:13,670
today to fix that or whatever it is you need to show them that they've identified a problem with your

48
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:16,230
listing and you're going to fix it immediately.

49
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:21,800
I usually think it helps to try to explain to them that Air B and B is not a hotel you can just say

50
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:27,650
basic things like you know I do this to help pay my rent or I do this so I can spend time freelance

51
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:31,650
writing or whatever it is that you do and you kind of say this is a lifestyle thing.

52
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:37,550
And then you can explain to them how bad you know negative reviews can damage your property because

53
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,550
a lot of times they think that oh I'm going to give them negative view and it's not going to make a

54
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:40,940
difference.

55
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:45,980
It really does make a difference so that they understand the actual damage they can actually they can

56
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,140
change their mind.

57
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:51,150
I to explain to them that OK you brought this to my attention.

58
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:53,120
I think it's an honest mistake.

59
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,670
And I guarantee you I'm going to fix it.

60
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,360
A lot of times people just say OK well that was the point to begin with I didn't want other guests to

61
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,380
come and you know you know that the heater doesn't work and they're freezing.

62
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:08,120
So if you stablish that sometimes you can get people that will change the review put some time into

63
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:13,250
this message make sure that you really actually come off as genuine and make sure that you do understand

64
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:18,230
what it is they're complaining about because you can't just pretend to address the issue.

65
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:21,970
It's going to come up in the future if someone goes out of their way to complain about it.

66
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:26,580
It's going to be something that someone else will find that they can also complain about it.

67
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:29,530
Guest have I think up to 15 days to modify their review.

68
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,340
So a lot of times I'll just delete it.

69
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:37,040
Sometimes we'll just modify it saying you know you know if it was an actual misunderstanding a lot of

70
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,930
times people say well we'll change it.

71
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:40,030
But a lot of times they just won't.

72
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,350
So then you go to Step Two.

73
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:48,440
Did they violate any of Airbnb review policies and has a lot of review policies that regulate what you

74
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,830
can say and review under what circumstances he can give a negative review.

75
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:55,190
They don't want negative reviews on their properties if they're not legitimate.

76
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:59,870
So they're kind of caught in a hard spot because they don't want good properties that make them money

77
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:06,230
to get unfair review in the same time they don't want to send people who are going to use their service

78
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:09,880
to properties that just don't produce good experiences.

79
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:16,370
So take a check and look at the reviews you can just look for eBay and be dot.com and search reviews

80
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,590
on their Web site and they'll give you all the instances where they've removed.

81
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:27,780
The biggest one is if they say something inflammatory if they curse or they say something derogatory

82
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:30,770
or they just make something that's completely unfounded.

83
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:35,550
That's something that could happen if they go to your three bedroom and they say no it is actually a

84
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,920
one bedroom and that's simply just not true.

85
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:40,330
Air being will strike that review.

86
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:45,390
Another one that I found in this actually happened to me is if a guest tells you that they wanted a

87
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:51,420
refund or a discount and they say they're going to give you a bad review if you don't that's blackmail

88
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:57,360
and B and B has a blackmail policy so you can sell air B and B Hey look at this tax message or threatening

89
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:01,670
to leave a bad review are being blocked them from being able to leave for review.

90
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,690
Kudos to them.

91
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:06,780
That's something that happens more often than I know and a lot of hosts just don't know that air being

92
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,440
B will protect you against that.

93
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:13,470
Most of the time they're being very reasonable about it but it's not going to make a ruling saying oh

94
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,050
the reviews too subjective.

95
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,650
They were not specific enough.

96
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:21,720
We don't agree because honestly it's he said she said sometimes in these reviews.

97
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:24,770
So you can't find anything that violates the review policy.

98
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:27,180
You know step three of you have found something you need to message them.

99
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,720
You can message them to their contacts and or number three.

100
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,720
This is the biggest one.

101
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,450
Make the changes.

102
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:38,760
If someone's complaining about something and they're compelled to put it in a review identify what it

103
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:44,320
is that they're complaining about and fix it if they're complaining about your neighbors being loud.

104
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,580
Talk to your neighbors.

105
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:52,680
Tell them to stop being loud if they're complaining that your fridge later doesn't work fix the refrigerator.

106
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:53,680
This is a big one.

107
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:59,470
If there's something in your listing that says you offer something and you don't you need to fix that

108
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:03,520
you need to make sure that you set expectations because you don't want people coming and thinking you

109
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,530
have a hot tub Jacuzzi getting there realizing you don't have a hot tub Jacuzzi.

110
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:10,430
Be honest when you say how close it is to other things.

111
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:16,060
Be careful about the hyperboles and the exaggerations that you use when describing your property because

112
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,310
this will come back to bite you.

113
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:23,110
So once you've made the changes and is assuming they won't change or review and Air B and B won't intervene

114
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:26,910
I say respond on the actual review.

115
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:32,380
And this is crucial if you see someone who has a negative view on their property and the host doesn't

116
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,200
respond.

117
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:36,250
That just spells out the host is just checked out.

118
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:41,800
It is important what you say and I think that first two lines of your response are crucial don't come

119
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:46,390
out and accuse them of being crazy or accuse them of doing something wrong.

120
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,560
Not saying this isn't the case.

121
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,330
A lot of times you just have crazies who just say things that make no sense.

122
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:57,910
I've had a guest put a negative review in another language and the things they said were just flat out

123
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,950
untrue.

124
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:04,990
They blamed me for break saying that I blame them for breaking something in my apartment when they did

125
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:05,370
break it.

126
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:11,880
I was gone the entire time and I came back and I found the shattered glass from a terrarium on the ground.

127
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:15,640
And there's nothing I can do with or B and B I can't just say like here's a photo of it.

128
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,230
This proves that they did it.

129
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,800
They're not going to strike that review because of one sentence.

130
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,420
So sometimes you do but you don't ever want to come off sounding like you're defensive sounding like

131
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,380
well that's just not true.

132
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,500
Other people have had a great experience.

133
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,650
Generally the best way of doing this is address the concerns.

134
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,110
You didn't just say I'm so sorry for this.

135
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,290
I did not realize.

136
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:42,790
And then if it is a legitimate misunderstanding like say the TV and say there is a TV and make sure

137
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,110
that that is the main thing you get across in your spots.

138
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:48,560
Anybody who's reading this is going to go oh this person says there's no TV.

139
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,260
Followed by her response saying there is a TV.

140
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,370
Here it is.

141
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:54,720
That will basically make them go oh OK it's just a bad guest.

142
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,120
And typically people are booking or forgiving towards that.

143
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:02,320
But if it's not a legitimate misunderstanding you just did something wrong.

144
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,500
You just need to address their concerns and then this is the best way of doing it.

145
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:11,250
You establish that you are going to correct the issue or you have corrected the issue and guarantee

146
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,370
that won't happen again.

147
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:17,920
The best thing to do is like say if they come in they say oh they said as a private room but it's missing

148
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,170
doors go get doors add them and then say I'm so sorry this is a misunderstanding.

149
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:30,400
I've updated my listing and I've added doors so any new gas coming in will not have this issue I guarantee

150
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:30,760
it.

151
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:36,380
It just caps off that problem someone looks at it and they go oh wow there's no doors and they need

152
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:36,940
luck and they go.

153
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:37,990
There are doors.

154
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,200
Case closed right.

155
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,170
They want to make sure that you're improving.

156
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:45,970
And if you do Consolacion proved the odds of getting a negative review are just going to dwindle and

157
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:49,670
the one thing that be careful when you do a response please don't drone on and on.

158
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:54,610
You know don't put a sentence that doesn't look good but don't put two full pages of response.

159
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:58,350
That just makes you look like you're exaggerating or are you going over the top.

160
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,530
The last step.

161
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:01,580
Step number five.

162
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,260
Hopefully it doesn't come to this.

163
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:09,050
Hopefully you have gotten them to remove the review change their review as being gotten rid of it and

164
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:14,930
hopefully you've changed everything that you need to but what you can do in the case of you have responded

165
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:21,530
and you do think it's significant it looks bad it does affect your reviews is typically you can respond

166
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:25,960
by trying to lower the impact of the review on your page.

167
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,940
There is a fall.

168
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:32,030
So once you've had five new reviews that page that's going to go to the second page you know 90 percent

169
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:35,570
of people are going to read your first page reviews and probably 30 percent are going to read your second

170
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:40,070
page reviews so you can kind of minimize the damage that way in order to do that typically what I would

171
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:42,950
do is I would lower the price for the immediate future.

172
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,240
So over the next week two weeks try to lower the price.

173
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:51,260
So what you'll do is you all get bookings that are much lower and then spend a little bit extra time

174
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,070
with them.

175
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:56,900
Previously we talked about maximizing the experience but there's a whole load of tips and tricks in

176
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:00,980
the section you can use to guarantee that you get a good review.

177
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:05,990
Try to pull out a couple extra ones make sure that the next four or five are positive because it'll

178
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,290
drown out the other one.

179
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:12,380
And if it's really causing a problem with bookings try temporarily lowering your price maybe 20 percent

180
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:17,990
25 percent to get people over that hump you all recover from as long as this is not something that you

181
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:20,310
repeatedly have problems with.

182
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:24,600
If that's the case you might run into a slog of trouble.

183
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:29,010
You guys have any questions let me know if you have any crazy guest stories.

184
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:32,790
I'd love to hear them if I think of any other worst case scenario guest stories.

185
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,220
All.

186
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:37,970
I'll post them in the extras section and you guys can laugh at my misery through those.

187
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:40,940
But if you guys have anything posted in the group discussion I will get to.
