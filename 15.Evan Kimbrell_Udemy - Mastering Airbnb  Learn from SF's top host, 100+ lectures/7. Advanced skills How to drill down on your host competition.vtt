00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:11.890
You're going to talk a little bit about how you can do a more in-depth drill down on the host performance

2
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.220
of other hosts in your area.

3
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.450
It's important because you need to know roughly what the bar is to get over to be successful in your

4
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:22.680
area.

5
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.200
It's not nearly as competitive as you think.

6
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.790
In the sense that you can get killed in this category of you know you're not the best host or you're

7
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.210
clearly worse than the other host and you'll still get bookings.

8
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.790
But if you do better than the other hosts you'll get a considerable amount more bookings.

9
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.240
You'll have more choices who you can have in your space and higher feel right when you go on vacation.

10
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.960
Higher filler out on vacation means you get more money for your vacation.

11
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.860
I'm not going to Dualla a ton on the subject but I think it's a skill set that's worth adding to your

12
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:53.870
tool box.

13
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.790
Previously we talked about you know so you look at a host or you look at another profile.

14
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.320
What is it that you're looking for.

15
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.710
We covered a little bit of reviews recovered a little bit about host metrics.

16
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.680
Talk a little bit more about those reviews are crucial.

17
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.190
And if you really start reading the reviews and I suggest you read all of them I mean they're all just

18
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.800
a paragraph or two.

19
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.850
See what people are mentioning and you can get an idea of what the host is not doing.

20
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.060
You'll notice in the listings or in their reviews are they mentioning the person by name.

21
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.310
Are they just describing the apartment by itself.

22
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.390
Are they talking about things specifically that the host did.

23
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.550
That's generally an indication of a more attentive host.

24
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:42.030
A lot of times they might even say what the host did not do or they might have a gripe of what the host

25
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.040
did not respond to this or did not fix this or the host had a certain response to give you a general

26
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.030
kind of picture of what they're doing what they're not doing whether or not they're attentive and whether

27
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.620
or not they are attentive.

28
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:58.140
You know if someone says we were staying there and one of the you know the toilet got screwed up and

29
00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.130
the host responded saying OK we'll fix it in a couple of days.

30
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.920
Clearly that's a host that's not particularly trying and take a mental note of that reviews are pretty

31
00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.890
much the best way of telling what a host is like whether or not there's a space to do better than them.

32
00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.750
I think that's really kind of the big point here is can you beat them and more often than not you have

33
00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.180
hosts that are just sloppy and so you don't have to go out of your way to be the best host and Sarah

34
00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.800
cover a little bit of how you can be the best host.

35
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.670
You know if you just keep a reasonable standard of quality you can actually beat out the people who

36
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.680
are vying for the same bookings and the same booking groups.

37
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.260
Another thing to look for in reviews look for the responses that are given by the host and whether or

38
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.940
not there are responses.

39
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:51.190
And then look at trends since the grammar of how they respond or look at the tone of how they respond.

40
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.170
Good hosts never respond defensively.

41
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.590
They never respond in a confrontation kind of style.

42
00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.090
They never blame it on the other guest.

43
00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.810
It's perfectly normal for them to respond saying that's unreasonable.

44
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.000
But I will improve in the future.

45
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.650
That's typically what you want to see out of a good host.

46
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.180
But a lot of times you just get people post and say This person is crazy they don't know what they're

47
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.560
talking about.

48
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.650
And the thing is that if there's only one time that's happened then people booking might be forgiving

49
00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.670
but if it's happened more than once it's seriously going to hurt the bookings of that place.

50
00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:28.690
And so if you're seeing that there's consistent defensiveness that means it's not going to improve.

51
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:34.120
Think about if you were booking and you were reading these reviews and you had ten glowing reviews in

52
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.100
the eleventh one that said it was terrible and they had a defensive response from a host that's generally

53
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.080
a negative thing.

54
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.750
That's something that the host is clearly not doing well.

55
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:49.180
On the flip side like saying sometimes you get very very positive reviews set for a host.

56
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:51.670
You can tell this host is really good at what they do.

57
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.650
The host came in brought them gifts.

58
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.800
They talked to them for an extended period of time.

59
00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.010
The guest is conveying a sense of friendship with the host.

60
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.650
These are all things that would make you believe that the host is kind of optimizing at least the host

61
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:11.530
experience because that is one of the big aspects of Arabs can be one of the big differentiation aspects

62
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.580
is that you can make yourself a really good host and people can read that in reviews and they're much

63
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.810
likely to go but they're typically when someone's looking at a property they're going to look at the

64
00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.770
reviews and the reviews are all positive but they're not glowing and they're all short and they're all

65
00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.550
kind of just talking out the space.

66
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:26.290
That's good.

67
00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:27.000
Definitely.

68
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.680
But it's not the same effect of every single person saying this is a fabulous experience.

69
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.500
Here is why this is how you know everything worked out for me.

70
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.170
Say a couple's booking for their honeymoon or say what's a family going on vacation.

71
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:46.070
They look for those experiences and those experiences and people saying like what a great host and this

72
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.540
everything was so thoughtful and well appointed.

73
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:54.490
Those reviews are going to be exactly what these types of people are what's going to push them over

74
00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:55.960
the edge into booking.

75
00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.480
They might look at the space it's cheaper and seems any better appointed.

76
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:04.450
But they're going to look at air space and it's cozy air and it looks like the host really cares a lot

77
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:10.920
more that's really going to push them to book with you versus someone else another way of analyzing

78
00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.610
the other hosts in your areas to look at their photographs.

79
00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:21.270
That's a very good way of telling how well thought out their space was it might not be immediately obvious

80
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.830
to you whether or not it's a good host or a bathouse house because say they have the air B and B photographs

81
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.110
and they look fantastic.

82
00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.530
Well there's certain things you're looking for that might indicate that the person is better or worse

83
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.670
something that would indicate that they're better Caribbean B and they take photographs they only are

84
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.610
going to send you maybe 10 12 shots.

85
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.770
Sometimes they only give you four or five.

86
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:45.090
They're not going to give you 20 shots but if you go to a page and there's Air B and B photographs and

87
00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:50.740
there's like you know 10 of them but then there's 20 amateur shot shots by the host.

88
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:55.980
That clearly means that the host is going above and beyond and they're not interested in just settling

89
00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:02.160
for what the Air B and B photographer gave them will cover the photography in a quick bit in the next

90
00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.260
section.

91
00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.290
You should be a little bit acquainted with you know most Arabs at this point you can tell from the photographs

92
00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.960
they have professional photography.

93
00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:15.950
It comes from Arabic and be one thing I always see with could host hosts that are kind of maximizing

94
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:17.090
their bookings.

95
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:21.190
They'll put photographs that are not air be photographed.

96
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:26.120
You can tell it's in Arabic and be provided photograph from an Arab and the photographer if it says

97
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.980
at the top verified photo next to the logo of Air B and B if it does not say that that means the host

98
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:32.120
took the photo.

99
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:37.820
Sometimes you can notice that the host takes photos that are just as good as being the photos and you

100
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.100
can't tell the difference visually except for the change in the logo.

101
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.890
That's something you makes you go oh wow the House actually took the time to go out and take professional

102
00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:48.130
photographs of the space themselves.

103
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:52.670
They can go and create professional photographs in every single space of their being the photographer

104
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:54.230
wouldn't touch.

105
00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:59.090
Another thing you'll notice good hosts when they do the photography they'll take photos of things that

106
00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:00.890
are very specific in a room.

107
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:05.510
They'll take a photo of say the amenities in their kitchen.

108
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.580
So like they'll take a photo of the toaster in the microwave so that everyone looking at it goes out.

109
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:13.700
They have a toaster and a microwave can't forget that took a photo of the breakfast cereal that we always

110
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:17.390
offer when you rent my apartment you will get those.

111
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:20.600
I never buy anything else I always just buy those because exactly what you would expect because you

112
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.600
saw the photograph.

113
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.930
So that's symbolically something you'll see.

114
00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:30.780
You know one house in San Francisco what she did was she made a welcome packet and that welcome back.

115
00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:34.130
It was like a basket and a card and an had some candies.

116
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.770
She took a photograph of that.

117
00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:39.570
Now that's something that screams this host really goes over the top.

118
00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.160
So what are negative things you'll notice in the photographs.

119
00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:50.100
Negative things are things like if they have a spare room or the room that they're renting out the photograph

120
00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:54.780
doesn't capture the entire room in the space somebody is going to put time into the photographs to find

121
00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:59.520
a way of hiding that and someone who's not going to put time into taking the photographs is going to

122
00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:03.660
take a photo like that we can only see the corner of the room or the top of the bed or something like

123
00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:04.440
that.

124
00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:08.580
These are typically things that would indicate that they did this very quickly you know while you think

125
00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:09.750
it's nuanced.

126
00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:14.100
Most guests will at least on a subconscious level notice these things.

127
00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:18.480
So you want to get as many things in the positive column as possible because that's really going to

128
00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:24.570
drive bookings things that you will see people who take photographs and they miss a room in their apartment

129
00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:29.070
and you can tell from the other photographs of the apartment or they take photographs that are seemingly

130
00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:30.600
pointless.

131
00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:34.820
One thing that's kind of a pet peeve for me is hosts that take photos and they don't put a subtitle

132
00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:40.650
of what we're looking at or in the subtitle they don't sell you like they'll take a photograph of their

133
00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:44.480
kitchen and in the kitchen they'll subtitle the kitchen.

134
00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:45.810
That's not helpful.

135
00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:51.610
That's a space where you can convince this person to come stay with you put something else saying my

136
00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:55.070
lovely kitchen with all sorts of amenities or something like that.

137
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:59.850
Those are missed opportunities those are things I'm looking on saying OK this house clearly is not trying

138
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:01.550
or maximizing their potential.

139
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:07.170
The other thing that I mentioned previously was hosting metrics and and go over that a little but again

140
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.990
I'm sorry if this is redundant but this is quite important.

141
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:13.860
You can look at their hosting metrics like I said before.

142
00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:17.570
100 percent is standard for response rate if it's below that.

143
00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:20.400
Unfortunately the host cannot make up for that.

144
00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:25.200
So if you see a host who is a 75 percent acceptance rate you can kind of assume that they're getting

145
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:31.250
probably half the bookings that they should because not only in responding to 25 percent of people most

146
00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:35.340
people are going to look at that and go wow I'm not going to try because I don't think this host is

147
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:38.420
even going to respond or even going to you know walk me through the process.

148
00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:39.960
A lot of guys are going to be on the fence.

149
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:43.130
They're not sure they're coming in late and they don't know if the host is going to respond.

150
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:48.600
That's something a huge deterrent to deters a lot more than what's proportionate in that percentage

151
00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:52.460
it's not going to deter 25 percent of people get the 75 percent response rate.

152
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:57.650
Tina Turner probably 50 percent of people that's something that a host really can screw up.

153
00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:02.310
Now if people around you or your doppelganger or the person you're comparing yourself to before is missing

154
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:04.950
that or there they made some mistakes.

155
00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:05.990
Great news.

156
00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.800
You're not going to make that mistake.

157
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.300
Response time again.

158
00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:13.570
You want to be within an hour but it's not a huge deal if it's a couple hours.

159
00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:17.010
Generally what that will mean though is that if someone's coming in and they're just going to message

160
00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:20.790
five different properties the person responds the quickest is most likely going to get that booking

161
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:22.130
just in general.

162
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:26.550
But if you're not in the mindset you want to book every single night in your apartment and that's not

163
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:28.390
entirely important.

164
00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.660
So hosing metrics very important.

165
00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:35.670
These are kind of a general way of giving a grade to someone looking at their profile did they fill

166
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:37.530
out their profile with the full information.

167
00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:39.770
Does the photograph have a picture of their face in it.

168
00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:43.400
This is a problem with how they'll put a photograph because they think they're being self-conscious.

169
00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:45.720
And it's of a group of people.

170
00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:49.840
No one wants a book if they don't even know who the host in the photograph is.

171
00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:54.240
Maybe it's not a big deal but on a subconscious level you want to make a connection to the person's

172
00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:58.710
face who you're going to book with and whose home you're going to be staying in.

173
00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.970
So those are all general kind of indications of the host quality.

174
00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:08.340
You'd be surprised at how low the quality of someone the hosts are.

175
00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:14.160
That kind of contributes to my general feeling of optimism in the sense that if you put in a minimal

176
00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:19.110
amount of effort you can be a good host and you can beat out these other properties so if you're looking

177
00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:23.160
at a space and you're saying MySpace can't compete against this place and this place will look at their

178
00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.400
hosting records and if they're bad hosting records.

179
00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:29.370
Trust me you can compete with them if they have a bad response right.

180
00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:33.470
That's something they can't recover from their bad reviews they're not going to get rid of those.

181
00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:37.190
So these are all things that should tell you yes this space is open.

182
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:38.310
I can make money on it.

183
00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:42.520
At least I can take a number two position and I can still get bookings.

184
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:46.120
Again if he has any questions on this ask me in the group discussions.

185
00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:51.990
The main point through this lecture was three things you're looking at photos reviews metrics.

186
00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.750
Does the three ways you can give a grade to the host.

187
00:11:54.780 --> 00:12:00.150
The point is lots about how in your area that means there's lots of opportunity for you to beat out

188
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:02.760
the category to beat them out to get more books.
