00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:12,030
Let's talk briefly about last second hosting last second how is it and what do I mean by that I mean

2
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:18,430
that occasionally you'll get people who are asked to stay at your apartment or your place and will stay

3
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:20,030
very late in the day.

4
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:23,140
Is the second whole thing worth it.

5
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,130
Yeah I think so.

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,240
Absolutely.

7
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:31,600
There are great opportunities to get good reviews because they're only usually staying like that night

8
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,480
or they're very much last second.

9
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:38,590
They often will give you the benefit of the doubt and they say like oh wow you know Heaven was so accommodating

10
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:43,540
he let me come in at 8:00 p.m. not last second housing works for you.

11
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:44,920
It just depends on your space.

12
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,700
How quickly can you have it cleaned.

13
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:51,580
Typically I say that the best practice is that let's say that you have guests leave you if you don't

14
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:55,420
have an immediate booking coming up I suggest you clean it after they leave.

15
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:59,850
This is the case that you don't actually use the space but try to clean it after they leave.

16
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:05,700
So that if anybody comes and says hey I want to say tonight you can just pull the trigger on that.

17
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:11,500
Keep in mind also that if you are going to use the N.S. book strategy then you need to clean right after

18
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,150
they leave.

19
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,590
So they always need to have it ready.

20
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:18,940
Also I want you to keep in mind there's a lot of things keep in mind that a lot of those tips and tricks

21
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:23,620
I talked about before with gifts and flowers and things like that you might not be able to pull these

22
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:28,540
off because you don't have enough time so gauge that and you know if it's the case that you're getting

23
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:32,020
like raving reviews without it then whatever it doesn't really matter.

24
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:37,890
Just bear in mind you're not giving them your best but I think in most cases less second housing it

25
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:38,530
works for me.

26
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:42,520
I'm very flexible and I'm perfectly fine with that the only thing that might happen is they might if

27
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,180
you're sharing a space they might book on a Friday night.

28
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:48,580
So you have to wait for them to come in and a lot of times you'll have guests that are inconsiderate.

29
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:53,190
So they say they're coming at 7:00 and then they disappear till 11:00 p.m. that's happened to me before.

30
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:59,590
But if you have a system set up where you can handle these on the fly then you're perfectly fine.
