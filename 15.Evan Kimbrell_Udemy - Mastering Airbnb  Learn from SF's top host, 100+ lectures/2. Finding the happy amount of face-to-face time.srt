00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:11,640
Here's another tip that I think take into consideration the more face to face interaction you have with

2
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,840
your guests the more likely you're going to get a good review.

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:20,690
I've known this from my own experience and I know this from looking at other people's listings and their

4
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,030
reviews.

5
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:29,520
Typically in other listings in the reviews you'll notice that the people who give bad reviews do not

6
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,030
meet the host there's always exceptions to this.

7
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:38,530
A lot of times people give a nastier view and at the very end they'll say like but the host was nice.

8
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:44,940
What you'll notice is when the person has met the host they typically give better reviews or they're

9
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,210
more likely to give a positive review.

10
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:50,220
It's another one of those things that I consider a smoothing tactic.

11
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:54,420
I don't think that it's the case that you necessarily have to meet with them.

12
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,220
I think in a lot and a lot of gas don't necessarily want it but it's never a negative.

13
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:03,840
If you're running out your entire apartment if you can be available to check them into the apartment

14
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,560
whether or not that takes five minutes 10 minutes or 30 minutes.

15
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:07,890
That makes a big difference.

16
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:13,080
You're showing them the space showing how things work and showing you some basic interests in who they

17
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,750
are just giving them some chats or reiterating that they can text you if they need any food recommendations

18
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:24,480
or whatever that's going to increase the likelihood that you're going to get good reviews if you're

19
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,440
running out your space.

20
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,910
Again you obviously want to have some face time.

21
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:32,100
They need to be comfortable with you knowing that you're sharing a space or they're running a private

22
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,090
room.

23
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:36,840
But in general keep this in mind the more you meet them the more likely they're going to give you a

24
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,890
good review.

25
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:43,760
Think about it the way that people view hotels act as if there is no human element to the hotel.

26
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,660
And in most cases it's just a hotel it's a big chain.

27
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,210
There is no human aspect to the person at the front desk.

28
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,240
Maybe that's different if they give you a really bad review that takes your reviews that could really

29
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,500
hurt your income.

30
00:01:55,650 --> 00:02:01,620
Meeting with them reminds them that there's a human element to this when they see you and see that you

31
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:06,630
are renting it to them and it's a personal relationship and that's not them struggling with some corporate

32
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,240
brand that will make a big difference.

33
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,730
They're going to give you the benefit the doubt more often.

34
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,390
A lot of times that they have a bad experience they're going to say themselves it's over and there's

35
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:20,560
no point in me ruining the integrity of their review wall.

36
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:26,010
It's something to take into consideration if you can fit in an extra 10 minutes 15 minutes and you want

37
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:30,930
to meet them or you can meet them test it out see if it's something that you like doing.

38
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:35,460
If you're someone who's a little bit introverted it might be invigorating in the sense that you have

39
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:39,960
very short interactions with people but it also could be a little exhausting especially if you're running

40
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,110
out for one night fall or one night fall by one night.

41
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,560
It can be a little disruptive to your day if you're in a shared space.

42
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,850
However obviously I think that you're going to need to spend some face time with them.

43
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,760
This is something that you should take into consideration.

44
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:59,520
More face to face interaction means better reviews more likely to get positive views and less negative

45
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,540
reviews.

46
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,290
Do you need to spend an hour and a half with each one.

47
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:08,210
Absolutely not only if you want to and only if you know that they are comfortable and they want that

48
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:09,750
my level of interaction.

49
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:13,860
The sweet spot I've found is typically between 15 to 20 minutes.

50
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:20,210
If you do five minutes it sounds like you know you just do this all the time and they mean kind of nothing.

51
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:24,860
If you do 15 minutes 20 minutes gives the impression that you know you are into this space.

52
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:30,050
You do like hosting you do like renting but you know you're not selling this as a space that comes with

53
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:35,150
a friend because a lot of people want to draw the line especially once you get into the range of where

54
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,520
you're charging more.

55
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:39,500
You it people who are like yes that's nice.

56
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,550
We want our space sooner rather than later.

57
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:42,620
They're cheaper.

58
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:46,020
They're probably more interested in spending time with the actual host.

59
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:46,890
Do you need to do this.

60
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:47,780
Absolutely not.

61
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,890
But I think it's something that if you are noticing that you're getting negative reviews or you need

62
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:56,600
more positive reviews really catapult your listing because remember the more reviews you get the higher

63
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,550
up in the search listings you will list.

64
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,200
It's something that I think you should consider doing.
