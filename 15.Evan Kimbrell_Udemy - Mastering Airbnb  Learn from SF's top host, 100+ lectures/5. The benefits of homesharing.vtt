00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.470
What are the benefits of home sharing.

2
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.500
Let me give you a little bit of an idea what I mean by home sharing because I know a lot of you are

3
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.210
going to be new to this concept coming and saying I've heard of there being be but I'm not totally sure

4
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.550
what it is.

5
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:25.910
If you're familiar with ride sharing like Uber lift this is home sharing a home sharing because Air

6
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.820
B and B that's what you're doing you're sharing your home.

7
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.790
People are renting your space and whether or not it's a shared space or it's an entire private apartment

8
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.020
to themselves.

9
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.840
But it is someone else's house.

10
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:44.210
It is staying in a place that has their personal things there with their own personal touch and you

11
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.100
have personal contact with that person whose apartment it is.

12
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.720
It's a different kind of paradigm if you're not used to traveling like that but that's what Home Sharing

13
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.910
is and it's it's you know through the air in the system it's this new economy that's really been opening

14
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.400
up in the last three four five years that you know it's changing the way we travel.

15
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.810
There's two main benefits.

16
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.580
One is financial.

17
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.240
The other one is is more of the intangible kind of benefits.

18
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.990
First financially being able to live in the most expensive city in America.

19
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.870
Or maybe it's the second and not have to worry about rent.

20
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:19.970
That's crazy.

21
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.090
Even if you are in a situation where maybe you're not in a large city or you have a property that isn't

22
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.940
naturally going to be as popular it's still going has the potential to take your rent in half or 75

23
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.830
percent even if you only want to do this casually you can reduce your aunt by 30 percent.

24
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.610
And a lot of cases that's a lot.

25
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.470
This is something that always drives me nuts.

26
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:45.020
When I lived in that apartment without air B and B it's this feeling of walking on a treadmill.

27
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:52.100
You wake up every day and my rent was $3000 knowing that I woke up today and I owe a hundred dollars.

28
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.800
So I need to do something that's productive enough to cover that hundred dollars.

29
00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.260
That has a weight on you.

30
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.680
And when I started running out on Airbnb all of a sudden that equation was reversed.

31
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:10.050
I could wake up knowing I don't owe a hundred dollars today I got 100 dollars.

32
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.510
It's OK if I want to spend the day reading or spend the day doing nothing and doing something that's

33
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.860
not productive I don't have to guilt myself any more about that.

34
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.930
That was one of the biggest benefits for me I think psychologically just knowing it's escaping that

35
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:31.190
treadmill escaping that feeling of no matter what I owe money on this space I pay to live.

36
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.110
I'd like to travel and when I travel I always feel bad because it's like I'm paying double rent I'm

37
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.410
paying rent on an apartment and I'm paying at a hotel wherever I'm going.

38
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.490
And so that feeling really kind of bums you out.

39
00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:49.700
It does feel like you are part of a rat race and so home showing really from a financial aspect really

40
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.340
got me out of that loop.

41
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.220
And you know in the summer when I rented out entirely so I could travel.

42
00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:01.520
That's obviously awesome being able to get paid a very nice salary per month to travel covered all of

43
00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:08.690
my expenses covered my airline tickets covered my stay my food all my activities and then some and even

44
00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.960
saved money when I was traveling.

45
00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:17.410
Being a tourist seeing the world so obviously I can't say enough about how phenomenal that is.

46
00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.650
The intangible though you know there's a lot of other benefits to this and I don't want people to think

47
00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.270
of it just as a money making mechanism.

48
00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.790
It really is something that helps you connect with your city.

49
00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:29.940
I live in San Francisco.

50
00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.430
I love that city.

51
00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.470
And so being able to have people stay in my apartment and being able to share with them what I liked

52
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.540
about the city and what I think they shouldn't do is just phenomenal because I've been everyone's been

53
00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.090
on a vacation you go there and you do the top three things on Trip Advisor and they suck.

54
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.310
You don't have a great experience you don't feel like you connected to the city.

55
00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:55.250
And so I feel like every time someone stays in my apartment I'm a bridge between that getting them over

56
00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:02.690
the socky land of them doing everything based off of their 30 minutes of research online and I can give

57
00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:03.920
them the local perspective.

58
00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.500
I've lived here for several years now.

59
00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.370
I can tell them exactly what to do what not to do one of the places they would never find that I just

60
00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.380
personally love and I can also tailor to their interest too.

61
00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:14.810
Oh you like Chinese food.

62
00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.240
I know a great Chinese restaurant just doing that and being able to help people enjoy their experience

63
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.370
even just traveler to traveler that has an immense kind of psychological benefit.

64
00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.130
I never enjoyed the hotel experience personally I never enjoyed checking into a high end or a Holiday

65
00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:37.850
Inn or you know Motel 6 it felt so sterile inhuman and the prices you pay just made no sense.

66
00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.850
It really was exciting to me because I can kind of jump on this new trend of home sharing.

67
00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:50.930
Right it's now all of a sudden you can rent out your space skip that whole overly developed overly manicured

68
00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.680
feeling of a hotel.

69
00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:53.470
That's awesome.

70
00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.400
I would have paid to stay in someone's apartment just to escape that feeling of being in the concrete

71
00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.120
jungle.

72
00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.820
But you know it helps to know that in general there are babies are much cheaper than that hotel so it's

73
00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.390
kind of when when it really is a game changer.

74
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:13.040
Being able to make money by helping people enjoy their vacations.

75
00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.790
That's crazy.

76
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.120
And I don't know if you guys ever heard of the this new company called viable.

77
00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.050
And this is a company that literally used Air B and B to start their business.

78
00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:26.540
They started a business by running out their apartment taking the proceeds and investing it into their

79
00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:32.360
business and their business is about helping people find great cheap tours in their city.

80
00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.450
So obviously it fits so perfectly.

81
00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:39.530
I'd love it if you guys can post in a group discussion if you've used Air B and B before you posted

82
00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:40.350
before.

83
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:41.510
Share your experiences.

84
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:46.130
I'd love it because the new students are kind of on the fence about it whether or not they want to try

85
00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.880
it or when they're on it.

86
00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.000
Dive right into it.

87
00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:55.260
I love it if they can hear your experiences and hear what you also liked about it.
