00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:08.430
So I've heard that and you do me a lot of people like to show off how much they actually make and to

2
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:09.960
show income proof.

3
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.200
So I thought I'd throw together a quick little screencast to show you roughly what my numbers for the

4
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.730
last couple of years have been to see up here.

5
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.970
That is actually what I ended up making.

6
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.100
I actually have multiple listings.

7
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.380
Typically they're just other spaces in my apartment or if I rent out my full apartment this number is

8
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:38.160
a little deceiving because there are other fees that will happen in San Francisco specifically an occupancy

9
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.130
tax which just doesn't actually take into consideration.

10
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:49.170
But that gives you a decent idea of what my income for last year or this year was and the year I started

11
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.190
this is what it actually looked like and that is because I actually only do a half year.

12
00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.920
Now keep in mind that I only do this casually.

13
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.550
I do not run my air B and B to the ground like some people do.

14
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.420
I rent it out when it's convenient for me.

15
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.730
I rent it out kind of you know when I'm traveling or when I feel like I'm up for hosting and a lot of

16
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.980
times I just don't really feel like it.

17
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:23.190
A lot of times I just said you know I kind of want my apartment to myself this you know this week.

18
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.880
And so that kind of factors into the numbers had I rented this out 100 percent.

19
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:28.640
Well yeah.

20
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:36.950
I mean you had been well in the probably 100 probably 150 160 range but it really it's up to everybody.

21
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.940
You can run it whatever way you want to.

22
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:39.890
This worked for me.

23
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.300
Covered my rent gave me a little extra cash on top of that you know and when I was travelling heavily

24
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.030
one month you know or two months it would pay me out quite a bit.

25
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.500
And you can see you know my general kind of idea behind this was that I just wanted to get over my rent

26
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.730
and then have a little extra.

27
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:07.560
So you can see like I was printing on well so I would use my living room occasionally or a side room.

28
00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.380
So like.

29
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.610
And then when I traveled the summer you can see that I rent it out quite a bit more.

30
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.180
And July was the biggest month was when I had the most bookings.

31
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.730
Again this 11000 is actually kind of deceiving.

32
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.320
There are taxes that go on top of that it ends up being more like ten thousand five hundred or something.

33
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:38.130
But regardless my Ransley $3000 so traveling this summer and it being quite lucrative.

34
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.510
And then when I got back in September I got back in the groove of things and this again covers my rent

35
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.300
and then gives me an extra thousand on top of it.

36
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:52.050
So if you guys want to figure out how I've done this how I have you know put this together what are

37
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.800
my hacks What are my tips sort of my tricks.

38
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.440
If you want me to show you in detail how you also can do this.

39
00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:00.380
Join the chorus.

40
00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.560
I'd love to see in their.
