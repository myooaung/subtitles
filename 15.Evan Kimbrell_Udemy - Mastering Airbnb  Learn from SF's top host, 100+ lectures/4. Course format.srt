00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:09,110
Hey guys welcome back to the course in this lecture I'm just going to go over what the Course form is

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,990
what to set some expectations what to give you some advice how you get the information out of this course

3
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:15,420
the easiest.

4
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:20,200
I want you to be successful at putting your ear be and be the first step is understanding how this course

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,180
is going to work.

6
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:27,190
So we have a wide variety of different types of lectures a lot of them are like this or I'm talking

7
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:32,620
directly and you can see my face and we can shoot it quite literally in the space that I use.

8
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:35,790
Some of them are screencast I show you some computer skills.

9
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:41,410
So later on like for instance I'm going to show you how you can use a basic computer skills to take

10
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:46,550
photographs and then use that magic touch that Air B and B uses on their photographs.

11
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:50,060
And so in that case I'm going to show you how to do that on the actual computer.

12
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:55,870
The majority of the course though actually is just audio with visual representations to reinforce the

13
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:56,480
learning.

14
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,210
Audio is the most important.

15
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:02,370
And then I just kind of show images that can help make it stick in your mind.

16
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:06,280
At the end of each lecture we have these things called cheat sheets.

17
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:11,940
So if you've already watched all the lectures and you want to go back and review what you've done or

18
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:17,020
what you've learned you have a cheat sheet and it's just broken down into a very quick simple ways you

19
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,360
can get the essence out of each lecture out of the way.

20
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,950
It's fantastic if you've gone through everything and you just want a refresher.

21
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,870
It's also helpful if you're in a rush and you want to be lazy.

22
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,650
Yeah that's right.

23
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:30,270
Call you lazy and you don't want to listen to the entire audio.

24
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:31,270
You're not going hurt my feelings.

25
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:36,250
But you can use the cheat sheet at the very end of the course so I have attached an entire PowerPoint

26
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:40,890
that you can download and take with you wherever you want to go and use that as a review.

27
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:45,430
I've also attached a lot of resources to each section if you guys want more resources posted in the

28
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:49,690
groups discussion but they're just tools and things that I think are helpful will save you a lot of

29
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:52,500
time and make you more effective at what you're doing.

30
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:56,020
Again guys you can message me whenever you want.

31
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:59,580
I would suggest that you follow this course in a linear fashion.

32
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:04,320
I think that you're not really going to really get the magic necessarily if you skip huge chunks.

33
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:09,250
However if you were already a host you can skip a lot of the things about like getting your space ready

34
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,100
and things like that.

35
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:14,140
I still think they're very important to understand because I can teach you the fundamentals of what

36
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:18,860
works and what doesn't work and a lot of times you have to go back and change some basic things.

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,680
But of course guys you can always skip around.

38
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,930
Feel free to do it whatever way you want.

39
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:29,980
Now and again make sure that if you have a question you reach out to me I'm there all the time.

40
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,140
Guys I'm really enthusiastic about Air B and B because I think it's a game changer.

41
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,110
And honestly I've seen it change so many people's lives.

42
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,470
That's why I want to teach you this.

43
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,840
So you're having trouble at all.

44
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,970
Please do not hesitate to contact me because I will respond often within an hour we go away.

45
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,330
All right.

46
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:47,170
I see the next letter.
