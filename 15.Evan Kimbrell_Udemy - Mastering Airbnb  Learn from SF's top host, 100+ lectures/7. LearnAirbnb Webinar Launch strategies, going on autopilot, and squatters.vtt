Awesome.

24
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.370
Yes.

25
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.690
Thanks for having me Jim.

26
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.670
And yeah I'm really looking forward to this.

27
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:31.760
Everybody who's listening.

28
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:32.990
Thanks for showing up.

29
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.240
Especially you guys on the West Coast.

30
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.480
I know how ridiculous the early it is right now.

31
00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.150
You guys are really champing it out if you guys have any questions as I'm doing this just type them

32
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.830
and send them to Jim and we can get to him at the end.

33
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.280
I know sometimes I get all excited and I talk all to you.

34
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:56.390
So I put together a little bit of just presentation about some of the questions that people ask me all

35
00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.320
the time some of the questions that people ask.

36
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.700
Gemma Lerner being be and I I want to start off by talking about how I got into being B because that's

37
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.730
a question a lot of people ask me.

38
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.620
It's always fun to like hear that Genesis story because everybody has their own story and you know when

39
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.600
you hear someone else describing how they got into it kind of like Brings back some of the stamina some

40
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.820
memories of how maybe you found it and how it could potentially change your life.

41
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.220
So yeah as Jim said I in San Francisco that's where my LBB is.

42
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:35.690
That is like ground zero for Air B and B that's where the headquarters is really first started.

43
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.150
That's where Terrance's going all over the news with being the last six months.

44
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.610
It's really kind of a hotbed for it.

45
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.960
So my story you know it's it's very similar to a lot of people moving in San Francisco.

46
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.940
I am self-employed.

47
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.220
I make websites.

48
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:58.790
I have a web development firm and we put together web sites and someone who is self-employed I don't

49
00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.530
know if you guys listening or self-employed but it's just brutal sometimes.

50
00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:11.450
Some months are and things are miserable and then you just sometimes you're through deserts and sometimes

51
00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.100
you're just on an unbelievable high.

52
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:19.430
And so I mean I was moving out to San Francisco and I don't know you guys are familiar with this but

53
00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.380
San Francisco is I believe you can correct me.

54
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.070
The most expensive city in the country for rent.

55
00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.840
And I just pulled this off of a burger.

56
00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:35.820
The average one bedroom in San Francisco right now is thirty four hundred dollars.

57
00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.390
When I moved out to San Francisco it was like two and a half three years ago and the average one bedroom

58
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.010
was like twenty eight hundred dollars.

59
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.070
Like steal a bargain.

60
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.700
And now it's only gotten worse.

61
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.780
And I kind of had a little bit of a crisis when I came here.

62
00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.980
San Francisco is a fantastic city.

63
00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.020
It's a great place if you're in tech.

64
00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:02.090
If you're a young professional if you're interested in working for startups and also if you're interested

65
00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.570
in the culture and kind of the scene of San Francisco it's very iconic.

66
00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:13.620
But there's a problem I mean it's a city that you have to break your bank account to live it.

67
00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.740
I mean I know people who make $70000 a year and it's like Congratulations.

68
00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:24.770
You can sleep in someone's kitchen because you need to put four people to bedroom because your rent

69
00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.700
is just out of this world.

70
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.560
And so I kind of had a little bit of a crisis when I first moved here and I was like doing all I could

71
00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.130
last year and it was not pretty.

72
00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:39.740
It was just one of those things like if I had a car.

73
00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.240
Oh I don't really know what my parachute plan was.

74
00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.880
So you know I try to make do with what I had.

75
00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.240
I tried to look for cheaper areas and I moved this area called fisherman's war.

76
00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.260
And if anybody's been a tourist in San Francisco you've probably been to this area.

77
00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.730
And if you're a local in San Francisco you probably just rolled your eyes when I said Fisherman's Wharf.

78
00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.810
It's like hey it's like I sometimes feel like I'm living at Disneyland.

79
00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:11.510
Like it's kind of that you know there's only so many times that you can watch you know eat at the Rainforest

80
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:18.050
Cafe or so many times that you can go to Madame Tussauds Wax Museum or you know you run out of pennies

81
00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.840
that you could smash into novelty coins.

82
00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.290
That's kind of the area.

83
00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.230
And it's just like a tourist place.

84
00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.820
It's beautiful but some of the locals don't really want to live in.

85
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:33.510
And I ended up in here because it's like it's about 30 percent cheaper than the other areas that you

86
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.840
can go back to that map up here.

87
00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.660
It's like a mid range one they lump it in the North Beach.

88
00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.490
Even this map doesn't care about Fisherman's Wharf.

89
00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:41.480
It's right here.

90
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.340
But it's in between these two.

91
00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:48.290
So it's still you know astronomical by normal people's standards.

92
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:53.010
But for San Francisco it's kind of like middle of the road.

93
00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.860
So this really makes no sense out of context.

94
00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:03.460
But the way I came out to Air B and B actually was because you know it's actually because I love talking

95
00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.740
about the red problem in San Francisco and how ridiculous it is.

96
00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:14.260
And you know lucky because they complained about it so much and you know my friends and my girlfriend

97
00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:18.960
just tell me like oh we've heard this story like 10 times ever.

98
00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:22.440
But people always suggest like hey maybe you should think about using air being bait.

99
00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:28.750
And they say oh you know you can rent out your living room for 50 bucks or you know 75 bucks or whatever

100
00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:29.180
it is.

101
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.940
The idea was like pick take the sting off your rent.

102
00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:37.750
The problem was that when they said that I'd never really occurred to me that I could pay my rent with

103
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:38.520
Arabic.

104
00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:41.810
I figured like oh I keep to 300 dollars a month.

105
00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:49.570
That's not really helpful when your rent is so astronomical high and my rent was 3000.

106
00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:53.320
I think it's risen to thirty one hundred now.

107
00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:59.140
So that's not really something that doesn't really factor into the calculus like it's not like oh that's

108
00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:08.250
my my white knight kind of situation or you know what I'm in a path putting if I wanted to come out

109
00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:15.330
to San Francisco to turn and looking at hotels and then looking at hotels and like all of these hotels

110
00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:16.210
around my area.

111
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:23.030
Well like $400 a night holiday inn $400 a night Hyatt $50 a night.

112
00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:28.110
All these places even like hotels like Travelodge and things like that were just not very nice.

113
00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:32.550
The eureka moment for me that really kind of brought me to Air B and B was actually I was like walking

114
00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:36.130
home from I don't even remember where.

115
00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:42.910
Probably just groaning in my head about my situation and it passed by this motel this ugly dumpy motel

116
00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:45.330
that is right next to my apartment.

117
00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:52.470
It is about a block away and just out of the you know really know what inspired me I walked in and asked

118
00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:53.930
about how much it cost.

119
00:07:53.970 --> 00:08:00.700
And you know motels like the man slash woman Garonne sat you know two hundred seventy five dollars a

120
00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:02.590
night which I remember she's telling you that.

121
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:05.040
And that's what I have for a motel.

122
00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:09.900
And then I asked her do you any vacancies and she said no it was like Ruhollah booked out a whole month

123
00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.620
that was where I kind of realized something and that was that.

124
00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:15.560
Wait a second.

125
00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:20.880
I'm a block away from this place in a nicer space in a full apartment.

126
00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:28.200
Surely someone would pay that over this dumpy motel of price gouging people on purpose.

127
00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:33.480
And that's where I kind of made the connection and I know a lot of prospective Arab TV hosts out there.

128
00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:39.390
They can have this problem when they think about getting on Air B B they don't think that their space

129
00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:43.830
has value and they look around them and they're like I live here you know.

130
00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:49.450
Why would anyone pay to live here or pay to live in an area that's decorated my stuff.

131
00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:55.310
I had that same problem and it wasn't until I had one of the more extreme examples like this.

132
00:08:55.310 --> 00:09:01.650
This dumpy motel to kind of knock me out knock me out of my senses which was that my apartment has value

133
00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:05.580
and surely if I'm struggling to find a place for my parents.

134
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:12.760
People are also looking for a place and they don't want to pay $400 a night to save the holiday or 275.

135
00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:14.530
It this place.

136
00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.000
And that's all I got.

137
00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:20.520
I honestly did this old thing week and a half.

138
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:23.110
I am a total nerd.

139
00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:24.310
I work.

140
00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:27.880
And you know I've been in startups with my pretty much my entire life.

141
00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:33.350
And so I'm digable like testing and data and and I'm really kind of obsessive about the details of things

142
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:37.330
I do and I end up spending way too much time on my listing.

143
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.890
But I really kind of dove into it.

144
00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:47.250
I started looking around the area I started studying other people's art looking at the amenities you

145
00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:49.050
know kind of studying what people were doing right.

146
00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:53.970
I mean I look at my competitors and I would practically memorized some of their reviews it's kind of

147
00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:58.700
into what I got and how I do it.

148
00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:03.090
I listen up my space and I had a decent reaction.

149
00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:10.020
I think my first month I think you know I rented out I got maybe a thousand dollars and it just kind

150
00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:16.920
of steadily rose from there as I started learning things as I started testing things out as I started

151
00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.450
coming up with ideas and trying to implement them.

152
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:21.160
And I was like OK more experience.

153
00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:27.300
There's a huge knowledge gap between hosts to have been hosting for a while and have been in the dirt

154
00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:30.470
for a while and people are completely new to this.

155
00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:34.580
There's a lot of skill and a lot of nuance to it.

156
00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:42.230
So with that today that is a screenshot of my backyard that backyard right there.

157
00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:46.000
Man that looks so much better than the backyard I've ever sat in.

158
00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:49.950
But that's the that's the magic of photography today.

159
00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.970
I've been well over 300 plus guests.

160
00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:59.250
I know originally for a long time I thought that disco was just an oddity in terms of how great of an

161
00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:00.960
opportunity this is for hosts.

162
00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:08.560
Well and now I've actually helped launch five different properties so I've helped launch properties

163
00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:09.460
in Oakland.

164
00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:17.620
Not too far I've watched them in Buenos Aires Baltimore Denver Colorado and even itty bitty Lawrence

165
00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:19.350
Kansas.

166
00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:24.620
So I and every single one of those properties has absolutely blown out of the water.

167
00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:26.830
The profit expectations.

168
00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:35.500
So my my full time listing started off at $200 and I'd been hosting half years now and now the average

169
00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:42.670
I run it up or is about 450 is not an area and not untypical but I have a night where I'm getting paid

170
00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:44.660
$600 a night to rent it out.

171
00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:50.820
And this is actually just recently about four months ago.

172
00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:57.950
The issue of everything I put together all the tips and tricks and techniques and really everything.

173
00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:04.540
Now I'm actually number one in San Francisco whenever you search just generically for the city for three

174
00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:09.640
plus guests and even if you search for to show up there it is actually.

175
00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:10.570
And that's what it's like.

176
00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:12.750
It's like Christmas coming early.

177
00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:21.580
And I remember about it about six weeks ago or two months ago I reposted my listing.

178
00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:27.340
I rented out every summer every summer I travel so I travel for three months every year.

179
00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:30.060
Last year I went to Bali and Borneo.

180
00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:40.480
Right now I'm in Thailand and I'm doing small little trips into China and Taiwan and etc. etc. but so

181
00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.840
I've listed it and I popped it up.

182
00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:48.340
There's like you know ready for the summer season and I packed it up and did it in five days.

183
00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:51.240
I booked $21000.

184
00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:56.250
And that is just like I said accumulation of pretty much everything I put together.

185
00:12:56.530 --> 00:13:02.980
And that is essentially that the whole experience I've taken and grown into a course and we'll talk

186
00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:05.700
a little bit about that later.

187
00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:08.050
That was a little Perouse shot.

188
00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:12.150
I like to keep this when I should make this like my desktop background or something just like my little

189
00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:13.440
badge of honor.

190
00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:19.280
When I did this in all sorts of different dates and also different guys settings and etc..

191
00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:24.270
Sahar hon I even thought like maybe I'm in search number one because I've logged into my account and

192
00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:31.120
that and so I want to talk a little bit about it.

193
00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:35.460
Jim's asked me to address the questions that you guys have specifically.

194
00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:42.760
We're going to talk a little bit about tips for them out and I want to be a distinction here what I'm

195
00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:43.150
talking about.

196
00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:49.000
Tips for starting off I'm talking to you guys who are prospective posts people who are thinking that

197
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.250
their space and really hoping that they can have the best launch they can.

198
00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:58.930
I know everybody out there still lists this and they want to start making money as soon as possible

199
00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:01.630
and I want to have the best experience possible.

200
00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:03.210
A lot of people don't want to hear that.

201
00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:04.670
You know it could take time.

202
00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:09.850
I mean to get to where I was it took two and a half years and two and half years of trial and error.

203
00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:17.320
So I'm going to focus these five tips on starting out like when I launch a property what do I do and

204
00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:22.900
what do I do that's work consistently because now whenever I launch a property I can get onto the first

205
00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:26.200
search page easily within like a month.

206
00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:29.350
I mean easily a lot of times it's been two weeks.

207
00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:38.410
The more competitive areas six weeks two months if I relisted my apartment now you know I think probably

208
00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:42.310
maybe three or four months to get to the front page as opposed to two and a half years.

209
00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:48.880
So I'm going to focus these on people starting out and I'm trying there's a lot that I can talk about

210
00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:51.070
be like best practices.

211
00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:52.870
They go a lot of like common sense.

212
00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:58.870
I try as much as possible to give you the uncommon information the kind of things that you never really

213
00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:04.210
would have thought about or things that are just not standard things that only someone has been doing

214
00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:12.890
for a long time and really really trying and iterating knows about certain.

215
00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:15.750
It's called your booking to inquiry ratio.

216
00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:20.730
Now all a lot of you even like normal host out there who have been hosting for a while don't even know

217
00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:22.310
what this is.

218
00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:29.280
Now there's a concept you need to understand that a lot of companies use whenever they have search listings

219
00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:37.390
Air B and B you know you to me as an example they use a concept called velocity and velocity is a race.

220
00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.270
Ever.

221
00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:40.590
But it is this X factor.

222
00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:48.120
You don't realize and what it is is they take the amount of time that it takes you from a launch to

223
00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:54.930
get into a point where you're required booking wiring inquiries page views and reviews and the gold

224
00:15:55.140 --> 00:16:01.950
standard like the golden rule everything comes down to this one booking the inquiry ratio that is how

225
00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:05.560
you maximize your search ranking.

226
00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:09.170
And I'm always amazed at how many people never heard of this.

227
00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:13.090
So what it does is it's wintertime you get an inquiry.

228
00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:14.130
You see it all the time right.

229
00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:17.600
So when I ask you a question time it's in terrible English.

230
00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:19.930
Sometimes it's horribly incomplete.

231
00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:22.640
Sometimes it's their entire life story.

232
00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:23.410
They are.

233
00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:30.140
You need to focus on the ratio of how many inquiries you take and how many you book.

234
00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:31.080
OK.

235
00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:36.180
Now you have to think about it from air being the perspective when everybody is deciding who to list

236
00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:37.090
in their search results.

237
00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:38.920
Who do you think they want to show.

238
00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:44.130
Do you want to show say a property that looks 50 percent of their people the people that Senate inquiry

239
00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:47.370
or do you think they want to send it to someone who books 90 percent.

240
00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:50.280
So that's something you need to keep in mind.

241
00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:55.740
And I honestly whenever I help people with their listings I try to tell them that it's very very important

242
00:16:55.740 --> 00:17:02.040
that you plan to cast your net as wide as possible if you want to maximize your earnings and maximize

243
00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:03.060
your experience.

244
00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:09.090
Now if you're someone who is only trying to do this part time then you still want to pay attention to

245
00:17:09.090 --> 00:17:11.180
your booking to increase ratio.

246
00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:15.820
But you will take a little bit more of a nuanced approach to it.

247
00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:20.730
You aren't going to be accepting every single person you're going to be more mindful about your calendar

248
00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:27.060
and you're going to keep in mind things like Don't ever decline guests do not ever decline guess guys

249
00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:28.290
if you are hearing this.

250
00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:29.320
Write this down.

251
00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:31.520
It's never worth it for you to do that.

252
00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:37.230
And that always hurts you but in general make sure that you are being mindful of how many people you're

253
00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:41.760
booking and how many people are asking you about your property or about your space.

254
00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:48.720
I personally try to book literally everyone and that is why my search ranking is so killer.

255
00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:55.080
So that's a huge huge metric and actually kind of the rest of the tips kind of when you into that.

256
00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:56.360
That's why I want to start with it.

257
00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:02.630
The second tip I would say for someone starting off is that.

258
00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:10.520
So first of all be aware of an editor when you first start off when you first list are being B.

259
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:12.650
You're going to be in like search page 8.

260
00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:13.240
Right.

261
00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:18.510
Like I do I have hosts all the time that come to me and say like I lost my property I'm not getting

262
00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:19.670
any page use at all.

263
00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:21.610
I can't even find my property.

264
00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:22.200
OK.

265
00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.720
I mean that's true and that's because you don't have social proof.

266
00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:29.100
You don't have a review base and you don't have bookings on off and you don't even have that that conversion

267
00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:32.700
ratio up above.

268
00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:37.180
And so the thing is that you need to focus on what are the things that you can manage.

269
00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:38.090
OK.

270
00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:40.730
If if you land on search page 8 you're brand new.

271
00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:45.520
What are the things that you can use to your advantage versus every other host out there.

272
00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:52.710
Every other house has reviews every other host has social proof they have references they have you know

273
00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:54.190
everybody's getting them search shoes.

274
00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:55.790
But what can you do.

275
00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:59.850
One of the things you can do makes a huge difference is your response time.

276
00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:05.850
I know I'm sure a lot of you have heard this before if you read a lot about MBB but I don't think you

277
00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:10.860
understand how how important it really is.

278
00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:14.240
So a lot of people say like oh you need to respond within an hour.

279
00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:14.870
OK.

280
00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:19.860
I'm not actually talking about that metric that metric that shows up on your host's profile on your

281
00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:24.070
home profile if you guys are looking at every area of the page and you go to the bottom.

282
00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:26.530
It'll say how often they respond.

283
00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:27.910
And it should be 100 percent.

284
00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:31.950
If you're trying to be competitive you're taking it seriously and it's just say how fast they respond.

285
00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:34.160
And the absolute best they can say is within an hour.

286
00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:34.700
Right.

287
00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:38.520
And so a lot of hosts go and they say Oh well as long as they responded in 55 minutes.

288
00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:43.380
I always have that badge of response time but you need to take it a little bit farther.

289
00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:44.180
OK.

290
00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:47.870
The way I do it and I honestly I did all the testing on this.

291
00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:49.620
You guys don't have to it's kind of ridiculous.

292
00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:53.460
But this is a handful of a little too analytical for my own good.

293
00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:58.800
What I started doing was I was testing when people message me and sometimes I'd respond in like a minute

294
00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:06.860
sometimes responded five minutes 10 minutes 30 minutes two hours and I'd see the act.

295
00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:10.880
Now think about it when someone messages you.

296
00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:14.450
Chances are they probably message like five other properties right.

297
00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:18.380
I mean have you ever looked on there being that you probably message multiple properties.

298
00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:23.330
One thing that I am in on this is what I realized from testing this constantly is just how important

299
00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:30.890
this is if they message five properties and you're like number four on their list in terms of their

300
00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:31.930
ideal spot.

301
00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:38.750
If you were immediately within 10 minutes within five minutes you are four times as likely to book them

302
00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:40.180
now.

303
00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:45.170
I mean you just think of it from a consumer standpoint I do this all the time like if I'm running out

304
00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:48.460
of space say I'm running out for a family vacation or an eye.

305
00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:49.720
Message five people.

306
00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:51.580
One of the worst things about air being me is I have to wait.

307
00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:51.910
Right.

308
00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:54.150
Like hotels like in his book it and I'm done.

309
00:20:54.530 --> 00:21:00.470
If someone responds immediately I can have a conversation with them and getting commission from them

310
00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:02.560
before I even hear from the other ones.

311
00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:08.970
Chances are and I'd say 60 70 percent of the time I'm always on an grps with the Kloner.

312
00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:17.430
Now the way that you can kind of accelerate your ability to do respond very quickly is get a smartphone.

313
00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:22.020
Honestly if you don't have a smartphone hopefully or at an age really everybody has a smartphone and

314
00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:27.300
you're not walking around with the feature phone like a Motorola Razor but get a smartphone and attach

315
00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:28.370
your phone to it.

316
00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:33.000
Use the text messages and able send you push notifications.

317
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:39.360
A also sends you text messages and respond to text messages long before you can respond to the post

318
00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.780
on the air in the app.

319
00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:48.450
You need to get a phone get a phone actually trumps being tied to it.

320
00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:50.460
Try being checking with it frequently.

321
00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:54.510
I know that that kind of drives people crazy but you can tell yourself This is a business thing right.

322
00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:58.280
Like I'm just trying to be successful I'm trying to pay my rent that's why I'm checking my phone.

323
00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:01.660
And trust me though I understand.

324
00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:08.460
But if you can honestly respond within a minute two minutes you will go from that page eight nobody

325
00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.720
to all of a sudden this page.

326
00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:15.440
Nobody of us is booking 50 percent of the people that they're there getting anywhere from.

327
00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:21.470
That is a really great way to accelerate your search ranking kind of movement.

328
00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:30.250
Are you sure growth get three upgrade your photos is another one that you hear quite often.

329
00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:32.930
But I want to get a little more in-depth with it.

330
00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:36.240
So that's another thing that you can use as a cost.

331
00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:42.460
Other shows that are not nearly as brand new as you people who are established.

332
00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:46.970
Now when someone sees your listing and this is one of the biggest problems I see with Neuhaus there

333
00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:54.710
are so many people out there who post post their list and put a picture of their room and always in

334
00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:56.410
portrait right.

335
00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:59.680
They don't realize how bad portrait displays and their the is.

336
00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:06.520
And they put you know maybe two photos and they're shocked when no one asked to stay at their place.

337
00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:07.900
OK.

338
00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:13.570
Well I mean obviously anyone who's hosted before knows that like why would you stay at a place that

339
00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:18.520
only has two photos if honestly they didn't take the effort to take three photos or clicked the shutter

340
00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:19.840
button four times.

341
00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:23.640
Why would you want to stay there what does that say about the experience.

342
00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:32.060
So trying to focus on getting out of the gate with the best photo you can and the way that I do this.

343
00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:39.880
And you don't have to be super rich or super one percenter to be able to come off with great fantastic

344
00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:42.700
studio quality photos.

345
00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:47.890
I mean all lets you in on a little secret this is how I get it and when I started again I was trying

346
00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:49.400
to wash my budget seriously.

347
00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:56.830
I actually just went to Costco because Costco has cameras and I know that they have a 90 day return

348
00:23:56.830 --> 00:24:01.570
policy for any reason any any reason any condition.

349
00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:08.450
And then I went to Target and I knew if they had a 15 day policy any reason any condition on lenses

350
00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:14.800
and say literally that's all I did I went got a fancy camera put it on my credit card and I don't feel

351
00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:21.280
bad because I shop McCoskrie all the time so they make more money off me and I use my fancy camera and

352
00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:22.020
I.

353
00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:27.040
And this is a tip that I learned later flashbulb attachments you guys don't know what that is.

354
00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:32.650
Go and search for flashbulb attachment flashbulb attachments are how they get your photos of.

355
00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:33.060
Right.

356
00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:33.890
By the way.

357
00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:39.880
And I went and got a wide angle lens because I knew the wide angle looks good and furniture looks good

358
00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:41.110
indoors.

359
00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:48.440
And I had an SLR camera when it took all my photos in one day and then returned it the next day.

360
00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:53.170
My photos alone were enough to get inquiries the first day.

361
00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:57.460
I even had people mentioning hey you have great photographs.

362
00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:02.040
Now a lot of people out there who are established hosts know that they're being be able to your photographs

363
00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:03.250
for you.

364
00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:04.100
This is true.

365
00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:08.640
But you also don't know that you probably stumble upon that after you get to a certain point we already

366
00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:11.250
have enough reviews that they're willing to come out and do this for you.

367
00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:16.810
You have to get to a certain point in your hosting before they'll send a photographer out there.

368
00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:20.470
I mean they're not going to send a photographer to anybody who thinks they're willing to host they're

369
00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:26.020
going to send it out to people who actually put the effort into hosting and who are serious about doing

370
00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:26.510
this.

371
00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:32.140
So there's this kind of this image to me where you know you could honestly if you have a bad start you

372
00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:38.950
could have six weeks two months before they deem you qualified to send their photographer out who takes

373
00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:42.840
all your photos and honestly like 20 minute this is a great stopgap.

374
00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:46.870
It's a great way to get your photos in between.

375
00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:51.780
It's much much better than iPhone and it's still not as good as their photos.

376
00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:52.940
But it's very close.

377
00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:59.290
And I go into seriously depth into this in my course I even show you how urban be and I figured this

378
00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:06.850
out just from having off the record conversations how they make your photos look like so saturated and

379
00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:09.550
so with so much like boom to them.

380
00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:12.830
You guys are what do the photos they look unnaturally good don't they.

381
00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:18.640
I always call it like putting the MSJ in your photos like it it's just something tasty about their photos.

382
00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:23.090
So yeah those are that's a huge one.

383
00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:28.220
And that's something that if you plan correctly you can take advantage of right out of the gate.

384
00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:33.600
That's going to give you the velocity that we talked about higher velocity will just sling Chuck forward.

385
00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:40.570
Augmented more amenities and this is something I cover absolutely in depth in my course.

386
00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:45.290
This is something that if you're coming from my course you probably are like rolling your eyes because

387
00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:50.420
they talk about this so much I'm in love with augmented minute is what I mean by this is everyone who's

388
00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:55.160
running out of space is probably going to get themselves like I can't compete against people who have

389
00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:56.940
these systematic advantages.

390
00:26:56.930 --> 00:27:02.540
People you know if you don't have a hot tub or you don't have extra space or you don't have really nice

391
00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:06.280
fixtures or maybe you only have one bathroom as opposed to two.

392
00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:08.600
You I think that I can't compete with other people.

393
00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:11.170
Well there's ways that you can make up for that.

394
00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:16.840
And this is just a want to see a long process of me experimenting and experimenting with like what are

395
00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:22.100
things that I can pay for that are external to my apartment or things I can add that can dramatically

396
00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:28.430
change how many people see my listing how many people book dramatically changed the value add when people

397
00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:30.340
read my listing and stay at my place.

398
00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:35.840
Two of my favorites are the air bed and the parquet air bed.

399
00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:42.850
So I did a in the air and in breakfast.

400
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:47.610
The whole idea was you set up an air bed in your living room and host people for conventions.

401
00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:51.120
But there's actually something somewhat to that.

402
00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:55.350
So what one of the things I experimented with is that I have a three bedroom apartment.

403
00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:59.790
Technically it's two but I was like Can I have a very large living room.

404
00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:05.280
Burdett two if there are better they are experimenting with was how many more page views and inquiries

405
00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:11.510
do I get if all of a sudden as opposed to being able to host six people I can just host eight or nine.

406
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:18.690
And I realize is absolutely massive growth in terms of how many people could see your listing.

407
00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:25.830
But also when you get up into these higher categories of booking six booking eight booking nine the

408
00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:32.910
competition up there where the air is thin is minimal because people just can't really compete with

409
00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:33.480
that.

410
00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:37.280
And so that's what the air bed is absolutely brilliant.

411
00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:44.940
And in my course I talk about the really go and this is there's a video of me jumping on Arab heads.

412
00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:50.140
And what exactly you need to get in an airbag and there's two main objections that people have.

413
00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:53.210
This one is airbags are not comfortable.

414
00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:55.180
People are paying a lot of money to stay here.

415
00:28:55.230 --> 00:29:01.770
Now I would challenge you because if you were to stay on my air bed and this is a fancy air bed it's

416
00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:03.370
a Seagate.

417
00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:05.780
No it's not a see that's a hard drive company.

418
00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:07.550
It's a front gate.

419
00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:09.760
The front gate bad.

420
00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:11.410
It actually is like a spin off of.

421
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:12.860
I think it's like a sharper image.

422
00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:16.690
You know that a company that's like like Sky Mall.

423
00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:22.190
But anyway it was a very expensive purchase like a $400 $500 bed.

424
00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:26.620
And as a means of a switch and it literally assembled itself.

425
00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:33.450
Now something that I learned from my grandma actually taught me all your True wisdom comes from it's

426
00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:38.490
always your grandparent as you tell me that you know if you have an air bed and you put a topper on

427
00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:43.350
top of it like 90 percent of people can't even notice the difference between that and sleeping on a

428
00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:51.390
normal queen that they're going to notice it's not a temper P-TECH or what is it like the Caspar that

429
00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:53.640
gets an airbag.

430
00:29:54.050 --> 00:29:58.500
And so it's kind of packed like you can really all of a sudden go from.

431
00:29:58.510 --> 00:30:05.690
I went for about six six people to eight people by having an inflatable that inflatable bed.

432
00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:13.590
And all of a sudden I think I added 60 percent to my views pretty much overnight and Jevon view means

433
00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:21.390
60 percent jump in bookings and I had a per person fee so my per night got higher and higher and higher.

434
00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:22.950
The other one was parking.

435
00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:25.520
Man 2 has just I turned the corner.

436
00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:26.310
When I did that.

437
00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:35.520
If you can start off right off the bat and offer parking especially in the that's going to go oh I don't

438
00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:36.920
have parking.

439
00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:37.660
Yes.

440
00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:40.040
But there are parking garage.

441
00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:44.690
So what you can do is you can go and add a parking spot and offer it to your guest.

442
00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:51.130
I mean I had a part I think quite literally like a if you went and looked at my book last year and a

443
00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:59.040
solid form mentioned the parking spot as a reason they huge I mean and obviously this doesn't work for

444
00:30:59.040 --> 00:30:59.960
every single person.

445
00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:02.790
Like if you live in an area that everyone has parking it doesn't really matter.

446
00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:06.340
But these are augmented or amenities like do you live near a gym.

447
00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:06.720
OK.

448
00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:08.930
Can you get guest passes for your guests.

449
00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:11.890
All of a sudden you have gym access.

450
00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:17.310
Look for those things that you can and these are like look at your list see the things you can't change

451
00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:22.440
and try to think of things that you can actually add it doesn't make a huge difference towards how many

452
00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:23.350
views you get.

453
00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:31.260
How many bookings you get on your inquiry to booking ratio in the city and then your last you know you

454
00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:35.550
go off and it's all rainbows and puppies and all that.

455
00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:39.830
All right number five is a no brainer pricing strategy.

456
00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:44.220
So one of the problems a lot of people have when they start posting is that they start thinking of they

457
00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:51.790
think of themselves like what is my my space worth I don't know what I should list my space for.

458
00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:55.830
You know they had the same problem I talked of before or you just don't think your space has any value

459
00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:57.240
and you just don't know where to start.

460
00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:00.180
Like what do I say 200 or $20 is too low.

461
00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:00.590
You got it.

462
00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:02.630
It's like analysis paralysis.

463
00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:09.060
And what I do is I always tell people start with a pricing strategy that is just like a dollar.

464
00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:16.320
And what I mean by like if someone looked at your price it needs to make immediate sense and I offer

465
00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:23.160
you give me examples of how you can do that in my course I have like eight but I go into more depth

466
00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:24.030
of that.

467
00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:30.430
One of them is look full on Expedia or Hotwire.

468
00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:34.840
I think they're all like that same parent.

469
00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:36.420
Look at what it cost for one bedroom.

470
00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:41.930
What would it cost for a two bedroom and a calculate what you know in your head how much you think you

471
00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:47.210
could charge for two people or four people where one of the equivalent is look at their of the list

472
00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:50.820
and then try your best to every single amenity they have.

473
00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:51.640
OK.

474
00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:52.720
They have hotwater.

475
00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:54.630
Good your hot water.

476
00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:56.100
Curling iron.

477
00:32:56.150 --> 00:33:02.170
Misty great to you because you know any little amenity you can think of that they expect in a hotel

478
00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:03.220
try to match that.

479
00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:06.230
And if you can match that that space like that.

480
00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:10.320
Oh here you equivalent space and then lower your price.

481
00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:13.430
Anyone who's looking at those two will know which one to book.

482
00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:17.020
They'll notebook with you because they're getting the same exact thing.

483
00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:23.460
Never mind all the intrinsic benefits to every TV set it is like having a host or having a local lowdown.

484
00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:32.030
Book or because you're cheaper and better or level the alternative to that what you can do also is you

485
00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:33.960
can also beat their amenities.

486
00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:36.860
Look at the hotel right next to you beat what they have.

487
00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:40.950
Add something else don't you know that's I go and buy a hot tub.

488
00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:46.260
But there are a lot of augmented or amenities you can add in and then match your price.

489
00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:48.300
So just match it to what they're doing.

490
00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:50.060
Then again it's a no brainer.

491
00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:51.460
This place is better.

492
00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:54.410
This place is.

493
00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:59.340
And the other thing I'd say is find a comparable property in your area.

494
00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:03.710
And do the same thing to them.

495
00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:08.650
Look for someone who has a decent amount or Cubase who has this most similar property be you.

496
00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:14.270
So in my course they call it your doppelganger.

497
00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:19.040
But really it's just like you want to find your arch rival kind of thing and try to beat them.

498
00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:21.750
My archrivals name was Lance.

499
00:34:21.910 --> 00:34:26.450
Hand you won't have amenities and then match their price.

500
00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:30.200
And as a starting off property that's a no brainer right.

501
00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:35.080
I mean that's how you overcome your lack of social proof your lack of head start.

502
00:34:36.670 --> 00:34:37.010
OK.

503
00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:38.520
And then I have.

504
00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:45.880
You were not expecting a bonus tip I'm sure but a step this is something that I only suggested to people

505
00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:51.210
who are pretty serious about this who really really want to make money and make money faster.

506
00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:53.140
It's Don't make your first month.

507
00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:56.350
Now that sounds counterintuitive but actually it's not.

508
00:34:56.350 --> 00:35:02.410
Now if you understand the concept of velocity they're is talking about what I always suggest is focus

509
00:35:02.410 --> 00:35:02.880
on that.

510
00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:12.250
And so what you can month is quite literally go and calculate what you think the cost is just the cost.

511
00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:13.020
Right.

512
00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:14.800
You know what's the cost of utilities.

513
00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:15.990
What's the cost of my rent.

514
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.750
What's the cost my mortgage or whatever.

515
00:35:17.850 --> 00:35:24.730
Was it coffee individual things that I do for them or the individual we call variable costs and charge

516
00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:25.680
that.

517
00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:26.400
OK.

518
00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:34.320
Now in order to make it so that people don't just run away with this next month and I an excellent 30

519
00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:36.360
percent 40 percent.

520
00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:42.430
Is that if you do this for your first month you are artificially subsidizing your space.

521
00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:43.470
Someone sees it.

522
00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:46.150
It is an artificial discipline.

523
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:47.880
No one can compete with that.

524
00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:52.180
It's obvious you're just going to book everyone's book.

525
00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:54.240
It's almost a fire sale.

526
00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:55.530
Everyone's going to go for it.

527
00:35:56.480 --> 00:36:02.570
And then what you do is you focus on the base focus on closing the gap between you and the rest of the

528
00:36:02.570 --> 00:36:03.440
host.

529
00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:05.880
And this is the Honestly my favorite thing.

530
00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:12.650
I mean it's just this is how you slingshot your listing because you just have a six week period or four

531
00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:18.400
week period and you can stomach that where you are not making any margins view honestly after six weeks

532
00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:27.580
we'll have more traction then you're comparable property has in two years a strategy that I love using

533
00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:30.520
I go into more depth in it.

534
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.390
But that is sufficient for you guys understand that concept.

535
00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:36.390
Okay.

536
00:36:36.730 --> 00:36:42.960
The second thing that Jim asked me to talk about was making things run smoothly.

537
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:49.770
Now this is more for people who are running it right now and maybe you guys are getting a burger now.

538
00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:52.810
Maybe you're about to stay in the

539
00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:03.210
well it's been in for the last six weeks and it will be for the next six weeks.

540
00:37:03.490 --> 00:37:06.790
And I don't have I mean I have internet connection my phone doesn't work.

541
00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:10.310
And I I'm managing pretty much everything.

542
00:37:10.330 --> 00:37:11.350
Funny story.

543
00:37:11.350 --> 00:37:14.680
I actually went and spent a month in Cuba.

544
00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:16.730
I'm American.

545
00:37:16.810 --> 00:37:21.470
So if you ever find yourself talking to Homeland Security this conversation never happened.

546
00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:27.830
But I spent a month there and if you know anything about Cuba they don't really they don't have internet.

547
00:37:27.850 --> 00:37:31.590
I think there's two places in the entire island that have a wife.

548
00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:36.630
And that Wi-Fi only allows for five people to be attached to it at a time to get internet.

549
00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:41.740
You have to wait in line and usually to wait in line like an hour to then buy overpriced Internet the

550
00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:43.010
last 15 minutes.

551
00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:48.450
So in the course of a month I checked my internet and I don't e-mail my internet because they're not

552
00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:55.570
fast enough Maloja e-mail four times a month and I have booked out like 90 percent fill rate for that

553
00:37:55.570 --> 00:37:56.110
month.

554
00:37:56.380 --> 00:38:02.280
So it's it's possible it is very possible to put this on autopilot if you want to.

555
00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:07.980
And so all cover kind of the tips I used to put together a system to do that.

556
00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:14.100
And this is a question I get because a lot of people are drawn like.

557
00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:16.400
Hope I'm in Boston.

558
00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:18.470
This is the money I made this fall on things like that.

559
00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:21.620
And I want to know how that's possible because a lot of people who are being teased are like this is

560
00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:26.690
way too active and a lot of people have guides I've read they say like you can't be passive.

561
00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:31.670
OK well it can be passive and there are some things that make it more passive and if you really want

562
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:33.770
to go to the extreme you can make it Foliott

563
00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:38.250
so it never will.

564
00:38:38.250 --> 00:38:40.960
I'm heiling incident.

565
00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:45.810
Using a serve you don't have V-A is it's a virtual assistant.

566
00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:50.460
When I say compile incident list I'm I'm such a nerd but this is what I thought I.

567
00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:56.880
And this is one of the things that hosts and new hosts is a huge gap of information.

568
00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:02.100
A lot of you hoes just don't know this but for people who've been Hosain haven't been around the block

569
00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:03.670
for a while.

570
00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:10.410
We know that like 99 percent of the interactions we have with our guests are the mandatory interactions

571
00:39:10.410 --> 00:39:14.950
we have with our guests really only fall into like maybe 10 different categories.

572
00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:19.010
I mean I what I literally did as I started taking an incident.

573
00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:25.580
Every time I was message about something I took a note of what it was about and then I wrote a response

574
00:39:26.010 --> 00:39:27.450
and I made a template.

575
00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:35.130
And after about a year and about 150 guests or whatever I had come together with a with a list that

576
00:39:35.130 --> 00:39:37.100
I was pretty happy with.

577
00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:44.490
I thought covered pretty much anything and that gave me a really good idea of what exactly goes wrong

578
00:39:44.490 --> 00:39:48.900
in my apartment so I can address them see if I can get a permanent exit number pops up again or what

579
00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:51.070
are the things that are just always going to pop up.

580
00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:52.900
And so I always need to be able to address them.

581
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.220
And are any of these things that like require me to be in person.

582
00:39:56.370 --> 00:40:00.930
And that's the end goal you want to get to the point where none of these incidents require that you

583
00:40:00.930 --> 00:40:02.330
be there in person.

584
00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:07.230
Now the second part of this the one two punch is you can use virtual assistants who are not familiar

585
00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:07.620
with that.

586
00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:14.130
There's a lot of people you can hire on line who can use these templates use these directions and do

587
00:40:14.130 --> 00:40:15.660
responses for you.

588
00:40:15.690 --> 00:40:22.440
This is a great way also of being able to maximize your response rate while you sleep too.

589
00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:26.790
If someone from Europe is trying to book your place you can't respond if you're sleep but a virtual

590
00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:27.820
assistant can.

591
00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:34.740
But what you can use them for primarily is that they look for incidents they look for a message they

592
00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:40.080
get a message and you pay them per incident and you give them a template and they know and you can train

593
00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:41.480
them very very quickly.

594
00:40:41.570 --> 00:40:45.650
Do you understand when something's different or something's popped up they've never seen before.

595
00:40:46.690 --> 00:40:53.130
And so you are very multifaceted I mean and when I take a virtual system honestly it could be someone

596
00:40:53.130 --> 00:40:56.230
who lives in your area who wants to do it who's always changed their phone.

597
00:40:56.430 --> 00:41:01.870
It could be someone in the Philippines who is available 16 hours a day.

598
00:41:01.890 --> 00:41:09.750
There's a lot of different things you can use I typically use things like oDesk and there's a lot of

599
00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:17.940
other firms that I suggest in the course that are are very useful and are kind of primed for this but

600
00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:23.160
it's not going to take a large amount of time but once you have enough experience to know what the students

601
00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:28.680
are very easily you can pass this over to an automated system where someone could send templates and

602
00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:35.190
that and these kind of if there is a problem it essentially fixes 90 percent of it at a time until you

603
00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:35.970
can respond.

604
00:41:39.130 --> 00:41:44.510
So number two guy I know tourers guidebooks.

605
00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:45.910
Wow.

606
00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:51.030
These these are absolutely insane and this is probably what you might have heard this before is because

607
00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:55.910
it's such an amazing pack of guidebooks.

608
00:41:56.050 --> 00:42:02.050
So what I mean by this is every time someone shows up to your place they are number one interested in

609
00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:03.850
how your space works.

610
00:42:04.770 --> 00:42:09.330
And number two interested in what there is to do around the area.

611
00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:16.050
Now I know for a while you guys probably have like a script in your head but you've gone through right

612
00:42:16.050 --> 00:42:17.260
with every single guest.

613
00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:21.230
I literally got to the point where I was like I had memorized my script every time I was checking in

614
00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:22.070
aghast.

615
00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:26.970
I don't even like the same suggestions and the same like punch lines and stuff.

616
00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:30.220
But you guys know exactly what people ask.

617
00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:31.840
You know what you know.

618
00:42:31.850 --> 00:42:38.100
Good restaurants there are you know what trips are worth doing and what trips are not worth doing right.

619
00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:41.210
These are things you can compile into a guidebook.

620
00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:47.160
Now when I say Guide typically people's eyes glaze over and they're like I don't want to create some

621
00:42:47.310 --> 00:42:49.530
high production value booklet.

622
00:42:49.590 --> 00:42:53.940
I'm not a publisher I'm not a Kindle master.

623
00:42:54.270 --> 00:42:56.850
And actually it's very very simple.

624
00:42:57.330 --> 00:43:02.190
What you can do and this is the way that I do it and I always suggest doing it is there are quite literally

625
00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:12.030
phone applications out there that you can create professional bound beautiful guidebooks for like $20

626
00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:14.340
and you can make them on your phone.

627
00:43:14.610 --> 00:43:15.980
That's how simple they are.

628
00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:21.360
And honestly that the template I always use is you use a photograph from your space or from your area

629
00:43:21.570 --> 00:43:28.980
you import it imported in and put ones that INS It looks so you know like eek and minimalistic.

630
00:43:29.070 --> 00:43:31.720
You're just saving yourself tons of time.

631
00:43:31.890 --> 00:43:33.640
What you do is you can compile those.

632
00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:38.740
Right when I did this I didn't realize at first that there are these mobile applications or I did find

633
00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:39.950
them.

634
00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:46.810
I miss them and like every time someone would like ask a question or give them a new advice or new or

635
00:43:46.810 --> 00:43:51.400
I want to get feedback and they say oh that restaurant was blank you know all import that into the guidebook

636
00:43:51.730 --> 00:43:55.250
and then literally like every three months I just reprint it.

637
00:43:55.620 --> 00:44:00.820
And after like six months I basically had enough information that I could print off a guidebook in that

638
00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:04.880
guidebook and answered all sorts of questions like you know how do you turn on the heat.

639
00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:07.120
How do you operate the oven.

640
00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:11.470
Does the door lock ought to be all of the things that people ask me.

641
00:44:11.530 --> 00:44:15.200
And I was that thing I could just go back through my incident list and look at all the things that people

642
00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:18.590
asked me and I put those together into a guide.

643
00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:22.780
Honestly 30 minutes 45 minutes go and read them all down.

644
00:44:22.930 --> 00:44:25.290
And I present an offer of a direct to my door.

645
00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:26.530
Those are fantastic.

646
00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:29.960
Those honestly will reduce your management time.

647
00:44:30.070 --> 00:44:38.770
70 percent of the time video tours this is another thing that can really be helpful.

648
00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:40.470
No one does them it's amazing.

649
00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:44.080
It just blows my mind what a video tour is.

650
00:44:44.310 --> 00:44:49.920
When you book when a book or even as a incentive to get people books you can take a video tour of your

651
00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:54.930
space just walk around film it talk about things and you can do the right things and you do one try

652
00:44:54.930 --> 00:44:58.230
to sell them on the property where you could do another one which basically shows them how to acquaint

653
00:44:58.230 --> 00:44:58.730
themselves.

654
00:44:58.740 --> 00:44:59.340
Right.

655
00:44:59.370 --> 00:45:01.650
I'm walking up to the door this is where I turn the key.

656
00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:03.650
This is you know this is this room this is this room.

657
00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:07.100
Here's the heat here's where I find the pots and pans.

658
00:45:07.170 --> 00:45:08.250
This is what I do with trash.

659
00:45:08.250 --> 00:45:08.740
Right.

660
00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:15.080
And if you do that not only does it make them ten times more comfortable but your space in booking your

661
00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:20.510
space but it reduces the amount of questions they have for you just considerably.

662
00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:20.860
Right.

663
00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:27.530
Because a lot of people you get are older or they just are not new to this whole thing that they were

664
00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:31.900
literally a video they can watch you vignette that's immensely helpful.

665
00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:38.510
And I know the kickback is always like oh but if I make a video I can tell that it's low quality and

666
00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:44.070
no one will want to book with me and I'm telling you right now you don't need to be Steven Spielberg.

667
00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:46.080
People are going to look at you listening.

668
00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:50.020
They're going to see fantastic photos and it's always a positive.

669
00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:56.870
If you have a video tour regardless whether you shot it on GoPro or an iPhone or a calculator like it

670
00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:58.180
just doesn't matter.

671
00:45:58.190 --> 00:46:04.970
Being able to show them that level of being a personalization and that level of this is real what you're

672
00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:07.650
coming to Israel because everyone has anxiety and they show up.

673
00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:07.940
Right.

674
00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:10.060
Like what does thing doesn't isn't there.

675
00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:11.150
I don't even find it.

676
00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:12.670
Like what if I can't find the key.

677
00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:14.670
Where's the host kind of things like that.

678
00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:20.990
You can kill all those anxieties and make it such that they can their to be a lot more autonomous.

679
00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:22.820
They can figure out things right.

680
00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:28.400
And also I know a lot more experience house near one of the biggest problems is our guests who have

681
00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:29.050
a problem.

682
00:46:29.050 --> 00:46:31.760
Don't mention it and then they put it on your review video.

683
00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:33.150
Tourists get rid of that.

684
00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:34.280
A lot of that right.

685
00:46:34.310 --> 00:46:36.340
Because you can cover anything.

686
00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:44.300
Number theory the repeatable Oh it's nothing left.

687
00:46:44.530 --> 00:46:48.860
This is of the ones that I kind of experimented with and I just tested it just to death.

688
00:46:48.970 --> 00:46:55.640
All like favorite things you could do what it is is it when if you're experiment with this you have

689
00:46:55.650 --> 00:46:59.230
gas and you give them a gift.

690
00:46:59.450 --> 00:47:00.920
It's always something right.

691
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:03.770
Aren't they always ecstatic.

692
00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:04.750
They're always happy.

693
00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:09.200
It's it's amazing and it doesn't matter what you give them it's the fact that you gave them a gift it

694
00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:11.850
makes such a difference in their experience.

695
00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:14.920
All of a sudden it's like yes this is the reason why book LBB.

696
00:47:15.070 --> 00:47:15.850
Yeah.

697
00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:22.830
Although the reviews were for I call this it's an experience smoother.

698
00:47:22.890 --> 00:47:27.200
And the reason why I put this into automation is because it's one of the things that you can deploy.

699
00:47:27.450 --> 00:47:33.570
And if you deploy it consistently It's always something that will minimize the amount of complaints

700
00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:39.080
or issues that you have it's always something I mean I've had people have issues and then you get a

701
00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:44.330
gift and all of a sudden they just it's just like water under the bridge right now the reason why I

702
00:47:44.330 --> 00:47:44.710
call it.

703
00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:45.490
Oh it's nothing.

704
00:47:45.490 --> 00:47:49.910
And why say it's repeatable is because what you can do is you can find and put together some kind of

705
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:56.180
a gift package something that has personality so that everybody likes and you can try to minimize the

706
00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:59.530
cost and then buy in bulk and give it to everyone.

707
00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:03.770
I know this sounds like mass manufactured but I mean not really.

708
00:48:03.770 --> 00:48:09.230
I mean if you're focusing on maximizing their guest experience then this is not actually a bad thing.

709
00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:14.900
I mean it's something that really does whiten there it automatically improves their mood.

710
00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:22.370
Even so I don't give you an example what I do I give a bottle of wine and I give some chocolates.

711
00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:28.720
Now the reason I picked those two is because while one reason everybody like chocolate and if they don't

712
00:48:28.730 --> 00:48:31.110
like chocolate they like wine.

713
00:48:31.590 --> 00:48:35.720
Unless you get some like super religious couple that can't drink.

714
00:48:35.930 --> 00:48:38.660
And they brought their dogs so they're afraid of opening the chocolate.

715
00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:41.380
They're really like outside kids but they always love that does it.

716
00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:43.120
That's a very good guess right.

717
00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:47.690
And even if like the 15 percent of people who don't use the either one of that you still get the boost

718
00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:51.590
the bonus rate of something like the sky's really the souces right.

719
00:48:52.010 --> 00:48:54.450
And then I added some personalization to it.

720
00:48:54.530 --> 00:48:59.520
So I live in San Francisco and we're right around Napa Valley and Sonoma Valley.

721
00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:05.690
And so what I did was I bought my favorite wine and it comes to an area called low dog valley low down

722
00:49:05.690 --> 00:49:06.110
valley.

723
00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:11.820
It is like the I know the younger sister to Sonoma and Napa.

724
00:49:11.830 --> 00:49:14.860
I don't want to call it the ugly little sister because I think it's pretty but it's not always pretty.

725
00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:15.630
The other.

726
00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:18.500
And I got them is a bottle of wine that I love it's the Zinfandel.

727
00:49:18.530 --> 00:49:20.500
And I always put this note right.

728
00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:27.490
Like everybody gums for Napa Valley but they don't know that Lodi Valley is much better and cheaper.

729
00:49:27.790 --> 00:49:32.870
And so I put that and like all of a sudden it's like oh wow this this guy is local.

730
00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:34.240
He knows what's up.

731
00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:36.240
And he gave us the lowdown.

732
00:49:36.410 --> 00:49:42.210
What a great personable like localized gift.

733
00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:44.870
Let me get specific to the areas that are there experience.

734
00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:49.850
And also people all the time say like oh you know like we're just so crammed for time we never get to

735
00:49:49.850 --> 00:49:50.810
vacation.

736
00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:55.070
And we just it really was terrible that we couldn't go see Napa Valley.

737
00:49:55.070 --> 00:50:00.560
But the fact that we got to drink it's unfindable from the area and from an era you say is better.

738
00:50:00.590 --> 00:50:01.560
That just made it up to them.

739
00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:01.900
Right.

740
00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:08.470
It's like it you have to go now I want to chocolate's I live right next to your deli Ghirardelli Square.

741
00:50:08.510 --> 00:50:13.640
I'm not originally from San Francisco so I'm pronouncing that wrong I'm sorry I'm from Kansas and I

742
00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:14.560
live right down the street from it.

743
00:50:14.570 --> 00:50:19.130
They have these little squares here of Ghirardelli Square is that everybody likes and they're very I

744
00:50:19.130 --> 00:50:24.030
caught a lot in common see the Ghirardelli Square.

745
00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:26.330
Literally like what I started doing.

746
00:50:26.330 --> 00:50:27.780
How would you go down there.

747
00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:31.870
And this was kind of boring and they had these people handing out free squares.

748
00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:37.280
And I would just walk past them and just walk in circles until I had like 10 to 15 of them and then

749
00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:38.770
I'd go and put them in a band.

750
00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:41.730
And I put them in all nice 10 and give them to the guests.

751
00:50:41.810 --> 00:50:43.110
They love that right.

752
00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:45.540
Everybody loves chocolate.

753
00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:47.270
Like oh something went wrong.

754
00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:54.770
He broke but I have chocolate and that's kind of like the response you see it's a it's experience smoother.

755
00:50:54.770 --> 00:50:58.930
And then obviously when I started doing it buying in bulk and I both got it reasonable and that and

756
00:50:58.970 --> 00:51:05.660
that's you know I it's like a $7 gift for me like that wine plus the chocolates in it being like 750

757
00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:06.320
or something like that.

758
00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:12.170
So literally when I book someone I like factor that into my costs like oh they booked it for you know

759
00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:13.180
$300 a night.

760
00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:17.020
Well it's more like 293 because I got to give them the oh it's nothing.

761
00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:18.560
Yes.

762
00:51:18.580 --> 00:51:23.280
So that's one of those things and then my course talk about how you can figure out what's a good gift

763
00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:24.830
for your area.

764
00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:27.330
How do you find ways of getting it cheaply and repeatable.

765
00:51:29.210 --> 00:51:35.110
Number four check out times and buffer zones check out times while when you first start listing everything

766
00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:40.850
be it's very important that you try to be flexible and you check out times because again remember we're

767
00:51:40.850 --> 00:51:45.920
sitting at a disadvantage you shouldn't have minimum days and you shouldn't have check out and check

768
00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:53.180
in times because you want to capture as many people as possible because you want to get the bookings

769
00:51:53.570 --> 00:51:58.430
on your system and get that search credit so that you can actually start getting serious amounts of

770
00:51:58.430 --> 00:52:00.660
inquiries.

771
00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:04.880
But once you start to automate this and once you have a little bit of experience or a little bit of

772
00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:09.920
social proof interview base then you want to start actually enforcing your check in and check out times.

773
00:52:10.010 --> 00:52:11.350
That's really important.

774
00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:16.730
If you try to travel abroad with flexible check in and check out it's not going to it's not going to

775
00:52:16.730 --> 00:52:19.540
work when I have flexible check in and check out.

776
00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:22.540
It was literally seven deep for the management.

777
00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:28.410
I had to deal because literally that's only like my check out to let me get to the other guest.

778
00:52:28.570 --> 00:52:32.830
Now I checked the other guess I'm than now.

779
00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:34.390
And then I got to second guess.

780
00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:38.210
Then say no actually can I check in early and then I to like figure out who wins in the check.

781
00:52:38.210 --> 00:52:41.480
It's just it's not worth it if you tell them upfront what it is.

782
00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:42.560
They know when they have to be out.

783
00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:46.360
They know that they can be in makes it that much easier.

784
00:52:47.150 --> 00:52:53.930
Buffer zones then are incredibly important too because you need to figure out how many things have to

785
00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:56.440
change in between things.

786
00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:57.760
And how long is that going to take.

787
00:52:57.770 --> 00:53:01.010
And always give yourself more time buffer buffer buffer.

788
00:53:01.010 --> 00:53:05.240
I mean like you might think oh it's terrible that someone has to check in after 3:00 p.m..

789
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:12.350
Well I mean that's much better than your cleaner is late 45 minutes or late an hour or sick and you

790
00:53:12.350 --> 00:53:14.220
have to scramble to get it clean.

791
00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:19.810
They show up and it's dirty much better scenario where they just know that they can't come through.

792
00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:25.110
And like you know show them ways places to drop off their bags don't let them drop off the bags to Michaels.

793
00:53:25.490 --> 00:53:29.660
So those are really important if you want to keep your sanity and you want to keep the trains moving

794
00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:30.650
on time.

795
00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:34.910
And if you have those honestly then it's just like all of a sudden the check out check in.

796
00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:36.590
It's a nonevent.

797
00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:46.630
Number five this is a mental exercise that I would suggest to host to do try to identify all of your

798
00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:48.080
moving parts.

799
00:53:48.130 --> 00:53:49.410
And now what do I mean by that.

800
00:53:49.410 --> 00:53:53.590
Try to identify all the things in your apartment that have to change from listing to listing or from

801
00:53:53.590 --> 00:53:58.320
booking the bookings or what has to move in order to satisfy the next booking.

802
00:53:58.440 --> 00:53:58.960
OK.

803
00:53:59.020 --> 00:54:01.520
Chances are you have to wash the sheets right.

804
00:54:01.610 --> 00:54:03.750
You need fresh towels.

805
00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:05.940
In my case I have to swap the keys out if you.

806
00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:12.230
The next question I have to give my parking pass to the next person you have to.

807
00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:18.100
There's a lot of things that you you would be surprised that you have to kind of catalog in your head

808
00:54:18.220 --> 00:54:19.400
about what's in a change.

809
00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:20.010
OK.

810
00:54:20.110 --> 00:54:24.640
And once you've identified all those moving parts it makes it so much simpler because in my case like

811
00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:27.380
I really only have four things I guess it's Lenins.

812
00:54:27.690 --> 00:54:33.820
It's the gift and it's the sum of the things that the check that the cleaner has to do.

813
00:54:33.850 --> 00:54:40.670
Does that mean that I actually listed those out and realize that's the only thing that actually has

814
00:54:40.670 --> 00:54:47.910
to change became a lot easier for me understand how it made it because that's all that I have to address.

815
00:54:47.930 --> 00:54:52.130
So all I have to do is kind of the system for making sure that each one of those things was in the right

816
00:54:52.130 --> 00:54:55.390
spot and if it wasn't how to find out how to get it and the next person.

817
00:54:55.430 --> 00:54:59.840
So once you can boil that down then you know what the moving parts are and then you can incorporate

818
00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:06.410
those into your buffer zones and incorporate those into the system that you built into how you train

819
00:55:06.410 --> 00:55:11.810
your cleaner or what you tell them how you do this because they know what to focus on.

820
00:55:11.810 --> 00:55:13.170
And it just gives you peace of mind.

821
00:55:16.330 --> 00:55:17.010
OK.

822
00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:27.300
So the other question that Jim wanted me to go on chip here and I'll be honest this is a question.

823
00:55:27.310 --> 00:55:30.030
I mean I get this all the time.

824
00:55:30.130 --> 00:55:35.020
My course has thirty five hundred people in it.

825
00:55:35.290 --> 00:55:38.400
And this is a question that I get frequently.

826
00:55:38.620 --> 00:55:43.210
Matt there's one thing I need to understand and our perspective hosts are probably like peeking their

827
00:55:43.210 --> 00:55:49.690
ears right now thinking like oh yes this is the number one question preventing me from hosting what

828
00:55:49.690 --> 00:55:56.440
you don't understand is that the only people who ask this question Are prospective hosts the people

829
00:55:56.560 --> 00:56:00.470
who have hosted once never asked this question again.

830
00:56:00.670 --> 00:56:03.970
I've never had someone host and then ask me this question.

831
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:05.480
It's because it is just so.

832
00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:09.520
Once you do it it's like oh it's just not.

833
00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:11.540
It's so much simpler than you think.

834
00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:13.970
It's not as big of a deal as you think.

835
00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:18.420
But there are ways of minimizing the anxiety around it.

836
00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:23.570
I mean a lot of people do you have any anxiety about how they keep their space secure.

837
00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:26.430
What happens if something gets broken whenever something disappears.

838
00:56:26.460 --> 00:56:27.020
OK.

839
00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:32.400
So I compiled some tips for at least giving you peace of mind and how I tackle the problem.

840
00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:37.690
So number one you need to understand that the host guarantee works.

841
00:56:37.690 --> 00:56:41.460
This is usually kind of the Corker in this conversation.

842
00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:55.120
So we will give you up to a million dollars in damage rectification as an insurance policy that as long

843
00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:58.590
as you have hosted with Air B and B they're going to give you.

844
00:56:58.750 --> 00:56:59.530
OK.

845
00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:04.840
And a lot of people don't are saying what this covers and I'll be honest it's not something that like

846
00:57:04.850 --> 00:57:10.600
tons of people know intimate details about because how often do you even have to use it.

847
00:57:10.610 --> 00:57:16.040
I have the luxury of knowing these things because I have multiple properties and I have thousands of

848
00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:17.330
students.

849
00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:20.260
They cover everything you could think of.

850
00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:31.040
I mean they cover fast fire damage damage to anything really your walls pay outs for white noise.

851
00:57:31.130 --> 00:57:33.650
I mean they don't cover if a meteor hits your place.

852
00:57:33.650 --> 00:57:34.180
Right.

853
00:57:34.430 --> 00:57:36.840
But your homeowner's insurance won't cover that anyway.

854
00:57:37.210 --> 00:57:40.560
Did you notice that like what are the things that you're worried about happening.

855
00:57:40.730 --> 00:57:42.590
Is it them feeling something from you.

856
00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:43.200
OK.

857
00:57:43.220 --> 00:57:45.310
Well that's covered in the host guarantee.

858
00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:47.810
So give me the money the outback.

859
00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:49.090
You heard about damage.

860
00:57:49.130 --> 00:57:53.360
Ok well as you know the covers that nearly done has to be a concern as if your house is over a million

861
00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:53.980
dollars.

862
00:57:54.050 --> 00:57:57.980
Right then it's the potential of that burnt down your house.

863
00:57:57.980 --> 00:58:02.870
You only get a million dollars back out of your 10 million dollar house Mitt Romney.

864
00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:09.940
So if you understand how you know this this guarantee works that kind of gets rid of 90 percent of the

865
00:58:10.290 --> 00:58:16.720
issues here they cover really anything and evidently is a very good company to work with.

866
00:58:16.740 --> 00:58:18.350
They are very understanding.

867
00:58:18.350 --> 00:58:21.810
They are very helpful and they're not out here to make a margin.

868
00:58:21.980 --> 00:58:28.940
They're not like you know say another sharing economy companies like Uber who apparently has different

869
00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:30.010
incentives.

870
00:58:30.140 --> 00:58:31.970
Every reason they're very good about this.

871
00:58:32.030 --> 00:58:35.650
Honestly I mean they have they always rectify the situation.

872
00:58:35.690 --> 00:58:37.710
They get a lot of flack for what happens.

873
00:58:37.790 --> 00:58:42.060
You know in the press but if you also reading between the lines they're always there.

874
00:58:42.080 --> 00:58:47.100
I mean they've gone above and beyond to help people in bad situations.

875
00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:51.900
It's just the press honestly does not does not always give them a fair representation.

876
00:58:54.780 --> 00:58:58.050
So number two you need a lot of your space.

877
00:58:58.090 --> 00:59:00.830
That's something that every host has to do.

878
00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:05.250
I mean you just understand that if your guest you're putting a space you don't want to come into a space

879
00:59:05.250 --> 00:59:07.910
that has pictures of your family everywhere.

880
00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:13.170
The soccer photos or you know your poster of your favorite band from when you're in sixth grade and

881
00:59:13.170 --> 00:59:14.630
things like that.

882
00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:19.380
And that's a sacrifice that you have to make people when you list you need to make it a little less

883
00:59:19.380 --> 00:59:23.970
personal lives because it's just kind of weird and you like take over someone's life and you're sitting

884
00:59:23.970 --> 00:59:25.440
in their living room.

885
00:59:25.570 --> 00:59:28.190
So you you know you've taken over their bodies.

886
00:59:28.830 --> 00:59:33.830
But one of the things he knew to do and it's just standard practice you needed your space.

887
00:59:33.830 --> 00:59:39.030
And so when you do that you'll make an identification list of things that would be valuable to you if

888
00:59:39.030 --> 00:59:41.070
you had a book say lost it.

889
00:59:41.310 --> 00:59:46.980
I always say move that to the side honestly and you might think like that doesn't solve the problem

890
00:59:46.980 --> 00:59:48.480
you just kicking the can down the road.

891
00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:53.790
But the problem isn't that the steps are going to get stolen is the fact that you have anxiety about

892
00:59:53.790 --> 00:59:58.970
it because I can cover all the reasons why the anxiety is not logical.

893
59:58.970 --> 1:00:03.360
I mean it's reasonable that it's not logical but if you move to the side say well you take all your

894
1:00:03.360 --> 1:00:05.700
valuable stuff and you put it in one closet.

895
1:00:05.730 --> 1:00:07.630
It's much easier to mentally manage.

896
1:00:07.740 --> 1:00:11.300
You can think to yourself oh this one room and it's locked away.

897
1:00:11.310 --> 1:00:12.510
No one can ever access that.

898
1:00:12.510 --> 1:00:14.660
It's got all my stuff where I have this closet.

899
1:00:14.670 --> 1:00:15.900
Everything is in that closet.

900
1:00:16.170 --> 1:00:21.660
And they don't have that worry like oh maybe someone's going to accidentally stumble upon my stash of

901
1:00:21.660 --> 1:00:22.380
treasure.

902
1:00:22.450 --> 1:00:23.690
Right.

903
1:00:23.770 --> 1:00:26.180
And honestly this isn't really a huge problem.

904
1:00:26.190 --> 1:00:31.380
You're like Scrooge McDuck and you just stored gold coins everywhere and you've lost track of all of

905
1:00:31.380 --> 1:00:31.760
them.

906
1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:36.200
Use it all say for small items.

907
1:00:36.290 --> 1:00:42.930
So the big the the one point you'll get me to agree with you on whether if there's a security issue

908
1:00:42.930 --> 1:00:48.320
with there have to be is the small items thing and I'm going to talk about the next point a little bit

909
1:00:48.320 --> 1:00:48.670
more.

910
1:00:48.710 --> 1:00:54.740
But one of the ways that you can help with small items is you know some small items can have very high

911
1:00:54.740 --> 1:00:57.250
value like your phone like your jewelry.

912
1:00:57.350 --> 1:01:04.430
You know all the mementos are your you know your your grandparents World War Two miles as you can get

913
1:01:04.430 --> 1:01:06.200
a small safe and put those in a safe.

914
1:01:06.230 --> 1:01:08.810
And these are surprisingly cheap.

915
1:01:08.990 --> 1:01:13.790
You can get one to Ace Hardware or whatever hardware store you're near for cheap but you get them on

916
1:01:13.790 --> 1:01:18.110
Amazon honestly and they're even with shipping that's like $40.

917
1:01:18.110 --> 1:01:23.570
It can be a small save with a button that you press and then you open it up and it can fit in more than

918
1:01:23.570 --> 1:01:24.900
you'll ever need.

919
1:01:25.680 --> 1:01:30.340
So you don't need like a gunmetal safe to store all your stuff.

920
1:01:30.960 --> 1:01:36.080
But you can at least feel safer about the small items because you can you can put them away.

921
1:01:36.380 --> 1:01:39.990
And these are assuming these are things like you never bring with you or maybe if you're hosting a shared

922
1:01:39.990 --> 1:01:44.860
space so you can leave the house they're carrying everything you own on you.

923
1:01:45.170 --> 1:01:45.410
OK.

924
1:01:45.420 --> 1:01:47.850
So this brings me to my other point.

925
1:01:48.030 --> 1:01:52.400
This is the way that the most effective way that I tackle the problem.

926
1:01:52.410 --> 1:02:02.220
The biggest issue with security would be is there could potentially be small items that are stolen that

927
1:02:02.220 --> 1:02:03.780
you do not realize.

928
1:02:03.900 --> 1:02:04.570
Right.

929
1:02:04.590 --> 1:02:06.520
That's the insidious problem right.

930
1:02:06.570 --> 1:02:09.840
It's not a problem of my TV is missing.

931
1:02:10.020 --> 1:02:11.980
Like they stole my computer.

932
1:02:12.060 --> 1:02:13.200
It's an issue of.

933
1:02:13.260 --> 1:02:15.100
They swiped my iPad.

934
1:02:15.220 --> 1:02:15.880
Where are they.

935
1:02:15.900 --> 1:02:21.150
You know something small and valuable is missing and what can happen.

936
1:02:21.150 --> 1:02:24.660
And this is where it becomes a problem is if say a back to back bookings.

937
1:02:24.680 --> 1:02:30.230
What if you don't realize something's gone until five bookings later because of this item when you don't

938
1:02:30.240 --> 1:02:32.180
see it every time you walk into the room.

939
1:02:32.430 --> 1:02:35.430
So what exactly do you do.

940
1:02:35.600 --> 1:02:36.870
There's the way that I did it.

941
1:02:36.940 --> 1:02:38.110
And it's very effective.

942
1:02:38.250 --> 1:02:43.620
You have when you have your cleaner come the first thing they do is they have a checklist.

943
1:02:43.620 --> 1:02:49.440
They go through your space and they look for all of the things that you have said are very valuable

944
1:02:49.440 --> 1:02:52.020
to you and they make sure that they're there.

945
1:02:52.050 --> 1:02:58.030
They literally go and physically you know identify it and confirm that it's there.

946
1:02:58.140 --> 1:03:00.900
And I always have my cleaners do videos too.

947
1:03:00.900 --> 1:03:05.340
That also helps with any damage claims they can show videos of it because you know if your screeners

948
1:03:05.340 --> 1:03:09.450
know exactly what you're talking about but after a couple times and know exactly what it is and you

949
1:03:09.450 --> 1:03:11.490
can watch the videos my cleaner they're hilarious.

950
1:03:11.490 --> 1:03:13.000
It's always like that.

951
1:03:13.020 --> 1:03:13.450
Yes.

952
1:03:13.470 --> 1:03:16.100
Your computer is still here.

953
1:03:16.500 --> 1:03:17.220
Yes.

954
1:03:17.360 --> 1:03:20.590
Your TV is still on the wall.

955
1:03:20.790 --> 1:03:22.040
But if I didn't have that.

956
1:03:22.050 --> 1:03:26.130
Honestly if something disappeared I would have no idea who did it.

957
1:03:26.220 --> 1:03:31.470
And that is as good as gone and there being be Unfortunately I don't know if they would cover that because

958
1:03:31.470 --> 1:03:32.660
it's like oh it's gone.

959
1:03:32.670 --> 1:03:34.010
I don't know who took it.

960
1:03:34.050 --> 1:03:36.880
I don't know when it was gone but trust me it was here.

961
1:03:37.750 --> 1:03:40.710
So you want to avoid any kind of gray area.

962
1:03:40.750 --> 1:03:41.520
That's how you do it.

963
1:03:41.530 --> 1:03:43.070
That's how you know every single thing there.

964
1:03:43.090 --> 1:03:47.570
And if it is gone then you know how to use the guarantee.

965
1:03:47.650 --> 1:03:50.460
And you know you use your security deposit.

966
1:03:50.560 --> 1:03:53.830
And also you know honestly there's one thing I always think about if you have something that is like

967
1:03:53.830 --> 1:04:00.130
value lists like Memento if family heirlooms that is something you might consider using save putting

968
1:04:00.130 --> 1:04:00.730
in a safe.

969
1:04:00.790 --> 1:04:03.610
Or if you can't put it in storage just there are things just in case.

970
1:04:03.610 --> 1:04:03.880
Right.

971
1:04:03.880 --> 1:04:09.850
Because even if it really can give you tons of money for it is it really good to make up for it.

972
1:04:10.030 --> 1:04:16.830
So if you do have items like that then I think it is worthwhile thinking about ways of moving those

973
1:04:17.140 --> 1:04:23.470
or securing.

974
1:04:23.790 --> 1:04:24.670
So this is one thing.

975
1:04:24.690 --> 1:04:27.330
A lot of people don't realize it's going to shock me.

976
1:04:27.330 --> 1:04:29.440
They learn things every week.

977
1:04:29.620 --> 1:04:31.150
This like a couple weeks ago.

978
1:04:31.320 --> 1:04:37.590
If you really wanted to you could get extra insurance like vacation rental insurance and it is not very

979
1:04:37.590 --> 1:04:38.670
expensive.

980
1:04:38.670 --> 1:04:45.150
I like my you know my apartment is probably worth like because of San Francisco like a million dollars

981
1:04:45.780 --> 1:04:47.300
if I wanted to cover every lease.

982
1:04:47.310 --> 1:04:50.100
Million dollar policy cover everything in my building.

983
1:04:50.550 --> 1:04:53.160
I think my quote was like $130 a month.

984
1:04:53.220 --> 1:04:55.390
Like it's really not very expensive.

985
1:04:55.440 --> 1:04:56.450
Right.

986
1:04:56.520 --> 1:05:01.860
And if you own your home a lot of people say oh my home I can get home you know home insurance homeowner's

987
1:05:01.860 --> 1:05:07.290
insurance and well that's a good idea to get additional because it's so cheap right like homeowners

988
1:05:07.290 --> 1:05:10.650
insurance is very cheap on a month to month basis.

989
1:05:10.860 --> 1:05:18.180
That actually I don't usually suggest doing that because a lot of insurance will deny you if you have

990
1:05:18.180 --> 1:05:23.490
stipulations your agreement about renting an air B because they'll see it as a business but look into

991
1:05:23.490 --> 1:05:26.510
extra insurance if it really something that you think is worthwhile.

992
1:05:26.580 --> 1:05:29.790
If your building is more valuable than a million dollars.

993
1:05:29.790 --> 1:05:31.070
Think about this.

994
1:05:31.200 --> 1:05:37.020
Think about using additional insurance Oh and yes.

995
1:05:37.030 --> 1:05:42.870
So what I've been doing with myself for the last like four months I'm sorry I made a course.

996
1:05:42.910 --> 1:05:49.190
And on that course I talked in-depth about every single thing I know about it.

997
1:05:49.360 --> 1:05:54.370
And the reason why I came of this course was because you know at a certain point like I had plateaued

998
1:05:54.370 --> 1:05:59.980
as a host I was just doing really well and I think I had a friend who made online courses he just said

999
1:05:59.980 --> 1:06:04.580
to me like Evan you're the you have thought about Irby league more than anyone had ever met.

1000
1:06:04.780 --> 1:06:10.210
And so it kind of became like an exercise for me because I wanted to make all my horses and some some

1001
1:06:10.210 --> 1:06:12.000
kind of experiment to start with.

1002
1:06:12.100 --> 1:06:17.800
And so I started with aerially and I put everything I knew into it and ended up being like 15 hours

1003
1:06:17.800 --> 1:06:23.690
of content and 118 lectures and I'm adding to it every week as I think of more things.

1004
1:06:24.970 --> 1:06:30.070
And so I put that together and that is something that is a fantastic resource if you guys out there

1005
1:06:30.070 --> 1:06:36.510
want to have a comprehensive understanding of coming a host or replicating my success.

1006
1:06:36.550 --> 1:06:38.950
And honestly the reception I've had is fantastic.

1007
1:06:39.070 --> 1:06:40.400
Like I have 30.

1008
1:06:40.600 --> 1:06:42.080
Thirty four hundred students.

1009
1:06:42.130 --> 1:06:45.770
I have 600 plus discussion threads.

1010
1:06:45.820 --> 1:06:50.080
So there's 600 discussions between hosts about what are the best things to do.

1011
1:06:50.080 --> 1:06:51.160
What has happened.

1012
1:06:51.220 --> 1:06:56.010
What are some of the things they've never thought would happen that happened or what are the best practices.

1013
1:06:56.020 --> 1:06:56.680
Everything like that.

1014
1:06:56.680 --> 1:06:58.940
And honestly I'm on their way.

1015
1:06:58.960 --> 1:07:01.790
I interact my students every single day.

1016
1:07:01.850 --> 1:07:04.030
My average response time is like 30 minutes.

1017
1:07:04.030 --> 1:07:08.070
The responses I give out my phone number to to my students.

1018
1:07:08.200 --> 1:07:12.220
I've had them call me during hosting emergencies and I work with everything.

1019
1:07:12.220 --> 1:07:13.930
One of them because I honestly love doing it.

1020
1:07:13.990 --> 1:07:20.200
It's so it's great for me because like I want to perfect my craft and it always just amazes me how different

1021
1:07:20.200 --> 1:07:24.880
scenario is that can happen and how I can everything I can get better at it.

1022
1:07:24.900 --> 1:07:29.440
But also the thing is that when you start off there's just like no reason that you have to go see that

1023
1:07:29.440 --> 1:07:35.600
trough of sorrow we're trying to figure out everything on your own or say you're a host that just plateau.

1024
1:07:35.650 --> 1:07:39.240
Honestly you can just take my course and learn every single thing.

1025
1:07:39.250 --> 1:07:41.620
I did listen to it on the weekend.

1026
1:07:41.620 --> 1:07:43.430
Implement it that way you can honestly.

1027
1:07:43.450 --> 1:07:47.980
One of the best things I've had throughout this entire course are some of the turnaround stories I've

1028
1:07:47.980 --> 1:07:49.030
had with guests.

1029
1:07:49.090 --> 1:07:53.380
I'm sorry I was out with students like literally this week.

1030
1:07:53.380 --> 1:07:55.150
I have a guy named Brian.

1031
1:07:55.150 --> 1:08:02.380
He's hosting in Nashville Tennessee and he bought my horse and he said to me and Evan I've had my thing

1032
1:08:02.380 --> 1:08:03.760
up for like two weeks.

1033
1:08:03.820 --> 1:08:07.600
I've only been getting a couple inquiries and I haven't made a single booking.

1034
1:08:07.640 --> 1:08:09.930
And over the weekend he took my entire course.

1035
1:08:09.930 --> 1:08:12.480
He listened to it I'm like two x playback or something.

1036
1:08:12.490 --> 1:08:14.360
So he listened to me sounding like a chipmunk.

1037
1:08:14.390 --> 1:08:19.660
Guess I took the entire thing took my listing took all of my tits I literally went to his thing and

1038
1:08:19.660 --> 1:08:25.750
confirmed every single thing he did went to my listening imported it in copy my templates from my descriptions

1039
1:08:25.750 --> 1:08:29.490
like templates for photos like comments everything.

1040
1:08:29.620 --> 1:08:30.990
And he did it.

1041
1:08:31.030 --> 1:08:34.360
So he took the course Saturday Sunday took the changes.

1042
1:08:34.360 --> 1:08:40.560
Posted it on Monday on Tuesday he booked $5000 and so now you go and look at his list.

1043
1:08:40.680 --> 1:08:46.030
It's it's currently like Swiss cheese because he's almost at 60 percent fail rate for the next four

1044
1:08:46.030 --> 1:08:49.950
months and he's and he's charging six hundred dollars a night.

1045
1:08:50.260 --> 1:08:52.740
So it's that's the thing.

1046
1:08:52.740 --> 1:08:57.700
It's like a lot of people they start and they have a horrible beginning and they hit page 8 and they

1047
1:08:57.700 --> 1:09:02.020
give up and honestly and that's why if you look at host there's so many hosts out there who have just

1048
1:09:02.020 --> 1:09:08.590
given up and you know the thing is you can be successful really with any space.

1049
1:09:08.800 --> 1:09:14.290
You know maybe you don't make hundreds of thousands of dollars but you can make it worthwhile and make

1050
1:09:14.290 --> 1:09:16.880
it seriously improve your life.

1051
1:09:17.050 --> 1:09:19.950
And the other thing I said it was I have fifty four or five star reviews.

1052
1:09:19.960 --> 1:09:25.200
I'm holding my breath until someone posts and says Evan you've done a terrible job.

1053
1:09:25.270 --> 1:09:28.060
I want my money back but that's never happened.

1054
1:09:28.060 --> 1:09:32.470
So maybe you can be the first one.

1055
1:09:32.590 --> 1:09:36.270
So yeah that's those are the questions that Jim wanted me to cover.

1056
1:09:36.700 --> 1:09:38.800
And I hope I've done them justice I think.

1057
1:09:38.800 --> 1:09:42.480
Live viewers I'm at your mercy.

1058
1:09:42.580 --> 1:09:44.910
And wow that is a lot.

1059
1:09:44.910 --> 1:09:47.880
A lot of great stuff you just dropped on us right there.

1060
1:09:47.880 --> 1:09:52.350
I think it is with SBB boot camp and the like think this is only a very small small portion of your

1061
1:09:52.350 --> 1:09:52.870
course.

1062
1:09:52.870 --> 1:09:54.540
I hope now that drill sergeant.

1063
1:09:54.540 --> 1:09:56.490
No it was it was amazing.

1064
1:09:56.490 --> 1:10:02.010
I'm sitting here like I'm ready little tips for myself for for I'm for our little business here.

1065
1:10:02.010 --> 1:10:03.690
So it's fantastic.

1066
1:10:03.690 --> 1:10:05.440
Awesome information.

1067
1:10:05.460 --> 1:10:09.500
I like to go over a few questions and then take questions from the audience so.

1068
1:10:09.630 --> 1:10:14.820
Audience do you have any questions you can e-mail them to info learn Air B and B is going to be around

1069
1:10:14.820 --> 1:10:15.570
for a little bit.

1070
1:10:15.570 --> 1:10:19.920
We're going to answer some life questions that I have and then whatever you guys like to contribute

1071
1:10:19.920 --> 1:10:20.880
as well.

1072
1:10:20.910 --> 1:10:23.370
So let's just jump right into them.

1073
1:10:23.490 --> 1:10:27.620
Evan what's been like your most costly mistake as an heir being the hostess you know.

1074
1:10:27.690 --> 1:10:31.530
Was it waiting too long to do a certain thing or to purchase something or you purchase something you

1075
1:10:31.530 --> 1:10:32.820
shouldn't have purchased.

1076
1:10:32.820 --> 1:10:35.730
You know what's been the biggest mistake costing the stakes for you.

1077
1:10:38.220 --> 1:10:38.550
Yeah.

1078
1:10:38.570 --> 1:10:45.520
I mean part of the problem being so testy when I tried a test match at Feigley a bad angry person.

1079
1:10:45.710 --> 1:10:47.600
But I test everything.

1080
1:10:47.660 --> 1:10:49.790
And so a lot of times to test things they don't work.

1081
1:10:49.790 --> 1:10:50.470
That is true.

1082
1:10:50.460 --> 1:10:54.950
Like when I play around with our response rate Oh yeah I left the money on the table so it's kind of

1083
1:10:54.950 --> 1:10:56.640
like my pain is your game.

1084
1:10:56.690 --> 1:10:57.930
This type of situation.

1085
1:10:58.130 --> 1:11:00.860
Yeah I did have lots of situations like that.

1086
1:11:01.190 --> 1:11:07.750
I've developed quite a thick skin towards you know like bad things that have happened.

1087
1:11:07.750 --> 1:11:10.070
Like I think one of them more expensive things.

1088
1:11:10.070 --> 1:11:16.820
I've made mistakes with the like for instance not paying attention to price fluctuations in your area.

1089
1:11:17.060 --> 1:11:23.300
And I've had situations where like people will come and they'll look out the space and they kind of

1090
1:11:23.300 --> 1:11:27.020
have this like attitude like they came from the RBO and I don't know if you guys are familiar with the

1091
1:11:27.020 --> 1:11:31.360
RBO but you booked a place and you don't pay till you show up.

1092
1:11:31.400 --> 1:11:31.960
Right.

1093
1:11:31.960 --> 1:11:32.880
And so I have this thing.

1094
1:11:32.880 --> 1:11:34.690
They show up and they're like me.

1095
1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:37.840
I'd rather pay double for the Hilton or something like that.

1096
1:11:37.840 --> 1:11:38.090
Right.

1097
1:11:38.090 --> 1:11:43.340
Or or the like or the hotel down the street for some reason dropped 80 percent of their price.

1098
1:11:43.460 --> 1:11:45.450
That at any one time.

1099
1:11:45.860 --> 1:11:51.500
So yeah that was one of the things I guess not having my finger on the ball a couple of times had caused

1100
1:11:51.500 --> 1:11:55.170
me some issues and I guess I was more expensive.

1101
1:11:55.600 --> 1:11:58.580
So what are the things I have to think about because I'm sure there's tons of things that have lost

1102
1:11:58.580 --> 1:11:59.230
money.

1103
1:11:59.270 --> 1:12:03.500
It's just like one of those people that I look at the money it deposits and the money that could have

1104
1:12:03.500 --> 1:12:05.150
deposited Yeah.

1105
1:12:05.260 --> 1:12:07.260
And that's good that's a good way to look at your business you know.

1106
1:12:07.260 --> 1:12:07.570
Cheers.

1107
1:12:07.600 --> 1:12:11.540
Buy some more lectures and come without costing mistakes and things that not tests you know obviously

1108
1:12:11.540 --> 1:12:14.290
because you've taken the time to do that.

1109
1:12:15.050 --> 1:12:19.970
And it's great that you know people can sit on your shoulders and really see what is the opportunity

1110
1:12:19.970 --> 1:12:22.540
for an awesome and excellent air being the host.

1111
1:12:22.550 --> 1:12:26.330
Our next question I have is like what's the biggest headache you face as being a remote area in the

1112
1:12:26.330 --> 1:12:30.240
house keys.

1113
1:12:30.390 --> 1:12:35.420
He's the man that has a conversation.

1114
1:12:35.420 --> 1:12:40.790
You do not want to get like a message you do not want to get stranded guests.

1115
1:12:40.940 --> 1:12:44.100
I've had them go out drinking and get locked out.

1116
1:12:44.410 --> 1:12:47.500
And he off the whole family's been locked out before.

1117
1:12:47.630 --> 1:12:56.570
And the reason why this is my my pain point is because my building was built in 1914 and so my locks

1118
1:12:56.630 --> 1:13:00.590
are like straight up like Civil War era.

1119
1:13:00.710 --> 1:13:07.880
They are super old and so there's only like two keys that could open the space.

1120
1:13:08.190 --> 1:13:15.440
And so whenever people ask me like oh how do I automate the swap process.

1121
1:13:15.470 --> 1:13:21.110
I always direct people for some really cool technology that's come out last year.

1122
1:13:21.320 --> 1:13:28.130
There are automatic lock systems which are absolutely kind of blow my mind was a Kickstarter program

1123
1:13:28.390 --> 1:13:30.210
that came out in the locker Tron.

1124
1:13:30.290 --> 1:13:33.120
Another one is called Open Sesame.

1125
1:13:33.170 --> 1:13:38.660
And there's a couple there to go on Amazon and look for electronic locks and what they are are these

1126
1:13:38.660 --> 1:13:41.420
locks that retro fit to the back of your door.

1127
1:13:41.540 --> 1:13:46.480
So if you have a traditional deadbolt or just a traditional door with a tangled nipple the current they

1128
1:13:46.600 --> 1:13:50.560
can literally attach to the back of it and then automate your lock system.

1129
1:13:50.630 --> 1:14:00.260
And the way that they work is they detect when someone is near the door with their phone and that person

1130
1:14:00.260 --> 1:14:05.230
can text message open the door and they can hold their phone up with Bluetooth.

1131
1:14:05.280 --> 1:14:09.780
I think they can if you have an iPhone it uses like that air play Magic.

1132
1:14:09.990 --> 1:14:15.410
And like they like six different ways you can get in the door and ways that you could authorize like

1133
1:14:15.410 --> 1:14:17.930
who you want to let in during what periods of time.

1134
1:14:17.960 --> 1:14:20.360
Also it tells you who comes in who comes out.

1135
1:14:20.420 --> 1:14:24.200
This is a problem for me because my door is so all that they don't make a system.

1136
1:14:24.460 --> 1:14:31.610
It's going to be able to hire people to handle my this like antique door that I have.

1137
1:14:31.840 --> 1:14:37.730
Both people have had really really good success automating that system and it works.

1138
1:14:37.730 --> 1:14:43.880
Honestly like situations where a lot of my guests are out of country and so they don't have a workable

1139
1:14:43.880 --> 1:14:44.440
phone.

1140
1:14:44.540 --> 1:14:50.420
Well they can what you like walk down to the coffee shop and use them like a log in just log into like

1141
1:14:50.450 --> 1:14:54.350
a public computer or anything like that unlock the door as long as they have access to it that you gave

1142
1:14:54.350 --> 1:14:54.610
it to.

1143
1:14:54.620 --> 1:14:55.620
Right.

1144
1:14:55.700 --> 1:15:01.430
Or they can message you in some way contact you and you can remotely let them in.

1145
1:15:01.430 --> 1:15:04.700
So that's a fantastic resource if you can do that for your door.

1146
1:15:04.700 --> 1:15:10.070
Much better than what I did for a year which is like stick the key under the mat which the security

1147
1:15:10.340 --> 1:15:14.300
people that people are worried about security are just like are you holding your breath after I said

1148
1:15:14.300 --> 1:15:18.470
that and I was calling out the smartest thing in the world and it had a lot of problems.

1149
1:15:19.250 --> 1:15:20.580
I was like oh I made it.

1150
1:15:20.710 --> 1:15:23.120
Maybe LOX is going to save a lot of headaches for a lot of people.

1151
1:15:23.120 --> 1:15:27.140
I like that you can track who is coming in and out of your place of how often.

1152
1:15:27.250 --> 1:15:30.160
That's a very good little feature of those things.

1153
1:15:30.200 --> 1:15:35.810
You mentioned the the air bed and the know high quality air bag what are some other really good investments

1154
1:15:35.810 --> 1:15:38.590
that your air B and B unit that really makes you stand out.

1155
1:15:41.280 --> 1:15:46.320
Or if I'm to send it out like what is what is one thing you're glad you put the cash outlay for and

1156
1:15:46.320 --> 1:15:52.410
it's like paid you over 10 times the amount and I read the parking was a fantastic example the parking

1157
1:15:52.410 --> 1:15:57.120
I paid a hundred dollars a month and I can literally quantify the amount of bookings that got me per

1158
1:15:57.120 --> 1:15:57.620
month.

1159
1:15:57.760 --> 1:16:02.350
And it was it was Evely you know 10 x 15 x it's great.

1160
1:16:02.700 --> 1:16:09.970
Yeah I mean there's other things like that like what I started doing was people of this one I got.

1161
1:16:10.050 --> 1:16:14.350
So people go to Alcatraz and Alcatraz.

1162
1:16:14.670 --> 1:16:16.010
You know it's a big icon right.

1163
1:16:16.020 --> 1:16:20.910
Well think about Alcatraz the book's out early so I started doing was like buying tickets in bulk and

1164
1:16:20.910 --> 1:16:24.490
being like hey come here I have the Alcatraz tickets last second.

1165
1:16:24.540 --> 1:16:26.030
So go to Alcatraz right.

1166
1:16:26.100 --> 1:16:28.880
I like a ticket scalper things like that.

1167
1:16:28.890 --> 1:16:29.160
Right.

1168
1:16:29.160 --> 1:16:33.540
Like really like who else can compete with that who cares enough to compete with that.

1169
1:16:33.660 --> 1:16:36.700
Yeah you know mean for sure yeah I mean I.

1170
1:16:36.780 --> 1:16:37.200
Oh man.

1171
1:16:37.260 --> 1:16:41.370
You know disappointing is what people like show up and they're like oh we want to see Alcatraz.

1172
1:16:41.400 --> 1:16:44.630
We didn't realize you had a book at a month in advance.

1173
1:16:44.810 --> 1:16:45.440
Yeah.

1174
1:16:45.540 --> 1:16:47.400
And then all of a sudden you are the hero.

1175
1:16:47.400 --> 1:16:52.170
But yeah things like that like that all augmented on my course or just go over like tons and tons of

1176
1:16:52.170 --> 1:16:54.410
these things you can do are good.

1177
1:16:54.450 --> 1:16:59.090
Those are some good ones because I didn't even think about buying tickets so that's a good idea.

1178
1:16:59.130 --> 1:17:01.380
They do so out sooner or earlier.

1179
1:17:01.380 --> 1:17:05.460
What are your thoughts on using automated pricing or do you prefer to keep it very simple and just have

1180
1:17:05.460 --> 1:17:08.670
maybe three or four prices and just check on special events.

1181
1:17:08.730 --> 1:17:12.300
What are your thoughts on the automated pricing trends that we're seeing nowadays.

1182
1:17:12.300 --> 1:17:12.640
Yeah.

1183
1:17:12.650 --> 1:17:16.740
And it's sort of a lot of these like service tools that are popping up for everybody trying to handle

1184
1:17:16.740 --> 1:17:21.580
cleaning management messaging pricing.

1185
1:17:21.810 --> 1:17:28.100
I am lukewarm on pricing and it's one of the things a lot of my students asked me about like if you

1186
1:17:28.110 --> 1:17:28.830
tried this.

1187
1:17:28.860 --> 1:17:31.140
You know such and such service.

1188
1:17:31.410 --> 1:17:36.290
And the reason why for me is because my personal experience they haven't been particularly helpful.

1189
1:17:36.420 --> 1:17:42.420
So for those who are not aware if you when you log in you're a B B B and B will suggest a price for

1190
1:17:42.420 --> 1:17:47.730
you and b b have a lot of data to work with and for a lot of people they're accurate.

1191
1:17:47.790 --> 1:17:55.320
But when I do it for some reason my $500 night listing that books out a year advance by the way people

1192
1:17:55.320 --> 1:17:59.600
booking like the farthest one is 18 months in advance.

1193
1:17:59.790 --> 1:18:01.700
It tells me to list it like 250.

1194
1:18:01.880 --> 1:18:02.370
Right.

1195
1:18:02.430 --> 1:18:08.160
Because something something is wrong that they're not capturing what the essence is allowing me to book

1196
1:18:08.160 --> 1:18:08.780
more.

1197
1:18:09.090 --> 1:18:12.300
And that is a problem that I've noticed with a lot of the tools out there.

1198
1:18:12.420 --> 1:18:16.160
So a lot of the tools out there to tackle this problem of like what do I price it out.

1199
1:18:16.230 --> 1:18:19.950
And also I mean people don't want to beat their calendar all the time to constantly be fiddling with

1200
1:18:19.950 --> 1:18:20.610
it.

1201
1:18:20.640 --> 1:18:27.720
So it leaves out a lot of these like intangibles that really do make a difference and in your listing

1202
1:18:28.860 --> 1:18:31.700
some of those tools out there they don't really take into consideration reviews.

1203
1:18:31.740 --> 1:18:32.310
Right.

1204
1:18:32.310 --> 1:18:35.790
How do they take into consideration for instance in an phatic review.

1205
1:18:35.790 --> 1:18:40.630
Someone who writes an emphatic review might as well just add $50 to your per night cost.

1206
1:18:40.680 --> 1:18:41.180
Right.

1207
1:18:41.300 --> 1:18:46.320
Yes that is just like one person just had a fantastic view you saved their marriage right.

1208
1:18:46.320 --> 1:18:51.040
How is that tool going to take into consideration that you know how good of a host you are.

1209
1:18:51.150 --> 1:18:56.650
I also didn't really like the fact that like they overly skew towards events.

1210
1:18:56.700 --> 1:18:59.910
So like I am San Francisco it it'll be like heaven.

1211
1:18:59.940 --> 1:19:03.030
You should raise your price 40 percent for outside lands.

1212
1:19:03.210 --> 1:19:03.690
OK.

1213
1:19:03.750 --> 1:19:06.150
First of all I'm not going to charge eight hundred dollars a night.

1214
1:19:06.150 --> 1:19:13.970
And second of all no plans like no one's booking my space for that like that music concert.

1215
1:19:14.310 --> 1:19:18.040
So they're kind of like painting with broad strokes.

1216
1:19:18.040 --> 1:19:23.260
And I understand theoretically how that would make sense and emotion for some people it does.

1217
1:19:23.340 --> 1:19:28.020
It's just not like a perfect solution so it kind of is a wash for me.

1218
1:19:28.020 --> 1:19:33.540
I think also that they're great if you're someone who is like I don't put this up and I want to automate

1219
1:19:33.540 --> 1:19:34.160
everything.

1220
1:19:34.200 --> 1:19:34.740
Right.

1221
1:19:34.740 --> 1:19:36.250
Like I just want it to grow.

1222
1:19:36.480 --> 1:19:37.570
And that's just not who I am.

1223
1:19:37.710 --> 1:19:43.800
You know like I'm the type of person that's like no I'm quite invested in my entire lectures on how

1224
1:19:43.800 --> 1:19:50.670
you can price your calendar correctly and how you can go through and know how to make friends and if

1225
1:19:50.670 --> 1:19:54.870
the listing is open tomorrow lower the price till it looks right.

1226
1:19:54.970 --> 1:19:57.680
Know all those pricing Joels don't do that.

1227
1:19:57.690 --> 1:19:58.650
They actually don't.

1228
1:19:58.650 --> 1:20:04.640
I mean it's like they don't take into consideration that hey an unbooked room has lost money.

1229
1:20:04.980 --> 1:20:05.880
Exactly.

1230
1:20:06.120 --> 1:20:10.640
I think either solvable problems for these tools out there and I think that they're getting a lot better

1231
1:20:10.650 --> 1:20:15.390
and I've seen that like over their iteration cycles as they've come out with new versions are getting

1232
1:20:15.390 --> 1:20:18.480
better and better and better just for me not yet.

1233
1:20:18.600 --> 1:20:22.250
Maybe call me old school ha ha that makes sense and it's narrow.

1234
1:20:22.320 --> 1:20:22.670
It's good.

1235
1:20:22.670 --> 1:20:27.900
It's a system that you have it's a manual it's can be really unbroken if you really know what you're

1236
1:20:27.900 --> 1:20:32.670
doing and if you know it's not as difficult to make it out to be but as you said the automatic pricing

1237
1:20:32.670 --> 1:20:35.980
is good for people that want to quit things and set it and forget it and let it roll.

1238
1:20:36.010 --> 1:20:36.420
Sure.

1239
1:20:36.570 --> 1:20:37.190
Yeah.

1240
1:20:37.350 --> 1:20:41.510
We have a question from one of our viewers Len how do you handle bad reviews.

1241
1:20:41.530 --> 1:20:42.830
You know do you respond to them.

1242
1:20:42.840 --> 1:20:43.710
Do you like.

1243
1:20:43.770 --> 1:20:46.020
Do you get all up in arms you freak out about it.

1244
1:20:46.020 --> 1:20:47.610
What do you do when you have a bad review.

1245
1:20:47.610 --> 1:20:49.860
I mean I'm sure you haven't had one or.

1246
1:20:50.030 --> 1:20:53.550
And you know you know fueling questions from your course.

1247
1:20:53.550 --> 1:20:54.660
People have had bad reviews.

1248
1:20:54.660 --> 1:20:56.920
What advice do you give to people who have bad reviews.

1249
1:20:57.150 --> 1:21:01.330
After I'm done like squaring off or be for ever.

1250
1:21:01.710 --> 1:21:02.830
No it's happened to me.

1251
1:21:02.940 --> 1:21:04.320
Honestly I'm not an angel.

1252
1:21:04.340 --> 1:21:10.240
I've had I've had not really like overly negative but not happy.

1253
1:21:11.100 --> 1:21:17.170
Wow OK so yeah I actually in my course I do have a framework that I had kind of developed over two and

1254
1:21:17.170 --> 1:21:24.480
a half years for how I dress negative reviews and there are a lot of techniques that you can use to

1255
1:21:24.480 --> 1:21:28.160
not only prevent them but get rid of them.

1256
1:21:28.380 --> 1:21:35.190
And then I cover in my course of the more controversial techniques that I don't necessarily endorse.

1257
1:21:35.190 --> 1:21:41.410
But if you kind of look at it from OK what are the main concerns that are happening.

1258
1:21:41.590 --> 1:21:43.690
They're complaining about frequently.

1259
1:21:43.710 --> 1:21:46.230
Right now not even initially address those.

1260
1:21:46.230 --> 1:21:46.570
OK.

1261
1:21:46.590 --> 1:21:48.760
Well maybe something happened to you did not anticipate.

1262
1:21:48.780 --> 1:21:50.050
Right.

1263
1:21:50.100 --> 1:21:57.690
You can go and for instance using experience smoothing techniques like gifts are fantastic way of preventing

1264
1:21:57.690 --> 1:21:59.170
them before they happen.

1265
1:21:59.240 --> 1:22:04.440
You know there's a lot of different situations where you know and then all you can do is when the review

1266
1:22:04.440 --> 1:22:06.420
period comes up this is what I always do.

1267
1:22:06.450 --> 1:22:06.910
Right.

1268
1:22:07.080 --> 1:22:14.070
I always message them my review first and then I tell them what I put right really hard for someone

1269
1:22:14.070 --> 1:22:18.130
to give you a negative review if you just told them that you gave them a positive review.

1270
1:22:18.220 --> 1:22:18.880
Right.

1271
1:22:19.020 --> 1:22:21.590
That'll kill 60 percent in the bud right there.

1272
1:22:21.900 --> 1:22:27.020
But should you ever get to the nuclear option or sun actually close yet.

1273
1:22:27.240 --> 1:22:29.300
There are some options.

1274
1:22:29.310 --> 1:22:36.870
I mean you can still hear a dialogue with them and consider the economic impact of what this is going

1275
1:22:36.870 --> 1:22:37.560
to do to your listing.

1276
1:22:37.560 --> 1:22:38.290
Right.

1277
1:22:38.340 --> 1:22:45.940
If it's the case that the you know you're not going to be running for a while maybe you don't want to

1278
1:22:45.940 --> 1:22:52.840
address it but if it is the case that basically hurt them and seriously damage your income in future

1279
1:22:52.900 --> 1:22:53.810
what's it worth it.

1280
1:22:53.890 --> 1:22:56.310
And you can honestly you can buy them off.

1281
1:22:56.410 --> 1:22:58.080
I mean that's a lot of time.

1282
1:22:58.510 --> 1:23:03.820
A lot of times people are giving reviews and it's not because like they didn't feel like you're responsive

1283
1:23:04.120 --> 1:23:09.640
they feel like the amount they paid isn't matched to the experience they got right.

1284
1:23:09.730 --> 1:23:14.120
Well if you lower the amount of money you can kind of reach an equilibrium point.

1285
1:23:14.140 --> 1:23:14.620
Right.

1286
1:23:14.780 --> 1:23:15.510
Yeah.

1287
1:23:15.750 --> 1:23:18.160
It's kind of like hey I'll give you 200 bucks back.

1288
1:23:18.430 --> 1:23:19.330
Like I'm so sorry.

1289
1:23:19.330 --> 1:23:21.100
Like I don't ever want this to be the case.

1290
1:23:21.100 --> 1:23:24.760
I work hard and make sure that they understand your circumstance right.

1291
1:23:24.760 --> 1:23:25.780
Like people are human.

1292
1:23:25.990 --> 1:23:26.460
Yes.

1293
1:23:26.500 --> 1:23:30.050
They ultimately want you to change something.

1294
1:23:30.070 --> 1:23:30.420
Right.

1295
1:23:30.430 --> 1:23:31.550
They want you to improve.

1296
1:23:31.600 --> 1:23:33.040
Not everybody out there is callous.

1297
1:23:33.040 --> 1:23:36.130
They don't want to like scar you with something forever.

1298
1:23:36.190 --> 1:23:38.560
They just want to feel like their issues than rock.

1299
1:23:38.810 --> 1:23:42.210
Yeah they want to be heard and they just want to you know be noticed and be taken care of.

1300
1:23:42.220 --> 1:23:47.440
You said it can be it can be nipped in the bud as being very proactive and getting your your guest review

1301
1:23:47.440 --> 1:23:48.810
out there you know and let them know.

1302
1:23:48.820 --> 1:23:51.960
I think that's a fantastic tip is something we explain on our Web site as well.

1303
1:23:51.970 --> 1:23:58.060
Just really make sure that you're getting it be proactive about this review system seriously and give

1304
1:23:58.060 --> 1:24:00.140
them an outlet for giving you feedback.

1305
1:24:00.160 --> 1:24:00.670
Right.

1306
1:24:00.790 --> 1:24:01.790
Yeah that's another one.

1307
1:24:02.140 --> 1:24:07.930
I always text I guess it when I'm in town in the middle of there other thing all I tax them and the

1308
1:24:07.930 --> 1:24:09.850
like anything I can help with.

1309
1:24:09.850 --> 1:24:10.350
Right.

1310
1:24:10.450 --> 1:24:12.970
Because I do not want a submarine issue.

1311
1:24:12.970 --> 1:24:15.140
I don't want something to pop up only on the review.

1312
1:24:15.180 --> 1:24:16.200
Yes.

1313
1:24:16.240 --> 1:24:21.520
So if you give them the opportunity to feel heard the opportunity to voice their concerns.

1314
1:24:21.660 --> 1:24:22.250
OK Alan.

1315
1:24:22.270 --> 1:24:24.340
Yeah I mean that that kills most of them.

1316
1:24:24.460 --> 1:24:25.950
That's good.

1317
1:24:26.030 --> 1:24:30.340
You know instant book it's you know a feature that a lot of hosts use when at what point do you recommend

1318
1:24:30.340 --> 1:24:35.440
host start using instant book or should they be screening all their guests you know down to the T or

1319
1:24:35.530 --> 1:24:37.960
you know what are your thoughts on instant book.

1320
1:24:37.960 --> 1:24:41.260
Well I mean so first of all you know by my opinion on security.

1321
1:24:41.290 --> 1:24:41.780
Right.

1322
1:24:41.970 --> 1:24:42.680
Yeah exactly.

1323
1:24:42.810 --> 1:24:43.940
Very lax.

1324
1:24:44.170 --> 1:24:46.350
I'm like open borders anybody comb.

1325
1:24:46.360 --> 1:24:47.320
Anybody go.

1326
1:24:47.420 --> 1:24:48.740
Yeah.

1327
1:24:49.270 --> 1:24:50.130
Yeah.

1328
1:24:50.520 --> 1:24:56.590
Instead books so typically when I'm working with someone or talking to one of my guests or one of my

1329
1:24:56.590 --> 1:25:01.790
students on the phone I tell them it is it something that you need to wait till you have some stripes.

1330
1:25:01.810 --> 1:25:02.620
Right.

1331
1:25:02.680 --> 1:25:08.770
You need to wait till you've had some bad experiences know you can respond to them and you've gotten

1332
1:25:08.760 --> 1:25:11.500
to a point where it's become a little bit redundant.

1333
1:25:11.500 --> 1:25:11.770
Right.

1334
1:25:11.770 --> 1:25:13.650
Like you know all the things that can go wrong.

1335
1:25:13.750 --> 1:25:20.340
You know the main issues you know how to solve them you need to wait till you have you've been in the

1336
1:25:20.360 --> 1:25:25.840
dirt a little bit before you do and that book but if you want to maximize your income infant book you

1337
1:25:25.840 --> 1:25:26.430
have to do it.

1338
1:25:26.440 --> 1:25:31.120
I'm sorry like it if you don't have instant book you're not going to be on the front page and honestly

1339
1:25:31.120 --> 1:25:36.620
like some people don't care because they can get plenty of bookings on the second page third page.

1340
1:25:36.620 --> 1:25:41.520
And you know power to you but if you're trying to maximize then you should do the book to be honest.

1341
1:25:41.620 --> 1:25:46.390
And another thing people need to understand is that like a lot of issues and it's like anybody could

1342
1:25:46.390 --> 1:25:46.870
show up.

1343
1:25:46.870 --> 1:25:47.670
Right.

1344
1:25:47.950 --> 1:25:51.360
Like some just gobble it is going to show up there great go.

1345
1:25:52.090 --> 1:25:53.020
Everybody does.

1346
1:25:53.030 --> 1:25:55.180
I mean you could set this in your answer book for it.

1347
1:25:55.210 --> 1:26:00.340
You can send us an answer but you can always say like only instead book two people who have positive

1348
1:26:00.340 --> 1:26:04.120
reviews you can say only instead of book to people who have been ID verified.

1349
1:26:04.120 --> 1:26:04.640
Right.

1350
1:26:04.660 --> 1:26:06.530
So you are technically screening them.

1351
1:26:06.580 --> 1:26:12.910
And I think is once you become popular why the people that are booking my space I wouldn't even have

1352
1:26:12.910 --> 1:26:19.280
enough time or information to make a decision about whether or not I want them to book.

1353
1:26:19.310 --> 1:26:19.910
Right.

1354
1:26:20.050 --> 1:26:25.110
So you have to plan for all comers and plan accordingly.

1355
1:26:25.270 --> 1:26:30.030
And that should set you up to do and to book it in a book like no joke it's it's you will bump your

1356
1:26:30.040 --> 1:26:35.560
revenue by 20 30 percent like everybody is OK with it but that's know more money or more people means

1357
1:26:35.560 --> 1:26:39.330
more money and you know that's a good way to pay for charities too.

1358
1:26:39.420 --> 1:26:40.640
If you do want to be choosy.

1359
1:26:40.810 --> 1:26:42.640
Exactly.

1360
1:26:42.760 --> 1:26:44.110
So that kind of leads into the next question.

1361
1:26:44.110 --> 1:26:48.880
How do you minimize the risk of squatters or nightmare type of guests because they know we see the media

1362
1:26:48.880 --> 1:26:50.730
sensationalizing a lot of the bad stuff.

1363
1:26:50.740 --> 1:26:54.570
And I know that kind of keeps you like hear my mother talk to me about air being abused you get all

1364
1:26:54.610 --> 1:26:56.610
real nervous about it.

1365
1:26:56.890 --> 1:26:58.270
But it's not something she was scared of.

1366
1:26:58.280 --> 1:27:01.390
You know how do you minimize the risk of squatters or nightmare type of guests.

1367
1:27:01.390 --> 1:27:04.390
Do you have any tips for the squatters.

1368
1:27:04.390 --> 1:27:06.950
Man Yeah is it all in the news or in the end.

1369
1:27:07.030 --> 1:27:11.580
It's a very small percentage but you know I mean some people think about it crosses their mind.

1370
1:27:11.620 --> 1:27:13.290
You know do you have any thoughts.

1371
1:27:13.900 --> 1:27:16.940
The amount of people that actually squatted in air and be looking.

1372
1:27:16.960 --> 1:27:18.370
It's like a rounding error.

1373
1:27:18.470 --> 1:27:21.860
Like literally like how many times have we had this happen 10 times.

1374
1:27:21.900 --> 1:27:26.530
The only bookings they had seriously like what is like a hundred million or something.

1375
1:27:26.530 --> 1:27:32.170
So your odds of like getting struck by lightning three times in a row are like what's that stat like

1376
1:27:32.470 --> 1:27:36.030
take back by a polar bear and a grizzly bear in the same day.

1377
1:27:36.070 --> 1:27:39.820
That's roughly a quibble equivocal did having a squatter.

1378
1:27:40.090 --> 1:27:41.480
Yes the squatters.

1379
1:27:41.510 --> 1:27:43.830
So what they're basically doing is taking advantage of local laws.

1380
1:27:43.880 --> 1:27:44.420
OK.

1381
1:27:44.810 --> 1:27:46.970
And yes this is a problem.

1382
1:27:46.970 --> 1:27:50.500
San Francisco two and a half years are a rumor.

1383
1:27:50.510 --> 1:27:53.080
You didn't hear from me in San Francisco.

1384
1:27:53.090 --> 1:27:59.450
There actually were a couple called off its They were caught suggesting to people who are homeless that

1385
1:27:59.500 --> 1:28:02.650
a huge Arab unity is a squatting mechanism.

1386
1:28:03.100 --> 1:28:03.600
Yeah.

1387
1:28:03.660 --> 1:28:06.670
Just what kind of an NGO is that seriously.

1388
1:28:07.430 --> 1:28:09.750
So the ways that you get around this one.

1389
1:28:09.770 --> 1:28:15.320
And you'll notice this with all of these types of guest interactions is that there's a certain point

1390
1:28:15.320 --> 1:28:16.610
at which you get tenants rights.

1391
1:28:16.640 --> 1:28:17.170
Right.

1392
1:28:17.420 --> 1:28:22.140
And some voices have been saying we low require some reasonable ones.

1393
1:28:22.160 --> 1:28:22.560
Right.

1394
1:28:22.760 --> 1:28:28.770
But the point is is that like like all of the stories that you look at them it's like well the I need

1395
1:28:28.810 --> 1:28:31.950
state for a grid at him to do him for two months.

1396
1:28:32.150 --> 1:28:32.700
OK.

1397
1:28:32.810 --> 1:28:36.980
You're running it for two months that the guy is a tenant right and you need a plan for that.

1398
1:28:36.980 --> 1:28:44.360
So one of the things is just like be more scrutinized more if you're getting these two month rentals

1399
1:28:44.510 --> 1:28:45.240
right now.

1400
1:28:45.350 --> 1:28:49.720
Honestly if you're interested in doing a month long rental get a traditional sublet.

1401
1:28:49.850 --> 1:28:56.060
I mean who's going to pay the light per night hotel costs of the night tourist costs to rent this for

1402
1:28:56.060 --> 1:28:56.600
a month.

1403
1:28:56.620 --> 1:28:58.980
Anyway she throws some red flags anyway right.

1404
1:28:59.120 --> 1:28:59.780
You don't ever.

1405
1:28:59.780 --> 1:29:03.000
Also do not ever take money off of the system.

1406
1:29:03.020 --> 1:29:04.310
It's not worth it.

1407
1:29:04.340 --> 1:29:05.540
It just isn't worth it.

1408
1:29:05.590 --> 1:29:06.400
Right.

1409
1:29:06.510 --> 1:29:11.690
And at the other one like the squatter in Sarasota or whatever she got caught because it's like she

1410
1:29:11.690 --> 1:29:12.470
didn't like.

1411
1:29:12.500 --> 1:29:15.110
She took money off the system.

1412
1:29:15.110 --> 1:29:15.680
Right.

1413
1:29:15.800 --> 1:29:21.260
And then the guy lied about how long he was in the building and had no way of proving it right.

1414
1:29:21.310 --> 1:29:21.540
Yes.

1415
1:29:21.590 --> 1:29:23.670
So everybody was there for like a month.

1416
1:29:23.690 --> 1:29:29.030
He claimed to be there for like three months or whatever the threshold was to get tenants rights.

1417
1:29:29.300 --> 1:29:30.260
And that's how he got around it.

1418
1:29:30.260 --> 1:29:33.080
So to just don't do that for one screw.

1419
1:29:33.120 --> 1:29:39.050
Nice long term booking to induce a basic research Honestly I figured out very quickly how long you could

1420
1:29:39.060 --> 1:29:41.180
be in a space free of tenants rights.

1421
1:29:41.260 --> 1:29:45.440
It's Francisco like don't quote me on it but it's like two weeks or something right but they're at a

1422
1:29:45.740 --> 1:29:47.040
rental.

1423
1:29:47.210 --> 1:29:52.930
So be aware of try to scrutinize it as much as possible.

1424
1:29:53.100 --> 1:29:57.660
If this does happen and you are that person is like the most unlucky person in the world.

1425
1:29:57.840 --> 1:30:00.290
Everybody has been quite fancy.

1426
1:30:00.300 --> 1:30:01.270
I mean it like that again.

1427
1:30:01.290 --> 1:30:06.610
One of the stories like local news story like to lose news outlets was harping on this stuff right.

1428
1:30:06.660 --> 1:30:10.830
They're not harping on the air being the orgy that happened in New York City probably had it's hilarious

1429
1:30:10.860 --> 1:30:15.460
but they always like talk about you know this is the terrible thing that happened.

1430
1:30:15.500 --> 1:30:20.120
They might in one sentence or whatever being we did and that's just totally not fair.

1431
1:30:20.220 --> 1:30:27.120
Everyone be like wired them huge chunks of money they hired surveillance teams they paid for all the

1432
1:30:27.120 --> 1:30:36.160
legal fees they put them in like a better apartment or own like just you guys have aligned incentives

1433
1:30:36.580 --> 1:30:38.300
they'll take care of you.

1434
1:30:38.470 --> 1:30:45.220
But in general yeah I mean that's an issue but as you just try to be a little more thoughtful about

1435
1:30:45.220 --> 1:30:50.600
how you plan for long term guests and try not I wouldn't use MBB for long term goals.

1436
1:30:50.800 --> 1:30:52.130
That's probably the biggest one.

1437
1:30:52.320 --> 1:30:52.820
Exactly.

1438
1:30:52.830 --> 1:30:55.030
That can dig away 99 percent of the risk great there.

1439
1:30:55.040 --> 1:31:00.640
And also is asking for you know very extended stay to show some of the red flags right away.

1440
1:31:00.930 --> 1:31:06.720
What like if you know if like the cutoff date was the 24 days to be a tenant to give tenants law in

1441
1:31:06.750 --> 1:31:09.580
the state for 25 days.

1442
1:31:09.790 --> 1:31:11.100
Like come on.

1443
1:31:11.100 --> 1:31:12.640
Like you get 25 days.

1444
1:31:12.760 --> 1:31:13.270
Exactly.

1445
1:31:13.270 --> 1:31:15.780
Your real name.

1446
1:31:15.790 --> 1:31:16.670
Exactly.

1447
1:31:16.840 --> 1:31:20.820
All right well that's all the questions I have I checked our e-mail there's not really any other questions

1448
1:31:20.860 --> 1:31:26.720
but we do have a special offer for the guests that were able to stick around to the end.

1449
1:31:26.740 --> 1:31:32.370
Evan has been very very generous to offer his course for a limited time price of forty nine dollars.

1450
1:31:32.370 --> 1:31:33.310
He just has a live visit.

1451

1452
1:31:37.590 --> 1:31:41.990
It will not last long it's a limited time offer.

1453
1:31:42.350 --> 1:31:48.100
I mean you've you've given us so much knowledge in just this past hour and a half I can only imagine

1454
1:31:48.100 --> 1:31:49.410
how deep the course goes.

1455
1:31:49.420 --> 1:31:52.870
You said it's about 15 hours and 118 lectures correct.
