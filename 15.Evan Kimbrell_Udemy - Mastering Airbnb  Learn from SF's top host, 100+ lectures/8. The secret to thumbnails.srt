1
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,870
Let's talk a little bit about thumbnails those tiny little square images of your apartment that someone

2
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,150
sees and they search for a property.

3
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,280
Yes they are immensely important.

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:21,470
Anyone who's taken a course on any type of display advertisement or anything even like an eBay course

5
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:23,820
they're done now is crucial.

6
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,850
What do I suggest you do with your thumbnails.

7
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:29,850
Well number one you want to have a photograph that looks professional.

8
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:34,530
So chances are you're going to use the air B and be photographed when you do a thumbnail on air B and

9
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:40,260
B if you pick a high quality photograph or at least make it such that other properties don't stand out

10
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,490
against yours.

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,190
You want your thumbnail to stick out as much as possible but in a good way you don't want to put a picture

12
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,490
of Google image of a cat or something like that.

13
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,750
I don't think Arab and me would except that you want yours to be slightly different just enough that

14
00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:01,920
when they look at six thumbnails they see yours first what I ended up doing for my thumbnail was I picked

15
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,100
the one thing that differentiates my property from all the other ones in the area.

16
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,690
One of the biggest ones and that was that I have a back yard and a patio.

17
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:16,230
Never mind the fact that in San Francisco you rarely get to use that patio because it's too windy or

18
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,520
it's too overcast.

19
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,370
It's something that when someone is booking they want to see that they have the option for it and that's

20
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:24,100
something that other people can't compete with.

21
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:27,870
You can't go and get a new property simply because it has a backyard.

22
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:32,970
San Francisco has very high urban density so it's not as common that you would have something like this.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,560
Also everyone seems to make the mistake of taking a photograph of their living room or something that

24
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,120
is inside their space.

25
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,350
That was a big differentiation for me.

26
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,220
I took a photograph of the backyard.

27
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,800
It's green and it's bright blue.

28
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:50,130
That's different than taking a picture of the inside of your apartment so that stands off against everybody

29
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:53,770
else who took photos of the best looking bedroom in their apartment.

30
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:57,120
Do you have something like that that could make a huge difference.

31
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,890
Maybe it's the front of your house.

32
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,050
You would take a photograph of the front of your house if you wanted to emphasize.

33
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:06,960
And you were the first thought someone has this is a house that I'm renting and that's somehow different

34
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,100
than the other places that I'm renting.

35
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:13,860
One of the big no nos thumbnails I've noticed is people will take a photograph of say their living room

36
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,980
and there's too much going on in the shot.

37
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,860
So when I look at that and the image is scaled down it doesn't look like anything.

38
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,750
I can't make out everything in the photograph.

39
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,540
It's actually a kind of a waste.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,740
Earlier in the course I talked about someone who took a picture a gift basket that they made and they

41
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:31,570
showed that as their number one thumbnail is the first thing you see.

42
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:36,350
And let me tell you that sticks out you see apartment apartment gift basket.

43
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,220
They did it with professional photography so it kind of had that aura of color and saturation that you'd

44
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,770
associate with an energy and be photo.

45
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,970
In my experience those are the best things you can do.

46
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:50,990
Not really worried about you know if everybody hears this course everybody makes these off the wall

47
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:55,430
kind of photographs or photographs of things that are old normal nontraditional because like I said

48
00:02:55,430 --> 00:03:00,180
earlier in the course Airbnb hosts they're just not nearly as competitive as you think.

49
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,510
If you put 10 percent more accurate than them you can make a property that's twice as good.

50
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,080
What else can we say about thumbnails.

51
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,800
If anybody has any experience with thumbnails post in the group discussion and glad to hear what you've

52
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,310
had and what works in my experience things that catch their attention are good.

53
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:19,470
So take a picture or something that's different from anything different going on your apartment maybe

54
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,630
take a picture of a nice painting on the wall.

55
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:27,360
Tested out like everything but in general you don't want to pick a low quality photo that you took yourself.

56
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,810
You want to pick something as lots of light because they want to be in a good mood and they come to

57
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,830
your listing you know want to pick something that's a picture of a closet or the darkest room in your

58
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:35,890
apartment.

59
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:39,870
Pick something that's going to get their attention it's going to stick out and it's going to exude a

60
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,000
positive vibe.

61
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,900
I would love if you guys would post what your experiences are thumbnails because I think we can kind

62
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,590
of crowdsource together and figure out you know this is work this doesn't work.

63
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,260
Lots of people like this people don't like.

64
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:55,170
So anyway questions experiences posted in the group discussion send me a private message.
