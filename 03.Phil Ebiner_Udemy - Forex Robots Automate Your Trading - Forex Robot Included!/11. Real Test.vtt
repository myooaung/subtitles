00:00:06.690  -->  00:00:09.430
Hello this is Kirill from forexboat dot com.

2

00:00:09.450  -->  00:00:15.480
And welcome back to the course on testing and optimization meditated for today we're going to be launching

3

00:00:15.480  -->  00:00:23.250
the real test of our expert advisors simple system version 5.0 in front of you here you can see my 4

4

00:00:23.250  -->  00:00:29.340
x the P.S. with the 4 demo test that we have been running so far.

5

00:00:29.430  -->  00:00:32.100
But at the same time I have opened a real account.

6

00:00:32.160  -->  00:00:33.990
I've opened it with Alper.

7

00:00:34.050  -->  00:00:41.170
I'll parry but that's not necessarily my favorite Broecker by any means.

8

00:00:41.370  -->  00:00:47.280
If you would like to find out who my favorite broker is please visit me on double dot for exposed dot

9

00:00:47.280  -->  00:00:55.770
com slash brokers and there you'll be able to see a comparison of the different companies that you can

10

00:00:55.770  -->  00:01:01.050
trade with and which ones are better for expert advisers which works better for manual trading which

11

00:01:01.050  -->  00:01:05.800
ones are better for different types of algorithms and so on.

12

00:01:06.330  -->  00:01:14.790
So going back to our real test here we have a terminal from Al Pari and this is where we are going to

13

00:01:14.790  -->  00:01:17.560
be running the test.

14

00:01:17.620  -->  00:01:26.040
There's five hundred dollars of funds here already and all we have to do is launch our expert adviser

15

00:01:26.050  -->  00:01:26.330
.

16

00:01:26.490  -->  00:01:32.130
But before we do that there's one thing that we have to check because our expert advisors simple system

17

00:01:32.160  -->  00:01:35.190
is highly dependent on time.

18

00:01:35.220  -->  00:01:36.430
We need to make.

19

00:01:36.450  -->  00:01:45.570
We need to check how the time of the broker compares to the server time of the broker lives with the

20

00:01:45.570  -->  00:01:51.510
server time of the other broker or the other server where we did a demo test.

21

00:01:51.600  -->  00:01:58.410
So our demo test as you can see here we did in the global terminal and the market watch time there is

22

00:01:59.370  -->  00:02:04.620
48 minutes past midnight on Monday the 22nd of September.

23

00:02:05.070  -->  00:02:12.960
Whereas the Al parta terminal server time is one hour forty eight minutes past midnight.

24

00:02:12.960  -->  00:02:18.560
So that means that there's a shift in the charts and we can even see that.

25

00:02:19.050  -->  00:02:28.340
If we zoom in to the chart and pick out any given bar so that let's zoom in and for example odds are

26

00:02:28.340  -->  00:02:29.580
smartish.

27

00:02:29.880  -->  00:02:34.920
So if we pick up this long bar and look at what time it occurred.

28

00:02:34.920  -->  00:02:41.700
So here you can see at the bottom that it occurred at 10 o'clock on the server where we were doing our

29

00:02:41.700  -->  00:02:42.800
demo test.

30

00:02:42.810  -->  00:02:49.050
So now if we go to the real server where we're going to be running a test peripherial funds you look

31

00:02:49.050  -->  00:02:55.290
at the same long bar and we look at the time when it occurred you'll notice that it occurred at 11:00

32

00:02:55.450  -->  00:02:55.990
.

33

00:02:56.010  -->  00:03:03.420
So therefore this whole chod is shifted by one bar to the right in comparison to the demo test.

34

00:03:03.540  -->  00:03:08.310
And that's something we have to take into account when we're launching our expert adviser.

35

00:03:08.340  -->  00:03:13.980
Now if you're working with an expert advisor that doesn't take time in to account in his algorithm then

36

00:03:14.010  -->  00:03:16.000
you don't need to think about these things.

37

00:03:16.230  -->  00:03:22.890
But in our case it's very vital that we do make this adjustment.

38

00:03:23.040  -->  00:03:24.350
So we're going to be doing that.

39

00:03:24.360  -->  00:03:29.910
Also I wanted to show you that I've already copied a simple system version 5.0 into the terminal and

40

00:03:29.910  -->  00:03:31.860
also you'll see another expert.

41

00:03:31.860  -->  00:03:34.400
Why is a simple system version 5.1.

42

00:03:34.620  -->  00:03:40.530
The only difference between these two is that in simple system version 5.1 I added another parameter

43

00:03:41.040  -->  00:03:43.220
which is the magic number.

44

00:03:43.260  -->  00:03:49.620
And that kind of allows you to launch many of the same expert adviser in one terminal and them not to

45

00:03:49.620  -->  00:03:51.060
interfere with each other's trade.

46

00:03:51.210  -->  00:03:57.450
So you can download a simple system version five point or five point one from the same place where you

47

00:03:57.450  -->  00:04:01.730
downloaded a simple system version five point oh it comes together with the score.

48

00:04:01.740  -->  00:04:03.060
It's no additional charge.

49

00:04:03.080  -->  00:04:08.780
And you can download it for free from there so please feel free to do that.

50

00:04:08.790  -->  00:04:17.400
Now what we want to do next is we want to run before we launched expertize and we want to run some tests

51

00:04:17.430  -->  00:04:25.170
in the tester just to make sure that the results align with what we saw in the demo in the general demo

52

00:04:25.170  -->  00:04:31.100
test in order to run these tests correctly you have to open your chart which is going to be running

53

00:04:31.110  -->  00:04:34.020
expert driver on and first get as much history as you can.

54

00:04:34.030  -->  00:04:41.040
So how to do that is you press home the home button while you are on the chart and you will see it adding

55

00:04:41.040  -->  00:04:41.640
more dots.

56

00:04:41.700  -->  00:04:45.240
And you also need to make sure you do that for all the other timeframes.

57

00:04:45.270  -->  00:04:51.800
If you're going to be running a test or using the old ticks model but we're going to use open price

58

00:04:51.800  -->  00:04:55.330
model because we know that for our expert guys it doesn't really matter.

59

00:04:55.440  -->  00:05:03.470
And then we have simple system 5.1 currency per British pound period or one our open prices.

60

00:05:03.720  -->  00:05:12.650
I've already set time interval to when we ran our When we started running our back tests.

61

00:05:12.670  -->  00:05:19.290
So the 8th of May 2014 and the end date I said it today.

62

00:05:19.600  -->  00:05:25.870
And so what we can do is we're going to load the expert properties so as we agreed we're not going to

63

00:05:25.870  -->  00:05:31.250
be considering that first set where there were no profitable trades at all.

64

00:05:31.270  -->  00:05:37.420
So we'll start with the second set said to her our was nine and now we know we need to adjust the time

65

00:05:37.420  -->  00:05:37.440
.

66

00:05:37.450  -->  00:05:44.920
So if that long bar was at 10 and then now in the AL Pari terminals at 11 so we have to change start

67

00:05:44.950  -->  00:05:48.440
or we have to increase it by one and all of our sets.

68

00:05:48.530  -->  00:05:50.490
So it will change it to 10.

69

00:05:50.500  -->  00:05:57.430
Also we have to take into account that all party is a five digit broker and we need to adjust our set

70

00:05:57.430  -->  00:06:00.950
accordingly so many people limit we have multiplied by 10.

71

00:06:01.150  -->  00:06:04.060
Take profit have to multiply it by 10 and stop loss.

72

00:06:04.060  -->  00:06:06.870
We have to multiply by 10.

73

00:06:07.180  -->  00:06:09.140
The rest of the parameters we don't need to touch.

74

00:06:09.160  -->  00:06:18.200
And as you can see here there's a magic number that will be important when we get to launching the expert

75

00:06:18.340  -->  00:06:23.080
on the Reel.com doesn't affect the strategy tests or runs.

76

00:06:23.080  -->  00:06:31.600
So we'll click OK and we'll click start and we look at our report our report looks reasonable if we

77

00:06:31.600  -->  00:06:35.520
compare it to what we saw in our back and testing for test.

78

00:06:35.530  -->  00:06:37.400
It will look very similar.

79

00:06:37.690  -->  00:06:46.270
And so that's that's a good sign that means that your expert advisor performs on this real Alpari terminal

80

00:06:46.280  -->  00:06:46.670
.

81

00:06:47.050  -->  00:06:54.410
Very similar to how it performed in the demo test runs that we we have been doing so far.

82

00:06:54.490  -->  00:06:57.490
So let's check another set the next set.

83

00:06:57.490  -->  00:07:03.680
The set three if are for open that quickly adjust this.

84

00:07:04.060  -->  00:07:11.570
These ones by 10 and let's run that and have a look at the result.

85

00:07:12.850  -->  00:07:20.500
So here we have an unexpected dip or a drawdown something I would not did not see on the back test and

86

00:07:20.500  -->  00:07:27.320
forward test that sometimes happens and means that the data the historical data that's stored in the

87

00:07:27.580  -->  00:07:34.720
alpari terminal is different to what we use what was stored and what we used in the global terminal

88

00:07:34.720  -->  00:07:36.070
where we ran the demo test.

89

00:07:36.120  -->  00:07:40.740
So that basically signals to us that we must be very cautious with the set if we are going to use it

90

00:07:40.750  -->  00:07:45.610
we cannot really rely on the results of the demo test practice for test.

91

00:07:45.750  -->  00:07:52.890
We do see here a upward trend that is very favorable and that's why I will launch this set now just

92

00:07:52.890  -->  00:07:54.410
to see how it goes.

93

00:07:54.430  -->  00:08:00.420
But we will launch it with very small a lot because we do have to be cautious with it.

94

00:08:00.430  -->  00:08:05.240
And finally let's look at the last set where our was 8.

95

00:08:05.680  -->  00:08:07.420
Here we have to change it to 9.

96

00:08:07.500  -->  00:08:12.380
Multiply these by 10 and click OK.

97

00:08:12.580  -->  00:08:13.530
Let's run that

98

00:08:16.870  -->  00:08:23.770
as you see here we have a very linear smooth graph something that we saw in the back test forward test

99

00:08:23.800  -->  00:08:28.350
and demo test where we didn't have even one loss over the two week period.

100

00:08:28.360  -->  00:08:30.010
So this is very good.

101

00:08:30.040  -->  00:08:34.460
And I think we will focus on this set as the main one.

102

00:08:34.600  -->  00:08:39.730
Now we can close the test so we don't really need it anymore and we want to launch the expert advisors

103

00:08:39.730  -->  00:08:46.960
So we're going to open two more charts for the British pound one on the time frame.

104

00:08:47.130  -->  00:08:52.470
We'll go down to simple system version 5.1 and we'll just drag it onto our charts.

105

00:08:52.570  -->  00:08:57.180
So here we're going to go to inputs load.

106

00:08:57.630  -->  00:09:04.540
It's on the desktop sets and we're going to load and load the set first.

107

00:09:04.840  -->  00:09:11.050
And here we have to change of course to turn a is going to be 80.

108

00:09:11.670  -->  00:09:19.300
Just adding zeros at the end for the stop loss to implement and the next thing that we need to think

109

00:09:19.300  -->  00:09:20.180
about is a lot.

110

00:09:20.230  -->  00:09:23.220
So I've prepared some calculations here.

111

00:09:23.560  -->  00:09:27.990
And as you can see for this set the take profit is 106 Pip's.

112

00:09:28.000  -->  00:09:36.250
So if you subtract the 3 pips spread then it's $10 30 of profit per every point is 0 1 Lotts Stop-Loss

113

00:09:36.250  -->  00:09:36.990
is 28.

114

00:09:37.000  -->  00:09:40.650
So it's $3 10 profit per every 0.1.

115

00:09:40.640  -->  00:09:44.260
A lot of similar calculations have been done for the rest of them.

116

00:09:44.380  -->  00:09:52.650
And so this set is the one we're going to set at .02 lots meaning that per day we can maximum lose about

117

00:09:52.650  -->  00:09:58.460
$6 20 which makes it about $30 or $31 in a week.

118

00:09:58.490  -->  00:10:01.930
Then we can lose maximum of all trades are not profitable.

119

00:10:02.250  -->  00:10:06.550
So that's something that we can tolerate and with a $500 deposit.

120

00:10:06.750  -->  00:10:08.210
And that's what we're going to set it at.

121

00:10:08.230  -->  00:10:14.310
So it's set it at .02 a point.

122

00:10:14.530  -->  00:10:20.140
And the magic number which is going to leave it as it is for now for this set.

123

00:10:20.250  -->  00:10:22.150
Next we're going to move on to the next chart.

124

00:10:22.140  -->  00:10:27.800
Simple system margin five point one load desktop sets.

125

00:10:27.880  -->  00:10:30.640
And we're going to load the next set.

126

00:10:30.630  -->  00:10:32.160
This is the one we can really trust.

127

00:10:32.160  -->  00:10:36.710
So first of all we're going to do all necessary adjustments.

128

00:10:36.860  -->  00:10:45.510
Fifty and but the lot will it's the least one we can sort of point or one we have to change the magic

129

00:10:45.520  -->  00:10:50.450
number so you can put an end number absolutely any number here is always different to the number of

130

00:10:50.440  -->  00:10:51.030
the first set.

131

00:10:51.150  -->  00:10:56.770
But here I'll just increase it by 1 and that will make sure that sets don't interfere with each other's

132

00:10:56.770  -->  00:10:57.620
trades.

133

00:10:57.930  -->  00:10:58.490
OK.

134

00:10:58.500  -->  00:10:59.820
There it is happy and running.

135

00:10:59.880  -->  00:11:09.110
And finally simple system version 5 1 1 on this chart we're going to load the right set here.

136

00:11:09.120  -->  00:11:15.010
This is the arrow and this is the one we like the most we have to change this to 9 limit is 100 This

137

00:11:15.000  -->  00:11:15.760
is 200.

138

00:11:15.750  -->  00:11:17.200
This is 600.

139

00:11:17.640  -->  00:11:27.180
And now we have to change the magic to put a 3 on the end or any number you like as long as it's different

140

00:11:27.180  -->  00:11:28.600
to the previous ones.

141

00:11:28.620  -->  00:11:34.980
It's just like an identifier of the trades and lots we're going to set it at point zero or three because

142

00:11:34.990  -->  00:11:38.730
this is the set that we like the most click OK.

143

00:11:38.830  -->  00:11:40.040
There it is running.

144

00:11:40.120  -->  00:11:44.730
And so that's how we set up the real test run.

145

00:11:44.830  -->  00:11:48.790
You might be wondering why or how were your adult charge open here.

146

00:11:48.930  -->  00:11:54.090
Well that's because I have a another expert buzzer running which is a watch dog.

147

00:11:54.100  -->  00:11:59.170
It doesn't create any trades but what it does do is it makes sure that the connection to the server

148

00:11:59.160  -->  00:12:02.350
is always current.

149

00:12:02.350  -->  00:12:09.630
It's always green over here and that there is always a possibility stability for the other expert to

150

00:12:09.630  -->  00:12:15.580
monitor the trades to create trades to close trades basically make sure that the connection is always

151

00:12:15.580  -->  00:12:16.180
there.
