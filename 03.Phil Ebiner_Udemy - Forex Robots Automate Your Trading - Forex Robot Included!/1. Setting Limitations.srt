00:00:07,260  -->  00:00:09,480
Hello this is Kirill from forexboat dot com.

2

00:00:09,480  -->  00:00:15,120
And welcome back to the course on testing and optimization and meditated for in this section of the

3

00:00:15,120  -->  00:00:21,570
course we will talk more about optimization and you will learn things like setting limitations two dimensional

4

00:00:21,570  -->  00:00:28,120
surface analysis exploring optimization results into Excel and further analysis there.

5

00:00:28,260  -->  00:00:34,260
The genetic algorithm and a few more very interesting and insightful topics.

6

00:00:34,260  -->  00:00:37,490
However before we proceed I'd like to ask a favor.

7

00:00:37,500  -->  00:00:42,900
Now I know I've already mentioned this previously in the course and if you have already left review

8

00:00:43,570  -->  00:00:45,170
then thank you very much.

9

00:00:45,270  -->  00:00:52,470
But if you haven't left review yet then and you do like what you've seen so far in the course I would

10

00:00:52,470  -->  00:00:55,640
like to ask you to maybe leave me some feedback.

11

00:00:55,650  -->  00:01:00,390
And even if you just clicked the number of stars you feel that the course deserves.

12

00:01:00,390  -->  00:01:01,800
That would be very helpful.

13

00:01:01,800  -->  00:01:07,770
It would not only help me out but it will also assist other students who haven't yet signed up for a

14

00:01:07,770  -->  00:01:13,800
course in deciding for themselves whether this course is worth their time.

15

00:01:13,890  -->  00:01:17,270
So I would really appreciate if you could leave a review.

16

00:01:17,580  -->  00:01:21,260
And once again thank you for those of you who have already done that.

17

00:01:21,420  -->  00:01:24,530
And now let's go back to today's topic.

18

00:01:24,690  -->  00:01:29,520
So today we'll be talking about the mutations.

19

00:01:29,520  -->  00:01:35,990
I've got the strategy tester when window open in front of me and I've already chosen simple system version

20

00:01:36,000  -->  00:01:37,500
5.0.

21

00:01:37,830  -->  00:01:44,340
Set the currency pair the period and the model as we remember we're going to be using open prices model

22

00:01:45,030  -->  00:01:46,210
and know what we're going to do.

23

00:01:46,230  -->  00:01:50,410
We're going to go into expert properties and to make it a bit more interesting.

24

00:01:50,430  -->  00:01:56,190
We will choose for expert properties we will choose one of the sets that we know perform quite well

25

00:01:56,430  -->  00:01:58,550
in our demo test.

26

00:01:58,570  -->  00:02:00,330
As you remember that it was the fourth set.

27

00:02:00,330  -->  00:02:03,630
The one that was at the bottom or bottom right corner.

28

00:02:03,900  -->  00:02:06,260
So let's go ahead and find that set.

29

00:02:06,360  -->  00:02:13,000
I save it in this folder here and out of the four sets this one set number four where our was eight

30

00:02:13,000  -->  00:02:13,580
.

31

00:02:13,890  -->  00:02:19,650
So we get to select that and it automatically populates the values of the set here.

32

00:02:19,650  -->  00:02:27,690
And so we'll just go ahead and run there just to see that the result is what we were looking for.

33

00:02:27,690  -->  00:02:29,700
As you can see that's the set over here.

34

00:02:29,920  -->  00:02:35,720
So and this is still on the same period where we ran out back test plus forward test.

35

00:02:35,880  -->  00:02:42,600
So those four months between May and September going back to the graph.

36

00:02:42,600  -->  00:02:43,950
So that's that's our share.

37

00:02:43,950  -->  00:02:49,020
Now what we want to do is go to exper properties and we want to optimize who we want to run like an

38

00:02:49,020  -->  00:02:51,660
optimization and maybe we'll see if we want it we can improve the said.

39

00:02:51,660  -->  00:02:54,360
But much more for the sake of just practice.

40

00:02:54,540  -->  00:03:01,260
We want to run an optimization so we'll uncheck that start all we really know that we're happy with

41

00:03:01,260  -->  00:03:04,430
this hour we know that out of the ones that we've chosen.

42

00:03:04,590  -->  00:03:12,030
This was perhaps the best hour that it's worth starting your trays that many people limit will also

43

00:03:12,160  -->  00:03:18,300
take that for now and a filter and a period will SANTICH that will be just optimizing and take profit

44

00:03:18,660  -->  00:03:25,740
and the stop loss and we will also leave the optimization parameters here so we'll start with 10 value

45

00:03:25,740  -->  00:03:28,620
of 10 will move step of 10 and will stop at 100.

46

00:03:28,620  -->  00:03:33,540
That's not particularly important right now so just click OK just to say that it will go back into expert

47

00:03:33,540  -->  00:03:39,700
properties and how to find the limitations we need to go into the optimization tab.

48

00:03:39,900  -->  00:03:49,320
So these limitations will allow you to kind of restrict the optimization results to certain criteria

49

00:03:50,010  -->  00:03:55,450
such undescended better I'll just go ahead and run the observation of any limitations at this stage

50

00:03:55,450  -->  00:03:55,590
.

51

00:03:55,590  -->  00:04:02,520
So just going to click optimization here and run it as it gets it as a 100 results which is fair because

52

00:04:02,580  -->  00:04:06,650
we had 10 steps that take profit intends to have full stop loss.

53

00:04:06,660  -->  00:04:09,170
They're all ordered by profit right now.

54

00:04:09,210  -->  00:04:17,190
So we can order them by pass if we like and here it will go from just make is bigger here we'll go from

55

00:04:17,250  -->  00:04:22,810
1 to 100 and is basically just gone through all different combinations.

56

00:04:22,980  -->  00:04:28,240
And here you see other parameters so you see the drawdown percentage drawdown expected payoff, profit

57

00:04:28,270  -->  00:04:31,530
factor total trades and profit and so on.

58

00:04:32,010  -->  00:04:35,830
So drawdown is a good example because you can set limitations on that.

59

00:04:35,850  -->  00:04:37,980
And let's just talk about that for a second.

60

00:04:38,280  -->  00:04:44,340
So what you can do in limitations is you can and this is something that we touched on during our test

61

00:04:44,400  -->  00:04:47,540
of our simple system in the previous section.

62

00:04:47,760  -->  00:04:55,980
You can limit the results that you see here and excludes results of say a certain drawback say you don't

63

00:04:55,980  -->  00:04:57,980
like this drawdown of 12 percent.

64

00:04:57,980  -->  00:05:06,120
You say that is about your level of tolerance and you don't want to include such results in your analysis

65

00:05:06,120  -->  00:05:09,320
or just basically wasting your time and taking up space.

66

00:05:09,450  -->  00:05:15,990
So you can set through limitations you can set this optimization process to exclude results.

67

00:05:15,990  -->  00:05:18,340
We have a drawdown of over 12 percent.

68

00:05:18,540  -->  00:05:24,780
So for example you wouldn't see these results from nineteen point eighty five you still see these ones

69

00:05:25,280  -->  00:05:30,520
of 11 or seven or 10 percent but you wouldn't see anything above 12.

70

00:05:30,690  -->  00:05:33,570
So how would we go and do that just to.

71

00:05:33,930  -->  00:05:37,060
So we have an illustration of how limitations work.

72

00:05:37,290  -->  00:05:43,170
So I'm going into X reappropriate I'm going into optimization and then I'm looking at maximal drawdown

73

00:05:43,190  -->  00:05:43,340
.

74

00:05:43,470  -->  00:05:49,520
Well first you thing you have to do is you have to take this box next you have to say changes value

75

00:05:49,540  -->  00:05:49,610
.

76

00:05:49,650  -->  00:05:56,130
And here it's very tricky so if I just click over here somewhere else then the value returns to its

77

00:05:56,130  -->  00:06:00,030
previous whatever the number was in there.

78

00:06:00,030  -->  00:06:06,400
So you have to set your value and click enter and that's something a lot of traders often forget.

79

00:06:06,420  -->  00:06:12,390
If you don't click entery just click OK then the value won't be set and just make sure that the box

80

00:06:12,390  -->  00:06:12,630
checked.

81

00:06:12,630  -->  00:06:19,600
So once that's done that means that any result of maximal drawdown above troops that will be excluded

82

00:06:19,600  -->  00:06:19,620
.

83

00:06:19,620  -->  00:06:23,160
So let's click OK and let's run optimization now.

84

00:06:23,520  -->  00:06:25,970
As you can see all 100 have been run.

85

00:06:26,160  -->  00:06:30,870
If we go into optimization you will notice that there is much less results.

86

00:06:30,870  -->  00:06:33,620
It's only got 31 results here.

87

00:06:33,780  -->  00:06:38,610
And as you can see for all of them the drawdown is below 12 percent.

88

00:06:38,760  -->  00:06:44,810
So it has literally excluded any results above so you can even see them here.

89

00:06:44,940  -->  00:06:52,140
And if you take any one of them and said as input parameters you will see that the drawdown here never

90

00:06:52,500  -->  00:06:58,130
goes above 12 percent of the deposit that it was at that at the start.

91

00:06:58,130  -->  00:07:00,220
Well on the drawdown started.

92

00:07:00,660  -->  00:07:02,940
So that's how you basically use limitation.

93

00:07:02,940  -->  00:07:06,990
So now let's go into a bit more detail which limitations are available.

94

00:07:07,110  -->  00:07:12,960
The motivations that you can select from are the minimum balance so you can say set the minimum balance

95

00:07:12,960  -->  00:07:16,730
to 9000 For example if your starting balance is 10000.

96

00:07:16,730  -->  00:07:21,580
Then you can to 9000 and you'll know that BAC tests that you're presented with Will Never.

97

00:07:21,660  -->  00:07:27,140
It has never been below that value profit maximums the maximum number amount of profit reached.

98

00:07:27,160  -->  00:07:32,880
And you might want to use that one in special cases when you're just checking some money management

99

00:07:32,880  -->  00:07:36,770
technique that you're trying out a minimal margin level.

100

00:07:36,780  -->  00:07:43,440
Find me a point of concern for some people maximal drawdown consecutive loss in value how much you can

101

00:07:43,440  -->  00:07:49,280
expect or you're prepared to lose in one in a series of Lost trades.

102

00:07:49,380  -->  00:07:54,680
So these one leads to a quite useful consecutive loss trades if you don't want to see your expert advisor

103

00:07:54,800  -->  00:08:01,020
level losing more than 10 times in a row or say two times in a row you can specify that here consecutive

104

00:08:01,020  -->  00:08:05,390
win trades if you don't want to see expert why is a winning more than 30 times in.

105

00:08:05,520  -->  00:08:13,080
Maybe because that's too suspicious too or you have other reasons to set that limitation mind you want

106

00:08:13,080  -->  00:08:13,740
to do that.

107

00:08:13,920  -->  00:08:20,040
But I find the most powerful one out of them is the maximal drawdown and I do use that quite often.

108

00:08:20,040  -->  00:08:27,150
It helps me significantly reduce the amount of time I spend on analyzing my optimization results.

109

00:08:27,150  -->  00:08:28,680
All right so I think that's enough for today.

110

00:08:28,680  -->  00:08:31,590
Have a play around with that and see how you go.

111

00:08:31,590  -->  00:08:35,140
Also let me know if you have any questions using the comments section.

112

00:08:35,340  -->  00:08:41,100
And next time we'll be talking about two dimensional surface analysis and I look forward to seeing you

113

00:08:41,370  -->  00:08:42,500
on that tutorial.

114

00:08:42,510  -->  00:08:43,810
Until then Happy training
