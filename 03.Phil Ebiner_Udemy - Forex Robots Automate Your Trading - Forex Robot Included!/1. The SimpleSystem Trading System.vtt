00:00:07.800  -->  00:00:09.870
Hello this is Curiel from Perrysburg dot com.

2

00:00:09.870  -->  00:00:16.700
And welcome to the ninth tutorial on testing and optimization and meditate for Congratulations on completing

3

00:00:16.700  -->  00:00:19.080
a theoretical section of the course.

4

00:00:19.170  -->  00:00:22.810
And now we are moving onto the practical section.

5

00:00:23.040  -->  00:00:29.760
And in this part of the course we will download and install an expert advisor will learn how to import

6

00:00:29.760  -->  00:00:37.260
data into the terminal will conduct back tests and optimizations we'll do some forward tests we'll even

7

00:00:37.260  -->  00:00:39.870
run a demo test which will be several weeks long.

8

00:00:39.870  -->  00:00:46.620
So it's an exciting time ahead and I'm really happy that you're on board and very looking forward to

9

00:00:47.160  -->  00:00:48.640
doing a session together.

10

00:00:48.840  -->  00:00:55.380
But before we can proceed Of course we have to understand the expert advisors that will be working with

11

00:00:55.380  -->  00:00:55.400
.

12

00:00:55.410  -->  00:01:00.600
And I would like to introduce you to simple system version 5.0.

13

00:01:00.780  -->  00:01:08.250
This particular algorithmic trading system was originally developed as part of another course that I'm

14

00:01:08.250  -->  00:01:14.200
running which is called algorithmic trading for complete beginners it's a course on programming and

15

00:01:14.210  -->  00:01:20.040
then kill for it's the green course in my series of courses and if you ever want to learn how to program

16

00:01:20.040  -->  00:01:24.790
expert advises in them kill four for the mantra what platform.

17

00:01:24.870  -->  00:01:27.260
I do highly encourage you to check it out.

18

00:01:27.270  -->  00:01:32.970
It's very comprehensive and whether you're a beginner or you have some basic programming knowledge you

19

00:01:32.970  -->  00:01:38.040
will learn from this course and by the end of it you'll be able to create your own for X robots just

20

00:01:38.040  -->  00:01:44.010
like the one we will be using in our current course on testing and optimization.

21

00:01:44.010  -->  00:01:48.050
So we'll be working with this simple system version 5.0.

22

00:01:48.060  -->  00:01:54.960
So I've decided that the best way to introduce you to this expert advisor would be to actually show

23

00:01:54.960  -->  00:02:01.890
you the video which demonstrates how I came up with the idea and how I explained it for the first time

24

00:02:02.280  -->  00:02:09.300
in that course on programming in kill for I hope you'll enjoy it and I'll see you right away on the

25

00:02:09.300  -->  00:02:11.590
other side.

26

00:02:11.640  -->  00:02:16.950
I wanted to come up with a trading system that would program in these in the series of tutorials but

27

00:02:17.220  -->  00:02:23.100
I didn't want it to be just a generic indicator based system or something that we would code just for

28

00:02:23.100  -->  00:02:28.830
the sake of training and practicing and upping our power programming skills I wanted to actually make

29

00:02:28.830  -->  00:02:36.690
it interesting by actually finding a pattern in the market and something that we can exploit and something

30

00:02:36.690  -->  00:02:42.630
that will give our system a chance so that it can actually be profitable and it can bring us money in

31

00:02:42.630  -->  00:02:47.850
the end and that way it'll be more interesting and more fun to create the code for the system.

32

00:02:47.850  -->  00:02:53.340
So what I was doing I was looking at the British pound dollar chart and this is what I found.

33

00:02:53.370  -->  00:02:59.700
I found that often the British pound will at the start of they will move in one direction and then around

34

00:02:59.780  -->  00:03:06.390
nine o'clock maybe eight nine 10 11 o'clock it will actually jump in the opposite direction.

35

00:03:06.420  -->  00:03:11.790
So as you can see here it's the red lines showing that the British pound was going down from the start

36

00:03:11.790  -->  00:03:17.880
of the day from 0 0 to here it's 13 oclock and then jump back up here.

37

00:03:17.910  -->  00:03:19.550
We can see the opposite happening.

38

00:03:19.550  -->  00:03:29.850
The British pound dollar started at one point seven 8:59 went up to 1.7 136 and then a jump or tumbled

39

00:03:29.850  -->  00:03:31.460
all the way back down.

40

00:03:31.920  -->  00:03:36.710
And so this dependency can be observed quite often.

41

00:03:36.780  -->  00:03:42.320
Sometimes you can observe it like for example here on the 16th of July 2014.

42

00:03:42.330  -->  00:03:44.460
It's going flat pretty much now.

43

00:03:44.460  -->  00:03:50.700
No big movements and the biggest span here is about 20 pips can to make a profit of that on British

44

00:03:50.700  -->  00:03:56.130
pound dollar a one charge or one hour chart here.

45

00:03:56.280  -->  00:04:02.370
What you can see is that is just going down just plain down and that's why there's no bounce back up

46

00:04:02.370  -->  00:04:07.150
and that's why I put the x's here meaning that Conry tray.

47

00:04:07.290  -->  00:04:13.950
If we trade we won't make a profit on these days if we try to trade this pattern that we've noticed

48

00:04:14.280  -->  00:04:23.480
over here yesterday on the 18th of July 2014 what happened was it went up and then the British pound

49

00:04:23.480  -->  00:04:26.350
dollar went up and around 10:00 and tumbled all the way down.

50

00:04:26.520  -->  00:04:34.080
So that's that's the depends on notice and that's what we're going to put to try to put at the core

51

00:04:34.080  -->  00:04:41.560
of our system and build a whole training strategy around then of course automated and the process all

52

00:04:41.570  -->  00:04:43.870
right I hope you find that presentation is useful.

53

00:04:43.880  -->  00:04:49.970
And now you know how this simple system expert advisor was created of course what was discussed in the

54

00:04:49.970  -->  00:04:55.100
previous video is just the basic original version of the simple system.

55

00:04:55.130  -->  00:05:00.480
Expert adviser since then there have been multiple modifications and adjustments to the code.

56

00:05:00.710  -->  00:05:06.380
And I just wanted to mention that what you will be presented with in this course is simple system version

57

00:05:06.380  -->  00:05:13.770
5.0 and it is a trading system which is not available anywhere else but this course.

58

00:05:13.790  -->  00:05:19.220
So in a sense that's a proprietary algorithmic trading system which I'll be giving away to you.

59

00:05:19.220  -->  00:05:25.740
And that's exactly what we will be working with further in this course in the rest of this video I wanted

60

00:05:25.760  -->  00:05:31.780
to quickly talk about the improvements which have been made in simple system version 5.0.

61

00:05:31.970  -->  00:05:37.990
So let's go ahead to the venture for trading platform and look at the expert there.

62

00:05:38.270  -->  00:05:44.570
Now I have already installed to the expert advisor into my training terminal but don't worry I will

63

00:05:44.570  -->  00:05:49.880
show you how this is done in the next tutorial for now we just needed because we would like to look

64

00:05:49.880  -->  00:05:51.440
at the parameters.

65

00:05:51.690  -->  00:05:57.960
So I'll bring up the input screen here and we'll just go through them one one by one start.

66

00:05:57.980  -->  00:06:03.210
Our is essentially the hour when we're looking for the training Paran.

67

00:06:03.230  -->  00:06:13.300
And there is something that was outlined in the demonstration video and here the default value is 9

68

00:06:13.310  -->  00:06:15.210
o'clock in the morning.

69

00:06:15.490  -->  00:06:22.340
Many people IMET is a new parameter which has been introduced in a simple system version five point

70

00:06:22.370  -->  00:06:31.190
0 and it is actually a an improvement which was suggested by one of the students in the course on algorithmic

71

00:06:31.190  -->  00:06:37.580
training for complete beginners and it works quite well and we will discuss this further down the track

72

00:06:37.580  -->  00:06:45.350
in the course what it does essentially is it specifies what the minimum distance should be between the

73

00:06:45.350  -->  00:06:52.100
open price of the day and the price of this hour for the expert adviser to be triggered and for it to

74

00:06:52.100  -->  00:06:54.890
be able to create trades.

75

00:06:54.890  -->  00:07:01.140
So if I say 10 pips then if the movement was less than 10 pips and orders won't be triggered.

76

00:07:01.220  -->  00:07:07.800
So it's kind of an additional filter to take profit and Stop-Loss are pretty self-explanatory.

77

00:07:07.930  -->  00:07:14.540
A lot is the law is a parameter which allows it to control the volume of your transactions as a period

78

00:07:14.570  -->  00:07:17.270
and use a filter something we'll discuss now.

79

00:07:17.270  -->  00:07:23.930
So I mean a period was introduced in Version 2.0 which was also developed in the algorithmic training

80

00:07:23.930  -->  00:07:24.770
for beginners course.

81

00:07:24.770  -->  00:07:31.990
However using my filters a switch which was not available then it's only available in version 5.0.

82

00:07:32.060  -->  00:07:35.240
The best way to describe these two parameters is to have a look on the chart.

83

00:07:35.420  -->  00:07:42.710
So what the MLA filter does is it actually allows us to control our transactions and have an additional

84

00:07:42.950  -->  00:07:50.030
point of reference for when we actually want to trade and not if we put a 100 period moving average

85

00:07:50.120  -->  00:07:57.080
onto this chart then you'll see that it just so happens that we are trading up when the price is below

86

00:07:57.080  -->  00:07:58.510
the moving average.

87

00:07:58.610  -->  00:08:05.810
If we go back here a bit and we see two cases when the price went up from the start of the day and then

88

00:08:06.980  -->  00:08:07.990
tumbled down.

89

00:08:08.120  -->  00:08:13.910
And if we look at the same moving average then in this case we were trading down when the price is above

90

00:08:14.000  -->  00:08:15.200
the moving average.

91

00:08:15.250  -->  00:08:23.530
So this is very counterintuitive because usually you would use the moving average as a trend indicator

92

00:08:23.540  -->  00:08:28.360
and when the price is above the moving average that means that it's a bullish market and therefore should

93

00:08:28.760  -->  00:08:31.220
trade by orders.

94

00:08:31.280  -->  00:08:34.520
But in this case we're doing we're creating sell orders and same thing.

95

00:08:34.670  -->  00:08:40.520
On the contrary when the price is below the moving average it's a bearish market and you should be creating

96

00:08:40.520  -->  00:08:41.030
sell orders.

97

00:08:41.030  -->  00:08:43.140
But what we are doing is growing by orders.

98

00:08:43.280  -->  00:08:51.110
And when you think about it it isn't actually a paradox what essentially this means is that we are trading

99

00:08:51.110  -->  00:08:52.010
retracement.

100

00:08:52.010  -->  00:08:57.530
This means that the original movement which is outlined here in blue and here in red at the start of

101

00:08:57.530  -->  00:08:59.950
the day is in line with the trend.

102

00:08:59.960  -->  00:09:06.110
But what we're doing is we're trading in the opposite direction meaning we're catching these smaller

103

00:09:06.110  -->  00:09:12.650
traces and that's perfectly fine and just means that our trading strategy is a counter-trend trading

104

00:09:12.650  -->  00:09:13.560
strategy.

105

00:09:13.640  -->  00:09:19.190
So that's all for today and all of this will make much more sense in the future when we are working

106

00:09:19.220  -->  00:09:25.100
very closely with this expert advise further down the track in the course and I look forward to seeing

107

00:09:25.100  -->  00:09:25.620
you on next.

108

00:09:25.630  -->  00:09:27.590
Tural until then I've been training
