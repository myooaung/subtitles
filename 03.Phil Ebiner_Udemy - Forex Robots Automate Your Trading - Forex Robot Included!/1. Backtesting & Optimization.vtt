00:00:07.470  -->  00:00:09.790
Hello this is Kiril from for X dot com.

2

00:00:09.810  -->  00:00:15.630
And welcome back to the course on testing and optimization in Medicaid for today's tutorial we will

3

00:00:15.660  -->  00:00:23.610
back test and optimize our expert Yser simple system version Oh as you can see I have the strategy tester

4

00:00:23.610  -->  00:00:29.010
window open here and I've already selected the simple system version 5 point 0 4 x robot.

5

00:00:29.010  -->  00:00:32.280
So please go ahead and do that as well.

6

00:00:32.280  -->  00:00:38.160
Next you need to check that the symbol is British pound dollar and that's a very common mistake that

7

00:00:38.160  -->  00:00:44.790
traders forget to set the right symbol and optimize on your dollar and the results of course are wrong

8

00:00:44.810  -->  00:00:45.080
.

9

00:00:45.330  -->  00:00:48.860
Next the period should be one hour.

10

00:00:48.960  -->  00:00:54.270
We won't be using every tick model but we will be using the open process model and this is because as

11

00:00:54.270  -->  00:01:01.290
you recall from a tutorial in section 2 of this course we discussed that expert advisors like simple

12

00:01:01.290  -->  00:01:08.760
system which use only open prices and or close prices in their analysis will always have the same modeling

13

00:01:08.760  -->  00:01:15.570
results on any of these three types of models so we will take advantage of that and that will significantly

14

00:01:15.600  -->  00:01:20.260
reduce the time required for our back tests and optimizations.

15

00:01:20.280  -->  00:01:21.710
In today's tutorial.

16

00:01:22.050  -->  00:01:26.160
Next we'll leave the spread at current the dates that we will use.

17

00:01:26.280  -->  00:01:30.850
I'll just open up a slide from one of the previous tutorials as you can see here.

18

00:01:30.990  -->  00:01:32.950
We want to run back tests and forward tests.

19

00:01:33.090  -->  00:01:35.190
So we'll take four months in total.

20

00:01:35.280  -->  00:01:41.220
All four of the past months will use the first three four back tests and then one month for forward

21

00:01:41.220  -->  00:01:41.880
test.

22

00:01:41.910  -->  00:01:44.400
So let's go ahead and do that.

23

00:01:44.680  -->  00:01:50.040
So like today 8th of September of 2014.

24

00:01:50.100  -->  00:01:53.720
So now we're going to go back four months one two three four.

25

00:01:53.730  -->  00:01:54.910
That's it may.

26

00:01:55.040  -->  00:01:57.120
And then so today and then we'll go back one month.

27

00:01:57.120  -->  00:02:03.360
So this is where we will be running our back tests if we go to expert properties and go to inputs just

28

00:02:03.360  -->  00:02:05.190
check that these are default.

29

00:02:05.250  -->  00:02:11.250
You can do that by clicking reset the default parameters all leave those and click OK and we'll run

30

00:02:11.250  -->  00:02:15.370
our first back test just by clicking right.

31

00:02:15.660  -->  00:02:21.060
As you can see here there's already one trade there's another trade that's a profit that's a loss that

32

00:02:21.060  -->  00:02:22.000
looks like a profit.

33

00:02:22.000  -->  00:02:24.020
Another profit or another profit.

34

00:02:24.030  -->  00:02:28.030
If we look at the graph it's slowly being built over here.

35

00:02:28.110  -->  00:02:30.080
So I'll just speed this up to the max.

36

00:02:30.660  -->  00:02:39.330
As you can see we incurred a loss as a result of this back test and of course we need to improve that

37

00:02:39.330  -->  00:02:41.330
situation by doing some optimizations.

38

00:02:41.340  -->  00:02:45.020
So that's exactly what we'll move on to right now to do.

39

00:02:45.090  -->  00:02:46.800
We'll go to expert properties.

40

00:02:46.800  -->  00:02:48.090
Start with the testing tab.

41

00:02:48.090  -->  00:02:53.280
We want to take genetic algorithm because that's something we'll discuss further down the course and

42

00:02:53.280  -->  00:02:56.180
we don't need today inputs.

43

00:02:56.520  -->  00:02:58.230
We're going to set the following inputs.

44

00:02:58.260  -->  00:03:02.920
So start are we want to optimize every single hour possible.

45

00:03:03.030  -->  00:03:08.940
And so we want to start with 0 step 1 and go up to 23 min limit.

46

00:03:08.940  -->  00:03:13.980
We want to optimize from zero focus step 1 to 10 take profit.

47

00:03:13.980  -->  00:03:18.420
We want to optimize from 10 to 10 to 100.

48

00:03:18.420  -->  00:03:24.850
And of course if your broker is 5 digit then you have to multiply the value of take profit by 10.

49

00:03:24.900  -->  00:03:29.730
Just as with many people limit and Stop-Loss as well.

50

00:03:29.880  -->  00:03:34.250
Stop-Loss who want to optimize 10 10 up to 100 lots.

51

00:03:34.260  -->  00:03:40.180
We don't want to optimize user may feel to want to start with true optimize up to false and MA period

52

00:03:40.180  -->  00:03:40.220
.

53

00:03:40.230  -->  00:03:45.300
We want to optimize something with 10 step of 10 up to 100.

54

00:03:45.300  -->  00:03:46.220
So that's quite a lot.

55

00:03:46.230  -->  00:03:50.040
There'll be a huge number of combinations in these parameters.

56

00:03:50.070  -->  00:03:57.150
And one more thing before we start the optimization we want to go into the optimization tab and we will

57

00:03:57.150  -->  00:04:00.290
discuss limitations further down in the course in more detail.

58

00:04:00.300  -->  00:04:04.590
But today what we want to do is we want to set maximal drawdown to 15.

59

00:04:04.650  -->  00:04:10.080
So just make sure that you after you said it you press enter others won't save.

60

00:04:10.500  -->  00:04:16.380
And what that will do is it will discard sets of parameters that yield a result that has a drawdown

61

00:04:16.380  -->  00:04:17.790
of more than 15 percent.

62

00:04:17.790  -->  00:04:25.190
So basically that will save us some time going through those on undesired result.

63

00:04:25.350  -->  00:04:30.600
So we'll click OK here take the optimization tab and click start.

64

00:04:30.960  -->  00:04:36.600
So as you can see a visual mode was unchecked by itself if Google optimization results we're starting

65

00:04:36.600  -->  00:04:37.920
to see results here.

66

00:04:38.100  -->  00:04:43.860
And I'll just confirm that I have the Skipp useless results check box unchecked.

67

00:04:43.860  -->  00:04:47.520
You can have it checked or checked doesn't really matter if you go to the optimization graph.

68

00:04:47.520  -->  00:04:53.110
We can already see some preliminary results appearing on the chart.

69

00:04:54.090  -->  00:04:56.700
So this line is zero.

70

00:04:56.790  -->  00:05:03.880
And then above is profitable Billos negative So what are we going to do now is because there is such

71

00:05:03.880  -->  00:05:08.440
a huge number of parameters 520000 even an open prices.

72

00:05:08.440  -->  00:05:10.240
Modeling is going to take four minutes.

73

00:05:10.390  -->  00:05:11.610
So I'll just let it finish.

74

00:05:11.620  -->  00:05:17.230
I'll pause the recording for these four minutes and then I'll be back with you once the optimization

75

00:05:17.230  -->  00:05:18.290
has completed.

76

00:05:18.400  -->  00:05:23.580
So the optimization has finished and as you can see it took just over four and a half minutes.

77

00:05:23.680  -->  00:05:30.760
If we go to the optimization results and we pick the best result here which yielded four thousand dollars

78

00:05:32.530  -->  00:05:33.310
in our back tests.

79

00:05:33.310  -->  00:05:36.840
So right click and we'll set input parameters.

80

00:05:37.000  -->  00:05:43.720
If we were unstarted Now then as you can see the visual mode optimization checkbox has been checked

81

00:05:43.720  -->  00:05:44.890
automatically.

82

00:05:44.890  -->  00:05:55.550
Now if we go to Grof this is what the best result looks like and it looks right to for this maybe drawdown

83

00:05:55.570  -->  00:06:01.750
down here so what we'll do is we'll go to settings or go to extra properties this settings that have

84

00:06:01.750  -->  00:06:03.460
been auto populated for us.

85

00:06:03.460  -->  00:06:06.250
We'll save them a simple system.

86

00:06:06.250  -->  00:06:10.850
Underscore one save that yes and OK.

87

00:06:10.870  -->  00:06:16.450
So what I want to do now is I want to pick out best ones that I like from this list of results that

88

00:06:16.960  -->  00:06:20.650
we see here and then save them all.

89

00:06:20.650  -->  00:06:26.560
Like I just did with this one and then use those saved sets to run the four tests.

90

00:06:27.010  -->  00:06:30.760
So let's go to the next one here for example.

91

00:06:30.970  -->  00:06:35.440
It it will look very similar because similar results are next to each other in that report.

92

00:06:35.450  -->  00:06:40.600
But what I want to show you is that the drawdowns are quite high and you might not like that so if we

93

00:06:40.600  -->  00:06:47.070
keep scrolling and you'll see that the next good parameters are here the drawdowns are still substantial

94

00:06:47.080  -->  00:06:53.380
So we said and prepared amateur's that's a very big draw down and say if you don't like that then what

95

00:06:53.380  -->  00:07:00.550
you can do is you can rerun this optimization and set the drawdown limit to 10 percent and that's exactly

96

00:07:00.550  -->  00:07:01.320
what we'll do.

97

00:07:01.420  -->  00:07:07.630
And it will save us some time in our analysis as we won't have to look through these drawdowns that

98

00:07:07.630  -->  00:07:09.230
are higher than 10 percent.

99

00:07:09.340  -->  00:07:15.250
We'll just go to settings exper properties optimization and we'll change this from 15 to 10.

100

00:07:15.340  -->  00:07:16.190
Click Enter.

101

00:07:16.210  -->  00:07:18.550
OK check optimization again.

102

00:07:18.550  -->  00:07:20.300
Just click start.

103

00:07:20.410  -->  00:07:28.540
So once again it will take some time but it will save you time in your visual analysis of the results

104

00:07:28.560  -->  00:07:28.730
.

105

00:07:28.900  -->  00:07:32.260
So I'll be back with you once this is done.

106

00:07:32.830  -->  00:07:38.320
All right as you can see the optimization has been completed and let's go to the result and up here

107

00:07:38.320  -->  00:07:44.050
we have the top results which all have approximately the same profit start hours for.

108

00:07:44.200  -->  00:07:48.170
So scroll down and see if we find any interesting ones.

109

00:07:48.250  -->  00:07:49.950
How about that one.

110

00:07:49.990  -->  00:07:54.610
This one stands out because all of the rest have used them a filter equals zero.

111

00:07:54.610  -->  00:07:56.690
This one has one equals one.

112

00:07:56.920  -->  00:08:01.660
So it doesn't really matter which one we pick because the profit is Gracchus And so we pick that one

113

00:08:02.140  -->  00:08:07.030
set and parameters start and let's have a look at the graph graph looks good.

114

00:08:07.060  -->  00:08:12.230
So we can definitely use this one go forward.

115

00:08:12.230  -->  00:08:15.530
So I'd say that will just change the name of this one.

116

00:08:15.850  -->  00:08:19.210
So we remember that that was our equals 10.

117

00:08:19.720  -->  00:08:25.210
And in this case we said to our equals four.

118

00:08:25.390  -->  00:08:27.390
So go ahead and say that.

119

00:08:27.580  -->  00:08:28.350
OK.

120

00:08:28.570  -->  00:08:30.590
Now let's go find another one.

121

00:08:30.820  -->  00:08:40.270
We've got optimization results and another handy trick I recommend is how they're ordered by profit

122

00:08:40.270  -->  00:08:40.370
.

123

00:08:40.370  -->  00:08:47.200
But now we can look for by just crawling down the street looking for the lowest drawdown that we can

124

00:08:47.200  -->  00:08:47.590
find.

125

00:08:47.590  -->  00:08:51.240
So so far we're a seven.

126

00:08:51.820  -->  00:08:57.760
So basically meaning that it's kind of like still a high profit but the drawdown is really low.

127

00:08:57.760  -->  00:09:09.360
So 7 8 9 still so and see what we can get a 10 6.

128

00:09:09.370  -->  00:09:09.840
Aha.

129

00:09:09.910  -->  00:09:12.400
So you see the drawdowns have dropped to 4.

130

00:09:12.820  -->  00:09:16.410
And the funny thing is that profit is all the same for them.

131

00:09:16.420  -->  00:09:20.250
Four point twenty one and the store hours also the same.

132

00:09:20.250  -->  00:09:24.790
So that's that's kind of an interesting observation.

133

00:09:24.790  -->  00:09:30.370
So let's let's just pick out a random one and look at the chart and the charts.

134

00:09:30.370  -->  00:09:32.110
Pretty cool as well.

135

00:09:32.200  -->  00:09:39.670
Looks like the tech profits are quite low and the Stop-Loss the high and so out of these ones which

136

00:09:39.670  -->  00:09:46.390
you would want to do is because because the results are kind of all the same it doesn't really matter

137

00:09:46.390  -->  00:09:55.470
which one which one you pick but you want to you want to kind of like it just look at the pattern here

138

00:09:55.570  -->  00:10:02.180
and you can see that the stop loss is the take off is fixed but the stop loss is dropping.

139

00:10:02.290  -->  00:10:06.220
So from 198 to 60 50 and 100 and so on.

140

00:10:06.220  -->  00:10:12.220
So you want to you don't want to pick one of the highest A-plus because if this basically means that

141

00:10:13.670  -->  00:10:16.480
it doesn't really matter what's the plus will send these back to us.

142

00:10:16.480  -->  00:10:20.260
But if in the future Stop-Loss is triggered.

143

00:10:20.260  -->  00:10:22.630
You don't want it to be 100 but you don't.

144

00:10:22.670  -->  00:10:28.810
Also you don't want to set it like at the lowest one because in that case maybe there is there will

145

00:10:28.810  -->  00:10:31.270
be a potential in your forward test to trigger it.

146

00:10:31.270  -->  00:10:37.410
So you want to maybe choose somewhere in between and I don't know like I try to go conservative anyways

147

00:10:37.420  -->  00:10:43.750
so maybe let's take stock or 60 and let's just check that the chart is the same.

148

00:10:43.820  -->  00:10:49.240
Got to graph it is the same and it's kind of three Liniers pre-fall chart and it's different to the

149

00:10:49.240  -->  00:10:50.430
ones we've already had.

150

00:10:50.460  -->  00:10:54.710
It's good to have this variety of results in your sets.

151

00:10:54.780  -->  00:10:57.740
And so we'll just go ahead and say that one.

152

00:10:57.760  -->  00:11:01.810
And so that's our answer.

153

00:11:01.810  -->  00:11:05.680
That's the third one we picked our was 8.

154

00:11:05.770  -->  00:11:08.210
So so that's OK.

155

00:11:08.590  -->  00:11:09.940
Now let's move on.

156

00:11:09.940  -->  00:11:17.230
And so that's another way to mix it up is look just look at the ones you have and you know that our

157

00:11:17.230  -->  00:11:19.750
is a very important parameter.

158

00:11:19.810  -->  00:11:21.590
And so far we get 4 8 10.

159

00:11:21.580  -->  00:11:26.800
So how about we look for something in between the first or the lowest to the foreign aid.

160

00:11:26.800  -->  00:11:29.890
So the so for five or six or seven.

161

00:11:30.220  -->  00:11:35.350
And then we go up back so ordered by profit and then we just scroll down and look for the first five

162

00:11:35.350  -->  00:11:37.520
six or seven that we come across.

163

00:11:38.080  -->  00:11:42.610
So it was a mine that was 10 8.

164

00:11:42.780  -->  00:11:48.800
There were seven so if we take the top seven set and pair up and put parameters restart.

165

00:11:49.780  -->  00:11:51.950
And that chart looks a lot like the eight.

166

00:11:51.970  -->  00:11:53.970
But there seems to be more trades.

167

00:11:53.980  -->  00:11:57.510
So we'll go ahead and take that on as well.

168

00:11:57.770  -->  00:11:58.820
Safe.

169

00:11:59.100  -->  00:12:04.710
So this will be four and this one is a seven.

170

00:12:05.410  -->  00:12:06.810
OK.

171

00:12:07.690  -->  00:12:16.100
All right so now let's go from the top and we find the first first one that's not a 4 or not anything

172

00:12:16.150  -->  00:12:18.790
where we have there's nine.

173

00:12:18.790  -->  00:12:21.580
So how are we set parameters.

174

00:12:21.850  -->  00:12:23.360
Start.

175

00:12:23.380  -->  00:12:34.150
The chart is pretty good so I think we'll keep that one expert properties and so will save that 9 1

176

00:12:37.740  -->  00:12:38.620
9.

177

00:12:38.620  -->  00:12:39.490
All right.

178

00:12:40.120  -->  00:12:41.120
OK.

179

00:12:41.560  -->  00:12:46.430
And what I wanted to draw attention to is that this 9 is soul.

180

00:12:46.480  -->  00:12:55.060
It's like solo it's by itself among these four so that that's not really good because you want there

181

00:12:55.060  -->  00:12:55.990
to be many nines.

182

00:12:55.990  -->  00:12:57.910
They want a cluster of them saying that.

183

00:12:57.910  -->  00:13:03.060
Meaning that if you do change the parameters around then the profit doesn't go away too far.

184

00:13:03.220  -->  00:13:07.840
So let's go look for more nines and see if we can find a cluster of them

185

00:13:11.140  -->  00:13:12.070
shouldn't be too far off.

186

00:13:12.070  -->  00:13:18.080
There's another soul nine so there is a cluster of nines.

187

00:13:18.490  -->  00:13:25.930
But what we want is we want results similar to that one and if you if you recall up here or we just

188

00:13:25.930  -->  00:13:28.710
came because we did run the test.

189

00:13:28.720  -->  00:13:33.170
We can just go to the report and you can see here that the profit factor for example was 2.00.

190

00:13:33.190  -->  00:13:37.040
So let's see if we can get a higher profit factor than that.

191

00:13:37.150  -->  00:13:39.260
Just keep scrolling shouldn't be too far.

192

00:13:39.280  -->  00:13:42.340
And bear in mind the profits are all pretty much the same.

193

00:13:42.340  -->  00:13:46.680
So we're not losing too much by scrolling down.

194

00:13:46.840  -->  00:13:47.440
So there we go.

195

00:13:47.440  -->  00:13:49.470
So those are two two point fourteen.

196

00:13:49.520  -->  00:13:51.330
That's that that is in Paramus.

197

00:13:51.340  -->  00:13:52.310
That's a good chart.

198

00:13:52.600  -->  00:13:55.810
And there's another one that's also good chart.

199

00:13:55.810  -->  00:13:57.280
And you can see they're very similar.

200

00:13:57.430  -->  00:14:06.220
So what we will do is in the next to Tauriel I'll show you how to use these parameters to run a more

201

00:14:06.220  -->  00:14:14.290
precise optimization around this particular night set to start with start our 9.

202

00:14:14.380  -->  00:14:16.630
I think that's enough optimizations for one day.

203

00:14:16.660  -->  00:14:17.860
We'll continue next time.

204

00:14:18.010  -->  00:14:21.250
And until then Happy training.
