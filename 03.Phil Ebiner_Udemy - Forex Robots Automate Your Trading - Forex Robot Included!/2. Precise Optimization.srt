00:00:07,350  -->  00:00:09,620
Hello this is Kirill from forexboat dot com.

2

00:00:09,690  -->  00:00:13,800
And welcome back to the course on testing and optimization and marriage headed for.

3

00:00:14,070  -->  00:00:21,270
And today we will run a more precise optimization of this particular set of parameters or of this cluster

4

00:00:21,270  -->  00:00:22,450
of sets.

5

00:00:22,470  -->  00:00:24,440
Start with our 9.

6

00:00:24,750  -->  00:00:28,900
So in order to do that you need to right click Set and prepare amateur's.

7

00:00:29,040  -->  00:00:35,220
We can run the tests just to see the result and what we want to do now is to go into text properties

8

00:00:35,590  -->  00:00:39,440
and uncheck start our meaning that we will keep it constant.

9

00:00:39,450  -->  00:00:41,420
We will not change it and it will.

10

00:00:41,420  -->  00:00:45,860
It will be nice for this optimization that will follow.

11

00:00:46,030  -->  00:00:48,700
And now we want to check if.

12

00:00:48,720  -->  00:00:57,140
Which of the sets around these particular parameters very in very close proximity to them.

13

00:00:57,600  -->  00:00:58,450
Is the best one.

14

00:00:58,470  -->  00:01:02,600
So what are we going to do is we going to optimize around these parameters.

15

00:01:02,730  -->  00:01:06,850
And this is technique that is very often used in optimization.

16

00:01:06,930  -->  00:01:11,250
So we are going to start at 6 move step 1 and go up to 10.

17

00:01:11,280  -->  00:01:19,320
That means that will check the values for a min limit of 6 7 8 9 and 10 and 8 is in the middle.

18

00:01:19,320  -->  00:01:20,890
And thats exactly what you want.

19

00:01:20,940  -->  00:01:26,260
And also I would like to stress once again for those of you who are using a five digit broker that in

20

00:01:26,460  -->  00:01:34,200
this particular expert vizor the easiest way to make your make it work for a five digit broker is to

21

00:01:34,500  -->  00:01:38,930
multiply mean limit take profit Stop-Loss everywhere in your settings by 10.

22

00:01:39,090  -->  00:01:46,680
So to be eighty thousand three hundred and same thing would apply in the Start step and stop values

23

00:01:46,690  -->  00:01:47,100
.

24

00:01:47,430  -->  00:01:48,330
So take profit.

25

00:01:48,360  -->  00:01:51,700
We know its a hundred in this particular set.

26

00:01:51,770  -->  00:01:53,160
We want to optimize around that.

27

00:01:53,160  -->  00:01:56,330
So we want to go start at 90.

28

00:01:56,910  -->  00:02:07,350
Step two and go to 110 and that puts a 100 in the middle and that will give us 20 steps from 90 to 100

29

00:02:07,350  -->  00:02:07,590
.

30

00:02:07,620  -->  00:02:11,790
Its five steps from 100 to 110 thats another five steps.

31

00:02:12,060  -->  00:02:19,740
Stop-Loss here is 30 so we want optimize from 20 step up to about 40 and you can do smaller steps you

32

00:02:19,740  -->  00:02:22,870
can do step 1 and do that for example or Fehmi period.

33

00:02:22,890  -->  00:02:26,680
So 17 is put in the middle.

34

00:02:26,700  -->  00:02:32,230
So will start at 16 will step 1 and will go up to 80.

35

00:02:32,250  -->  00:02:38,390
So that will give us a more precise optimization We'll find out exactly which parameters are the best

36

00:02:38,400  -->  00:02:43,020
to start our line in the vicinity of these products that we have.

37

00:02:43,200  -->  00:02:50,580
So going to click okay optimization and will just go kick start the optimization is much faster now

38

00:02:50,580  -->  00:02:55,960
because there is a lower number of parameters and will go Siggraph.

39

00:02:56,280  -->  00:02:57,770
Very interesting graph.

40

00:02:57,840  -->  00:03:04,090
Sometimes they can be quite amusing and there we go.

41

00:03:04,210  -->  00:03:09,700
The results so let's see what the best set of parameters is.

42

00:03:09,840  -->  00:03:14,170
As you can see start our has been moved to the back because it's no longer an optimized parameter.

43

00:03:14,340  -->  00:03:23,550
And then we have the optimized parameters here so many people it is a take profit is 106 plus 28 a filter

44

00:03:23,730  -->  00:03:23,810
.

45

00:03:23,810  -->  00:03:25,920
True and a period 71.

46

00:03:25,920  -->  00:03:31,380
So what are we going to do now as we roll right click Set and parameters start and we'll just check

47

00:03:31,380  -->  00:03:34,180
out the graph gross graph hasn't changed much.

48

00:03:34,350  -->  00:03:41,360
But if you look at the profit then you can see that there is maybe one trade difference because 3000

49

00:03:41,370  -->  00:03:43,730
here the next those 2356.

50

00:03:43,950  -->  00:03:46,010
So it does change a little bit.

51

00:03:46,050  -->  00:03:53,820
And if you want to get the best results for your expert wiser then sometimes it's worth optimizing around

52

00:03:53,820  -->  00:03:55,350
the parameters you've set.

53

00:03:55,770  -->  00:04:02,940
It won't really help you if this that original set that we used was curve fitted set.

54

00:04:02,940  -->  00:04:09,070
So it wasn't a true set that will survive in market conditions.

55

00:04:09,120  -->  00:04:14,540
But if in case it was then we can maybe improve marginally improve your result.

56

00:04:14,550  -->  00:04:19,930
And if you're trading large volumes that can be something that you'd want to do.

57

00:04:19,980  -->  00:04:28,380
So we go ahead and save that and we'll save that as simple system set 6 9 9 b for example.

58

00:04:28,380  -->  00:04:32,290
So that's all we have success.

59

00:04:32,310  -->  00:04:35,520
I think that's enough just just have a look.

60

00:04:35,680  -->  00:04:37,770
We have six sets I think that's enough for now.

61

00:04:37,920  -->  00:04:45,770
What we want to do next is run all forward tests and pick out the best ones out of these sets.

62

00:04:45,780  -->  00:04:48,980
So we'll do that next tural and I hope to see you then.

63

00:04:49,020  -->  00:04:51,030
Until next time hepi training
