00:00:00,960  -->  00:00:03,500
Hello hello this is Kirill from forexboat dot com.

2

00:00:03,510  -->  00:00:10,160
And welcome back to the course on testing and optimization in meditator for so Louis quick video.

3

00:00:10,200  -->  00:00:16,920
I wanted to show you how to set up your terminal so that the expert or adviser can actually perform

4

00:00:17,430  -->  00:00:19,400
live or demo trades.

5

00:00:19,410  -->  00:00:26,280
So here I've got a demo terminal open in front of me and I've got a simple system version 7 here somewhere

6

00:00:26,280  -->  00:00:26,670
.

7

00:00:26,670  -->  00:00:33,320
If I just drag it onto the chart then you will see that one side you know set of my inputs and everything

8

00:00:33,320  -->  00:00:34,740
is good here.

9

00:00:34,740  -->  00:00:43,330
When I click OK here the simple system I can has like a frowny face and that means that the expert adviser

10

00:00:43,370  -->  00:00:46,590
is not operational it's not working.

11

00:00:46,590  -->  00:00:48,770
And so now we're going to rectify this issue.

12

00:00:48,960  -->  00:00:54,000
So I'm going to ride click and I'm going to remove the expert adviser.

13

00:00:54,070  -->  00:00:56,730
Now there's two things that you have to pay attention to.

14

00:00:56,730  -->  00:01:02,690
So first of all this button over here this arbitrating when it's red that means it's off.

15

00:01:02,760  -->  00:01:05,510
If you click it mate makes it green.

16

00:01:05,530  -->  00:01:12,150
Now trading is on and there needs to be green but that's kind of the the very quick switch when you

17

00:01:12,160  -->  00:01:18,090
just installing the extra adviser you have to go into the settings of the terminal and fix everything

18

00:01:18,090  -->  00:01:19,390
up there first.

19

00:01:19,410  -->  00:01:28,170
So we're going to go to Tools Options up at the top here and we get this window pop up.

20

00:01:28,320  -->  00:01:33,630
And usually it's on like on the first page you need to go to the expert advisors tab and this is what

21

00:01:33,630  -->  00:01:42,120
it looks like in the recent builds of a trader for us so we're talking build seven hundred and sixty

22

00:01:42,120  -->  00:01:48,130
five plus I used to look very different but this is the most recent one.

23

00:01:48,150  -->  00:01:54,390
So here you have to click allow automated trading and that's basically this is pretty much the same

24

00:01:54,390  -->  00:01:55,320
as clicking this button.

25

00:01:55,320  -->  00:02:03,170
So when you click this button at the top the red green one it will trigger this checkbox.

26

00:02:03,360  -->  00:02:10,020
But in here within the checkbox we have to set up our own preferences so the first one is disable automated

27

00:02:10,020  -->  00:02:12,500
trading when the count has been changed.

28

00:02:12,510  -->  00:02:17,640
I recommend keeping that on on because if you've changed your counting your terminal which I don't recommend

29

00:02:17,640  -->  00:02:18,060
doing.

30

00:02:18,090  -->  00:02:23,850
But if you have then probably you don't want the same expert advisors running on that other account

31

00:02:23,880  -->  00:02:28,240
as well disable automated trading when the profile has been changed.

32

00:02:28,390  -->  00:02:33,210
Yes I I also keep that one on even though I don't normally change profiles at all.

33

00:02:33,570  -->  00:02:34,770
But just in case.

34

00:02:34,980  -->  00:02:39,810
Disable automated trading when the charge symbol or period has been changed.

35

00:02:39,810  -->  00:02:46,230
I also like to keep that on on and that is because if your expert advisor is designed for the already

36

00:02:46,250  -->  00:02:51,980
time frame and you accidentally switch to the daily time frame you want to make sure you expedite and

37

00:02:52,040  -->  00:02:54,010
wiser is switched off.

38

00:02:54,030  -->  00:02:59,880
Once again that's something I don't recommend doing ever changing the charts a when expert advisors

39

00:02:59,880  -->  00:03:00,680
are running on them.

40

00:03:00,690  -->  00:03:07,590
But if that happens by accident you're probably better off if they spurred wise it turns off.

41

00:03:07,770  -->  00:03:11,610
Otherwise it can make a lot of mistakes lot of imports.

42

00:03:11,640  -->  00:03:18,460
So if your expert advisor is running using DL else then you should switch Hassan and I will switch it

43

00:03:18,460  -->  00:03:19,730
on.

44

00:03:19,920  -->  00:03:26,060
Most expert advisors or simple expert advisors like simple system don't use deal else but you'd rather

45

00:03:26,060  -->  00:03:33,900
have this on in case you do want an expert or wiser deal else on so that you don't forget to turn this

46

00:03:33,960  -->  00:03:40,380
option on when when the time comes and allow web requests from list the Jor-El's.

47

00:03:40,800  -->  00:03:49,650
I don't really use expert advisors that go too suddenly or sometimes that happens when your expert advisor

48

00:03:50,520  -->  00:03:59,250
tries to find out news or CRN algorithms that are proprietary and are hosted on web so I usually don't

49

00:03:59,250  -->  00:04:04,800
switch to sun unless I specifically see that in this tractions of my supervisor.

50

00:04:04,800  -->  00:04:06,340
So now we click OK.

51

00:04:06,420  -->  00:04:09,080
As you can see our trading is enabled.

52

00:04:09,150  -->  00:04:12,210
It's very simple to switch it off switch it back on.

53

00:04:12,210  -->  00:04:14,290
You don't have to go back into the settings anymore.

54

00:04:14,300  -->  00:04:17,130
Now your terminal is set up.

55

00:04:17,240  -->  00:04:23,460
I know you just click click drag your simple system expert vizor you put in all your settings as you

56

00:04:23,460  -->  00:04:26,430
like click OK and there you go.

57

00:04:26,430  -->  00:04:33,340
So now simple system version 7.0 is running and there is a smiley face and that some That's a good thing

58

00:04:33,340  -->  00:04:37,830
that means that the expert adviser is ready to roll.

59

00:04:38,250  -->  00:04:43,140
Once again just make sure that you are always aware of the state of this button.

60

00:04:43,380  -->  00:04:49,860
If it's red that means your expert advisers have been switched off and they're not making any trades

61

00:04:50,040  -->  00:04:53,280
at the moment so I hope that was helpful.

62

00:04:53,280  -->  00:04:55,150
I look forward to seeing you on the next Tauriel.

63

00:04:55,200  -->  00:04:57,150
And until then happy trading
