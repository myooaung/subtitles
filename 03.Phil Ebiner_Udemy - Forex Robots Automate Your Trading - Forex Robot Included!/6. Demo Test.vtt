00:00:07.560  -->  00:00:09.650
Hello this is Kirill from forexboat dot com.

2

00:00:09.690  -->  00:00:15.030
And welcome back to the course on testing and optimization in meditator for today is going to be a very

3

00:00:15.030  -->  00:00:21.570
exciting tutorial because so far we've done our back tests our optimizations and our forward tests and

4

00:00:21.570  -->  00:00:25.910
today's the day we finally get to launch our demo test.

5

00:00:26.160  -->  00:00:32.670
As you can see here I have four different Ameritrade or four terminals open and the markets have just

6

00:00:32.670  -->  00:00:36.230
fired up it's just past midnight according to server time.

7

00:00:36.480  -->  00:00:43.580
And we're going to be using these four metro to four terminals to launch four separate tests or two

8

00:00:43.610  -->  00:00:50.140
sets of parameters for our expert advise a simple system version five point 0.

9

00:00:50.370  -->  00:00:57.810
And then we'll be tracking the progress of these separate sets on these four different demo accounts

10

00:00:58.020  -->  00:00:59.430
over the coming weeks.

11

00:00:59.490  -->  00:01:03.990
All of this is actually happening on a virtual private server.

12

00:01:04.200  -->  00:01:10.020
And I can demonstrate that to you by just making this window a bit smaller and moving around.

13

00:01:10.020  -->  00:01:19.260
So this over here at the bar behind me is my computer this window is actually a virtual private server

14

00:01:19.260  -->  00:01:21.390
which is located somewhere elsewhere in the world.

15

00:01:21.410  -->  00:01:27.780
And I've launched the military installed and launched Ameritrade has four terminals on the virtual private

16

00:01:27.780  -->  00:01:34.230
server and I'm going to keep it running 24/7 that way we can avoid any interruptions to these demo tests

17

00:01:34.230  -->  00:01:34.990
.

18

00:01:35.010  -->  00:01:40.910
Now I have already copied the expert advise it to the terminals as you can see over here.

19

00:01:41.100  -->  00:01:46.530
However now I we need to copy the sets of parameters so how do we do that.

20

00:01:46.530  -->  00:01:53.520
Well if I go to my computer of the virtual private server you'll see that I can only access the local

21

00:01:53.520  -->  00:01:56.810
drive of the DP.

22

00:01:57.030  -->  00:02:02.000
Now I'll show you how to get these files onto the virtual private server.

23

00:02:02.400  -->  00:02:08.030
We're going to close this window so that will keep our virtual private server running.

24

00:02:08.370  -->  00:02:11.530
But at the same time we'll just to close the connection to it.

25

00:02:11.760  -->  00:02:13.670
So we won't see what's happening.

26

00:02:13.830  -->  00:02:16.480
Now I've already prepared these files over here.

27

00:02:16.870  -->  00:02:23.380
Now in this folder on my D drive is called files for my forex VPS.

28

00:02:23.390  -->  00:02:27.280
And then in the fall some folder sets I have the four sets that we want to run.

29

00:02:27.450  -->  00:02:37.100
So if I launch my BP connection now and I go to Options local resources more drives she not all dredges

30

00:02:37.110  -->  00:02:38.120
the D drive.

31

00:02:38.250  -->  00:02:40.580
I click OK connect.

32

00:02:40.800  -->  00:02:42.070
Yes.

33

00:02:42.780  -->  00:02:47.560
And what you'll see now is that I'm actually allowing the server to access my

34

00:02:50.240  -->  00:02:52.310
Majdi drive remotely.

35

00:02:52.590  -->  00:03:00.570
And now if we go to my computer here right away you can see the D drive on my computer at home which

36

00:03:00.570  -->  00:03:01.320
is which is great.

37

00:03:01.320  -->  00:03:05.430
That means now I can transfer the files very seamlessly.

38

00:03:05.430  -->  00:03:08.190
I'm just going to access the D drive right now.

39

00:03:08.190  -->  00:03:08.810
There we go.

40

00:03:08.820  -->  00:03:20.340
And now I need to find files for my forex VPS and sets.

41

00:03:20.520  -->  00:03:26.850
And as you can see the files are being copied to my virtual private server desktop.

42

00:03:26.850  -->  00:03:32.940
So while that's copying I just wanted to mention that these tips and tricks are on setting up your virtual

43

00:03:32.940  -->  00:03:37.280
private server and actually some but very important and useful information.

44

00:03:37.280  -->  00:03:43.400
They can all be found in my course which is called FOREX BOAT VPS set up for algorithmic trading.

45

00:03:43.740  -->  00:03:49.950
It's a course that I developed over the years of my experience of working with Witchell private servers

46

00:03:49.980  -->  00:03:57.990
and apart from Handey things like copying files like this from this course you can learn how to set

47

00:03:57.990  -->  00:04:04.830
up your virtual private server in a way that it is failsafe that if something happens and because of

48

00:04:04.830  -->  00:04:10.500
some maintenance Shettles it reboots then automatically your metatrader 4 terminals will self launch

49

00:04:10.500  -->  00:04:18.940
and they'll be a watchdog making sure that the connection is right with your server and so on.

50

00:04:18.940  -->  00:04:26.640
So very detailed guide on how to set up your virtual processor for reliable for extruding So check out

51

00:04:26.640  -->  00:04:30.090
that course if if you're interested if you using VIPIR servers.

52

00:04:30.570  -->  00:04:34.530
You can fight it on you Jimmy or you can find it on my web site.

53

00:04:34.560  -->  00:04:41.130
It is a premium course but if you are using virtual processors for real trading then it can actually

54

00:04:42.270  -->  00:04:49.130
definitely benefit you in the sense of minimizing your risks and exposure during trading.

55

00:04:49.170  -->  00:04:57.270
All right so back to our course now if we open these terminals and we want we we just want to launch

56

00:04:57.270  -->  00:04:59.150
the expert advisor now.

57

00:04:59.410  -->  00:05:03.570
And so that we have a whole test running from the start of this week.

58

00:05:04.740  -->  00:05:06.460
There we go so we're starting the test.

59

00:05:06.520  -->  00:05:09.630
I'm still saying 7th September.

60

00:05:09.780  -->  00:05:16.750
It's actually according to server time it's Monday the 8th of September 2014 so we're on the run it

61

00:05:16.770  -->  00:05:19.300
maybe for a couple of weeks starting from today.

62

00:05:19.770  -->  00:05:23.140
So all we want to do is copy simple system already.

63

00:05:23.180  -->  00:05:29.080
I've already allowed all the trading we're going to choose for inputs we're going to choose our sets

64

00:05:29.080  -->  00:05:32.690
of parameters and they're located on the desktop sets.

65

00:05:32.730  -->  00:05:38.370
So this one will be said one to turn our set and so 10.

66

00:05:38.590  -->  00:05:39.790
Yep that looks good.

67

00:05:39.810  -->  00:05:40.150
Okay.

68

00:05:40.150  -->  00:05:46.790
So run run that as you can see is expert advise has been launched.

69

00:05:46.860  -->  00:05:48.420
Simple system here.

70

00:05:48.460  -->  00:05:49.920
We're going to launch a second one

71

00:05:52.180  -->  00:05:54.490
.

72

00:05:54.530  -->  00:05:55.160
Okay.

73

00:05:55.170  -->  00:06:06.690
So set by the way I ordered these sets and the numbers of these sets correspond to the amount of profit

74

00:06:06.690  -->  00:06:11.830
they yielded during our back test and including for it.

75

00:06:11.890  -->  00:06:17.950
So that is that was that was the most profitable set the second most profitable set.

76

00:06:17.940  -->  00:06:25.200
This is going to be the third other are the ones that we chose of course.

77

00:06:25.200  -->  00:06:27.770
So we're just launching one more.

78

00:06:28.860  -->  00:06:30.570
And finally the last one

79

00:06:33.670  -->  00:06:38.920
.

80

00:06:40.980  -->  00:06:42.080
Okay.

81

00:06:42.450  -->  00:06:50.550
So there we go all expert advisors launched and we'll check in soon to see how it's all going.
