00:00:07,860  -->  00:00:10,350
Hello this is Kirill from forexboat dot com.

2

00:00:10,350  -->  00:00:16,740
And welcome back to the course on testing and optimization in Medicare for now that we have made a trader

3

00:00:16,740  -->  00:00:23,280
for successfully installed and we have a demo account up and running today we can focus on the strategy

4

00:00:23,280  -->  00:00:28,360
tester window and the navigation controls that operated.

5

00:00:28,370  -->  00:00:36,720
So here in front of you you can see the trailer for platform and at the bottom here we have the Terminal

6

00:00:37,020  -->  00:00:37,430
window.

7

00:00:37,440  -->  00:00:41,330
And this is what your platform will look like if you've opened it for the first time.

8

00:00:41,850  -->  00:00:46,770
And you can see your demo account name and number over here on the left.

9

00:00:46,770  -->  00:00:54,750
If we click around in the terminal tab in the terminal tabs you will notice that there isn't a tab for

10

00:00:54,750  -->  00:01:00,900
the strategy tester and that is because the strategy Tester has its own separate window which we can

11

00:01:00,900  -->  00:01:05,090
open by pressing this button over here which is called the strategy tester.

12

00:01:05,220  -->  00:01:06,850
So just go ahead and do that.

13

00:01:07,080  -->  00:01:12,750
As you can see a new window has popped up at the bottom here which is called the tester window.

14

00:01:12,750  -->  00:01:17,280
Now we want to close the terminal window because we don't have any active trades that we need to monitor

15

00:01:17,280  -->  00:01:19,880
and we don't really need the terminal window at this stage.

16

00:01:19,950  -->  00:01:26,340
We can do that either by clicking the terminal button over here or alternatively we can just click the

17

00:01:26,720  -->  00:01:29,120
button or we're here on the top left.

18

00:01:29,340  -->  00:01:31,330
So it will go ahead and do that.

19

00:01:31,410  -->  00:01:37,860
And now the first thing that it will do we'll just pull this navigate a bar tab to the right so that

20

00:01:38,250  -->  00:01:41,380
we can see a bit more of these two windows.

21

00:01:41,700  -->  00:01:49,630
Now at the bottom we have the tester window and I already have a expert advisor and symbol selected

22

00:01:49,630  -->  00:01:49,660
.

23

00:01:49,660  -->  00:01:55,910
Yours are probably blank at this stage but we'll fix that shortly.

24

00:01:55,950  -->  00:02:02,580
So there are quite a few controls here and let's go through them one by one to understand what they

25

00:02:02,580  -->  00:02:03,310
do.

26

00:02:03,420  -->  00:02:10,890
The first control allows you to select an expert advisor and basically that means you have to specify

27

00:02:10,890  -->  00:02:12,660
which forex robot you want to test.

28

00:02:12,660  -->  00:02:20,580
And as you can see these expert advisors here present the same ones which you can see in your expert

29

00:02:20,580  -->  00:02:23,850
advisers folder in the Navigator.

30

00:02:23,850  -->  00:02:28,470
And basically that means that you can select any one of the expert advisers that's installed in your

31

00:02:28,710  -->  00:02:29,830
platform currently.

32

00:02:30,120  -->  00:02:35,380
And at this stage it's just the two prepackaged expert advisors that come with marriage for.

33

00:02:35,550  -->  00:02:41,580
So we'll go ahead and select the moving average and go we'll move on to the next control the next control

34

00:02:41,580  -->  00:02:43,200
is the symbol here.

35

00:02:43,320  -->  00:02:49,170
You can choose from a variety of different financial instruments on which you would like to test your

36

00:02:49,170  -->  00:02:50,420
expert buys.

37

00:02:50,970  -->  00:02:55,020
And these are the same financial instruments as you have here in the market.

38

00:02:55,020  -->  00:03:02,850
Watch next is the period and the periods in the right here are currently selected the hourly period

39

00:03:02,850  -->  00:03:04,030
is selected.

40

00:03:04,290  -->  00:03:08,420
You can select any other period on which you want to test your most expert advisor.

41

00:03:08,430  -->  00:03:15,600
And the reason for this control is because med trader 4 has historically been developed in a very specific

42

00:03:15,600  -->  00:03:24,360
way and there are ways that if you launch an expert advisor on on a chart you're not only launching

43

00:03:24,360  -->  00:03:30,360
it on that financial instrument but you're also launching it on that specific timeframe of the chart

44

00:03:30,360  -->  00:03:30,390
.

45

00:03:30,390  -->  00:03:38,970
So let's let's look an example if I open a Eurodollar here and I choose for hourly chart then launching

46

00:03:38,970  -->  00:03:42,880
an expert advisor on the hourly chart will be different.

47

00:03:42,880  -->  00:03:48,540
We're launching an expert advise on the four hours each hour and that is applicable to all expert advisors

48

00:03:48,720  -->  00:03:55,670
except for the cases when they're specifically coded in a way that disregards the period on which they're

49

00:03:55,680  -->  00:03:57,940
launched which is quite rare usually.

50

00:03:58,110  -->  00:04:03,720
Expert advisors use the bars of the period they're launched on or the chart that launched on them for

51

00:04:03,720  -->  00:04:11,260
the period has a significant influence that feature of traitor for is different for example to the Duke

52

00:04:11,280  -->  00:04:17,220
is called PJ for its platform where if you want an expert advisor or for X robot you launch it on a

53

00:04:17,220  -->  00:04:23,760
financial instrument and then within the expert adviser itself the code has to decide which periods

54

00:04:23,760  -->  00:04:30,140
it will work with in military or for it's not like that imagery for the period which are launching the

55

00:04:30,160  -->  00:04:35,800
expert advisor on has significant influence on the outcomes and performance of the 4 x robot.

56

00:04:35,820  -->  00:04:41,790
So that's why you should always remember to choose the correct period for your expert adviser.

57

00:04:41,790  -->  00:04:45,400
Now let's move on to the next control which is the model.

58

00:04:45,450  -->  00:04:51,920
We'll talk about these three different types of models separately in another tutorial in the scores

59

00:04:51,920  -->  00:04:51,960
.

60

00:04:51,960  -->  00:04:59,220
But for now it's sufficient for us to understand that open prices is the least precise model for testing

61

00:04:59,250  -->  00:05:05,670
but it is the fastest one for testing control points is the average and every tick is the most precise

62

00:05:05,670  -->  00:05:06,030
model.

63

00:05:06,030  -->  00:05:09,480
But it takes the longest to run tests on the small.

64

00:05:09,500  -->  00:05:12,530
Next we're going to move on to the date controls.

65

00:05:12,540  -->  00:05:18,270
So here you can specify a date where within which you want to test the expert advice.

66

00:05:18,270  -->  00:05:25,020
So for example if you want to test it from the start of this year then you just put in first of January

67

00:05:25,020  -->  00:05:27,910
and then you can add up to today or you can test it up to us.

68

00:05:27,960  -->  00:05:37,800
Any other date in the past visual mode will specify whether you want to see how the test is progressing

69

00:05:37,800  -->  00:05:44,400
on the chart over here or if you just want to get the results if you take this you'll just get the result

70

00:05:44,400  -->  00:05:47,490
for the test before it actually seen when the trades were open.

71

00:05:47,490  -->  00:05:52,920
So obviously we'll find the visual motets Foster with visual Moji you get to see when the trades are

72

00:05:52,920  -->  00:05:53,650
occurring.

73

00:05:53,880  -->  00:06:01,110
Skip to allows you to skip to a certain date during a visual mode test so if you set the date like say

74

00:06:01,250  -->  00:06:06,330
a second of June and you start from the start of the year you can watch it at the start of the year

75

00:06:06,330  -->  00:06:09,040
and then click skip to and skip to a certain date.

76

00:06:09,040  -->  00:06:12,810
Next the spread parameter here is quite new.

77

00:06:12,810  -->  00:06:19,200
I think it was introduced in one of the recent builds and if you're using me as a traitor for above

78

00:06:19,380  -->  00:06:22,200
build 600 then you definitely should have it.

79

00:06:22,200  -->  00:06:28,380
And this allows you to specify which spread you want to test your expert advice.

80

00:06:28,470  -->  00:06:33,480
It's a very convenient function as you can see here the spade right now is to Pip's I might want to

81

00:06:33,480  -->  00:06:38,070
test my expert was with five pips in there you can choose and you can also enter any other value you

82

00:06:38,070  -->  00:06:40,570
want in here you don't have to select one of the dropdown.

83

00:06:40,710  -->  00:06:43,640
The optimization button will talk about that later.

84

00:06:43,650  -->  00:06:49,410
But basically it allows you to optimize your expert was also there's a few controls in the right here

85

00:06:49,830  -->  00:06:56,100
modify expert Darell going to kill for to change the code for the expert visor open chart.

86

00:06:56,100  -->  00:07:02,000
I never use that bottom myself but basically I guess it just opens the chart symbol properties.

87

00:07:02,010  -->  00:07:08,280
Also we'll talk about that separately and expert property bring expert properties brings up the parameters

88

00:07:08,280  -->  00:07:10,160
of the expert advisors.

89

00:07:10,200  -->  00:07:13,920
So we'll talk about this more in the coming to Tyrol's.

90

00:07:14,250  -->  00:07:19,110
I look forward to seeing you there if you're watching and you do subscribe to the channel to be notified

91

00:07:19,110  -->  00:07:20,410
when I post next.

92

00:07:20,410  -->  00:07:23,530
Bridget Tauriel and until then Happy training
