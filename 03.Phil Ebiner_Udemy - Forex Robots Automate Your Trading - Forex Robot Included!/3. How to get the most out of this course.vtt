Hello this is Kirill from forexboat dot com.

2

00:00:09.450  -->  00:00:14.790
And welcome back to the course and today Sitara will give you a few quick tips on how to get the most

3

00:00:15.120  -->  00:00:17.400
value out of this course.

4

00:00:17.610  -->  00:00:22.660
So a little before tips and the first one is watch these videos in high resolution.

5

00:00:22.650  -->  00:00:27.540
There's a bottom at the bottom that you can click and that will switch the resolution to the highest

6

00:00:27.540  -->  00:00:28.270
possible.

7

00:00:28.470  -->  00:00:34.620
And in that way the picture will be more sharp and you'll be able to see the finer details which is

8

00:00:34.620  -->  00:00:39.850
quite important for our video so please watch his videos in higher resolution.

9

00:00:40.230  -->  00:00:44.320
Second one is do the quizzes the quizzes are very useful and handy.

10

00:00:44.490  -->  00:00:48.600
Some of the questions are pretty simple but will still help you keep on track.

11

00:00:48.600  -->  00:00:53.640
Some of the questions are trick questions and will help you have a little bit of fun along the way.

12

00:00:53.640  -->  00:00:54.560
Follow along.

13

00:00:54.690  -->  00:00:59.270
You'll notice that a substantial part of this course is dedicated to the practical side of things.

14

00:00:59.400  -->  00:01:05.040
So it will be highly beneficial if you're able to follow what I'm doing my computer and replicate that

15

00:01:05.420  -->  00:01:11.540
in and that'll help you take advantage of not only the TerraCycle site but also the practical side scores

16

00:01:11.650  -->  00:01:11.980
.

17

00:01:12.300  -->  00:01:18.100
And finally I refer to the folks about Web site for supplementary materials.

18

00:01:18.210  -->  00:01:24.570
You will notice me mentioning the Web site a few times and sometimes we will have to download things

19

00:01:24.750  -->  00:01:31.650
that I have hosted over there but always feel free to just jump on the website and find any additional

20

00:01:31.650  -->  00:01:34.570
materials that can help you through this course.

21

00:01:34.590  -->  00:01:40.830
Those are the main four things that will help you achieve the maximum value out of the scores and I

22

00:01:40.830  -->  00:01:43.260
look forward to seeing you in the next tutorial.

23

00:01:43.260  -->  00:01:44.520
Until then heavy training
