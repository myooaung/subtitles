00:00:01.029 --> 00:00:01.307
Okay.

2
00:00:01.307 --> 00:00:06.858
So let's summarize what we learned in this course, and where you can go next.

3
00:00:06.858 --> 00:00:13.880
We saw big differences between three different styles and types of JSON API.

4
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:14.286
Firstly,

5
00:00:14.286 --> 00:00:18.351
you saw a binding API where the mapping between Java

6
00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:20.193
objects in JSON was automatic.

7
00:00:20.193 --> 00:00:25.310
This was a really good way of getting started and a really good default choice.

8
00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.806
In most applications, this is the best thing to use.

9
00:00:28.806 --> 00:00:34.204
Then, you saw a tree or DOM-style API as some of us call it.

10
00:00:34.204 --> 00:00:37.463
This enables you to write generic code that works on

11
00:00:37.463 --> 00:00:39.886
different types of documents more easily.

12
00:00:39.886 --> 00:00:43.698
For example, tooling to inspect or process JSON documents.

13
00:00:43.698 --> 00:00:48.708
This API is more involved to work with compared to just binding.

14
00:00:48.708 --> 00:00:51.212
Finally, you saw a streaming API.

15
00:00:51.212 --> 00:00:55.725
This offered the best performance in code as there was no need to

16
00:00:55.725 --> 00:00:58.318
construct an in-memory representation of the JSON document.

17
00:00:58.318 --> 00:01:02.423
It also offered the lowest memory consumption for the same reasons.

18
00:01:02.423 --> 00:01:07.215
The streaming API is often most time consuming to work with.

19
00:01:07.215 --> 00:01:11.899
So only worth choosing if you need these performance advantages.

20
00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:12.280
Okay.

21
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.804
So let's face it.

22
00:01:13.804 --> 00:01:18.210
JSON is really popular and a really useful skill to have on your belt.

23
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.980
It's something you can use on a wide variety of development projects

24
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.922
for both websites and web services in the backend.

25
00:01:25.922 --> 00:01:28.932
In this course, you learned a lot about JSON.

26
00:01:28.932 --> 00:01:32.304
We started off looking at the basic structure of JSON documents themselves,

27
00:01:32.304 --> 00:01:33.895
and what they were used for.

28
00:01:33.895 --> 00:01:37.754
Then you learned about the different styles of the APIs that we covered.

29
00:01:37.754 --> 00:01:38.478
And finally,

30
00:01:38.478 --> 00:01:41.735
we talked about important do's and don'ts of using

31
00:01:41.735 --> 00:01:46.311
JSON in practical Java projects, information architecture.

32
00:01:46.311 --> 00:01:50.031
Now, you can count yourself as a JSON master.

33
00:01:50.031 --> 00:01:53.844
You should feel comfortable and confident tackling problems related

34
00:01:53.844 --> 00:02:00.000
to JSON and using it in production applications. Well done!
