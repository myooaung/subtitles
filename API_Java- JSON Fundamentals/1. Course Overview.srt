Hi everyone.

2
00:00:01,464 --> 00:00:10,309
My name is Richard Warburton, and welcome to my course Java: JSON Fundamentals.

3
00:00:10,309 --> 00:00:14,843
I'm an independent software consultant and co-founder of Opsian.

4
00:00:14,843 --> 00:00:18,323
com, a low overhead production profiling solution.

5
00:00:18,323 --> 00:00:23,360
JSON is one of the most popular formats for serializing data into

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,452
and is really commonly used by Java programmers,

7
00:00:26,452 --> 00:00:29,157
especially for talking to front-end web applications.

8
00:00:29,157 --> 00:00:34,011
Some of the major topics you'll learn about in this course are as follows,

9
00:00:34,011 --> 00:00:37,810
what JSON is used for in the context of Java application,

10
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:41,838
how to take Java objects and produce JSON documents from

11
00:00:41,838 --> 00:00:44,396
them in an easy and maintainable manner,

12
00:00:44,396 --> 00:00:49,782
how to consume JSON documents and ingest them into Java objects,

13
00:00:49,782 --> 00:00:52,237
what are the best practices of information

14
00:00:52,237 --> 00:00:54,402
architecture for using JSON with Java.

15
00:00:54,402 --> 00:00:56,627
By the end of this course,

16
00:00:56,627 --> 00:01:00,214
you'll know how to use JSON in real-world Java

17
00:01:00,214 --> 00:01:03,246
applications and be really productive with it.

18
00:01:03,246 --> 00:01:04,514
Before beginning the course,

19
00:01:04,514 --> 00:01:08,679
you only need to be familiar with core Java programming techniques.

20
00:01:08,679 --> 00:01:11,940
No familiarity with JSON is assumed.

21
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:26,000
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn JSON with the Java: JSON Fundamentals course at Pluralsight.
