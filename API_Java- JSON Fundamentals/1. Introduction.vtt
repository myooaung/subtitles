Hello, and welcome to the final module of this course on JSON with Java.

2
00:00:05.946 --> 00:00:06.991
In this module,

3
00:00:06.991 --> 00:00:10.873
you're going to learn more about integrating JSON with existing web

4
00:00:10.873 --> 00:00:13.800
frameworks and also cover a few summary topics.

5
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.517
This will help you save time and be more productive when

6
00:00:16.517 --> 00:00:19.801
using the most common Java frameworks.

7
00:00:19.801 --> 00:00:23.661
We're going to cover a couple of key integration points in this module.

8
00:00:23.661 --> 00:00:27.139
Firstly, we're going to look at how to integrate JSON parsing with Spring,

9
00:00:27.139 --> 00:00:30.663
a very popular framework for web development.

10
00:00:30.663 --> 00:00:33.927
You'll see how to integrate it with Spring Web and Spring Boot.

11
00:00:33.927 --> 00:00:38.240
Then we'll look at how to integrate JSON with JAX-RS and Jersey.

12
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.013
JAX-RS is a commonly used standard approach for the development

13
00:00:42.013 --> 00:00:45.665
of web services that produce JSON and XML.

14
00:00:45.665 --> 00:00:49.434
After this, we will evaluate some alternatives to JSON.

15
00:00:49.434 --> 00:00:54.596
JSON is really commonly used as a serialization format in both the

16
00:00:54.596 --> 00:00:57.348
server-to-server and server-to-JavaScript client use cases.

17
00:00:57.348 --> 00:00:58.888
In the former case,

18
00:00:58.888 --> 00:01:03.183
there are several serialization options that can offer more features,

19
00:01:03.183 --> 00:01:13.000
schema support, and performance than JSON. And finally, we'll wrap up and conclude the course.
