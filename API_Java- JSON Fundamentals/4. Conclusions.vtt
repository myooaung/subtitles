00:00:01.769 --> 00:00:01.973
Well,

2
00:00:01.973 --> 00:00:04.214
it's time to give you a sneak peek of what's coming

3
00:00:04.214 --> 00:00:06.091
up in the rest of this course.

4
00:00:06.091 --> 00:00:09.694
First, we're going to talk about producing JSON in the next module.

5
00:00:09.694 --> 00:00:13.093
Now I know you're thinking as a Java effort, look, it's just a string.

6
00:00:13.093 --> 00:00:14.478
I know how to produce a string.

7
00:00:14.478 --> 00:00:15.357
But as we'll see,

8
00:00:15.357 --> 00:00:19.022
there are really a lot of better ways of producing JSON objects than

9
00:00:19.022 --> 00:00:21.959
just string concatenation or string formatting.

10
00:00:21.959 --> 00:00:27.410
Then we're going to look at three different ways to consume or parse JSON.

11
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.310
We're going to use a DOM API, a binding API, and a SAX API.

12
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.003
And then we'll talk about the reasons why you may want each

13
00:00:34.003 --> 00:00:35.904
of those different approaches for parsing,

14
00:00:35.904 --> 00:00:39.919
and what those terms actually mean, how do they differ from each other.

15
00:00:39.919 --> 00:00:44.187
Finally, we'll talk about two big topic areas at the end.

16
00:00:44.187 --> 00:00:45.803
Firstly, information architecture.

17
00:00:45.803 --> 00:00:48.715
What are the kind of good and bad things to do when

18
00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:50.537
sending messages encoded using JSON?

19
00:00:50.537 --> 00:00:54.995
Then finally, how do we integrate our use of JSON?

20
00:00:54.995 --> 00:01:00.319
So how do we make it work with popular web frameworks like Spring and Jersey?

21
00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:03.125
And how do we use different communication patterns that we

22
00:01:03.125 --> 00:01:06.857
talked about earlier in this course with JSON?

23
00:01:06.857 --> 00:01:07.169
Okay.

24
00:01:07.169 --> 00:01:12.234
Well if you got here, you've reached the end of the first module of the course.

25
00:01:12.234 --> 00:01:12.563
Awesome!

26
00:01:12.563 --> 00:01:17.241
You've learned about a few different things so far in this course.

27
00:01:17.241 --> 00:01:22.701
Firstly, you learned about why you might want to use JSON, the use cases.

28
00:01:22.701 --> 00:01:27.200
Then we talked about what JSON really was and how to write it by hand.

29
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.123
The rest of this course will let you know how to use

30
00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:31.531
JSON within a Java application,

31
00:01:31.531 --> 00:01:36.042
and that is going to be really exciting because you really don't want to

32
00:01:36.042 --> 00:01:38.295
handcraft your JSON objects like an artisan baker.

33
00:01:38.295 --> 00:01:41.473
You want an application code to mass produce the

34
00:01:41.473 --> 00:01:48.000
JSON for you like a Model T car. See you then.
