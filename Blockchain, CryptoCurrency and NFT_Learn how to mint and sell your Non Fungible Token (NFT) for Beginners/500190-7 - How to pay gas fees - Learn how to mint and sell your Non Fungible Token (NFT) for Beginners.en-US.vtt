00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.595
As you can see, the transaction was successful.

00:00:02.595 --> 00:00:10.395
So I'm just gonna go to my wallet again and see if I can see at Natalia, yes,

00:00:10.395 --> 00:00:13.050
I think my second project,

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:19.935
and then you can see I have got 0.018 trillion in my wallet.

00:00:19.935 --> 00:00:27.660
Now, if I go back again and I'll try to list one of these items.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.795
So I'm just going to go with the one that you're talking about, the Indian bubble.

00:00:33.795 --> 00:00:43.699
So the price over here is It's 0.

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:48.275
If I take on one and then everything is fine.

00:00:48.275 --> 00:00:50.849
Forced your listing.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.510
And it's asking me Can can expand this sum all for the gas fees?

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:09.380
Yes. Sure. So it's doing the initialize your icon first,

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.810
which is the first bit like and you're doing it the first time you have to initialize it.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.890
There you go.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.390
Sounds good.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.570
Details this side regarding this permission,

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:42.175
full transaction details to automate translations for you?

00:01:42.175 --> 00:01:43.730
Yes.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.770
Is this okay?

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.890
Waiting for block chain conformation?

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:00.950
So I'm just going to go to the mega mouse followed and see why can't see the film button.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.229
Transaction. This is fine.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.550
Okay, so I had to select the transaction type,

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:22.860
so I selected slope and I'm going to click on phone.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:37.290
So that's basically you'd say should now do the approving, approve the transaction.

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:44.160
And now I'm just gonna make sure that there's no more notifications over here.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.715
Seeing this.

00:02:52.715 --> 00:02:55.400
So because it's selected slow,

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.420
I think it's going to take some time to go to rate.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.715
Confirmation duration is greater than 10 hours and that's fine.

00:03:07.715 --> 00:03:14.300
It will happen when the miners

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:21.240
basically walked to the transaction and verify that this is the election.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.330
Okay?

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.340
So that's basically it.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.960
We will have to wait a few hours now for this transaction to

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.940
go to and opens here to create a token for myself.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.905
So once I've token is created,

00:03:36.905 --> 00:03:39.830
I'll continue guarding the course video,

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:45.695
where we basically publish both of the art books int,

00:03:45.695 --> 00:03:52.800
into the market in occupancy to sell it. Thank you for watching.
