00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
In my last video, I showed you how you can create a MetaMask wallet.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.720
In this video, we will be looking at the connection plaster vault,

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.775
and the connection is still there.

00:00:11.775 --> 00:00:20.920
So you can see over here in Chrome plugin and kinda metabolic website.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.570
Now, for the next step,

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.230
we want to connect our MetaMask wallet with the open sea.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.134
To do this, just go to the open sea website.

00:00:36.134 --> 00:00:40.930
Click on My Profile, click on sign-in.

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.960
Give it doesn't walk. Pick again.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.470
You could still doesn't know just to refresh your page.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.555
Once you refresh it, then click sign in,

00:00:59.555 --> 00:01:04.655
you will see a connect with metals pop-up on your right.

00:01:04.655 --> 00:01:07.460
And you can see your water will die. Just cut.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.670
Select a watered and click on Next.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.320
Make sure it's perfect.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.350
Then click on Connect.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:22.940
So this will take some time to connect and AQ to this screen where you can

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.530
see your new username, which is unnamed.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.850
Okay, now click on the Settings gave and assign directly.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.455
Assign.

00:01:36.455 --> 00:01:39.920
This will take you to the general settings page.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.905
Here you will see if anything's use a name,

00:01:42.905 --> 00:01:45.620
bio, and email address.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.415
For the username, I'm going to just use a single arrow

00:01:49.415 --> 00:01:53.990
because I'm a big fan of p and enemies.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.640
And it has this correct term.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.960
This general, who likes to make tea and run a tea shop,

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.450
and that's something that I really enjoy.

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.315
So my username and then collateral bio,

00:02:11.315 --> 00:02:14.060
I'm just going to write something that represents that.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.875
So when somebody comes onto my page,

00:02:15.875 --> 00:02:22.355
they know what they are going to get in my collections.

00:02:22.355 --> 00:02:25.430
So gotta just fried something

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.390
like p

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.970
and animate.

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.190
So let's think about honesty bless enemy,

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.260
which is the PAGA plan profile.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.740
And they add on a piece how the email address.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.700
I'll choose my email address,

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.960
which is e-mail and direct combat Rosa.com.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.510
So if you want to contact me by e-mail,

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.115
you can use this as well.

00:03:01.115 --> 00:03:04.790
So by saying that username is already taken,

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.800
so I can't use uncle IRA.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.579
But as I said, I'm a big fan of p and enemies.

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:14.730
So I'm going to use t and then weight.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.525
That's it, and click on Save.

00:03:19.525 --> 00:03:26.319
So this will update my settings and send an email to my inbox.

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.530
Okay, so click on the open sea level.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.430
It'll take you to the main page and then click on my profile.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.655
And you will see the changes that you have made available.

00:03:36.655 --> 00:03:41.665
So by using the enemy and my bio is t plus enemy and FTEs.

00:03:41.665 --> 00:03:44.245
And you can see wallet,

00:03:44.245 --> 00:03:47.090
hash as well in the middle.

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.675
So we have done to personalize your argon.

00:03:52.675 --> 00:03:58.860
Next step is creating your own collection On Open see.

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.340
Okay, is to create a collection we will be using the technique called lazy minting.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.560
Lazy minting means that the fees for the transaction is paid by

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:21.845
the seller and not by you who's signed by the buyer,

00:04:21.845 --> 00:04:23.120
not, not by the seller.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.470
So you are the seller.

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.480
It's paid by the buyer.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.270
So let's open the URL,

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.480
open C dot io slash collections.

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.935
This will take you to the my collections page.

00:04:42.935 --> 00:04:46.170
Yeah, you can create a new collection.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.010
Second law, beyond that,

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.035
you don't want to end it right now.

00:04:57.035 --> 00:04:59.495
So as far as global,

00:04:59.495 --> 00:05:03.965
as I'm very inspired by the type corrector, uncle IRA.

00:05:03.965 --> 00:05:08.855
I will be using the logo as his image for now.

00:05:08.855 --> 00:05:12.965
Because it's talking about P and enemy,

00:05:12.965 --> 00:05:16.440
which resembled my very favorite topics.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.810
Okay, So let's pick this image.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.170
It's called on, I knew Save Image

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:39.710
As I'm going to save it on a desktop that I can quickly access it.

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.435
Click on the logo, go to desktop, select that image.

00:05:44.435 --> 00:05:46.190
That's a great image.

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:50.615
There you go. So we have got the logo as uncle arrow.

00:05:50.615 --> 00:05:56.060
And what would we the name of my collection

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:01.820
and telling me is already my username.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.590
So I'm just going to use something.

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:04.700
One interesting.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.290
I'm Kali arrows, TTY shell.

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.150
And the description.

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:24.620
Just to tell people what they will find over here in this, well,

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:31.745
in this collection, I'm deciding null will find all the p really did.

00:06:31.745 --> 00:06:32.765
And a mallard.

00:06:32.765 --> 00:06:34.560
That's it.
