00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
Alright, so in the last video,

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.160
you saw that we created an image,

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.205
which was this image.

00:00:11.205 --> 00:00:17.175
How do you go from an image to actual NFT?

00:00:17.175 --> 00:00:20.025
Which is this thing.

00:00:20.025 --> 00:00:23.280
So as you can see, this is an NFT.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.365
It has certain properties,

00:00:25.365 --> 00:00:30.090
That's levels and it's a part of the collection.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.930
When I go to my collection on upmc dot io,

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:41.710
uncle tea shop, I can see this here.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.410
So let me walk you through this first step.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.420
Because I've already used this image,

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.250
I'm going to use a different image.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:57.470
So what the emitter half-baked is, this one.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.955
Again, I found this on Flickr,

00:01:00.955 --> 00:01:08.480
are converting this image into this, excuse me.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.550
And from this image, I mean,

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.220
if you look at this image, this is a bit small.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.345
So the dimensions are 1200 by 1940,

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:20.950
which is a small image.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.180
Imagine someone trying to hang this digital gallery.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.370
You're not giving them value.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.095
To give them value.

00:01:29.095 --> 00:01:35.350
What I did was I used an AI image and larger.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.330
And it has enlarge this image by four times.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.310
So I will be using this image instead.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.230
And this is the resolution for this one is 5000, which is brilliant.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.710
This is like a really big image now.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.670
Okay, so first things first,

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.665
when you go to open C dot io,

00:02:02.665 --> 00:02:04.450
you will see this page.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.400
You're already logged in because you have to MetaMask wallet.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.110
Type forward slash collections.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.850
Here.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.570
Select the collection that we already created in the previous video.

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.950
Click on, Add New Item.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.800
Drag and drop this image over here.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:34.595
So this image is like what do you want to call it?

00:02:34.595 --> 00:02:36.470
That's what it is asking.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.330
This is the required field, which is name.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:44.220
So I'm going to call this an Indian.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:58.080
And the description of what's going on over here.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:09.450
Having a cup of tea enjoying ago.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.700
And then the properties.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.019
So corrector is male.

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.170
Religion.

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.245
So just to give you a bit of idea,

00:03:33.245 --> 00:03:38.105
think of this as the properties of a character.

00:03:38.105 --> 00:03:42.575
So you are basically building a profile of your NMT.

00:03:42.575 --> 00:03:48.350
And an example would be like if you have played video games,

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.500
in the video games you have like characters and character styles,

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.665
character levels, character properties.

00:03:54.665 --> 00:04:01.820
So for example, CAN has a property that he's, he's a male,

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.660
he can do, for example,

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.855
karate or something so that those out like his properties.

00:04:08.855 --> 00:04:14.840
So It's a similar concept that we are going to be using as a properties.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:20.940
And here are some examples like character is male, religion, Hindu.

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.870
And what else can we add? Origin?

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.910
Origin, Indian.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.145
Let's just add these three characters,

00:04:34.145 --> 00:04:39.125
district and the level.

00:04:39.125 --> 00:04:41.960
So I'm just going to compare this fit.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.975
The one that I've already created for.

00:04:44.975 --> 00:04:51.690
The other one, open sea to the IO forward slash collections.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:59.105
And over here we have got Pakistani Java.

00:04:59.105 --> 00:05:03.965
So for example, the properties over here, age.

00:05:03.965 --> 00:05:05.600
I've added age as well.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:14.450
So let me add H and let's meet mean it's up to us what we want to call it.

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:22.370
And it's going to say 45. And you have got credit for mills Muslim D making.

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:23.960
So that was his specialty.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.400
So more specialty.

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:42.570
I'm a good talker, are pure.

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.270
So he can mean jokes.

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:53.240
And that's especially now when we talk about level.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.760
Level is like in the game.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.990
So you have a character who's more offensive, defensive.

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.490
It's a similar kind of things.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:06.620
So for example, I had the speed and T knowledge.

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:12.065
Speed. Let's just say speed is slow because he's older.

00:06:12.065 --> 00:06:15.090
So speed is one.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:27.090
Knowledge is one out of 1000.

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:37.770
And let's just go with those two sets.

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.780
Let me see what I used in the previous ones,

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:43.580
I used the hygiene reading.

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:49.470
So this guy had the hydrogen Reading 2.

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:56.040
And we will just use a similar kind of reading.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:12.064
Rating is one safe.

00:07:12.064 --> 00:07:15.650
You can just come up with random numbers over here.

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:18.334
The idea is that you are creating a character.

00:07:18.334 --> 00:07:21.605
So by random numbers, it doesn't it?

00:07:21.605 --> 00:07:23.450
I mean, when I say random numbers,

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:26.855
I'm just trying to look at the location,

00:07:26.855 --> 00:07:29.150
the type, the get up,

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:33.635
and just building a character profile in my head.

00:07:33.635 --> 00:07:35.390
It's up to you what, what,

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:39.410
what's your story basically you're telling a story over here. So what's your story?

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:43.310
Another thing that is an option about supply.

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:46.970
So by default it will be disabled and it would have one that

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:50.810
is like a perimeter that he can use on the URL,

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:56.480
which allows you to change this number.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:02.930
I'll put it in the description of this course so that you can use it from there.

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:05.990
But for now we'll just go with this,

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:09.035
these details where we have the image,

00:08:09.035 --> 00:08:14.210
the name, description, properties, level, stats, supply.

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:19.430
One interesting thing to note is I'm only uploaded a JPEG or PNG file.

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:24.760
You can upload a 3D model and you can upload a video.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:31.070
You can upload a vector graphics.

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:32.660
A lot more like that.

00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:35.570
There's many, many options.

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:39.180
Okay, so let's do a Create.

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:51.845
So one thing to note is when you're doing it for the first time,

00:08:51.845 --> 00:08:59.389
you need to ensure that you have at least 37 dollars

00:08:59.389 --> 00:09:07.655
or 0.15 ethereum in your wallet to do a cell.

00:09:07.655 --> 00:09:10.490
So you can see the Indian tea Barbara has been created.

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:12.155
If I click on cell,

00:09:12.155 --> 00:09:15.470
what happens is it takes me to

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:19.985
this screen where I can do the setting of the site, prices and everything.

00:09:19.985 --> 00:09:25.535
But let me actually show you what happens so that you can understand it better.

00:09:25.535 --> 00:09:34.470
So I'm just going to convert 20 USD to Ethereum,

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:41.880
which is 0, 79.

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:46.620
So I'm just going to round up to 80.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.035
It's either an ascendant.

00:09:53.035 --> 00:09:56.095
Okay, for eyes, that surprise,

00:09:56.095 --> 00:10:01.525
I wanted to go with the highest bid is a one.

00:10:01.525 --> 00:10:04.030
So just, I mean,

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:05.920
this is a great price.

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:08.605
You can set any particular price over here.

00:10:08.605 --> 00:10:11.965
Expiration date, five days.

00:10:11.965 --> 00:10:17.530
Any instructions, bases, decentralize.

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:19.630
So we nevertheless squire items.

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:21.265
Okay.

00:10:21.265 --> 00:10:27.950
So now when I click on posts, your listing.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.935
Tries to list the item.

00:10:30.935 --> 00:10:36.485
It will open the wallet and it will say that you don't have enough money in a wallet.

00:10:36.485 --> 00:10:38.510
So for the first item,

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:41.840
you need to ensure that you have gas fees.

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.925
It can pay the gas phase.

00:10:43.925 --> 00:10:46.805
So this is the most important way.

00:10:46.805 --> 00:10:52.640
So my suggestion is go with the lower price item.

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:59.165
So first of all, opened up Meta mass folate and reject this.

00:10:59.165 --> 00:11:02.930
Go to the low-price item.

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:06.845
Because you have to pay the gas phase for the first time.

00:11:06.845 --> 00:11:11.660
And click on cell here,

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:17.399
click on this into the same details.

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:30.815
Let's just go with 0.72

00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:36.080
and we can click on post.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.860
Your listing.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.530
Price is same.

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:45.500
So previously showed me a lower price.

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:49.190
So this keeps on changing based on the price of the yttrium.

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:52.820
So previously it was twenty-seven dollars.

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:57.200
Now it's asking me for $44, which is fine.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:02.360
So I'm going to just reject this and go to the MetaMask wallet.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:03.770
In a MetaMask wallet,

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:10.290
I can go and click on Buy and continue to wire.

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:16.640
So this is the initial gas fees.

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.620
This is only one time.

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:24.650
And from because you have created a collection from the next time,

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:27.440
it will be the buyer who would pay the peas.

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:33.365
But for the first time we have to create a token for your, for your profile.

00:12:33.365 --> 00:12:36.785
And this is why it's asking you for the gas phase.

00:12:36.785 --> 00:12:44.570
So if five by 40 word of Ethereum,

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:48.380
I will get 0.020.

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:49.970
And how I do I need,

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:52.500
if I click on this,

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:59.060
I basically need 0.0172.

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:02.060
So let's call it 0.018.

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:05.180
So I basically 0.018.

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:07.580
And if I pay 40,

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:11.075
I basically have to pay 40, 45, glide.

00:13:11.075 --> 00:13:15.440
So if I change this number to 37,

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.840
that should be fine.

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:18.995
38.

00:13:18.995 --> 00:13:23.375
So I 26, 0.018.

00:13:23.375 --> 00:13:27.155
And that's what we needed over here, 0.018.

00:13:27.155 --> 00:13:28.895
So I'm just going to pay 36,

00:13:28.895 --> 00:13:32.640
which is equal to 41, 51 line.

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:36.095
I authorize.

00:13:36.095 --> 00:13:39.769
And click on Next.

00:13:39.769 --> 00:13:42.020
And these are credit card details.

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:46.530
So I'm going to fill this outside the screen.
