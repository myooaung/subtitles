Hi welcome back what you stood and saw him as being from the future and coming back just to you know



2

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.970

just a couple of things on their application.



3

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.790

So the first thing that I want to see is right here on their razor on the school user we're missing



4

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.350

an ass right here.



5

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:19.140

I want to just that and I want to just this nor reply I want to make sure that we have the right link.



6

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.920

All right.



7

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.020

So in the last lecture we already corrected all of this and make sure that you if you're using a live



8

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.110

server that you put your Web site there.



9

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.330

So it's going to be something like this.



10

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.590

Like that.



11

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.270

No reply.



12

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:35.770

All right.



13

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:43.060

And I'm going to correct the next one so I'm going to look for that nor reply right here.



14

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:45.700

Have a go.



15

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.630

Actually right there like that.



16

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:51.130

All right.



17

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.070

And make sure that both of them say headers.



18

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.610

All right.



19

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:55.630

So we're done.



20

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.850

Right.



21

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:56.820

That was easy.



22

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.210

Thank you so much for watching.



23

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:03.280

And again this is Ellen from the future and you'll see me around when we need to ask someone who lectures



24

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.620

or we need to fix some issues.



25

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.390

You the best thing in the world because you're taking my course.



26

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:09.340

Thank you.



27

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.350

See you in the next lecture.
