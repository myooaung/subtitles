Hi welcome back my student.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,680
This is Edwin from the future.

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:08,390
We are creating this new section here to fix bugs in the application.

4
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:11,560
You know not every application is perfect and one of the best part.

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:16,310
In my case my opinion is debugging your application and making it better right.

6
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:19,890
So in this lecture here we're going to be facing a little bug.

7
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:20,750
Well a little.

8
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,980
Type all that I have on some of the functions.

9
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,250
So let me show you what it is.

10
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:32,750
So it is going to find and any editor you can have a Find function on the right are going to find the

11
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:37,740
splost symbol but in reality let's look for M.D five right.

12
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:44,440
Let's look for another M.D five and you can see right here any five takes I string parameter all right

13
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,090
to make your pass where you know to hash a password right here.

14
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,400
What the problem is is that we're using a plus symbol to concatenate this.

15
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:56,650
And if you want to if we really wanted to concatenate is we use a dot notation right.

16
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,750
It still works you know.

17
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:04,000
But he adds basically the string to the micro time function.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,050
So the correct way of doing it is with the dot notation right.

19
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,630
Let's go to the next one.

20
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:15,820
And M.D five years good here we have another one.

21
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,550
And this is in the recover PP-ASEL function let's go again.

22
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,980
And it looks like that's it.

23
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:32,070
All right so in the register use a function and then we cover function is the problem right recoverer

24
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,170
password.

25
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:36,080
Make sure you have those down notations they are right.

26
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,060
Anyway thank you so much for watching.

27
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,820
And you know some of you already gave me reviews.

28
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:46,890
I really appreciate that very much that you took the time to express how you feel about this course.

29
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:49,010
You know for those of you that gave me really good reviews.

30
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,880
Thank you so much.

31
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,610
Without you I wouldn't be here.

32
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:55,500
I wouldn't have motivation to wake up in the morning or a night time.

33
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,430
I've made these courses here as better as best as I can.

34
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:02,210
You know I try my best to do these courses.

35
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:02,630
So.

36
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,090
Well you guys can benefit.

37
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:08,890
Anyway thank you so much again and I'll see you in the next lectures.

38
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:09,550
Take care.
