Hi I'm Edwin Diaz.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,230
Welcome to the course.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,810
Now before we go on and started of course there are a couple of things that I need to tell you.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:18,120
First of all here's some of the things that we are using in this course we're using zap lamp or map

5
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,820
any of these local environments should work for the course as long as you can run ph be in my ask.

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,770
You know we're good to go.

7
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,090
Now I'm going to be using sublime as a cool weather too.

8
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:31,320
But you can use any cool editor you want.

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,770
Now there are a couple of things that you should know before you start the course.

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,770
You should know some basic BHB a minuscule L and I think I wrote this very clearly in the description

11
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:41,640
of the course.

12
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,960
If you don't please understand that you won't be able to follow the course and understand it 100 percent.

13
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:53,950
You will be able to code with me and follow every line but you won't be able to understand it 100 percent.

14
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:54,980
Just keep that in mind.

15
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:59,390
OK now here are some tips and what I expect from you in the course.

16
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,080
I expect you to write code.

17
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:07,820
This course is meant for you to learn and the best way to learn is writing the code.

18
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:15,370
Now when you get stock I want you to try your best before you ask a question in the course I want you

19
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,700
to get stuck for an hour or two.

20
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,160
Two days is ok.

21
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,050
Don't worry you will get through it and you can.

22
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,900
You're going to become a lot better than what you are right now.

23
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:31,570
But if you need help immediately I want you to come and tell me abody would pose the question in the

24
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:32,470
discussion.

25
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:40,210
OK but after you have tried it enough now I want to thank you for taking the time for you know for investing

26
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:46,960
in discourse I'm here when you need me and if I don't deserve my stars let me prove the course and let

27
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,480
me know before you give me any ratings.

28
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:54,050
Again thank you so much for joining me and let's have some fun in the course.

29
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,020
Ellis learned some really cool stuff.
