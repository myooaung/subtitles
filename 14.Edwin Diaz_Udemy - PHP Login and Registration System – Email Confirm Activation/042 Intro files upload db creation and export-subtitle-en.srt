1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:02,200
Welcome back my students.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,410
So it's time for us to take our application to the web.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:10,400
Now I always recommend my top company for hosting.

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:12,840
Now you don't have to have a hosting right now.

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,990
You can just watch this lecture see or learn how to do this.

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:23,580
But if you're curious to find out how to do this with a live server what company is the best then I

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,610
can only recommend one company and that is.

8
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:34,230
If you go to the US DOT com that's my personal web site and you go to resources right here I have a

9
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,790
special link for my students.

10
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,290
This link was provided to me by Go Daddy.

11
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,250
And basically this link will give you.

12
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:45,650
All right.

13
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:52,680
Crazy crazy discount is going to give you coasting for $1 a month.

14
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,240
All right.

15
00:00:53,400 --> 00:01:00,120
It's going to give you a free domain and you're going to have C-SPAN installed which is a software that

16
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,010
we use to do a whole bunch of things.

17
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:03,660
All right.

18
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:04,770
And we set it up like this.

19
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:11,190
We click on the first one and it says for one domain there but don't worry about it because in one domain

20
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:14,010
we can set up multiple applications just by using folders.

21
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,150
We know that right.

22
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:18,290
So what you can say something like this.

23
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:19,930
Right.

24
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:27,210
This is how we can set it up and I'll show you right now that this is really truly an amazing thing.

25
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,190
We get it for 12 hours and 18 cents.

26
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:29,800
All right.

27
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,360
Pretty cool stuff right.

28
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:36,350
And then they also have we saved like 86 dollars.

29
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,130
That's what they saying.

30
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:43,740
If we are new we click here and we write our information and then we can even use paypal.

31
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:44,710
We want to.

32
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:45,420
All right.

33
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,020
And we don't even have to use our credit cards.

34
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:48,750
Pretty cool stuff.

35
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,940
Anybody would do this.

36
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:59,340
So anyway that's why I recommend going to logon right now because I want to show you logging in there

37
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:05,400
on the screen because I don't want you to see my information and now because I don't trust you.

38
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,730
It's just because I don't know you.

39
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,790
So that's the whole reason why I'm doing this.

40
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:12,350
All right.

41
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,220
So don't get upset with me if I'm doing this you know this side.

42
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,950
That's OK.

43
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:17,440
All right.

44
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,690
So anyway I'm logged in right now.

45
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,600
All right.

46
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:31,140
Once you log in you click on view my account with Go Daddy Go Daddy I think once you pay and they got

47
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,770
to send you your credentials by e-mail as well.

48
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:41,100
But once you pay you can you're looking automatically and you look for my account and web hosting you

49
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:47,940
have some tasks like this and you click on web hosting manage right here and ask them to tell you listen

50
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,940
go to your.

51
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:52,720
You want to go to your see band or you're going to say oh yeah sure let's manage it.

52
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:57,910
And then we're going to go to a see panel right here and this is where the magic happens is a whole

53
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:00,140
bunch of things that we can do.

54
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:01,480
All right.

55
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:09,330
You can set up FTB accounts or you can log in to their to your applications or have somebody the people

56
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,820
game can set up application.

57
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,050
One click has a whole bunch of things.

58
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:17,760
Some companies are charging big money for this and Bill within my special link that I have on my web

59
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,510
site for you you only going to get charged $1 a month.

60
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,280
But anyway.

61
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:28,540
So I'm going to go to file manager because this is where I have this is where everything is.

62
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:32,480
Now some of the applications are under this same domain.

63
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:33,220
Right.

64
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,690
As you can see right here.

65
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,400
So I'm going to create a new folder.

66
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,040
As a matter of fact

67
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:45,200
let's compress everything.

68
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:51,720
So I'm going to compress everything right here and I'll show you in a minute.

69
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,470
We have this log in here and I'm just going to compress it.

70
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,150
I'm going to right click and compress it is using my Mac and compressing everything.

71
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,780
As a matter of fact I'm going to compress everything here.

72
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,860
Sorry about that.

73
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,720
And it's going to be called archive.

74
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,420
OK that's fine archive.

75
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,800
And then I delete this one.

76
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:20,210
If you are using Windows you can just right click and zip it using some application there from windows.

77
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:26,480
They we also have I think 7 zip is an application that you can use to zip it seven zip.

78
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:33,850
It does seem that you can use this which is free is a program that will zip the files for you just sipping

79
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:39,010
it so that way I can make it smaller so that I way I can upload it.

80
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:39,550
All right.

81
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:46,290
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a for there here I'm going to click folder because I

82
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:51,930
mean my root directory and that's where I want to be on public that underscore the mail create a full

83
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:55,050
they're going to call this logon underscore score app

84
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:03,930
and create a new folder and my logging app right here.

85
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:07,500
So now I'm going to go in overload that file.

86
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:08,610
All right.

87
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,180
So then I say oh load.

88
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:22,030
I'm going to choose where I want to load my find my logging app and is inside logging archive.

89
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:22,790
Open

90
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,210
all right so that's complete.

91
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:31,510
Another thing that we need to do is we need to go to the database.

92
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:35,330
So let's go to the HP my admin

93
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:48,800
and let's go to Logan underscore logging logging to underscore the users let's just click on the logo

94
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:54,400
on this court TV and export.

95
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,860
All right so it's exported.

96
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,620
I'm going to put it in my desktop

97
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:07,620
right here I'm going to come back to my SEE panel right.

98
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:15,520
This is their home page of my C panel and then I'm going to go to my databases that I raised with her

99
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,810
I'm going to create a new database I'm going to call this mine.

100
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:30,450
On this whole login app the B and then not copy this because I'm going to need this information later

101
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:40,100
and I paste it here and I'm going to put some comments database set up.

102
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,710
All right.

103
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:45,570
Next step

104
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,700
right.

105
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,940
And use a name.

106
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:59,820
Mind you Logan pap user Whoops.

107
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,080
He's going to call this guy my logging user that's fine.

108
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:09,120
And I make sure that I put him here.

109
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:12,140
And just going to put the baby name in there

110
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,550
when I hear.

111
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:18,120
But here

112
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,060
and

113
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:34,250
here.

114
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,170
OK.

115
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,070
And then the pass we're going to use a password generator.

116
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:42,400
They're going to copy it.

117
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:48,260
I have copy it and use password good create user.

118
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,380
Now I'm going to put a password right here password.

119
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,110
All right.

120
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,900
Beautiful.

121
00:07:56,010 --> 00:08:01,550
So I'm going to say all privileges and next step.

122
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:06,100
All right as has been completed on the next lecture we're going to hook it up.

123
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:10,550
All right so we're going to connect it and make sure everything is working and test our applications

124
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,860
is going to be pretty cool stuff.

125
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,670
Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture.
