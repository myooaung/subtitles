00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.450

All right so in the last lecture we got this working pretty good right pass was match.



2

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.860

All right.



3

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.740

Time for us to do the big things.



4

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:08.390

Beautiful.



5

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.310

So now the first thing that we need to do is encrypt the password.



6

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:12.330

Right.



7

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.440

Let's call this



8

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:18.990

all day the password actually.



9

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.000

I think he's going to be better than done calling it just password.



10

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.280

That way we can differentiate it from this password right here from the password from the forum.



11

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:36.820

So anyway let's go ahead and grab this guy right here and do this all right.



12

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:48.350

Now let's uncomment this guy right here and we are going to be using this and scaping it.



13

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.990

We're going to just replace this one for the updated one.



14

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:53.230

All right.



15

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.810

And we are using a variable here and we already do we have a variable.



16

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.800

No we don't have that e-mail variable anywhere.



17

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:13.560

So we need to be getting a requests as an email so we can use again requests.



18

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.890

All right.



19

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.050

There we go.



20

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.860

Perfect.



21

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:29.360

So once we do that all we have to do is make sure that we send Aquarion as well confirming just to make



22

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.120

sure that actually we don't need to confirm it once we send it in.



23

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.680

We're good to go.



24

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.410

All right.



25

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.510

And let's let's see action before I could get Spier right.



26

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.220

So let's write this secret secret.



27

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.510

We said All right let's see we saw it we got something in the database.



28

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:48.140

All right.



29

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.970

So this is a okes.



30

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.180

This is our password now.



31

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.810

By E. B.



32

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.100

6:09 refresh.



33

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.530

All right it looks like we have the same password.



34

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.240

We need to set these validation to something else.



35

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.020

I think I refresh when I click here but let's just see if we can log in.



36

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.520

All right.



37

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.410

All right.



38

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.860

Logon that Antar.



39

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.210

Let's write the e-mail.



40

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.360

And let's just say See.



41

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.420

Correct logging.



42

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.570

So we are able to log in with a new password so it is working.



43

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.260

All right.



44

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.920

That means that I click on this link here and they just send another request here and refresh.



45

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.030

And we got in this change you can post a video look at it again.



46

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.770

So this probably was another possible before any change.



47

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.150

I know that we need to do is we need to set these valuation to zero.



48

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.090

All right.



49

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.490

So we got to see this thing action again.



50

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:48.650

So we said the password to that new updated password and we are also going to play it or call my here



51

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.870

and we're going to set up a validation code to zero.



52

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.620

All right we have to do that.



53

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:01.530

And then after we are done here we could send a message.



54

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.310

And actually I think we have a message here.



55

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.050

We can write a function in the future for that if you wanted to.



56

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:16.330

Like a successful message or something like that but that's OK or we can put this inside the set message.



57

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.710

There's p tags.



58

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.500

That's OK.



59

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.210

So we're going to say your password has been



60

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:42.130

being updated please again and we're got to send this person or that to the lawyer page redirect.



61

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.680

Logan BHB That's beautiful isn't it.



62

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.860

That's a really nice piece of coal there.



63

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:55.730

Make sure that you write your content and your comments here so that way you know exactly what's going



64

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.920

on.



65

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:56.710

All right.



66

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.110

All right.



67

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.140

Make sure you have your cold really organized.



68

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.110

That's a really good thing to have.



69

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:13.570

And he will log out and let's go to our recovery page click here for one e-mail.



70

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.410

New validation code.



71

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.460

Let's refresh.



72

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.790

All right.



73

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.610

Double click here.



74

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.120

Copy



75

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.820

paste that Code Pink or text editor.



76

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.310

Copy this.



77

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:33.590

She got.



78

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.550

You probably have the hang of it already right.



79

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:38.820

And paste it here.



80

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.810

Antar get the code again



81

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.970

based here.



82

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.420

Continue.



83

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.330

And we can reset our password and this is going to be crazy.



84

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:59.450

So right now I'm just going to write my name and when and do.



85

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.090

Reset your password is being updated.



86

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:03.780

Please log in.



87

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.370

Now we got to change the color of this because this is like a red card and we want it to have something



88

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.290

like green but we know that it is working.



89

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:19.390

And now if I'm typing on and I say some other password here log in your credentials are not correct.



90

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.190

Let's do one.



91

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.240

And then my name.



92

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.780

Then why law.



93

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.230

And now we come back to our database.



94

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.580

We can see that is the past which starts with Friday and ends with 6 9.



95

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:40.130

If we refresh that password it starts now with a e and ends with the two.



96

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.050

And the validation code 0 again.



97

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.550

Look at that.



98

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.090

Isn't that cool guys.



99

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:52.680

We are actually making lot we have made a lot of progress and we have created a really awesome application



100

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.920

that logging in registration application.



101

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.580

Now all we got to do is just make it better with time.



102

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:06.240

Little by that will make it better more flexible quicker with less code will refactor some of it if



103

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.220

we have to.



104

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:11.790

And the sky's the limit with something like this with the knowledge that you learn in this course here



105

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:17.730

you can build any really cool log in the registration system for any application out there based on



106

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.260

BHB and my school.



107

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:20.070

Good job.



108

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.600

Thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lectures.



109

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:23.320

Take care.
