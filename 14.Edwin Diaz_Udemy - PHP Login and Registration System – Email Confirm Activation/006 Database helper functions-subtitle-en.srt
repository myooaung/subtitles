1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,110
All right welcome back my student.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:09,330
So hopefully you took my advice from the best lectures and let you know when I told you that this is

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,770
not a beginner's course.

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:11,250
All right.

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:16,420
And if I didn't say that now I'm saying this is not a beginner's for BHB course.

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,380
So if you don't know basic BHB you're going to get lost.

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:25,080
Let me just remind you that right now holding you to lunch by the hand on this course like I do in my

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,980
older beginner's courses right.

9
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:31,200
Because I'm assuming that you already know this stuff just to be clear.

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:36,480
So anyway on the last lecture we connected to the database we make sure that everything was working.

11
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,010
Take that out of there right here inside.

12
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:44,040
We need that BHB we are going to be initializing some other stuff.

13
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,520
So right now we're going to be initialising Olby on this on the score start.

14
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,870
This is a predefined function that will turn on output buffering.

15
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,090
We're going to use this for redirection.

16
00:00:54,090 --> 00:01:01,730
We are also going to start our session here because we wanted this to be available in all our application.

17
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:07,330
Right so we got to start it in in it that BHB just to make sure that we have this right.

18
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,700
So you don't have to make sure that you do now.

19
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:16,890
Now we're going to start working with some you know making our our life a little bit easier when we

20
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,640
do functions database functions or stuff like that.

21
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:30,510
So if we go to our D-B right here all right we can actually have some mom some of these functions here

22
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,550
put it on DVD or BHB if we wanted to where we can put it in functions.

23
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,230
Let's do it right here on the B that BHB and the functions that I'm talking about is like the equerry

24
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:47,040
functionality you know the fetching arrays you know redirecting things like that.

25
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:52,080
All right things have to do with a database we want to actually put it right here.

26
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:52,500
All right.

27
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:59,490
So the first thing is that Querrey right let's just create a function here and this just let me show

28
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,060
you what I mean.

29
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:08,670
So usually when we are acquiring the data base we have to do something like this might ask you like

30
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:15,380
where we are right and we've got to put that connection went down we got to do the query right.

31
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:20,080
This is kind of a pain right to do this all the time.

32
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:24,650
And I just want to make sure that you know we take care of this.

33
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,570
All right.

34
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:32,190
So here on the Querrey what we're going to be doing is we're going to of course pass the Querrey

35
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:40,410
just to Kohary here just to make it more understandable.

36
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:40,800
All right.

37
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:45,530
And then we'll grab the connection with these cases right here.

38
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:54,180
But we have to put global because this is a flaw a function so a global icon right there then will say

39
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,860
my issue lie.

40
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,110
Connect not connect.

41
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:00,490
Sorry.

42
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:01,170
Querrey

43
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:09,420
again we'll pass in that connection and then we'll pass it where we are right and all we're got to do

44
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,950
is return this.

45
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:19,640
So now every time we want to make a query we just use this function like this Kohary quote like this.

46
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,720
And then you will make everything for us.

47
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,530
We don't have to be typing in this two parameters every time.

48
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,320
All right.

49
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,290
Beautiful.

50
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,100
What else do we need.

51
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:34,660
Well it's also very good to actually clean your database escaping.

52
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:34,990
Right.

53
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,450
We're going to be using mice you realize.

54
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:45,730
So let's actually create a little function that will allow us to clean our data and actually scaping.

55
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:48,900
So let's just do it right here let's use scaping

56
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:54,080
you know what let's do it.

57
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:54,570
Yeah.

58
00:03:54,600 --> 00:04:00,270
To help us find do scape.

59
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,950
We're going to put the string here.

60
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,950
We're going to pass in the string is going to do everything else for us.

61
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:06,550
All right.

62
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:18,250
So we're going to say my AS A lie is real escape string.

63
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,100
All right.

64
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,240
We'll pass in the connection it will.

65
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,700
We've got to put that on on a global by the way.

66
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,520
And then here we are passing in the string right.

67
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,100
Let's do that.

68
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,050
All was well

69
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:40,470
OK but let's do a little bit something else here.

70
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,220
That's fine.

71
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:42,840
That's OK.

72
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:43,930
Let's all return.

73
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,880
So this will escape the data for us.

74
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,760
OK.

75
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,920
That's fine.

76
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,830
Let's also use another function.

77
00:04:53,860 --> 00:05:00,730
Usually we do which DML entities to clean up like strange characters when we're putting stuff on like

78
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,510
when we taking stuff from.

79
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,390
Any input.

80
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:07,600
Type on input type ttes we get some HDMI sometimes in there.

81
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,660
So let's create a function to clean that up as well.

82
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:17,590
So let's just say function clean and you know what I think we should leave this for the functions that

83
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:22,360
BHB file because we want everything to do with the database here.

84
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:29,600
So let's just do fetch data here.

85
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,490
Or let's just say Fetch array.

86
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:37,430
All right we're going to take in our result from here.

87
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:47,960
And I was just going to say real quick here.

88
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,480
I was going to say my secure line

89
00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:02,510
fetch rate this is going to be fetching data for us.

90
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,230
All right.

91
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:09,460
So this is going to grab the resoled and fetch it for us.

92
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,370
All right it's going to grab everything.

93
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:25,230
Now we can fetch call this like fetch or date I'll fetch one data you know whatever we want to fetch

94
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,140
from it.

95
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:32,960
So that way it's just a very handy way of doing things right.

96
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,380
Actually you know what.

97
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,490
That's fine that's fine.

98
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,410
Let's just leave it like that.

99
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,540
They don't we can modify this and make it better.

100
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:48,570
Let's also create a confirmed full function here just to confirm that all the information from the database

101
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:49,770
is good.

102
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:51,410
The query is good.

103
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:56,520
So let's just grab the normal here real quick.

104
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:01,220
Actually we don't need all to make sure that actually we do.

105
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:08,710
Sorry we do because we can provide some other errors notification.

106
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:17,020
So my is a lie actually if we pass an assault here.

107
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:21,540
So if not sold

108
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:38,110
then we can just say die we can say where we failed and I know this is a lot of writing here guys.

109
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:43,050
A lot of coding but believe me this is going to make our lives a lot easier later on.

110
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,560
All right.

111
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:48,740
We'll pass in the connection here real quick.

112
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,610
All right.

113
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,410
Beautiful.

114
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:55,990
All right.

115
00:07:58,730 --> 00:07:58,980
All right.

116
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,420
We're got to leave it at this here.

117
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:06,400
And if we got some more functionality from the database We'll continue in the next lecture.

118
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:09,320
Now we'll continue with our regular functions.

119
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,620
But anyway thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lecture.

120
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,870
Take care.
