1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,750
All right welcome back my student.

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:10,260
So now we have come very far with this register score user function here and we are doing a lot of things

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,060
here.

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:15,940
So now it's time for us to send the activation link to the user right.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:22,390
Because right now this is registering from the user but we haven't sent the activation link yet.

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,890
Now we could if we wanted to come here and use the mail function and do that.

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,820
Now what I want to do is I want to make this malfunction a little bit more generic.

8
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:36,550
And we're going to do the same thing we were doing with the help of functions right here.

9
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:37,830
All right.

10
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:43,380
And just in case in the future we have some type of plugging or something for it we can use this generic

11
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:50,050
function this helper function here to change it here and then we would change through our whole application.

12
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,530
All right so I hope you understand that concept.

13
00:00:52,650 --> 00:01:00,960
So we're going to say send mail send send e-mail when they send an e-mail like this.

14
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:09,020
All right so we have a plug in we'll put the plug in coding here and we can use this to change everything

15
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,570
through our whole application every time we send e-mails right.

16
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,120
So the first parameter would be the e-mail.

17
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:22,100
Then the second would be the subject right after we'd be the message Hemmers G.

18
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,840
And we could just say message there right now right.

19
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:29,710
Yes let's just say I'm and G.

20
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,510
And the last one would be the headers.

21
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:34,200
All right.

22
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:44,500
And all we got to do here is just return the mail function with all these parameters like the.

23
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:50,120
Now we could if we wanted to return already with some type of message right.

24
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,680
So that way we don't have to write any code.

25
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:59,040
And the other side we could say hey if because these malfunctioning if it fails it's going to return

26
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,020
some type of false or negative value.

27
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:10,620
And if we return successful we will actually submit the form and return a success a true back to the

28
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:13,370
two where we is calling this function right.

29
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:22,730
So we can say if mail then we can echo something and say let's just you know what you said we're right

30
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:24,370
away some type of message

31
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:35,250
let me see maybe we can you know what is actually returned the mail I guess and then we can handle this

32
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,050
session somewhere else because

33
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,270
that would be too much.

34
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,480
We want this function to be the most generic as possible and and putting all these echoes inside this

35
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,920
function doesn't make it very generic which is going to make the functioning echo something I would

36
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,050
let's just return this and then we can handle that outside.

37
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:57,670
Right.

38
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:03,410
So let's go to the registration here and.

39
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:13,580
All right so here if the registration goes good then we can send the mail right or right here before

40
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:18,830
we echo the true so that we don't have that much coding here.

41
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:27,400
We've got to think about this one minute where we already have a link here.

42
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,260
All right let's use user right here.

43
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:36,070
Send e-mail.

44
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,820
Now let's go down here.

45
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:39,760
We'll move on.

46
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:40,860
We need to later on.

47
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,850
But that's fine.

48
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,740
Let's just send it here because we're going to write a lot of code here.

49
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:48,730
I don't want to clog the space right here with so many things.

50
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:49,900
All right.

51
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:53,640
If we change our minds later on we'll change.

52
00:03:53,650 --> 00:04:02,100
But right now I think this is the best way here because we are escaping all these values here already.

53
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,460
All right.

54
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:08,570
Any way e-mail we only scaping e-mail by the way.

55
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:13,990
Well then we'll actually let's go up here and get the

56
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,000
oh these parameters

57
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:21,850
right.

58
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:26,880
And there we go and let's see what we want to send.

59
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:37,850
So we've got a subject there and the subject is is going to be called activation active AA account.

60
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:38,970
All right.

61
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,940
Then we have a message

62
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:50,110
this message will write something like this.

63
00:04:50,490 --> 00:05:04,660
We're going to say please click the link below to actively open your account and then we'll put the

64
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,800
link below.

65
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:13,630
This link is going to say HTP in this case is going to be local hoze boy will change out later.

66
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,360
All right.

67
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,810
And as a matter of fact I'm going to.

68
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,910
Yeah that's fine.

69
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,480
You can leave it like this for now.

70
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:34,570
Logan and activity that BHP is going to go to this page activity that BHB and then they're actually

71
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,580
yeah that's the that's a page that we want to send it to.

72
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:46,960
We're going to send the e-mail and we will send another parameter here and we'll put an ampersand there

73
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:51,010
email and then the validation code.

74
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:58,780
So then it's a code equals validation code there we go.

75
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:02,620
So once they click on this link and this is going to be our Web site here later on we're going to put

76
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,340
our Web site there.

77
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:09,370
But once they click on this link this is going to send the e-mail of the user in a validation called

78
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,040
hash and encrypt it.

79
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:12,620
All right.

80
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:18,050
And then we can actually create a function to read to activate the user later on.

81
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:21,150
But that's what we're going to do right now.

82
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,390
All right.

83
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:35,970
Let's make this a little smaller like this and here I want to create the headers and I say from of course

84
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:37,570
no reply.

85
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:55,120
At my Web site right to your Web site.

86
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:56,040
All right.

87
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:56,680
Does

88
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,040
Ray

89
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:07,470
perfect.

90
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,690
We'll test this in the live server later on.

91
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:14,490
But right now we're just going to leave it that way it is if we have in the next lecture We'll test

92
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:22,770
it out in our local environment just to see if they the users being register and just we're going to

93
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:23,260
check.

94
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:27,790
What can we get when we put these values in there you are L..

95
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:28,770
All right.

96
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:34,670
So I think we're done with the registration right now.

97
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:35,910
What else can we do here.

98
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:40,400
Al's right.

99
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,210
Yeah we're good for now.

100
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:44,960
Register user.

101
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:49,010
And if we are unable to you say use it for some reason.

102
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,180
We're going to return false.

103
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:00,230
All right.

104
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:00,980
Perfect.

105
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,180
All right I think we're good for now.

106
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:06,980
The next lecture will test it make sure that he's working and I see you the next one.

107
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:07,550
Take care.

108
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,640
Have fun and enjoy.

109
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:10,210
Bye bye.
