00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:01,860
Welcome back my students.

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:06,480
So this is either from the future or I just want to give you a heads up on the following lectures the

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,240
following lectures are going to contain the mail functionality the email by sending email them the native

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,160
BHB mail function.

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,300
Now that works for many people but it doesn't work for a few people.

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:25,620
So if you have any type of issues with that mail function know that I added section to deal with that

7
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,280
problem for those of you that cannot get this to work.

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:34,900
I had a I had a section 12 that deals with this.

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:43,470
Not only do we fix these through the application but basically we improve our application by adding

10
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,860
a third party library called BHP Mader.

11
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:53,280
And that is you know use in a lot of BHB projects because we use s m t p.

12
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,570
Basically we get configurations from our.

13
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:01,740
Let's say if we're using Gmail G.M. first as a.p services for free.

14
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,960
So you got your username the patent number and all that.

15
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:10,830
Plug it into that class so that BHP melee class and then you can send e-mails and they get to get to

16
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,430
their users in about ninety nine point nine percent of the time with a malfunction.

17
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,900
Some of you are going to have issues and it's not going to work.

18
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,700
But don't worry I got your cover if you have issues.

19
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:25,450
Go to Section 12 blog inter-party library which you're going to learn a bunch.

20
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,830
You're going to have a lot of fun with that and that's it.

21
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,210
OK.

22
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,210
For those of you that do have a problem as you can continue learning about the malfunction it doesn't

23
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,010
hurt.

24
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:41,340
For those of you that don't have any problems continue learning and learn about a third party library

25
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:41,870
as well.

26
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,080
In Section 12.

27
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,760
So thank you so much for watching guys.

28
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:49,260
