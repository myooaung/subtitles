1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,270
All right welcome back my students.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:09,600
The Last Lecture I should I actually challenge you to do a simple task basically was to complete this

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,270
right to do the math and minimum of all of them.

4
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,520
And also you can use do the username.

5
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:18,330
All right.

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,180
So I already completed mine you can compare your code right here.

7
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,240
All right for the math.

8
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,010
We changed that.

9
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,730
Less than symbol to a greater than symbol.

10
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,200
All right because we're seeing here now a first name is greater than math.

11
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,830
Then we have a problem right.

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,010
So let me show you how that one works.

13
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:40,250
So I'm just going to write some crazy string here.

14
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,140
Two and two

15
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:50,080
right now on this lecture we will show these in a better format.

16
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,830
But you see your first name cannot be more than 20 characters.

17
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:54,110
That's the first error.

18
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:55,950
And then your last name cannot be less.

19
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:58,190
You see my arrows are working 100 percent.

20
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:05,400
Now what I want to show you is that you can go to get Bushrod that come which is the Web site for the

21
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,410
framework that we are using.

22
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,810
And we can get some really cool components there.

23
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:14,750
Let me show you.

24
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:26,430
So this is Gebal sure that com let me see if I can click on to see SS and then Nye's not in the CSX

25
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:32,620
components and right of component you're going to go to alerts and write on alerts.

26
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:40,110
We're going to find this little guy right here that I like and copy this guy and instead of this plane

27
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:43,460
is really empty errors.

28
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,530
We're going to play some really cool errors.

29
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,050
I'll show you right now.

30
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:54,940
Single quotes because when I have a lot of stuff is going to have double quotes inside here and we don't

31
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,160
want that.

32
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:03,830
We want to take that off because we have some single coaching here that is breaking our mouth.

33
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:09,030
Well our BHB and they say this one here.

34
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:16,170
We just want to display there like this.

35
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,750
All right.

36
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,530
But anyway I'll show you a better way of doing this.

37
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,170
We can bring these down if you want.

38
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,260
I like that.

39
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:32,210
All right let's see if this works actually.

40
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:33,930
Let's check it out.

41
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:38,150
I don't remember if we single cause we can see the variable.

42
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,590
Let me make sure that it works.

43
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:46,430
Let's go to our form and I strive to display that real quick.

44
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:50,310
Make sure you save it right anyway.

45
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:51,840
Register.

46
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:52,170
OK.

47
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:55,080
It's not working with single cause but you can see the message right.

48
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,590
Pretty cool stuff.

49
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:03,960
Anyway you can make this work with single quotes and you can put a string in a variable inside single

50
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,510
quotes.

51
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,540
You can concatenate those like this.

52
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,670
That's why I like to use double quotes.

53
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:11,670
All right well we can do that because we have a lot of double quotes there.

54
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,840
So what we need to do is concatenate this.

55
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:23,430
We can break it like this and break it like this and then do this all right.

56
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,670
And now if we go back to it.

57
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,210
Whatever.

58
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:31,100
Whatever.

59
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,090
And 2.

60
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:39,900
Now you can see your first name cannot be more than 20 character and name thinking be less than three

61
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,610
characters.

62
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:41,940
Pretty cool stuff right.

63
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,260
We want to change the color of it.

64
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:47,160
All we have to do is change this class to from warning to danger.

65
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:47,550
All right.

66
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,460
So that way gives us like a little reddish color.

67
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:54,470
Now what I want to do something a little bit better than that to be honest with you.

68
00:03:55,020 --> 00:04:00,450
I don't like this because I got to be concatenating here this if we had double costs like I said before

69
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:06,840
like this and you're going to see me using this a lot we can do we can put the very well writing side

70
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,110
without doing concatenation but we have a lot of double counting that we can do that.

71
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,780
So what I'm going to do is create something called a delimiter.

72
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,460
Actually

73
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,090
something like this the limmer you can put whatever name you won here.

74
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,710
But I call it the limiter.

75
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:45,450
But it does have a name and I from the top of my head right now forgot echo and delimiter BHP.

76
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,150
I forgot the name of it.

77
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,200
I forgot the name of it but anyway you read it like this.

78
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:12,920
You write your message in a variable you save all this in a variable and then you write whatever name

79
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,460
you want.

80
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,480
And we're just going to create the limiter here.

81
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,670
We put this less than symbols 1 2 and 3.

82
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:27,830
All right and then you write the same word again and you put it right at the end here and you put the

83
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,560
semicolon right there.

84
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,540
All right.

85
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:36,440
Now make sure you have more space here because if you do if you have some space this is not going to

86
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,620
be that is not going to work.

87
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:44,910
So I'm going to command zero control Z and you're going to see that now all we got to do here just echo

88
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:47,180
the message.

89
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:49,150
It does.

90
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,040
All right.

91
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:53,270
And you can pull whatever you want seeing with codes as you can see.

92
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:58,130
Look to that double cords or whatever you want.

93
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,400
All right.

94
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:06,080
Let's go in short in the form to see how we can make up.

95
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:15,440
And I write a really long string here a small one and my mind just went blank all the name of that functionality

96
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:21,500
to be honest so you register and right here your first name can be more than 20 character and your last

97
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:26,020
name can be less than three characters you see as working.

98
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:34,430
Now we came back when we went to the command Z I believe it is danger class that gives us a nice color.

99
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:38,120
Danger right here.

100
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,310
All right.

101
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,540
Let's try one more time because I want to see the color

102
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:46,800
go.

103
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,640
Go register.

104
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,360
There we go.

105
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,640
See that beautiful.

106
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,150
So this is working.

107
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:56,300
And I just show you another way of doing this.

108
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,390
Besides they're just using.

109
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:58,940
All right.

110
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,400
I think this is a better way.

111
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,680
And you can do whatever you want here.

112
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,620
Anyway thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture.

113
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,550
Take care.
