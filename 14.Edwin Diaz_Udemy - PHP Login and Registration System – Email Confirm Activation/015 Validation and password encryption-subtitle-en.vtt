00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.170

All right welcome back my students.



2

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:09.810

So we have created at a valuation function a year for our form which is pretty cool right now.



3

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:10.430

All right.



4

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.670

It's a pretty cool validation and you can't stand it even make it better if you won.



5

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:15.800

If you take more time for it.



6

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.740

But right now we need to create our registered user functionality.



7

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:21.510

All right.



8

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:29.760

So you can make some comments here you know in you say function and this code here would be to post



9

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.880

requests something like this.



10

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.090

And I'd like to do this but I'm not going to waste time on this cause doing that because that's going



11

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.070

to take a lot of your time doing it.



12

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.900

So make sure you put some comments here so that I know that what you know where you are and you know



13

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.700

why the code is actually doing so.



14

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.160

You can put some comments right here in here as well and say what a clean function he's doing and all



15

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.630

that.



16

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.860

So that way six months from now or two weeks from now you know exactly what you did.



17

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.690

So it's always good to put comments on your code.



18

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:57.010

Right.



19

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.640

But anyway let's create the register.



20

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.600

Sister.



21

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:13.800

He's not spelling very good to the register user function.



22

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.160

All right.



23

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.850

And while we want to do is taking some data.



24

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.050

So this function right here is validating it.



25

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:28.640

All right it would be also very good to skip all these data before we even get to the re user user.



26

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.430

Or we can scape it right here in the register user.



27

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.330

Right so we can take that data.



28

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.940

Let's take the first name for example let's take the last name.



29

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.000

Let's take the user name.



30

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.450

Let's take the e-mail.



31

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.600

Oops.



32

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.850

What else do we have.



33

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.830

We have the password.



34

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:50.030

All right.



35

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.860

And then we can put all that information there.



36

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:55.610

All right.



37

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:04.530

So here what we can do is we can use one of our functions e-mail address that we can check for the e-mail



38

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.410

first.



39

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.140

All right.



40

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:16.110

Then we can register the use and we return false or something like that.



41

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:18.410

All right.



42

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:26.400

And the one else f here and we can check for the user name if the user name is just



43

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.510

and we go and we pass in the username



44

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.000

and let me actually.



45

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.740

Wait a minute.



46

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.900

All right this function is not scaping it.



47

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:47.570

All right.



48

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.400

So make sure that you scaped before you even said it.



49

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.440

Send it in.



50

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.650

So it will be very good if you skip all these data.



51

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:56.720

All right.



52

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.980

So let's actually escape right here.



53

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.350

So that way we don't have a problem with it let's just use our escape function that we created earlier



54

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.350

and escape it.



55

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:14.070

First name and we do this a couple of times right.



56

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.620

And I think we need one more here last name



57

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:35.680

scaping this data is not very fun but he has to be done that way we prevent it prevents you or injection.



58

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:36.750

All right.



59

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.790

Shoot me and this would be my own



60

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.460

right.



61

00:03:53.480 --> 00:04:00.420

And the last one password.



62

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.740

All right.



63

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.810

We've got to do something else with the password because we can actually say this password like this



64

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.800

in the in the Users table.



65

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.370

All right.



66

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.830

So anyway once you skip all these data then we can do things with it.



67

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.220

So let's continue here.



68

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:24.440

We're going to return for as well with this if we find a user name in there else.



69

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.900

This right now statement here that's what they are for.



70

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:27.470

Else.



71

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.000

All right.



72

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.830

Here we're going to do our Querrey.



73

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:33.490

All right.



74

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:40.650

So we can say I ask you well and then we doing screen to like that.



75

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:41.040

All right.



76

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.400

But anyway before we do that we have to do something to this bass We're right here.



77

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.600

All right.



78

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:55.970

So all right what I want to do is I want encrypted so I'm going to use the 5 and this function will



79

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.450

encrypt this password.



80

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:58.070

All right.



81

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.970

Of course we can make this a lot more secure by appending micro time to all the time whatever.



82

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:05.810

There's a whole bunch of other ways of doing it.



83

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.760

But this is very secure right now.



84

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:08.490

Right.



85

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.880

It maybe in the future will ask for more actual lectures on how to make this evening more secure than



86

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:14.110

this.



87

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.450

But right now this is good enough for this application.



88

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:18.350

All right.



89

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.570

This is very secure right now anyway.



90

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:27.380

So once the state is clean we come here and we're starting to users and we're going to do the first



91

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:33.470

part in this lecture and then on the next election we'll continue we'll do the last part of his registration.



92

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:34.100

All right.



93

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:47.580

But anyway then we start inserting here the values the column names first name last name user name email



94

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:52.120

whoops what else password.



95

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:58.240

And there are a couple more columns that we need actually validation code.



96

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.040

One does a column that is on the database.



97

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.720

So we need some type of value for that.



98

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:11.480

And we also have active that's going to be 0 and is 0 by the form we're just going to put that value



99

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.460

in there.



100

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:12.940

All right.



101

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.870

So we need this validation code here somewhere.



102

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:18.960

OK.



103

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:28.630

So to make that I'm actually going to do something else aswell Well I'm going to grab the user name



104

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.830

and a hash you as well.



105

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:37.270

I'm going to create a validation code encrypt it and do some crazy stuff with it.



106

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:38.250

All right.



107

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:42.200

So let's see what we can do.



108

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:46.450

Let's just do the five and I'll show you what we can do with micro time.



109

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:52.790

And this has the user name and the user names because sometimes the user is pretty long and we can use



110

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:57.250

that and then we can spend my crew time to it.



111

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.030

The micro time function.



112

00:06:59.040 --> 00:06:59.790

All right.



113

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:03.330

And that could give us a really nice validation code if we wanted to.



114

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.360

Well that's what we're going to be using for this one.



115

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:12.020

We might change it in the future and provide something a little bit stronger than that but this is really



116

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.100

good right now.



117

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:14.210

All right.



118

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:21.590

So in the next lecture We'll continue with this Querrey and we'll get it to where we can register the



119

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:25.110

user and then do all the good things with it.



120

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:29.240

Finish this and then we'll finish the rest on the next lecture.



121

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:32.240

I make sure that you have this all these fields correctly here.



122

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.360

Remember these other columns for your use are stable.



123

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:42.480

Anyway thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next week's lecture.



124

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:43.320

Take care.
