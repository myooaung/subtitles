00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.020

All right welcome back my dear student.



2

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:09.690

So on this lecture we are going to be using reusing some of our extra mail by doing some inclusion with



3

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:10.410

BHB.



4

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.610

So let's go ahead and start doing that.



5

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:13.320

All right.



6

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.470

So let's open our editor and drop all the contents of your logon in there.



7

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.740

I'm using subline right now but you can use any editor and if you don't have any it looks like this



8

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.870

and you want to use something very similar to this but you don't want to pay like I don't want $79 $100



9

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:31.770

for this.



10

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:39.420

You can try the free version of sublime for like 30 days or you can download brackets which is very



11

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.200

similar.



12

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.280

All right.



13

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.170

You can find out about brackets of course if you do a little google search brackets editor makes them



14

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.700

lighter and you can download it.



15

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.500

But anyway so now we can see here if we go to those files.



16

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.960

Right.



17

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.580

And I have the whole folder open here.



18

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.260

What I Did It was I dragged it into the sidebar here my subline name and of course it will give me all



19

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.930

the files.



20

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.590

But anyway we could see that we have a lot of mail especially on the head and footer.



21

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.760

Right.



22

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.710

Let's take care of that right.



23

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.040

We don't want to deal with that.



24

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.290

Let's actually create a folder and let's call this folder includes.



25

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:19.410

Right.



26

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.470

For those of you that have taken courses from me basically you know what we're going to be doing here.



27

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.290

Right.



28

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:31.010

So I'm going to create a file header that HP will want to head for here.



29

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.360

And of course we'll also one other file.



30

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.120

That would be the Forder webpage.



31

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.620

All right let's go to and that's.



32

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.420

And this has everything we need.



33

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.110

All right.



34

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.740

I'm going to take everything from the body to the head.



35

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.380

All right.



36

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.790

And we're going to do some inclusion here so I'm going to say include



37

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.960

better.



38

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:08.560

Actually we are in a folder called includes and then head are about BHB.



39

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.190

All right.



40

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.930

So that way we don't forget.



41

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.490

And what else.



42

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:22.160

Actually as a matter of fact we should take all of this to the footer as well.



43

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.700

All right.



44

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.970

And drop this in there.



45

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.470

Let's go back to that and see.



46

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.850

We can also take that container.



47

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.410

We're not going to be putting anything.



48

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.800

We have this navigation as well here.



49

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.120

Let's do some let's do an obligation too.



50

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.760

So let's go in and say new file.



51

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.240

And it's called is naff that BHB writing side includes.



52

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.100

OK.



53

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.590

And it's got to end.



54

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:53.120

And then just take the whole navigation out of there.



55

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.710

And you know what I was thinking we could put this thing in the header right here.



56

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.780

All right.



57

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:01.330

So



58

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.720

let's actually let's put this thing first let's just paste out navigation in there not that BHB And



59

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.250

let's see what we can do with it.



60

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:19.110

All right let's go back to when they here we have this container and we should put this container H.T.



61

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:26.930

mail tag inside the header right here because this is the beginning right of our Templi.



62

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:33.870

This day of container we have the opening in on the footer which you have the closing one like this.



63

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.860

All right.



64

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.530

So make sure you have that.



65

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.240

Now this should be our end it's all right now.



66

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.390

We could if we wanted to go ahead and put the navigation right here because that's where it goes.



67

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:54.060

So we could say BHB include navigation if we wanted to.



68

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.640

Right.



69

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.870

But I think it would make it very clear it would put it right here that way.



70

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.830

We don't want the navigation in one of our files we can delete it all right because everybody is going



71

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.990

to have something like this.



72

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:21.070

So let's just include it right here and it's include and then which includes your nav which.



73

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.820

And this is the Jumbotron here that's fine.



74

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.570

Let's do the footer and then just copy this whole thing.



75

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.850

And as you see for now we can go out and check it out.



76

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:38.320

OK.



77

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:39.770

Working is the same thing.



78

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:40.050

All right.



79

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.400

So we got everything working here make sure that you save all your files.



80

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.690

All right so now we have this.



81

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:52.230

Now all we got to do in every file is basically the same thing just take all of them off.



82

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:53.070

All right.



83

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.110

And use that all right.



84

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:08.010

This one doesn't even have anything as we can just say activate make sure they activate Bache But basically



85

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:15.110

we can now do this go to activate real quick take all that out.



86

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.220

And then the footer right.



87

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:24.580

This.



88

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:30.690

But anyway admen think adman they all the same you can do that to every page and that's what I'm going



89

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:31.080

to do.



90

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.320

And you're not going to see me doing that because I expect you to do it.



91

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:40.200

But let me show you a different page she had this one here is called BHB.



92

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:41.310

All right.



93

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.150

Now this is a little different.



94

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.310

Don't just care.



95

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:54.990

I called up HP doesn't have an obligation so let me show you called duppy HP does have an obligation



96

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.980

to empty ideas because we want you don't want to distract the user from entering their code here.



97

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.080

All right.



98

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:09.420

So what we got to do is take all these off of course and this is moving here so that we can work with



99

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:18.150

it all right and it doesn't have an obligation so we're going to include the header and all the way



100

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:19.140

in the bottom here.



101

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:20.300

Let's see what that container



102

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.630

this def class finishes.



103

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:26.590

All right.



104

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.770

And we take these three round here and we put the footer in there.



105

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:34.410

All right.



106

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.710

Let's go and check it out real quick.



107

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:40.190

All right.



108

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:41.350

Still works.



109

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:46.700

You can check your page source just to make sure but it works.



110

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:47.120

All right.



111

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.880

Let me see while the page is different.



112

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:49.920

Recover.



113

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.350

It's a little different as well.



114

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:53.800

We don't have an obligation here.



115

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:55.920

All right.



116

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:04.130

So you going to do that basically the same thing we did with let's grab the head or we called up HB



117

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:04.870

and recover.



118

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:05.720

All right.



119

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.670

So you take this container out



120

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.340

get the footer from here



121

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:25.510

this letter last three tracks with the footer in there right register should be should have a navigation.



122

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:26.560

All right.



123

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:28.970

So let's go to container.



124

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:35.790

Take everything out and change this to header right.



125

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:44.240

Take these last three out pasted in there that's the footer.



126

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:47.180

And this one did navigation right.



127

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:51.690

So there you said they have a navigation we need to put the navigation in here.



128

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.160

So this would be



129

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:56.840

like this.



130

00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:58.860

Make sure that it is working.



131

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:09.250

Registration register that BHB now we go to this one they have an obligation.



132

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:11.150

Right.



133

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.350

All right.



134

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:14.600

What else we set.



135

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:15.830

We said those have



136

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:24.020

any navigation software you paste that header



137

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.480

go all the way down



138

00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:37.230

take the last Reale again.



139

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.470

Make sure you check all these pages.



140

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:41.870

Right.



141

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:53.020

And this one they have an obligation so just take everything from here.



142

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.080

This is the last three



143

00:08:58.750 --> 00:08:59.260

footer



144

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:06.390

navigation.



145

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.290

Now let's check let's check out real quick.



146

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:12.710

Make sure that it is correct.



147

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:14.800

I mean that page.



148

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:16.840

All I have is good.



149

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:24.340

If we go to page source we can see that we do have the last container piece we have this on top and



150

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:26.070

we do have the navigation included.



151

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:26.850

All right.



152

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:28.200

So make sure that you work on that.



153

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:33.710

If I miss any of these files make sure that you don't go to each other as make it so that where you



154

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:41.500

are including navigation Hetter on some of them and then some of them the sidebar as well.



155

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:43.960

And then AAVE the footer as well.



156

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:47.080

Footer header and obligation.



157

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.350

All right Logan.



158

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:52.530

All right.



159

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:58.740

This will be the header.



160

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:02.920

I think this will had a navigations.



161

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:06.360

If you see me make a mistake don't follow me.



162

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:06.770

All right



163

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:11.850

and all the way down.



164

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:14.980

We'll put the footer in here.



165

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.830

All right.



166

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:21.930

If I missed any of them I will correct them but you won't be.



167

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:23.510

You won't be able to see me OK.



168

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:27.000

Just make sure that you have what you need on all of them.



169

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:30.880

If you don't have a navigation don't put it there even if I did.



170

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:36.110

All right so we should be aware of files or enclosures on place.



171

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:36.920

All right.



172

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:39.140

On the next election we're going to start working with



173

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:49.320

I believe now with the NSA in initialising our files and our APHC files.



174

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:52.520

All right thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lectures.
