1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:06,510
All right welcome back my students on the last lecture we created this functionality right now to select

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:11,250
the password and the idea from users where the email is the same as the e-mail that we're getting right

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,960
here right now.

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,330
So I told you that we need to pull the password from the database so that way we can use our five function

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:24,240
to be coded so that we can compare it with password from the form because if we try to do it like days

6
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:30,030
just comparing the password from the D.B and the form without using them the FI function is not going

7
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,950
to work because we need to decode it ways in encrypted remember that.

8
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:34,710
All right.

9
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,580
So I'm not going to work like that so let's let's do it with them.

10
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,000
The five function.

11
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:44,430
All right so now that we have are we getting the password.

12
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:50,840
The idea here and we're getting something here we know that the user exist right.

13
00:00:50,850 --> 00:01:01,580
We know that we're finding those but let's go ahead and do something here so we we are fetching here

14
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:06,870
but what we really need to fetch is not as well we need to fetch the result.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So we need to change this to resort like this.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,060
That way we can get the real password out.

17
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:12,820
All right.

18
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:21,150
So if I had this to ask you in the last lecture make sure that you have a right to have to be salt.

19
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:21,900
All right.

20
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,330
All right.

21
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:26,110
So let's do this.

22
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,210
I hope you're having a lot of fun this is really fun.

23
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:30,680
So we're going to use them the fire in the if statement.

24
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:36,470
All right because then the fight is going to return either yes or no if we if we are able to match it.

25
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:46,780
So a password from the form the code that he coded is equal to the password then we are golden.

26
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:47,460
Right.

27
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:48,940
Then we can just return TRUE

28
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:52,320
else.

29
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:56,440
We just you know what we turn false but we're going to do a little bit more than that.

30
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,390
I just want to show you that it works right.

31
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,050
False.

32
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:01,580
There we go.

33
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,480
So let's go ahead and try it.

34
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:08,810
I already have a user here that's called one and I think he's passed.

35
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:17,650
Password is 1 2 3 from the form but you can see here that he's already encrypted and this user is activated

36
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:18,370
now right.

37
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,540
Make sure he's activated because we're checking for those things.

38
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,450
All right.

39
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,430
Actually we're not checking for those to make sure that you are.

40
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,450
I don't know if you are.

41
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:33,920
Maybe I did on The Last Lecture and I took it all from this one.

42
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:39,310
But make sure that it is an active equals one.

43
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:44,180
I think I already did in the last lecture and for some reason I took it off.

44
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,760
Right.

45
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,170
OK let's try this.

46
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:53,050
Now let's go back to it and let's just do the e-mail one.

47
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,580
One two and three.

48
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:57,910
Logan oops unexpected 5:22.

49
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,260
What could that be.

50
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:10,870
Now I don't remember.

51
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:16,120
Right here there's a little guy right here.

52
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,510
See the 5:22 right here.

53
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,980
So put a semicolon there if you don't have it.

54
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,430
All right let's refresh.

55
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,590
Let's try it again.

56
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,010
1 1 2 and 3.

57
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:26,800
Log in.

58
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:32,390
Oops on point two and three logon.

59
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,410
There we go.

60
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,020
So it's working all right.

61
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:41,270
So if we had the wrong password doesn't work let's just try with the wrong password just in case just

62
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:48,650
to make sure we won and is just Dreisinger stuff log in and you can see that he says your credentials

63
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:49,330
are not correct.

64
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:52,620
So even our credentials arrows are actually popping up.

65
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,610
Really cool stuff right.

66
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,470
Really a flexible.

67
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,470
All right.

68
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,070
So this is beautiful like this right.

69
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:07,800
Now on the next lecture we're going to build and we're going to build a function that would take care

70
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,960
of the logging for us right.

71
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:13,500
We already know that we are logged in but we need to actually record this in a session so that when

72
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:21,190
we can detect it from other places in our protection we don't want to just depend on a static function

73
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:24,270
IP where he'd allow us to log in.

74
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,920
But then he doesn't remember us.

75
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,570
We need to actually let our application know that we are logged in and if we are logged in it should

76
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,660
allow us to be anywhere in our application.

77
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:40,410
If we're not logged in the shooting allow the user or the administrators of course Bill to that place.

78
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:40,930
All right.

79
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,090
So anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture I hope you're having a lot of fun and learning

80
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,400
a lot of stuff and I'll see you in the next one.

81
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:47,810
All right.

82
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,730
Take care.
