00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.610

All right welcome back with students on this lecture we are going to be on setting our cookie so that



2

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.660

way we can log them out too as well.



3

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.800

Now my my.



4

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.660

Now my cookies probably expire.



5

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.750

So if I click refresh you to take those back to that refresh.



6

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.580

And as you can see we're back to when that's right.



7

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:20.970

All right.



8

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.410

Perfect.



9

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.830

So let's go to our logo page and we're going to do something here.



10

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.390

All right.



11

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.580

So the first thing that we're going to do is to check to see if we have a cookie right because if we



12

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.950

have a cookie we don't have a cookie then we shouldn't do anything.



13

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.250

Oh great.



14

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.560

So that's a good name.



15

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:55.580

So we have a cookie and it's actually and then this and Albon.



16

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.080

All right.



17

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.370

So we have a cookie.



18

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.390

First thing is on set to cookie.



19

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:09.670

So we're going to use our previous function from BHB on set and then just to make it very clear we're



20

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:16.330

going to say I want to set the cookie to an empty value right.



21

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:27.160

And I want to minus whatever time I gave it in the beginning which was 60 second song and minus.



22

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.710

All right.



23

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.580

That's going to make it very clear that that's our intention is to take care of this cookie.



24

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.090

All right.



25

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.060

Now I really want to be logged into our application.



26

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.330

I don't want to be logging in and logging out because we're going to be working on it right.



27

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:49.820

So let's actually go to google real quick and say something like one day.



28

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.290

Two seconds.



29

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.420

All right.



30

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.740

All right.



31

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:57.910

86 and four.



32

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.110

Eighty six thousand.



33

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.660

All right.



34

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.030

Let's actually do that let's go to Logan to functions and right below here.



35

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.710

Let's just say plus eighty six thousand four hundred.



36

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.280

Log file.



37

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.350

Mine is eighty six thousand four hundred.



38

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.670

All right.



39

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.500

I hope that's very clear to you what we're doing here.



40

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:17.210

All right.



41

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:24.070

So we were always logged into our application maybe we'll log out later but right now I want to be logged



42

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.000

in because we are not out to kick the user out.



43

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.520

Two and Three remember me and that's it.



44

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.340

All right so now we have this working for us.



45

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.170

What is the next step.



46

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:47.470

Well the next step is to work on the Forgotten Password in logon right here.



47

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.860

Logon duppy XP.



48

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:52.350

All right.



49

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.190

Plus we do also want to show this if we are log then but we're going to work on our own extra features



50

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.660

or something like that.



51

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.130

We can work on this too.



52

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.130

We can show certain links if we are logged in if we are not.



53

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.880

We don't show them that's super easy to do without function that we create a log in.



54

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:07.550

Right.



55

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.010

So I'm pretty sure you guys can do that but we're going to do that probably later on when we are tying



56

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.770

in loose ends.



57

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.420

You know where we are making loose ends now you lose.



58

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.200

All right.



59

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.040

So let's work on this function I would click on this is going to take years to recover that BHB.



60

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.410

And this is where we got it.



61

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.520

We're working on the next lecture I'm going to explain exactly how this is going to work and why we



62

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.020

are going to be doing so.



63

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.040

Anyway thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture.



64

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.780

Take care.
