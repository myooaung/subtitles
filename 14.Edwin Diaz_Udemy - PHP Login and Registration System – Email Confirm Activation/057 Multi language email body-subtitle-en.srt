Welcome back my students.

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:06,320
So let's face a couple of things.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:11,720
Well it's not so much a fit scene but Addie So let's go to our same malfunction year and when I want

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,630
to add.

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:19,970
You saw that in my e-mail trapping the development server there for the e-mail we saw that we got a

6
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:26,480
link but that's not going to always be the case sometimes you have to be specific and you have to tell

7
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,980
which remailer to actually send the e-mail.

8
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:36,210
So make sure that you use this method here and said this true true but the argument.

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,700
And another thing is I know some of you are from different countries and you might use defraying and

10
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,450
what you might call it might use different characters in your language and you're going to have things

11
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:49,520
that we don't have in English.

12
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:57,860
So when you want to send things like that characters that are not English you want to set this property

13
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:03,630
chart set and you're going to set this to you T F.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,030
OK.

15
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:12,760
Basically this UTF and coding basically is going to it's going to have a whole bunch of characters set.

16
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,420
Well is this card that says we're going to have a whole bunch of characters.

17
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,540
They're very common.

18
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,480
OK in many different languages so use that and that you should be good to go.
