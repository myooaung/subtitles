1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,920
All right welcome back my students so we have created a couple of functions here let's make sure that

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:10,200
they work right because we don't want to keep writing and writing and then find out later on that they

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:10,920
don't work.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:11,660
All right.

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:21,600
So let's go to our BHB admin my oddment And let's go to our logon app lawyer and squaddie right here

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,460
and you'll see a user real quick.

7
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:30,240
All right let's go let's go users.

8
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,390
Insert first user of course is going to be myself.

9
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:45,420
And when the last user named Rico and password 2:59 validation code is empty and actif is zero that's

10
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,650
OK.

11
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,510
All right let's make sure that we or we can pull that data out.

12
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:50,450
All right.

13
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:55,460
So let's go to let's go to our.

14
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:58,040
And that's that BHB Let's try it out.

15
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,280
All right.

16
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,290
Right below this Jumbotron here.

17
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,840
This used to be.

18
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:06,880
All right.

19
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,370
So we want to pull information from the database.

20
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,210
Right.

21
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:29,560
So let's just do as well here and let's just say select all users should select all from users.

22
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:30,070
All right.

23
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:42,390
And this is find out right now as you Querrey here and we're going to send this guy in here.

24
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:43,130
Right.

25
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,070
And we can assign this to a variable if we wanted to.

26
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:51,250
So let's just sign this to like a variable like result.

27
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,400
Right.

28
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:58,440
And then we got something call fetch array right which is a function that we created fetch the score

29
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,460
array.

30
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:10,820
And we just fetch the results and we can fetch it and apply it to a variable called row.

31
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,440
All right.

32
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:20,640
Before that we saw here let's make sure that we do confirm to use the function confirm make sure everything

33
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,790
is good.

34
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,310
Are with a semi-colon.

35
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:29,830
So we're going to select all from from users and we're going to display.

36
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:33,040
So it's going to come into something like this.

37
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:38,640
Let's use display the user name.

38
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,000
All right.

39
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,250
Cool.

40
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:42,870
Beautiful.

41
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,440
Let's check it out.

42
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:52,890
So this is the index and we got some unexpected errors like 36 on the B.

43
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,240
Let's find out real quick.

44
00:02:55,350 --> 00:03:02,810
So the line 36 What we forget to do to do.

45
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:03,760
OK.

46
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:09,540
This is not a coma this is a dot for concatenation refresh.

47
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:13,270
And now you can see the user name right here Rico.

48
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,690
All right.

49
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:21,770
So we are able to pull information from the database using our custom functions which is pretty cool

50
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,320
right.

51
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:28,210
That way we don't have to write a whole bunch of you know things in here.

52
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:28,990
All right.

53
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,990
So now this is working.

54
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:35,070
Let's jump into the functions that BHB and start working there.

55
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:35,750
Right.

56
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:40,000
But I want you to make sure that you get this right before you continue.

57
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:46,480
OK let me just give you a little bit of overview before we go on.

58
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,910
If you used have problems I want you to watch this video if not you skip go to the next one.

59
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:52,630
All right.

60
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:58,870
So we've got these inat file that we starting everything right everything we start in a right here.

61
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:05,010
We are including that the database connection so it's available to not only they in it that BHP but

62
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:09,930
is available to functions at BHP and is available to every application out there.

63
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:14,510
Because we are including it in the header.

64
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:19,920
So right here in it everything is available even though our connection to our database is available

65
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:26,470
if we wanted to end this file right here in and headed out BHP in that everywhere else everything does

66
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:27,300
here.

67
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,610
And inside these files he's available to everything in our application.

68
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,700
So make sure that you've got this correct.

69
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:34,690
Correct.

70
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,740
Make sure that you've got your functions correct.

71
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:43,250
I'm going to scroll down a little bit so that you can copy anything that might be wrong with yours.

72
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,040
All right remember that these files are available to you.

73
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,680
All right so you can reference them but I don't want you to copy them.

74
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:56,850
I want you to do the work yourself so you can get used to writing it and everything becomes just easier.

75
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:57,220
All right.

76
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,820
Thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lecture.
