1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:07,560
All right so in this lecture we are going to be correcting the address where we send the e-mails right.

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,210
So I just want to do that make sure that you have it done already in your site.

3
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:18,360
I'm going to go to functions and then I'm going to edit the function I want to correct it right in front

4
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,620
of you so that where you know exactly where it is.

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,630
But you should know this.

6
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,500
I just want to make sure that you do it right.

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:31,260
So I'm going to do a control and command effort just to find this function right here where we are sending

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:31,620
this.

9
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:34,720
You see this all right.

10
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,090
So I'm going to pace whatever I had.

11
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,380
My you are well and that's going to send this Sree.

12
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:46,490
He's going to give me the link that I'm looking for.

13
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:47,890
Save changes.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,870
That's it.

15
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:49,960
I'm good there.

16
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,810
All right we can close that.

17
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:53,440
All right.

18
00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:00,810
So now the next thing that I want to check on this here is the Forgot Password.

19
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:07,640
Now we also need to make sure that this recover sends the right e-mail address as well.

20
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,520
So actually we need to go back to there.

21
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:19,010
Let's see if we can go to this again and this should be recovered.

22
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:26,880
SY So let's do my F and let's look let's look for localhost.

23
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:27,340
All right.

24
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,180
As you can see we have it right here.

25
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:35,120
So I'm going to this is for recovery password.

26
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,470
So there we go.

27
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:51,780
Co-host and this one was not set correctly before based on the same code in there and it's going to

28
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,560
go to my

29
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,770
write address save it.

30
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:02,530
All right so now we should be good.

31
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,930
Let's refresh your errors refresh here.

32
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,070
Good.

33
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:08,750
All right.

34
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:12,960
So now I want to replay I want to actually modify walk out.

35
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:18,260
Let's say I lost my password right or wrong and it's happening here and I got to type in the past where

36
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,120
there probably doesn't exist.

37
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,250
Let's see what we get here.

38
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,190
This e-mail does not exist.

39
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,690
OK.

40
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:34,830
I just like to see some errors you guys recording faculty can send this.

41
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:39,440
And please check your spam folder for that.

42
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,360
And sure enough we got it right here.

43
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:46,230
Please reset your password.

44
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:46,910
Click on it.

45
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,110
And we got this link right here.

46
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,220
We can modify this.

47
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,350
This is the code here.

48
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,500
Here's your password reset code.

49
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,450
All right.

50
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,650
And we also have it on the euro.

51
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:06,570
Let's right click and we see we are able to get in this and we can get this cold right here and we can

52
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:10,130
push a strong extremal tagline here just to make this bold.

53
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:10,720
All right.

54
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,610
And let's play.

55
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,780
Paste the code writing here and click continue.

56
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:21,800
Now we are able to reset our password and I'm going to make this something else.

57
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,170
All right.

58
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:34,260
So my new password is going to be Edwyn 1 2 and 3 and window 1 2 and 3 and 4.

59
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:34,900
All right.

60
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:37,710
That came back here and it was wrong.

61
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,410
So my password didn't match.

62
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,510
But we didn't get that arrow there.

63
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:42,800
Let's just do it again.

64
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,490
One two three four.

65
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:53,010
Actually the one to and Edwin and then one two and three and then at one point two and three we sat

66
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:57,060
down went through so we have to work and I already change the color in there.

67
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,290
So if you haven't changed it change it to green.

68
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:04,740
So we have to work on that very very fixation to make sure that that's actually being echoed.

69
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:05,270
All right.

70
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:05,920
Print it.

71
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,100
But anyway the good thing is that it works.

72
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:16,740
And now we can go ahead and say support faculty and we can type in some crazy password.

73
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,620
And those credentials are not good.

74
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:24,620
And if we come here and we type in the right password and when I want to pray log in.

75
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:30,610
While the registration system is complete.

76
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,070
All right.

77
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,030
Beautiful.

78
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:38,550
We can log in again and we can keep logged in anytime we want.

79
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,130
Pretty cool stuff right.

80
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:44,470
So if you're happy please read discours.

81
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,290
Thank you so much for being my student.

82
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:50,740
And if I have anything else to add I will keep adding lecture lectures.

83
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:55,530
You know that I'm always adding lectures if you're taking although my other course is that I have you

84
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:58,460
know that are always at lectures just to make my course is better.

85
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,630
And you always keep learning with me if I learn something new I'll show it to you and some of you when

86
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:07,970
you learn something new you of course posted in the discussion board which is pretty cool.

87
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:11,850
Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you maybe in the next.

88
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:12,680
Extra lectures.

89
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:13,440
Oh I see you.

90
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,090
I see you in the next course.

91
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:16,240
Take care.
