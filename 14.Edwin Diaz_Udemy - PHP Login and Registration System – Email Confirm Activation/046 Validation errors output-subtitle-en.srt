1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,100
All right welcome back my students so I decided to add another lecture here and now we are at functions

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,040
at BHB in Amin password.

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:08,270
Underscore we set.

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:15,000
So we saw that when I was showing you in the life server about you know we said when we were resetting

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,130
the password I typed in their own password the second field and the password confirm in a confirmed

6
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,040
password field input.

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,490
And you know it didn't give us any arrows any timing or or anything like that.

8
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,550
So it would be nice if we get some type of error.

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,300
So we're going to add that right now.

10
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:36,960
So make sure that whatever I show you in the local environment you update it in your life server and

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,790
whatever show you life server you are updating your local environment.

12
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,720
All right just in case you do do both.

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:48,430
But if you do only one or your code is going to be here anyway so the password don't match.

14
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,440
We're going to do an else.

15
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,760
We're going to echo some

16
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,190
validation errors.

17
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:55,760
All right.

18
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,380
Simple as that.

19
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:07,440
All validation errors and we're just going to echo something like passwords password

20
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,920
fields don't match.

21
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:18,990
Just in case and we're not going to test that because I'm pretty sure they worked.

22
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,210
But why you want to do is you want to add this to your life server.

23
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,330
All right.

24
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,890
So make sure that you let you add that to your live environment.

25
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,750
Functions right here.

26
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,510
All right.

27
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,500
And that's going to go in the past will reset right all the way down.

28
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:48,910
You see this right here right right here is make sure this is desk next tag after we direct it is and

29
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:53,500
we're just going to paste that in there like this and save it.

30
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,680
All right.

31
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,390
And that should work 100 percent there.

32
00:01:58,940 --> 00:01:59,350
All right.

33
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,570
I just wanted to for you to be sure that you add that the way you get some verification there are they

34
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,590
don't match or anything like something like that.

35
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,330
Perfect.

36
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,800
So anyway thank you so much for watching my lectures.

37
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:16,920
And if I have something to add or you have some type of some some function I you would see you want

38
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:23,060
to see added to the course please post it in the discussion board and I'll see you soon.

39
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:23,520
Take care.
