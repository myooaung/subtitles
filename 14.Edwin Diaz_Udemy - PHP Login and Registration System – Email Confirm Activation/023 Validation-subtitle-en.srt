1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:01,960
All right welcome back my students.

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:05,630
So it's time for us to go and build this logging system so let's look at it.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,530
First let's look at a call so let's open our editors Let's see what we need.

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,410
We first need some type of validation right.

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:18,320
We have a validation we're ready for our registration system.

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:23,420
So our whole system is going to be very similar but we're going to have less inputs to deal with.

7
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:26,320
So let's go ahead and open the browser and let's see what we need.

8
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:33,670
If we go and click on logon we go to the logon that BHB page and we have two inputs here used to validate.

9
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,130
All right and you can do whatever you.

10
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,450
If you want to validate with BHB You are welcome to but these inputs are already validated where the

11
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:44,640
male 5 would require attribute just like I showed in the past.

12
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,270
But you can of course validate them with an empty functionality that I showed you how to do in PH.

13
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:50,820
Right.

14
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,900
And we can validate them with minimal emet if we wanted to.

15
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:00,240
I'm not going to deal with that on this lecture here I'm going to do the empty one just because the

16
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,920
email is very hard to validate an email with a lot of character C.

17
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,390
We might use some other advanced validations in the future.

18
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,980
But right now are actually five validation is good enough for these two fields.

19
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:20,100
So let's do some empty validation and PSP and let's put some arrows from here on top let's make sure

20
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,070
that we have that in place.

21
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,010
So let's go back.

22
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:23,580
All right.

23
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:34,980
So we got this value they use a registration going to copy this actually and right below here this is

24
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,600
active user.

25
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,970
Let's put let's fix this a little bit.

26
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:48,770
And you're going to punch in Little coming down here would be nice.

27
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:55,220
Let me take it from this function right here.

28
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,470
Right.

29
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:04,340
And they either Logan

30
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:24,220
All right so first let's see if this works so I'm going to do an echo here real quick and let's grab

31
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:31,350
the value they use or logon and let's go to log in that BHB And let's look at it.

32
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:32,530
All right.

33
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,730
We have already we already displaying a message here.

34
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:36,130
No.

35
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,770
PH be right below here and going to

36
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,690
put my call at function.

37
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:47,090
All right.

38
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:54,550
One thing that I want you to make sure is that on pages like ad man you can if you won you can put your

39
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:03,910
pages like admin pages that have this little container here you can put that display message there just

40
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:07,490
in case you one to display some sessions in the future.

41
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,370
Right.

42
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:15,660
But if you want a way for me that's OK but if I forget make sure that you have remember that this display

43
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,560
a function here is the one displaying the messages there the session messages.

44
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,730
But anyway now that we have that in place when I save it.

45
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:27,320
Let's go back and let's see if it works ok.

46
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,180
Oops for one functions.

47
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,550
Where did I forget this time.

48
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,540
Curly brackets right here.

49
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,700
All right.

50
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:51,970
That's not it may seem to do to the downturn.

51
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:52,720
F

52
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,450
line for one of our next showing.

53
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,690
There we go.

54
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,780
All right.

55
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:07,930
So there's this and it works.

56
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,720
All right so we're getting something out of it.

57
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:10,870
Beautiful.

58
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:11,710
All right.

59
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:15,850
So we got the mini match there but we're going to we're not going to use that let's see if we can grab

60
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:19,270
some of these values as well from here.

61
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:26,080
We won the e-mail on the box where I believe that's the only two fields that I have here email and password.

62
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,340
OK.

63
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:30,910
We grab that we

64
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,560
scaping.

65
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:45,010
This is Razor actually is escaping it we should clean it right here.

66
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,850
Can I grab this too.

67
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,430
And instead of scaping I'm going to clean it.

68
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:53,290
All right.

69
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,020
All right.

70
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,980
Beautiful.

71
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:08,520
So once we clean it and we have these validation in place then let's get the rest of it

72
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:18,120
right errors right.

73
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:33,330
Right let's check for the e-mail on the password.

74
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:36,730
So we already have one here for.

75
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,820
No let's do MT actually let's make up some new ones.

76
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,600
So I'm going to make some new

77
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:49,300
with this a little bit more this way.

78
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,170
And we go let's create a new one let's just say it's empty.

79
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:00,040
Email.

80
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,850
I'm going to use the errors array.

81
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:13,660
I was going to say email field cannot be empty.

82
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,170
All right.

83
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:34,000
And this would be password.

84
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,880
All right.

85
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:47,650
We're not going to do else right now but because else would be the function.

86
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:54,330
But let's just say no errors here just to make sure this is working even though it's not going to work

87
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,350
because we have those required fields anyway.

88
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:56,740
But

89
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:08,090
we should see something with errors or errors if we type this correctly no errors.

90
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,030
All right.

91
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,010
Perfect.

92
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:18,450
All right so now that we have some type of validation in place I think this is good for now.

93
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,330
All right we need to log in the user.

94
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:24,940
All right.

95
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:28,700
Now I want you to remember something we have a functionality that we are going to be adding here pretty

96
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,240
soon.

97
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:35,450
And is this session functionality this cookie functionality basically when we click on remember me we

98
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:41,990
want this application to remember us because right now the way this works is if we close our browser

99
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,550
right and we are able to log in but we close our browser and we are still looking to our application

100
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:53,420
when we open the browser again I'm going to ask us to log in again is going to forget about us.

101
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:57,470
So in the future we're going to remember the functionality I'm going to explain to a little bit more

102
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:06,530
later but right now what we need to do is log in the user and then we start working on this functionality

103
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,660
a right because that's kind of extra for now.

104
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,340
All right.

105
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,130
So.

106
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:10,940
All right.

107
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:15,390
So on the next lecture we're going to start working on the log in user functionality.

108
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:21,980
And then once we log in the user then we're going to start working on this remember me and we're going

109
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,670
to start working on the Forgot Password functionality.

110
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:26,690
All right.

111
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,200
Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture.
