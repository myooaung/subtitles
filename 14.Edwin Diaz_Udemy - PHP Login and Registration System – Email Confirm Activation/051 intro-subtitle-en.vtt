00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.730

I welcome back my students.



2

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.700

So I came back to add some more content to the course.



3

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.290

Now we're going to be adding a couple more of features and a couple more different functionalities in



4

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.290

this course.



5

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.660

One of the first things that I want to do is starting with this section here is to add a better e-mail



6

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.060

service basically.



7

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:25.350

So e-mail functionality that is actually going to deliver the e-mail every iching every time you know



8

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.330

somebody registers in your application.



9

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.670

We want to make sure that our e-mail gets there natively we are using the mail functions not that's



10

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.230

not very reliable.



11

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:41.670

Let me show you the functionality here we have if we look for the functions and e-mail you know that



12

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.690

we are using this function to return to malfunction from BHB the native one.



13

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.380

Right.



14

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.890

It's what we're doing here.



15

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.900

Oh and by the way I'm using a different editor.



16

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.310

I hope you don't mind.



17

00:00:53.310 --> 00:01:00.030

You just keep using the same editor I'm using BHB storm here just because this application is getting



18

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.220

bigger by the moment and sometimes it is better to have an ID when your application is getting bigger.



19

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.660

We started this course when application was really small and little by little it just getting a little



20

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:10.210

bigger.



21

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:15.720

So I'm using an idea I hope your mind can still use sublime and still find brackets whatever you want.



22

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:23.940

But anyway so let's start thinking why we are going to be using as a male function idea for course.



23

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:30.280

And I'm thinking we've got a use and I want to use a male BHB mailer.



24

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.400

Now if you look up HP mailer some of you probably are already very familiar with it.



25

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.280

It's a library.



26

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.690

OK is the library for sending email.



27

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.350

The classic one the most popular one for BHB.



28

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.500

OK as you can see here now this is going to be downloading this in a different way.



29

00:01:50.500 --> 00:02:00.840

You can come here to the game page and you can of course download the zip OK and you can come back here



30

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.580

and you can go ahead and do it this way.



31

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.160

OK.



32

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.790

Now you're going to have different classes here that we are going to be including our project to make



33

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:12.160

this work.



34

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.320

This is the Meilleur class right here and it's a couple of examples here on how to use it.



35

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:18.200

OK.



36

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.710

As you can see has an index page there.



37

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.370

And you're welcome to click on that and read some more code examples here.



38

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:34.780

OK what I'm what I'm going to be doing here in this course is we're going to be using composer and this



39

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:41.350

is it's about time that I show you about composer composer is a dependency manager for BHB is a program



40

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:47.890

that we are going to be installing in our computer in this case he could be a server to install BHB



41

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:48.970

the Penzeys.



42

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.810

OK.



43

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.610

Now it's very straightforward.



44

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.560

You go ahead and click on down or when you go to their page and if you have a Mac you follow this instruction



45

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.970

of our window we show you the instructions for Windows machine or whatever operating system you're using.



46

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.120

And this bunch you get a communication.



47

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.630

If you have any issues installing composer which you shouldn't.



48

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.940

But if you do I have a pretty good course.



49

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:20.770

I believe in my web site coding faculty that come in it's a free course you can register and learn.



50

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:28.920

Click and free courses and click on BHB advanced tools and roll and that will show you how to install



51

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.070

things would compose or how to use it in your project.



52

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.720

OK.



53

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.330

So let's get going real quick and the next lecture I'm also going to be using ma'am.



54

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:38.610

OK.



55

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.990

And you know you it doesn't matter if you sample map as long as BHP is working.
