Welcome back many students I hope you have a lot of fun in the last sections on this section.



2

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.760

We're going to have a lot more fun right because we are building the Logan system.



3

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.890

We already have a registration system in place right.



4

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:20.040

We allow the users to come in and register with their unique user name and well with their unique email



5

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.410

address right.



6

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.610

Once they register they get an e-mail right with an activation link that they can click and get their



7

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.980

account activated in our applications.



8

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.470

Really cool stuff right.



9

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.260

So far it's been really cool.



10

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.620

Now we need a login system to log them in if they are activated either or not.



11

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.270

We're not going to log them into the system we don't want in there unless they activate their account.



12

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.960

So if you're ready to learn some really awesome stuff some more awesome stuff then you in the right



13

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:49.470

place.
