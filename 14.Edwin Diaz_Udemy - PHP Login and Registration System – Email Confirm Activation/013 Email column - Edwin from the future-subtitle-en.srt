00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,110
Hi welcome back my students.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,410
This is Eric from the future.

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,670
And I just come back some time just to make sure that everything is OK.

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:06,990
All right.

5
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,560
So in the next lecture we're going to be you know dealing with e-mails I want to make sure that you

6
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,630
already have a column for e-mail if you don't have one.

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,940
I want you to go to your users table and create a column for e-mail right below the username.

8
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:19,870
All right.

9
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,450
So once you have that I want you to go in.

10
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,900
Insert any type of data that you want.

11
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,090
All right.

12
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:32,190
So I'm going to just go insert here and on the next lecture I'm probably going to have different information

13
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:36,060
because I made them from the future but just you know for you to know they're OK.

14
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:43,260
So anyway just type in whatever username you want and whatever e-mail around is going to use these e-mail

15
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,370
here and whatever passible you want of course.

16
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:48,030
All right.

17
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:51,110
You don't need a confirmation code.

18
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,360
If you don't have that column Don't worry about it.

19
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,280
I will help you make that later on but you should already have that and active.

20
00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:59,780
We're going to leave everything else the same.

21
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:03,970
I just want you to have this e-mail column which is very important we're going to be dealing with that

22
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:04,730
in the next election.

23
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:05,350
OK.

24
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,780
So I have that in there have some data.

25
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,510
All right and I'll see you.

26
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:14,090
Well you'll see my Edun from the pass my my other editing in an intellectual.

27
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:14,660
OK.

28
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,870
It was a pleasure like always.

29
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:16,940
And I'll see you around.

30
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:17,670
Take care.
