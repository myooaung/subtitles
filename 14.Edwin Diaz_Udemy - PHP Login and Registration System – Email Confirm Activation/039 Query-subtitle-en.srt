1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:02,610
All right welcome back my student.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:08,520
So it's tough for us to start checking to see if we get some type of response from here right because

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,260
we're doing a lot of checks right now and we're checking for that separation.

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:17,610
We're checking for the talking inside the form just to make sure that he can't die whatever data we're

5
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:22,500
getting comes from that form and we are also checking for that you are able get for the GET request

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,200
e-mail and call.

7
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:23,720
Right.

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,590
I'm going to make a little bit of modification here what I'm going to do is I'm going to we want to

9
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:34,500
check for this one before we check further talking because this was going to be available before.

10
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,590
Right.

11
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,110
So that's how I'm going to do it now.

12
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,810
And then if we get to talking then we can process the form.

13
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:51,090
All right but here we also got to make sure that they know that this is not going to be available to

14
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,090
us unless we submit the form.

15
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:54,390
All right.

16
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,060
So keep that in mind.

17
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:03,360
All right so in order for us not to get an error we need to do it on the set here and then make sure

18
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,780
that we compare it.

19
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:15,930
All right but let's do this first let's go to our recover and get some new validation cause the way

20
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,280
we can test this out.

21
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:24,820
All right so let's go and say warren g mail dot com.

22
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:25,230
All right.

23
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,580
So we got that.

24
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,540
Let's go to our table and let's just quickly refresh you again.

25
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,720
This new validation this double click it and get it.

26
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:39,510
Let's come back to our tax file and that's good.

27
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:46,850
We don't you know this stuff here let's just replace this one here real quick.

28
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:49,270
Need a you code.

29
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,880
Right you see how easy this is.

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:59,860
Now I come back here and paste in the browser and are now looking into our code right.

31
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,900
So now we can go and do this.

32
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:09,760
We can also trend this just in case they make a mistake in typing space or something when they pasting

33
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,590
it.

34
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:11,630
We can do it as well.

35
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:16,630
Right guys you know that let's just click continue and you see we get these undefined talking heads

36
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:22,480
because we are trying to use it when he's not actually we're set yet.

37
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:27,730
So all we can do with that is we can create a new set for that specific

38
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:36,400
person right here where that person functionality person I'm calling this guy a person already and I'm

39
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,610
calling him a guy.

40
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,220
Him Oh stop geez.

41
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,630
I'm already getting too too too friendly with the Coldiron guys.

42
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:46,500
Don't do that.

43
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,030
Please don't get too friendly.

44
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,450
So anyway would check to see if this is set.

45
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:57,700
And we also check checking to see if the talking is set and then were saying and both talking is equal

46
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,140
to session talking.

47
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,490
All right.

48
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:05,500
So we could divide this a little bit.

49
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:05,930
All right.

50
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,760
And compare it so we can do this like this.

51
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:15,880
We can do this so that way it can be a little clearer to you.

52
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,600
And then if it's set

53
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:22,960
we can do it like this.

54
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:23,870
Well like the

55
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,260
right.

56
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,680
And of course we need this one here.

57
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,420
Make sure that you have your 1 2 3 4 5 down here.

58
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:44,120
So one two three four and five.

59
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:47,220
One two three four five.

60
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:52,370
We got this still here we got those we got this one there.

61
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,520
And this is the

62
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,420
access code right here.

63
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,880
So we're good we are good.

64
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,060
And then we can go.

65
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,520
It works.

66
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:16,150
All right this is when we set to break something on that form let's look at it real quick and we don't

67
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,710
get no errors.

68
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:19,540
It works.

69
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,680
Look at that.

70
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,060
All right.

71
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:22,860
Beautiful.

72
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,520
So now we get right to our.

73
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:28,380
We sit here.

74
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,100
All right.

75
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:43,560
So we can say if we're not in we can't select We can update users.

76
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:44,330
Right.

77
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:49,220
And we can set the password

78
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:57,600
equal to and let's escape that real quick

79
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:13,270
we've got to pass we're coming from the fourth from the set so we can do this.

80
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,740
So this is available that means the form was submitted.

81
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,470
All right.

82
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,330
So that's OK.

83
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:23,460
And password.

84
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,580
All right.

85
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,960
So we can all day the password.

86
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,560
But we got to do another check before we got to make sure that these two fields match OK.

87
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,020
Let's do this query first.

88
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:40,670
Where.

89
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:48,840
He calls or e-mail.

90
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,000
Check this out real quick.

91
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:53,480
All right.

92
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:57,850
So before we do that let's compare the fields here.

93
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:07,210
But we also got to do something else I forgot this password needs to be what you might call it.

94
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:10,650
We need to verify this password but this is an encrypted password right.

95
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,540
So that's another thing that we've got to do but let's just do this two things.

96
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:18,250
First if this is this password field is equal to that confirm

97
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:23,650
right here.

98
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,110
All right.

99
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:29,450
And as a matter of fact we need to take it out we haven't converted this into variables yet so we need

100
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:35,420
to use a post super global to do this password.

101
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,830
And I should put this as a placeholder there.

102
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,640
All this is equal to this guy right here.

103
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:53,080
There's going to be right here.

104
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,410
Then we can do this.

105
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,600
Let's test this real quick.

106
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,650
All right.

107
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,640
This is going to be very secure.

108
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,270
Guys crazy secure

109
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,640
passwords match.

110
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:23,460
All right let's check it out if hopefully our cookies night spired.

111
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:26,260
Let's make these cookies expire a little bit later.

112
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,010
Guys seriously.

113
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:34,630
So let's go to functions and mine is set to five minutes.

114
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:36,970
Let's send this to 15 minutes.

115
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,630
This is in the valley they code.

116
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,370
All right.

117
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,300
Perfect.

118
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:43,960
So let's

119
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:53,350
go to one e-mail right.

120
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:01,260
And let's come back here and refresh validation code.

121
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,000
Right.

122
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:16,770
Are based on this jacket then with page that he in the euro and are the same routine that we've been

123
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,010
doing.

124
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,540
Paste this here continue.

125
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,020
We are good to go here.

126
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,390
And now let's just say one two three one two and three.

127
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,380
Enter passwords match.

128
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:28,830
All right.

129
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,870
So we are good to this point here right.

130
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,490
We're got to cut the video here and we're going to finish on the next lecture OK.

131
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,180
I think we would.

132
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,630
We have been doing very good.

133
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:43,300
We need to encrypt the password so if you want to go ahead and do that encrypted password compare it.

134
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:49,880
And if everything is good then we can go heading all day to user right.

135
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:55,500
Well we got to actually we do have to compare it from the database to be honest with you because what

136
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:01,440
we're doing is creating a new password so all we got to do is encrypt a new password and then update

137
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:04,470
whatever we have inside that table.

138
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:07,840
So if you want to go ahead and do that go ahead and do that.

139
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,720
You're doing very good if you follow me to this to this point.

140
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:11,920
See you in the next lecture.
