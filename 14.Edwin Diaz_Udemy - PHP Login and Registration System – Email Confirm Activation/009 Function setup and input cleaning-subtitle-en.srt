1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,610
All right welcome back my student.

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:07,080
So now that we are done with then general helper functions in functions are BHB.

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:11,900
Well we are done for now but we'll create some more function later.

4
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:19,170
What we need to do is we need to go to register that BHB and inspect this functionality right here.

5
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,000
All right let's go to our

6
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:28,090
Peachi my HP log in.

7
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:32,400
And then we'll go to register.

8
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,520
Let me show you the form.

9
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:41,530
Now we know that we have more columns in the database so we need to update this form of the name and

10
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:45,510
the last name field so let's do that real quick.

11
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,530
Right.

12
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,230
So we need two of these.

13
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:49,890
All right.

14
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,180
So this one is going to have the first name

15
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,870
right and we'll have this here

16
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:08,610
for a little bit of update to this.

17
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,820
All right.

18
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,120
And this one we have the last name

19
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:27,410
last name and let's get these user these placeholders.

20
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:32,200
Well my last name does.

21
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,230
All right let's look at that real quick.

22
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:40,130
All right now we've got those.

23
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:41,510
They're in place.

24
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:45,490
Make sure that your form has the required.

25
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:46,320
All right.

26
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:53,160
This is just to make sure that they don't leave any blank space input fields.

27
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,760
All right.

28
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,350
Beautiful.

29
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:57,860
All right.

30
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:01,670
So this for me is going to cement itself because it has no action.

31
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,980
Actually you are right.

32
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:04,840
Perfect.

33
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,600
But we want to validate the data too.

34
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:06,920
Right.

35
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,230
Just in case.

36
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:15,450
So we want it we are validating here already with javascript as you can see we can submit our last day

37
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:24,710
or complete but we this is the MFI I'm sorry now javascript page 5 but we also need to validate the

38
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,260
data.

39
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:30,900
You know let's say for example they use the first names too long or something like or they use a name

40
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,990
too long or too short.

41
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,240
That would be cool to validate.

42
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,060
Right.

43
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:41,170
I'm not going to bother too much with checking to see if it's blank because I'm L5 doing that or I'm

44
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:45,500
going to show you how to do it anyway but I'm not going to be doing that too much in this course since

45
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:50,160
most of the Web sites out there applications are running HD 5 anyway.

46
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:50,650
So.

47
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,880
But anyway I want to show you how to do it anyway.

48
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,960
So let's go to functions at BHP and right below.

49
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:01,880
Here is common that we create a validation functions.

50
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:09,100
We're going to create a function right and this function just Cannavale the it's going to validate the

51
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:09,960
user.

52
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:10,880
All right.

53
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:22,730
So let's create a function validate user registration.

54
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:24,880
Right.

55
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:33,830
And some of you already know that we can do something like this if it's set right and we check for that

56
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,840
name value in the cement right here.

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,060
We could do that right

58
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,820
right here like this.

59
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:49,370
And then we can check to see if our form was submitted right.

60
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:55,370
But we were checking to see in the POSSO pro-global if this is available if he said.

61
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,600
Right.

62
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,830
I like to go another way.

63
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:06,020
What I'd like to do is I like to access the server array server variables and I like to check to see

64
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,900
if we have any post requests at all.

65
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:14,240
And when we do we pull out the values and I show you how to do that is actually a more compatible way

66
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,210
within browsers.

67
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,810
Right.

68
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:21,640
I think my and explorer has a problem when we use the last one this one here.

69
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,390
All right but anyway just to make sure that everything works writing our application we use a server

70
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:36,090
here and we use this guy right here and you can find out some more information about a specific array

71
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,840
that has a whole bunch of variables.

72
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:45,080
So he has one request and method.

73
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,620
All right.

74
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:52,850
So if the request is equal to post and he could be get and I think it also could be put them Patchen

75
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:54,790
and all that good stuff.

76
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,940
But right now we're detecting from post.

77
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:03,710
So if the post requests is equal to posts we want to do something I'm going to just echo something out

78
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:10,520
and say he works and then we're going to grab the phone the name of the function and we're going to

79
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:18,730
go to that specific register that BHB and right here where he says he has his little role here.

80
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:22,000
It's a little deaf with a class of call hyphen.

81
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:29,560
LG it's going to put the funk I'm going to call a function like this.

82
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,530
Let's check it out real quick.

83
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,410
See if he's working.

84
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,260
I'm going to put instant stuffing here.

85
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:45,060
Make sure that I have my e-mail register and you can see now that he says it works beautiful.

86
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:47,090
So he's working were able to make that work.

87
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,620
That's a first step.

88
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:58,020
And after that we need to actually pulao the values one by one so we can use post-Super global for that.

89
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,660
Right.

90
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,850
And the first thing is first name right.

91
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,760
That's the first value.

92
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:11,510
We don't have to do it in order but I think it's a little bit more organized to do it in order and we

93
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:18,370
can assign a variable right away to that value and we can use our one of our helper methods.

94
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:26,600
Not meant as functions to clean this up so we can say clean and now we can remove any unwanted characters

95
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,400
from there.

96
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,850
All right and this is the dove the method that we are going to be using going to separate is a little

97
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,340
bit.

98
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,700
This is the technique we're going to use for all of them.

99
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:42,320
I believe we have like five of them so I'm going to copy and paste a couple of times and I'm going to

100
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,400
start from the left to right.

101
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:52,700
And if you find you can you know pause a video into yourself and see if you've got the same thing last

102
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,830
name and paste that in here.

103
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,990
I hope you see my method there.

104
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,080
All right.

105
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:07,330
The next one will be user name.

106
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:08,890
Copy this.

107
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:09,320
You don't.

108
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,520
It doesn't have to be the same.

109
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,730
But like I say I like to make it the same.

110
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:21,530
Remember these other values coming from the form coming from this value Neema from the is the value

111
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:23,640
of these attribute name right here.

112
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:28,900
The postal Biglow is going to pick up these value and that's what we're getting right here.

113
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,950
All right.

114
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,090
And then we can assign many variable name if we wanted to.

115
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,260
But we are signing this one.

116
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:39,890
You guys already know that but I just want to make sure that for some reason if one of you join these

117
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:48,410
cause and don't know much about it to learn something but remember that you should only be here if you

118
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,020
know basically.

119
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,770
And this is basic BHB password.

120
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,130
All right.

121
00:07:55,130 --> 00:08:00,280
And then we copy this one here see how easy this is.

122
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,940
Once you get everything in place.

123
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:09,310
Now we have to purge the mail entities there all the time and that's not a very good password.

124
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:17,000
Let's just call it confirm password.

125
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,690
That's big.

126
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:25,960
Let's go to the registration that BHP raised that BHP make sure that this field is the same confirmed

127
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,660
park pass we're not sure.

128
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:31,830
All right so it is the same.

129
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:37,610
Make sure that yours is the same Morais right here.

130
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:42,340
All right we save it and we are ready to go to the next phase.

131
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:47,540
All right so in the next lecture we are going to actually do some evaluation here and make sure that

132
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:55,580
these are the the type of size that we want and they are we do certain things and there now we do certain

133
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,270
things.

134
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:56,910
All right.

135
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,290
So anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture on the next lecture.

136
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,030
We'll continue with this functionality.

137
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:02,960
Take care.
