00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.330

All right welcome back my dear student.



2

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.130

So it's time for us to build this really cool function that would allow us to be logged in all the time.



3

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.900

Well first of all if we are able to find to verify the password the first thing that we need to do is



4

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.920

save this in a session right.



5

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.350

We need to let our application know that we are good.



6

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:26.570

So we'll save something in a session and save the email so we'll save the email in a session.



7

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:33.300

I would set that up and now we can create a function to allow us to be logged in all the time that use



8

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.580

and watch function there.



9

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.710

So let's create a logged in function here.



10

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.840

Let's grab some comments.



11

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.660

Plug in function.



12

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.000

All right.



13

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:07.550

So this function is going to be called logged in I guess I don't think we need to give any parameter



14

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.760

This function is going to make sure that the session is set.



15

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:21.700

So we're going to set this here like this when to make sure it's set and if it's set which is going



16

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.020

to return true.



17

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.350

Right.



18

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:37.310

And where we try to boss.



19

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:38.790

All right.



20

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.950

So now we've got to do is use this guy right here when we go again.



21

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:43.640

All right.



22

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:55.010

So if we go to admin Let's go to admen that be hearing admen we can write that if we want to let's do



23

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.870

it right here so you can see it.



24

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:17.250

So if I logged in the right and were logged in then we can say something like Echo logged in.



25

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.410

All right like that.



26

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.570

So they just make sure that we do some quotes around them.



27

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.720

All right.



28

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:26.560

So we are logged in.



29

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.480

Let me just do it like this is clear for you.



30

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:31.340

All right.



31

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.570

So if is loading is going to do that else we can redirect



32

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.480

back to that or something like that.



33

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.770

All right.



34

00:02:49.260 --> 00:03:02.490

So let's try this let's log in so we can set that session tubes one two and three log in admin.



35

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:03.500

Did I forget



36

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.150

line 11.



37

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.930

This is a function.



38

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.410

Parentheses right there.



39

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.110

All right.



40

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.910

He says logged in as you can as you can see that you see that beautiful.



41

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.620

So now that we know then we need to build the functionality that is a log out as well.



42

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.430

They do allow us to log out.



43

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:33.150

Right.



44

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.550

So on the next lecture we'll build that up and then we'll start implementing some more advanced features.



45

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:39.050

All right.



46

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:40.710

Thank you so much for watching.



47

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.840

See you in the next lecture.
