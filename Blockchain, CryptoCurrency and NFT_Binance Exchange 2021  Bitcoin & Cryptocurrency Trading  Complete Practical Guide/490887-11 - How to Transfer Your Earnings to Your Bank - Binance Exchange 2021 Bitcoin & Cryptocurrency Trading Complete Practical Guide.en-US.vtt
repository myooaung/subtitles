00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.250
Welcome to the final part of this course.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.385
Also the very, very important part,

00:00:14.385 --> 00:00:21.810
because you have invested cash which is in your band,

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.340
divide clip dose, and maybe you made profits and you

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.630
have invested facade along and you have made profits out of it.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:37.940
Now, what you need to do is you have a requirement to withdraw then back to your cash.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.365
You need some funds.

00:00:39.365 --> 00:00:46.370
So you need can the script dollars into cache in terms of Bangkok gas

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:53.585
via method that you can't simply cash-out it or use for your normal day-to-day spending.

00:00:53.585 --> 00:00:55.670
So you can do that.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:02.390
The option is that you have to go to your wallet and click all of you,

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:10.140
and then you will be redirected to the OU and you how to select the P2P.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.775
Okay.

00:01:13.775 --> 00:01:17.220
Now what is P2P?

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.860
Why do you think the P2P represents P to P means peer-to-peer platform.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.880
So when it comes to this peer-to-peer platform,

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.020
that means like the finance peer-to-peer platform,

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.820
which allows us to buy Bitcoins or

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:43.330
any other cryptocurrency with the local currency at that seed of fees.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:44.980
What I see raphe,

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.960
so that is what makes B to be the method special.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:57.745
There will be no charges at all when we transfer through this B2B method.

00:01:57.745 --> 00:02:03.185
And also, we have the freedom to choose our preferred,

00:02:03.185 --> 00:02:08.990
the counterparties and payment methods forward trades and any,

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.075
any kind of clip dose.

00:02:11.075 --> 00:02:18.050
So there will be more payment methods available and we set a scroll by, by an N.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.540
So that is very important.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.435
There will be seen on fees and there'll be

00:02:23.435 --> 00:02:29.075
more payment options that we can convert this back into the form of cash or

00:02:29.075 --> 00:02:33.275
bank or paper low at everything that you need

00:02:33.275 --> 00:02:38.090
to spend in your normal current day to day spending.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.715
So I'll show you how you can do this.

00:02:40.715 --> 00:02:44.930
Okay, Let's say I have some USD D bands now, okay?

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.750
I have some USD D clip Tibetans and I need to convert and get it back to cash.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.475
So how I can do that?

00:02:52.475 --> 00:02:56.210
I had to go here and click transfer.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.775
Heat transfer. There will be a window like this from B2B to spot.

00:03:01.775 --> 00:03:02.465
No.

00:03:02.465 --> 00:03:04.744
We are to click middle.

00:03:04.744 --> 00:03:07.430
And get it from sport to be,

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:14.015
to be because spot is where we already deposited.

00:03:14.015 --> 00:03:15.620
Then we did all the trading.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.300
This is this place.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:26.045
So you are going to take your crypto balances from spot color to your PT,

00:03:26.045 --> 00:03:28.895
no P2P tear to be a platform.

00:03:28.895 --> 00:03:32.180
So we are selecting the finance you SDT,

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.100
or you can select any other crypto.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:39.890
And then you enter how much of USD D are going to take.

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.720
I would example, say 100 USD and I

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.330
will click Confirm transfer because I do not towel in a balance.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.325
I will not be eligible to transfer.

00:03:55.325 --> 00:04:00.005
If I do have a 100 WSDL at this time,

00:04:00.005 --> 00:04:03.140
they will allow me so I can click on Confirm transfer.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.990
So now you have taken your answers for two P2P.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:13.115
You are going to convert these USD D dollars,

00:04:13.115 --> 00:04:17.540
a hundred USD into the form of bank,

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.805
how you're going to take in, into your back.

00:04:19.805 --> 00:04:24.440
Now after that, you have to go to this trend, trend Mendel.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.610
Take the cursor down,

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.620
then you will see P2P here.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:37.010
Bam tans for shunts and also 100 plus payment methods you can select from here.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.020
Now we are not going to buy.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.310
What you're going to do is you're going to sell and get a ban transfer.

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.304
You click Console and select the off yet currency,

00:04:48.304 --> 00:04:52.220
which means the connectivity is regulated by your country.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.155
Example you is DD.

00:04:54.155 --> 00:04:56.255
And here you can select,

00:04:56.255 --> 00:04:58.280
if you want to take into bad,

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:05.450
select BAM trans from now.

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.635
Yeah, I chose the band transfer.

00:05:09.635 --> 00:05:12.630
I select bank transfer.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.060
And US D, D,

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:23.450
I'm going to take to my bank and that I see less data,

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:29.030
the bias by the USDA D,

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.190
and they're going to do bank transfer.

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:38.900
So I can select the rates,

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.655
can change the rates here,

00:05:40.655 --> 00:05:49.190
availability and there are some limits that I need to when we are selling.

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:56.660
There are certain limits that we need to match with our by us.

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.590
So we will only be allowed to trade with their balances.

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:01.700
Know what?

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.240
Show us on top of my list is supplier Khan,

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.340
lucky never fails limit.

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:14.300
And the price three USD, D, the USD.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.800
And he's having 5000 word w is d, d.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.040
And if I entertained with Tim,

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:29.720
I had to tread photo value of the $150 to $10,500.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.190
Now again, and he,

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.310
he is allowed with these kinds of payment methods.

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.550
I can need the bank transfer or if I change the mind,

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:42.185
I can also go with the bell with those either verified by,

00:06:42.185 --> 00:06:48.080
I would see I sell my USD T click cell.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.090
I want to sell how much?

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:53.525
You SDD.

00:06:53.525 --> 00:06:59.030
And I will receive 300 US dollars based on

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:07.160
the devices and based on beliefs that are given by the Maya.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.205
And set my payment method,

00:07:10.205 --> 00:07:12.320
I am going to get it.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.840
The man transfer is what I need.

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:21.695
Well, now when I click the bank transfer,

00:07:21.695 --> 00:07:26.030
I haven't added any bank to my by an enzyme gone.

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:28.445
So I had to do is before the trade,

00:07:28.445 --> 00:07:32.450
the they ask us to add a beam and methods.

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:34.640
I have to click on the payment method.

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:40.910
And the idea that the bellows So is then the bank Dan's foil.

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:43.280
Any other Beethoven at that?

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:47.810
You can find from that I loved like that.

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:51.500
Say, you want it in PayPal low scale,

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:54.215
so then you can do that as well.

00:07:54.215 --> 00:07:57.800
And since we are planning to do it for this example,

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:01.230
bank transfer, I would select ban transfer.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:07.500
And then it will pop up the screen door and the payment method.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:11.780
And I have to enter my band details.

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:19.685
And the band, ma'am here and the account opening branch and keep contact phone.

00:08:19.685 --> 00:08:25.445
So my bag will be added at the Vaillant option.

00:08:25.445 --> 00:08:33.275
And when I click on sale to let's say the cell,

00:08:33.275 --> 00:08:35.360
then I will get the funds.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:40.055
The way Bangkok on which I have defined here bit by nets.

00:08:40.055 --> 00:08:45.410
So that is how the whole cycle by an enzyme is happening.

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:47.015
How we can buy,

00:08:47.015 --> 00:08:49.340
how we can invest,

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:51.240
how we can trade,

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.920
and we can sell,

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:58.930
and also finally transfer the profits that we how man,

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:03.520
if you, if not profit the whole amount due, if you think,

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:09.280
no, I want to come out from these crypto trading and take my cash bad,

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:12.190
met our layout investor and with the profit

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:15.250
or loss that they are in good everything then you can

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:17.785
simply take it back through

00:09:17.785 --> 00:09:22.600
the term sorption in any kind of transfer method by selecting me,

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:26.785
the bank towns, rain kind of plants or method that you prefer.

00:09:26.785 --> 00:09:33.585
All right, I hope now we all very good with finance.

00:09:33.585 --> 00:09:40.010
And definitely you can make profit out of this tradings and disease, more trending.

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:44.540
And this is going to be a very interesting thing,

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:47.540
and it doesn't make you a profit and loafers,

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:50.630
