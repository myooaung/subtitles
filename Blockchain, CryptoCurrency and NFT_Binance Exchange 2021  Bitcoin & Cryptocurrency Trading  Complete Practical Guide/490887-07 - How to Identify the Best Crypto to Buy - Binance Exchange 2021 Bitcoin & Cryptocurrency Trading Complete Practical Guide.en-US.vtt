00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.965
Welcome to coin market cap.

00:00:10.965 --> 00:00:14.910
If you notice this is not a part of by Lance.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.425
This is a separate website called coin market cap.com.

00:00:19.425 --> 00:00:24.510
And why I'm here is that if you remember from our previous video,

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.580
we have already deposited tos to our code.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.885
Right?

00:00:30.885 --> 00:00:35.400
So now what we have to do is that we need to understand and

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:41.770
identify the best crypto currency to buy at the moment.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:48.860
Because if you want to buy cryptocurrencies,

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.135
that can lead to different reasons and purposes.

00:00:53.135 --> 00:00:56.615
The first purpose is that you are going to buy

00:00:56.615 --> 00:01:01.910
cryptocurrencies and you're going to hold it for,

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.880
let's say five to ten years.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.440
Because you are not going to trade the other and to buy and keep it

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.240
as it is in the vallate and hold it and look how it grows.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.365
And in case if you see some downfall continuously,

00:01:18.365 --> 00:01:23.840
you will be able to understand through this website coin market cap and

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.240
quickly transfer those downward coins you sell,

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.145
lead them by some mother.

00:01:31.145 --> 00:01:38.314
Improving O heavy now higher demand coined by the time you start investing.

00:01:38.314 --> 00:01:43.850
So investing and holding is about keeping your cryptocurrencies by an N. Keeping of

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.790
cryptocurrencies for more than one meal until you get a good return out of it.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.000
And the second thing, what you'll be doing knees lot you can

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.150
do is the trade you buy today.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:02.675
Let's say you buy one from this example.

00:02:02.675 --> 00:02:10.550
The other end to buy you one AD coin Cardano for our prize on 1.20.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.840
And then when the price rises for let's say $2,

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.445
and you're going to sell it,

00:02:16.445 --> 00:02:18.860
and then you are creating a profit out of it.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.890
And again, your interest in that property does

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.205
not apply now for the same the cryptocurrency.

00:02:25.205 --> 00:02:27.620
So that is how the trading happens.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.570
But wait for the moment,

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:35.090
we will be discussing more in detail about how we can do the trading in finance.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.410
Now I am here,

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.760
as I said to you before,

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.700
we have deposited funds and you need to understand

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.455
the best cryptocurrency to invest whole oh,

00:02:45.455 --> 00:02:49.025
for traded so you can make a profit out of it.

00:02:49.025 --> 00:02:52.820
So this website helps you to understand the rand

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.170
keep here if you notice that I'm not tough,

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.670
cryptocurrency is right, starting from Bitcoin Ethereum,

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:07.985
Colorado, AD by dance coin is the tea pot of colored Sharpie.

00:03:07.985 --> 00:03:11.900
Likewise data many number of cryptocurrencies

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.040
as if I were to tell you the number of cryptocurrencies.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:23.300
You can see here 8,657 cryptocurrencies.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:29.540
Let me click on that and we haven't just look the cryptocurrencies that is available.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.210
I'm sure most of you must have heard about the material, color, no bitcoin,

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.505
cash and excel beyond this,

00:03:37.505 --> 00:03:41.240
that there are a lot are the cryptocurrencies available in

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.680
the marketplace which are not much famous right now.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:52.730
So this is to give you an idea how much up cryptocurrency is available in the market.

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:58.130
You can have a look by going into this website coin market cap,

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.560
and then you click on the cryptocurrency,

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.070
then you will be redirected to the dorsal cryptocurrencies

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.420
available land one by the time you visit this website.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:15.170
Alright, now, I'll go back to the top a 100 cryptocurrencies.

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.940
Now my purpose is to identify the best cryptocurrency,

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:27.380
to invest, to invest my funds that are deposited in my wallet right now.

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.000
If you want to buy year Bitcoin, BTC,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.570
that around price 47,782. White.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.780
Just sent party seven thousand,

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.170
eight hundred and thirty nine thousand.

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.500
And let's say this is highly volatile.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.140
This can increase, this can decrease,

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.815
and it can fluctuate any second of the day.

00:04:54.815 --> 00:05:03.260
So this is the model famous and this cryptocurrencies it needs maturity Bitcoin.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:08.930
We also see based on the history of field look into the history of this kind.

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.185
The founder is the Satoshi Nakamoto.

00:05:12.185 --> 00:05:19.745
And this is what more popular among the crypto world when it comes to the big climb.

00:05:19.745 --> 00:05:23.990
So if I talk on the history of Bitcoin,

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.170
It started in some around 2009,

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:33.590
2010, and started with the initial listing price of 0.08.

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.590
And now the near since then now we are in

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.790
2021 and see the price that imagine if you'd have

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:46.040
bought one cryptocurrencies in

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:52.685
2 thousand and multi-cell value of that.

00:05:52.685 --> 00:05:58.520
Today, it's going to be somewhere around 47 thousand know,

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.660
it can even be 50 thousands because it's highly on the dial just

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.980
before a week ago increased to 55 thousand,

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.410
but by the time you wash, the prices may,

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.320
might have reached, maybe see 60,

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.780
70000, that could be.

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:21.559
So this is all about understanding what are the cryptocurrencies available.

00:06:21.559 --> 00:06:27.080
So you can understand from this website now say I want to study more about Bitcoin.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.570
I just click on the client.

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.120
And you can see,

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:37.940
what you can see here is that the Bitcoin price,

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.830
right now, the current price.

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:46.850
And what is the change in percentage that it is a positive or a negative?

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:52.849
And you also can see within the last 24 hours,

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:56.450
what is the lowest price it when to 40000,

00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:00.350
D9 D. And also highest price it treats to 50000.

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:05.480
So within 24 hours of time, this crypto,

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.010
which is called the bitcoin,

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:09.920
is trading in between these two values,

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.840
the lowest and at the highest value.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.335
Alright?

00:07:14.335 --> 00:07:20.965
And these cryptocurrencies have eaten the market cap or market capitalization.

00:07:20.965 --> 00:07:27.925
Now, market capitalisation of how much each oblige figure, right?

00:07:27.925 --> 00:07:31.300
And what is market capitalization.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:35.335
You can simply understand everything through this website,

00:07:35.335 --> 00:07:38.260
every day level, this cryptocurrency,

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.110
which is Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrencies like I,

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:43.735
how I came for this one,

00:07:43.735 --> 00:07:46.615
it is basically the market kept bees.

00:07:46.615 --> 00:07:49.915
The current price into the circulating sublet.

00:07:49.915 --> 00:07:56.810
That mean how much of supply is currently circulated within people like us?

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.945
How much people have already bought this cryptocurrency

00:07:59.945 --> 00:08:03.605
into the current price is called a market capitalisation.

00:08:03.605 --> 00:08:06.170
Or you can understand through this says read

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:11.390
the total market value of a cryptocurrency circulating supply.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:16.970
These are logos to the free float capitalisation in the stock market.

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:20.480
This gives me, see you the understanding as to

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:26.840
how much the market capitalization or its covers from the market,

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.730
from the means of Bitcoin.

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:33.050
And also likewise, you can see a lot of details here,

00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:35.840
fairly diluted market gap and the volume,

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:39.125
how much volume traded within 24 hours of time,

00:08:39.125 --> 00:08:43.595
a measure of how much a cryptocurrency was traded in the last 24 hours.

00:08:43.595 --> 00:08:50.840
So this much of amount Bitcoin traded in last 24 hours and the circulating supply.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:56.780
Also you can see maximum supply that it can be it is

00:08:56.780 --> 00:09:02.930
21 million and it already these 18 million stays very,

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:05.420
very like around 3 million knees left,

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.655
89 percent is completed.

00:09:07.655 --> 00:09:13.640
So that is why there can be high demand because this applies limited.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:17.420
Okay, So how do you define this circulating supply?

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:21.230
These the amount of coins that are circulating in

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:26.255
the market and now in public hands like people like you and me.

00:09:26.255 --> 00:09:32.540
And these analagous to the flow in jazz in the stock market.

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:34.340
So now you have a very,

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:37.310
very basic understanding how you can

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:41.720
understand in cryptocurrencies whether to invest or not,

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.255
how I say whether to invest or not.

00:09:44.255 --> 00:09:47.120
Because this is very, very crucial.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:50.645
Much easier maximums are placed 21 million.

00:09:50.645 --> 00:09:56.735
And the total supply as of now it's already reached for a didn't really answer this.

00:09:56.735 --> 00:09:59.960
Another, how much 11% is left.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:05.420
So there will be a high demand going forward based on the circulating supply.

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:08.450
After that, there has to be new miners to

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:12.500
mine these bitcoins and non-lethal come into this upwind.

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:18.170
So that is how the demand will be created for big guy going forward.

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:21.140
And a very easy thing how you can

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:27.230
predict the history by looking into the history and the current prices

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:32.510
and how you can have for an EQ shampoo piu future as

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:38.975
to what do you need to invest or whether you need to invest in Bitcoin or not.

00:10:38.975 --> 00:10:45.260
Now, this is all time root of Bitcoin.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:49.385
If you notice here.

00:10:49.385 --> 00:10:53.600
So I would say this from the spine 2013,

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:59.310
August 21st, the prize went for a $120, right?

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:02.990
By today, it creates for around

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:08.165
47 thousand divided by looking into this all at all, all time.

00:11:08.165 --> 00:11:13.250
But you can see is the slope upwards, right?

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:15.320
It's increasing day by day,

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:20.030
that up some kind of fluctuation.

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:22.190
It goes down to the minimum,

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:25.355
but still then the orally it's going up.

00:11:25.355 --> 00:11:32.300
So there's still a chance that Bitcoin can rise to another unpredictable level.

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.040
So it is better.

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:38.885
Sometimes we might think know that Bitcoin is at its maturity,

00:11:38.885 --> 00:11:42.350
but I'm not sure why the diarrhea watch this video.

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:47.765
It must towel might have reached to a maybe a 100 thousand.

00:11:47.765 --> 00:11:53.165
I don't know this possible because that is why we call high risk,

00:11:53.165 --> 00:11:57.920
high return and highly volatile market this cryptocurrencies.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:03.965
So this is how you can have a very clear view about the currency.

00:12:03.965 --> 00:12:07.640
And also another thing that we need to understand about

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:13.460
this cryptocurrency is that what could be the future demand?

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:16.144
Now when I save future demand,

00:12:16.144 --> 00:12:20.870
how this future demand is created for this cryptocurrencies.

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:27.065
Imagine a company which is small,

00:12:27.065 --> 00:12:29.945
famous, let's say, Tesla.

00:12:29.945 --> 00:12:37.280
Few weeks ago, Elon Musk tweeted that he invested 1.5 billion on

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:39.860
Bitcoin and he is going to enable

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:45.755
cryptocurrencies as marred up the money to buy his Tesla us.

00:12:45.755 --> 00:12:53.765
Likewise, there are few other companies like Starbucks and some,

00:12:53.765 --> 00:12:56.840
some other companies are planning and how

00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:01.220
already adopted cryptocurrency payments that have enabled it.

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:05.240
So because of that situation in place,

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:09.620
there's a huge demand that if this bit coins are the clip,

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:15.620
those become a normal day-to-day be one method like the band low-life,

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:17.450
the visa like that,

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:21.110
then there will be a huge demand for these cryptocurrencies.

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:25.415
So don't waste your time, invest and keep.

00:13:25.415 --> 00:13:27.275
You will never regret.

00:13:27.275 --> 00:13:33.905
Said that is something I could say because being in this

00:13:33.905 --> 00:13:40.235
Tread and as high possibility that we get more profit out of 15 fuchsia.

00:13:40.235 --> 00:13:43.325
And there'll be more and more organizations.

00:13:43.325 --> 00:13:48.725
Large organizations currently planning and currently put enough strategies to deal

00:13:48.725 --> 00:13:51.380
with this big guy in and trying to make

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:54.380
these cryptocurrencies into their mode of bare months.

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:59.390
And therefore, people will be able to make Bitcoin payments to buy

00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:05.030
goods and services out good.

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:11.825
Now I will go back again to the market, the market cap.

00:14:11.825 --> 00:14:15.485
And this will be the initial screen.

00:14:15.485 --> 00:14:24.620
And I did not speak about here is the Bitcoin dominance as of two days, 66.1%.

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:27.665
B is dominating the market.

00:14:27.665 --> 00:14:33.065
Likewise, it, the EDS idiom to L binds 7%.

00:14:33.065 --> 00:14:36.830
They have captured that alter double hockey.

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:40.325
So they are like the Giants first 10 seconds.

00:14:40.325 --> 00:14:44.855
And there are some other coins trying to come up.

00:14:44.855 --> 00:14:49.099
Now if you feel like looking into this Bitcoin,

00:14:49.099 --> 00:14:50.390
yeah, I said positive.

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:53.930
The glean got to indicate it's positive right now that is,

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:59.510
there can be improvement compared to the last seven days.

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:02.150
And the red color indicates a downturn.

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:06.529
Name is Erin and down turn and then it can again increase.

00:15:06.529 --> 00:15:09.950
But these are tough, expensive right now.

00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:11.750
As I said before,

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:14.585
based on the situation that you watch this video.

00:15:14.585 --> 00:15:18.620
And there are some cryptocurrencies like Cardano,

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:23.090
ED few naught this 1.2 fellows,

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:28.430
and increase in person pages 29 percent,

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:30.560
that's a significant value.

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:38.000
Imagine this clip though you're investing a $100 and

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:45.620
now you're gonna get a 100 ADA of this crypto.

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:53.400
And in, toward our than 25 or 2030,

00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:57.665
this can reach to another Beta level.

00:15:57.665 --> 00:15:59.990
So how you can do that is now you,

00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:02.555
here you can see 24 hours.

00:16:02.555 --> 00:16:06.590
I'm going to see within 24 hours,

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:12.110
what is the most increased crypto E, W,

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:15.890
T analogy web token within this trend default,

00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:19.625
this is the most increased cryptocurrency.

00:16:19.625 --> 00:16:25.595
Likewise, other cryptocurrencies, these are very new.

00:16:25.595 --> 00:16:26.840
This could be new,

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:31.310
or these maybe not much famous and link is of course,

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:33.995
be tough into the market right now.

00:16:33.995 --> 00:16:35.960
It always had a 55, 9,

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:39.630
2% within the last 24 hours.

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:45.620
And now I'm going to see what is the clip thought that

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:50.960
went down most within the last 24 hours.

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:58.805
If I thought I heard Louis simply again click this 24 hour, the icon clickable.

00:16:58.805 --> 00:17:02.060
You can simply click on that then new again.

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:04.280
Our Lady split.

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:08.510
What is the product went down in a higher percentage.

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:11.300
Likewise, within the last seven days,

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:13.850
if I click several one-d,

00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:15.980
within the last seven days,

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:19.610
80 percent increase for E and G.

00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:21.350
That is a very,

00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:24.860
very significant percentage, right?

00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:27.020
80 percent.

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:32.645
Likewise, there are the coins with 54%.

00:17:32.645 --> 00:17:37.910
And there are a lot deeper sense of these

00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:43.145
are positive change and these kinds of coins you have to be very careful lamp.

00:17:43.145 --> 00:17:46.130
It's better if you can buy some monkey because there's

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:51.439
a huge increase in percentage compared to this previously,

00:17:51.439 --> 00:17:54.830
so that could have a possibility to increase.

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:58.940
Likewise, you can see my data cryptosystem that having a

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:05.690
negative downward compared to the last seven days egg this case.

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:10.145
So you have to avoid investing in non Crypto layer this.

00:18:10.145 --> 00:18:14.280
So you will not

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:22.610
suffer from invest in or not on cryptocurrency if you properly analyze this.

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:25.310
As I said, if you want to go further,

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:28.670
investigate and identify its trends and patterns,

00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:35.060
you can still go on but the crypto itself and look into the analysis.

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:40.280
So likewise, you can review what has happened.

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:47.180
So these are the analysis that gives for the cryptocurrency

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:56.360
ICO St. that on our data because that is some seems to be a newly introduced crypto.

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:58.355
Likewise, you can have a very,

00:18:58.355 --> 00:19:02.570
very clear understanding as to what cryptocurrencies you need to buy.

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:05.225
Based on the the,

00:19:05.225 --> 00:19:11.060
the patterns are the trends with the demand that the script toes good.

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:13.760
And based on the signals, as I said,

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:17.660
signals the news that you would here.

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:21.440
You can also go to websites like the block folio.

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.015
You can have a mobile lab.

00:19:23.015 --> 00:19:28.145
So those kinds of the websites will give you the Sedna's what is happening,

00:19:28.145 --> 00:19:33.515
how many big companies trying to influence on this crypto market?

00:19:33.515 --> 00:19:38.135
And therefore, what is the likely hood up increase in price.

00:19:38.135 --> 00:19:47.465
So that understanding you can clearly have through the signals to these Bitcoin market.

00:19:47.465 --> 00:19:53.810
I owe blah, we are clear as to what crypto that you would like to buy.

00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:56.689
Of course meet easy tedium.

00:19:56.689 --> 00:20:05.345
They are the dominant San data drift towards like the polka dot and power two x RP.

00:20:05.345 --> 00:20:10.130
Rp is considered as more,

00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:14.420
more of a payment method where

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:19.865
many companies are implementing and adopt in this Sharpie pay on that debt.

00:20:19.865 --> 00:20:26.045
And therefore there is more likelihood of having future demand for these crypto.

00:20:26.045 --> 00:20:27.425
Just keep in mind.

00:20:27.425 --> 00:20:31.670
And these can be prediction said with

00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:36.140
predictions and good values for these cryptocurrencies.

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:41.915
The chain link also have in the past two fingers as of now.

00:20:41.915 --> 00:20:45.470
So it's all about doing Westin now.

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:48.934
And another interesting kinase, the dogecoin.

00:20:48.934 --> 00:20:54.785
This became very interesting right after Elon Musk tweeted about the sensory,

00:20:54.785 --> 00:20:59.645
mentioning that he, he bought somewhat Dogecoin for his son.

00:20:59.645 --> 00:21:03.080
And this is also considered to be a meme coin.

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:07.550
And since there are some backup and some,

00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:10.790
some influence for the script dose,

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:13.730
all right, now that is a negative two.

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:16.280
The value is without dropping.

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:20.810
And within the last seven days the value is good,

00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:24.560
that there can be a good future if there

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:28.445
are some influencing people around these cryptocurrencies.

00:21:28.445 --> 00:21:33.680
So those are also factors that we need to consider when we are selecting

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:40.984
one cryptocurrency that we have a mess at that time that you are going to invest.

00:21:40.984 --> 00:21:45.050
So keep in mind by the time you visit this and watch this goes.

00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:51.439
And by the time you try to invest in crypto to study the current trends and practices

00:21:51.439 --> 00:21:58.430
by that time at the signals and study the time that you are trying to invest.

00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:00.080
Dude.

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:05.480
All right, so we have colored coin market cap.

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:08.900
And now I have say, Okay,

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:12.860
I'm selecting AB to buy now.

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:18.500
And that is what I have decided from this website.

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:20.945
This gives me a lot of information.

00:22:20.945 --> 00:22:23.285
This electron, Dubai.

00:22:23.285 --> 00:22:30.120
Well now let's go back to bind ends and let's do some Freddy.
