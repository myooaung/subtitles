00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.760
Hello everyone.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.420
Now let's look into the way are

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.400
the process of selling Maya cryptocurrencies from the previous video,

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.570
we have already selected the ADA cryptocurrency

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:30.590
against the tyranny of now I'm going to sell my EB or the harder now the cryptocurrency,

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.445
which I have a balance of 16.3 coins.

00:00:34.445 --> 00:00:36.650
I'm going to sell these against it.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.085
The area that mean I'm going to sell it area.

00:00:40.085 --> 00:00:45.020
And to get the ETH.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.800
Say I have 16, but I do not want to,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.400
since all of my sixteenths I want to say lonely 10.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.365
So you entertain here.

00:00:54.365 --> 00:00:58.625
And in terms of the Ethereum,

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:02.430
the daughter will be 0.08148.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.835
And you can click Console and so you can make the sale here.

00:01:06.835 --> 00:01:09.730
So that is our dis-ease exchange.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.395
You buy a new cell,

00:01:11.395 --> 00:01:16.330
you by even the price fluctuations when it is at

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.265
a lower price and you sell us when the price is increased.

00:01:21.265 --> 00:01:22.945
So this is very easy.

00:01:22.945 --> 00:01:25.810
It is, it is very simple.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.940
It's only about you select the right cryptocurrency to buy and sell.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.815
And you also how to wait and see when the prices are increasing.

00:01:35.815 --> 00:01:39.250
That you can check from these charts.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.875
You bought in that this level,

00:01:41.875 --> 00:01:44.295
let's say you bought it that.

00:01:44.295 --> 00:01:46.820
See you now point 0, 0, 3,

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.180
9 level and you're going to sell it at Theta 1,

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.595
0, 1, so you're making a profit,

00:01:52.595 --> 00:01:54.335
they get Bill be appropriate.

00:01:54.335 --> 00:02:00.980
So that is how you have to think in terms of trade in menu to the exchange.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.145
This is how you can make profit.

00:02:04.145 --> 00:02:06.590
We discussed two methods.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.065
One is you buy you, hold,

00:02:09.065 --> 00:02:13.235
and wait for IOS to come,

00:02:13.235 --> 00:02:15.020
let's say five to 10 years.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.750
And probably the price would go up because there's a huge demand nowadays and also

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.320
the future demand is almost a kind of certain now

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.489
based on the company's behavior, the corporates behavior.

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.720
And secondly, what we can do in this above it by,

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.630
by Anansi is that we can trade,

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.939
we can buy at a lower rate and settled and the prices are increased.

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:44.660
So that is how the Finance selling,

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.080
the exchange of finance is happening.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:55.160
All right, So we are now very clear as to what we are doing.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:04.020
And we had done a training now as well of your lab clear with this Great.
