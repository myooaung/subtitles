00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:14.865
Well, now you're in the overview of this account.

00:00:14.865 --> 00:00:20.205
From this screen, you can see how much of your balance,

00:00:20.205 --> 00:00:23.310
the current balance of the cryptocurrencies and what

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:30.045
cryptocurrencies is over leaving most of it out of your total cryptocurrency values.

00:00:30.045 --> 00:00:31.650
So that is over.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.690
You can see here under your how I KPIs,

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.920
I clicked on my account and then click Done my email address,

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.505
then I will be redirected to the dashboard.

00:00:46.505 --> 00:00:48.785
So like I showed you.

00:00:48.785 --> 00:00:52.580
And so this is going to

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.510
be my overview of the cryptocurrencies that I'm currently hold in.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.460
So for this specifically,

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.630
this account is created to show for that training purpose.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.915
So you all can see some balances here.

00:01:05.915 --> 00:01:13.070
Well, now you have a good idea as to how it will appear.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.410
But of course, you do not know how you can

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.695
buy and sell still because you are going to do it.

00:01:18.695 --> 00:01:21.710
And the next sessions also,

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.945
you can go to the Overview.

00:01:23.945 --> 00:01:28.670

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.235
Yeah. But you can go to wallet,

00:01:31.235 --> 00:01:35.040
click on Wallet, and click on all of you.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:45.965
This view, you wouldn't be able to see how much up here to our little balance.

00:01:45.965 --> 00:01:47.855
Yeah, hold in.

00:01:47.855 --> 00:01:54.290
Now, hold in this much of BTC value in terms of dollars,

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:01.805
it's a $100 and the setCount in this account specifically.

00:02:01.805 --> 00:02:04.415
And then you can see here,

00:02:04.415 --> 00:02:07.430
in terms of fear and spark trade in,

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.280
I have one business card on this knife,

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.950

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.830
This shows a little allele,

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.135
all of the combination or the summation of these daughters.

00:02:26.135 --> 00:02:30.530
And since yesterday, how much profit I have made,

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:31.775
I have made a six.

00:02:31.775 --> 00:02:36.200
Now that's explained 14 since yesterday,

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.975
which is a change by sent out positive change percent of 6.5% as red.

00:02:41.975 --> 00:02:46.940
So these are my cryptocurrencies that they have invested in.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.505
The second, you can see here the bulk or dark link, ABA,

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:58.520
