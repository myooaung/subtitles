1
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,540
Welcome back to part four.

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:11,550
We're going to go right where we left off last time and now add in our actual date picker as a core

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,490
component and then linked that to our callback.

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,810
And there's a couple of things we're going to change when we link it to the callback such as formatting

5
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,210
back from a string to a Date Time object.

6
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,050
Let's get started.

7
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,390
OK here we are back at the text editor.

8
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:29,910
We've done our imports created dash and then what we're going to do before we get started is refactor

9
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,820
our layout just a little bit.

10
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:36,690
The fact that we're going to do is we're going to put H-3 an input into its own div and that way we

11
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,900
can line it up with a div for the date picker.

12
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:48,900
So right after H-1 we're going to do here is say T.M. div and then number pass and a list there comma

13
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,990
and we're going to grab everything from H-3 and input.

14
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,680
And in fact we're going to delete that comma.

15
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,590
Grab this cut and paste it into that list.

16
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:04,450
So essentially we just took H-3 input and put it into a list inside of this new division.

17
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:09,900
And here is where we can edit a little bit of styling for the H-3 where we're going to do here is inside

18
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,150
of the H-3 call.

19
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,150
I'm going to add in the style dictionary and say padding right.

20
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:19,790
And set that equal to 30 pixels.

21
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,120
Essentially we're going to be doing here is giving a little more room.

22
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:26,450
So it lines up for next year that we're going to create this input it's going to stay the same.

23
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:31,850
My ticker symbol Tesla and we're going to add in one more parameter here.

24
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,080
We'll say style.

25
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,330
And let's get rid of this comment.

26
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,130
Style is equal to.

27
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,160
We're going to edit the font size a little bit so it looks a little nicer.

28
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,800
So 24 font size.

29
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:50,710
And let's give it a width of 75 to notice that's not a percentage is just a number there.

30
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,800
And then we're going to pastille for this entire div.

31
00:01:53,810 --> 00:02:00,610
So here's the list of the div let's say comma after that list and pass in its own style dictionary.

32
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:05,790
Say display inline block.

33
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,340
It lines up with the div we're about to create.

34
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:14,560
Then we're also going to say vertical align is top.

35
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,580
OK so that's this div right here.

36
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:25,820
We're going to put in one more T.M. div comma after that and here's where it ends at in another Hetter

37
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,550
or H-3 and the date picker.

38
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:34,160
So inside that list will say each div T.M. H.

39
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:41,870
And this is going to say select a start and end dates and then right below that.

40
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:51,400
Still inside this list for this div we're going to put a core component date picker range.

41
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:55,430
And of course if check of the documentation this is essentially the component that brings up a little

42
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,550
calendar free to pick data from.

43
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:05,550
So we'll give it the ID of my date picker and we're going to add in a couple of parameters here.

44
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:09,840
Essentially the parameters you add in are the minimum and maximum dates allowed and then the default

45
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,660
Vartan and dates so many dates allowed.

46
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,620
Well is it that this is really just an arbitrary choice here.

47
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:26,270
But let's have it only go back to January 1st of 2015 and let's have the maximum date be today.

48
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:32,210
So the way to do that is just say Max they allowed is equal to and then calling date time you can say

49
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:34,050
today.

50
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,280
So those here now are still important date time in order to do these calls.

51
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,330
Time today.

52
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,240
And then we can set a default start date.

53
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:53,180
So start is equal to date time the default start date just be the first of 2018 and we'll have the default

54
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,250
end date be.

55
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,450
Let's just have that also be today date time

56
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:04,250
OK so we have those parameters the minimum maximum dates allowed as well as default started and dates.

57
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:10,190
We're also going to do is for this div including H-3 and it pick range inside this list.

58
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:14,690
I'm going to do is read after that list add in a style dictionary.

59
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:19,820
And we'll just set the display to be inline block

60
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:27,200
OK perfect save that we'll still keep the same graph and we'll be updating that figure.

61
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,310
So remember that we can take in multiple inputs in sawder callback.

62
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:35,030
So the inputs we're most interested in is this start and end date.

63
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,990
So it's come back down here.

64
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:48,020
Here's our input and we're going to do here is in this input from my date picker I'm going to grab that

65
00:04:48,080 --> 00:05:01,460
start date parameter and then I'm also going to grab again from my date picker the end date parameter.

66
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:02,150
There we go.

67
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:07,660
So this list of inputs is passed in the same order to update graph.

68
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,510
So that stock ticker parameter is going to be the value.

69
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,120
And then you want start date and end date.

70
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,520
So it's past those in as well.

71
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:17,840
Make sure these are in the same order start date and date.

72
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:23,490
Now unfortunately it would be really nice if I could then just say start here is equal to start date

73
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,950
but it's not going to work that way because what happens is and this is kind of an annoying feature

74
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,850
but it's just the way it's going to have to work is date picker range internally.

75
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:34,350
It's dealing with date time objects.

76
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,590
So that's no problem.

77
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:42,540
However once you actually grab it and then pass it into this input it's going to grab its string representation

78
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:48,470
which is fine except that string representation isn't going to work with this web data reader call.

79
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:53,690
So we actually need to then reformat this string again to be a Date Time object.

80
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:58,410
So the way we do that is using Date Time strip time.

81
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:05,220
So I'll show you how to do that will say date time Dot strict time and then we're going to grab that

82
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:12,720
start date string we grab from the beginning all the way to index 10 of that string and then we pass

83
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,880
and the formatting we want and the way this works to say percent sign the Y stands for a year.

84
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:22,000
Percent sign and stands for a month and then percent science.

85
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,640
That's an effort to date.

86
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:29,580
So what this is doing is basically saying hey the strings come in this format go ahead and then convert

87
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:34,650
that string into a date time object called start so we can then pass in here into our data reader.

88
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:39,340
And that's again because even those start date inside a date picker is the date time object.

89
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:44,330
By the time it gets passed into the input what Dash's doing ascribing the string representation of it.

90
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:48,850
So inside of this because we want to add a date time we need to reformat it again.

91
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:54,500
I'm going to copy this paste here and then for the end and sort of start date it's going to be.

92
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,480
And the all right save that then.

93
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:06,010
Now we have a data frame where the index is going to represent the actual time stamp and then the closing

94
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,030
column is going to represent the close price.

95
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,040
And we can do this.

96
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:15,840
You can either say that close but it's usually recommended that you do a more classic Pancho's column

97
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:20,850
call by passing a string in braces so we can say DFI close in this manner as well.

98
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,890
Let's save this and let's make sure we have no errors here.

99
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:28,690
It's really easy especially when you're adding in new divs up here to get typos of commas.

100
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,950
Let's make sure we haven't done that ourselves.

101
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,500
Let's say I'm basically a pie.

102
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,320
And like is mentioned really easy.

103
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:40,810
Looks like a start date date time isn't working here so let's make sure we did that correctly actually

104
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:44,210
put an 0 there that should just be the number one.

105
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,750
Let's save that and let's run this again.

106
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:53,720
Python basically pie and it looks like we have one more issue here.

107
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:57,130
The argument might the picker start is not a type dash.

108
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:05,240
Put so we'll come back down here and it looks like I forgot to actually put these into an input function.

109
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:08,320
So it's copy and paste that down here.

110
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,470
There we go.

111
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:15,070
So that's what I'm trying to tell you it says hey you're not doing a dash input which makes sense because

112
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,340
I was just passing in a tuple.

113
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:19,040
I should have in passing in a list of input functions.

114
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:24,400
So hopefully this helps you debug your own code or just get practice really in reading these errors

115
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:26,280
understanding how that reflects your code.

116
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:30,080
So it's a more realistic experience you're not going to be perfect on your first try.

117
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:32,000
My thumb based up-I we run this again.

118
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,300
Good.

119
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,240
Now we're ready to go.

120
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:38,170
So let's go back toward dashboard OK here's my dashboard you can see right now it looks like it's falling

121
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:43,100
along the default January 1st and then all the way to today's date.

122
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,850
I'm going to edit our dates.

123
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,980
So let's go back much further in time.

124
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:53,140
Maybe something like May 2017 and it's actually grab a month of data may 2017 the whole month and then

125
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:56,880
boom we have updated and let's choose another stock.

126
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:01,130
Make sure that still works we'll choose Apple and updated for Apple stock.

127
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:01,590
OK.

128
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,410
Awesome.

129
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:07,150
Now what would be nice if we can later add in something like state to actually then just have a submit

130
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:07,640
button.

131
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:12,760
So once we're ready for actual start and end dates and our stock symbol then we can tell the plot to

132
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,870
adjust and graph.

133
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:17,770
So we're going to do that and some of the next steps and we'll see at the next lecture.
