00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:06.450
Welcome back.

2
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.980
So you not learned a lot about callbacks and interactive components in general.

3
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.720
What we want to do now is test your new skills with a simple interactive components exercise.

4
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.120
So the main idea here is we're going to show you a dashboard and your job is going to be to recreate

5
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.810
it.

6
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.180
Keep in mind you can take two approaches to this exercise.

7
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.810
Either you can try on your own to recreate it or you can treat it as a Kotok lecture by jumping to the

8
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.570
next lecture of the solution and coding along with us.

9
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.220
But I would suggest that you try your best to do it all on your own.

10
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.050
That way when you think of a dashboard in your head you're able to implement it with Dash.

11
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.080
So let's show you with the finished application should look like.

12
00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.060
OK so this is the application.

13
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.930
You're going to be creating as a dashboard and it's basically two main components here.

14
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.800
You have this slider component.

15
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.660
And you'll notice you have two markers here.

16
00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.650
One to select something on the left and one to select a number on the right and the result over here

17
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.190
is an output of this number on the left.

18
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.150
Multiply by this number on the right.

19
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:13.020
So for example if I select negative two and one here whoops negative two and drag the sky over to one

20
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.970
then 1 times negative 2 is equal to negative 2.

21
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.040
But if I move this over to 3 that I get three times negative two is equal to negative six.

22
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:28.010
So I have this marker and I can't move them until I multiply the first point by the second point.

23
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.260
So negative 4 times negative one is for.

24
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.330
Now notice we haven't directly shown you how to create a range slider in this fashion where you have

25
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.610
two points that you can drag along what you're going to have to do is look in the documentation grab

26
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.240
their example and adjust it to what you need.

27
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.610
It's up to you what the top and bottom limit should be.

28
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.370
Here we've gone from negative five to six but it's really up to you.

29
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.340
What number limits you on this side.

30
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.750
The main idea here of this dashboard is that you have this range slider.

31
00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.790
You can choose a left point on it and a right point on it and it will give you the first point multiplied

32
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.840
by that last point.

33
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.580
So in this case negative three times five it will output negative 15.

34
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:09.410
OK.

35
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.620
So we've also given you some skeleton code.

36
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.980
Let's take a look at it all right here we are at the exercise.

37
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:21.900
So this is the interactive components that py file under interactive components exercise and it's very

38
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.400
basic skeleton code basically you're going to do your imports launch the application and then set up

39
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.780
your dash layout.

40
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.210
We want to keep this really open for you.

41
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.730
And again the main idea here is that if you see a dashboard in real life or if you think of a dashboard

42
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.070
in your mind you're going to be able to recreate it by leveraging what you already know.

43
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.420
Along with examples in the documentation.

44
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:49.080
So remember in the guidebook or in the online search you can find the components page for dash all those

45
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.020
core components you're going to be using them.

46
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.340
You basically just need one for that range slider.

47
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.440
And then some output component that we've seen before that can just be in a simple div and you provide

48
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.480
that children string.

49
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.040
OK.

50
00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.470
Best of luck with this exercise.

51
00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.400
There's lots and lots of different ways to do it.

52
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.350
So keep in mind in the next lecture we're going to go over an example solution.

53
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.490
It's not the only way to solve this dashboard but it's one we're going to present for you.

54
00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.860
OK.

55
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.920
We'll see if the next lecture where we go over the solution.
