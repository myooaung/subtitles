00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.370
Welcome back.

2
00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:12.730
So as I was previously saying we have the capability to convert plotline into Dasch basically allowing

3
00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:19.850
us to insert what we already know about polygraph objects into a dash dashboard so we're going to be

4
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:26.060
doing and this lecture is showing you how you can use those dash core components graph and then insert

5
00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.800
figures that you already know how to create with normal plot.

6
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.150
So we're going to begin with a simple example of inserting a single plotless scatterplot into the dashboard.

7
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.430
And later on we're going to expand on this idea to answer multiple plots.

8
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.900
But right now in this lecture we'll keep it simple by importing and essentially inserting a plotless

9
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.280
scatterplot into the dash dashboard.

10
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:48.540
Let's get started.

11
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.350
OK here I am in my basic thought py file.

12
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.960
Let's quickly review what you'll be typically importing.

13
00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.980
We want to import dash and then we're also going to be importing that core components so that core components

14
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.360
as DCC.

15
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:10.920
Remember that's the more abstract component and then we'll also import dash HTL components as HMO.

16
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.220
And we'll be discussing both of these in more detail later on then.

17
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.760
Let's go ahead and import what we already need for graph objects from Poly.

18
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.100
So that's going to be what we already covered in that first section of course on creating graph objects

19
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.240
of plot we total say import poly graph under square object says go.

20
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.820
And in order to make some data for our plot we're going to import some pie as an.

21
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:35.210
OK.

22
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.190
So let's get started first we're going to want to actually create our application object or variable.

23
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:49.070
So I'll say app is equal to dash dot dash is capitally there and then let's create some data for this.

24
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.850
So this is just our creating data so we use them PI for this.

25
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.780
I'm going to see that where you get the same random data.

26
00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:59.420
I do.

27
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.510
So I'll choose the number 42 for this particular example.

28
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:13.150
And this creates some random x data all say random x is equal to the random And let's get some random

29
00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.650
integers.

30
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:20.830
So say ran integers from 1 to 100 let's grab 100 of those and we're going to copy and paste this line

31
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.720
to create a similar thing for y.

32
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:26.790
So we get our imports.

33
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.550
We created the ash objects and now we are going to have a set of random x values and a set of random

34
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:32.170
y values.

35
00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.840
So a hundred of each the random integers that's going to allow us to plot this.

36
00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.260
So how do we actually now create a plot the graph inside or dashed dashboard.

37
00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:51.560
Well first we're going to call app lay out as we did earlier and then we call HVM l div..

38
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.320
Open and close parentheses.

39
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.420
And basically what this says is everything that we're going to be inserting belongs into this div for

40
00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:06.490
the T.M. and then inside of this div we start creating a list and inside of this is going to go DCC

41
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.050
dot and we're going to call the graph component here.

42
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.010
So this graph component is what's actually going to accept the plot figure.

43
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:23.510
So we give this an ID parameter so the ID can just be something like scatterplot.

44
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.650
And this is just a string that you decide whatever you want to call it the ID will see later on how

45
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.270
we can use that as a reference.

46
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:35.380
And then we'll go ahead and Krajina that line here.

47
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:41.740
We're going to say figure is equal to and this is where our dictionary is going to go.

48
00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.700
And inside of this dictionary we're going to have two very familiar objects.

49
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:52.900
We're going to have a data key and then we're also going to have a lay out key and this is where you

50
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.940
can use the knowledge that you just attain with partly in your actual dash dashboard.

51
00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:05.140
So here data the value this key is going to have is basically going to be that entire list that we normally

52
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.010
passed in with data for normal plot.

53
00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.820
So that means we create a list here and then we say go that scatter.

54
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.770
And you're basically back to basics things you already know.

55
00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.010
So for scatterplot we know how to create this.

56
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:18.420
We know we just need to say.

57
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.650
And let me go ahead and put this on a new line.

58
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.090
So it's a little more readable.

59
00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.750
Something to keep in mind is that these braces and brackets that tend to be a lot more dash and plot

60
00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:27.130
line.

61
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.750
So you're going have to be careful in keeping track of this if you ever get an error such as end of

62
00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.410
line error or unexpected in the station.

63
00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.630
Go ahead and copy and paste from our notes directly.

64
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.090
It's really easy to make a typo here but hopefully furling along.

65
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.310
Just keep an awareness of that.

66
00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:50.240
So inside of go that scatter we're going to do an x call so we'll say x is equal to that random x value.

67
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:58.360
Then we're also going to say Y is equal to that random y value and then for scatterplot we say mode

68
00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.830
is equal to marker's So that's our data list.

69
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.200
Hopefully that feels really familiar to you given all the practice you have politely.

70
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.510
So that's the value.

71
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:14.730
This list right here that's the value that goes with that data key in this dictionary that's inside

72
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.590
of that figure parameter which is that inside of this graph.

73
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:23.240
Call and this figures ID is scatterplot or whatever you happen to call this string.

74
00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:28.160
Then the next step is to provide the layout and the layout is just going to be go that way.

75
00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.890
And this is whatever you usually provide for the layout of your normal partly plot.

76
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:43.070
So here Elisha's go ahead and give this a title will say title is equal to my scatterplot.

77
00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:50.740
So that's the very basics of inserting a normal plot leape plot into your layout for your dash dashboard.

78
00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:56.720
So again here all the imports we create are a dash app created some random data and this is basically

79
00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.520
where the key happens.

80
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:06.290
We say app that layout is equal to and inside of an HMO div we created a list here then we create a

81
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:08.330
dash core component for the graph.

82
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:13.910
We give this particular graph an ID so that we can reference it later on if need be.

83
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.550
And then the key one here is this figure.

84
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.270
So figure itself is going to be a dictionary with two keys here.

85
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:26.390
Data and layout and the values for data and layout inside of this figure dictionary.

86
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.890
That's the exact stuff we were using before with Plumley and hopefully now you can see that this is

87
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:37.490
a much easier approach than what we were doing before with kind of following along with the dash documentation.

88
00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.930
I believe personally that if you already know plotless Well you're going to be able to really leverage

89
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:43.880
that understanding of that knowledge.

90
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:48.970
If you follow this approach using Dasch core components and using this figure dictionary approach.

91
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.690
So this is where we differ a little bit from the documentation but hopefully it makes life a lot easier

92
00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:57.560
and more importantly gets you up and running of dashboards a lot faster.

93
00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:03.620
So now that we created our app layout the next thing to do is just at the very end we're going to say

94
00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:12.530
if name is equal to main We're going to run our server open and close princes.

95
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:15.310
So let's actually run this and make sure it works.

96
00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:20.660
So I'm going to say Python and I just called this basic Bajpai going to hit enter and then I'm going

97
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:24.220
to go to my browser to this location or here's let me copy this.

98
00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:26.510
Remember be careful control c otherwise you'll quit.

99
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:29.160
So copy and let's go check it out.

100
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:29.860
OK.

101
00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:32.970
Putting that address in our browser renders our actual dashboard.

102
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:36.820
And right now our dashboard is really simple it's just scatterplot inside of the Stiv.

103
00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:38.230
So there we have it.

104
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:42.860
Those are the random points and it looks like everything's working as suspected.

105
00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:46.370
Let's go head and see how we can expand on this dashboard.

106
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:46.600
All right.

107
00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:49.440
Here we are back at the text editor.

108
00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:54.500
What I want to do now is add in a couple more parameters to show you how we can further affect this

109
00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:55.070
figure.

110
00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:59.230
And it should be stuff that feels familiar to you since you've already done this with basic plots.

111
00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:04.450
Again all we're doing here is after creating the data we create this layout an insight as to meld that

112
00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:05.010
live.

113
00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:10.850
We have this list which contains this dash core component graph object takes in an ID and then takes

114
00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:16.320
in a figure and this figure parameter is a dictionary with a data key and a lay out key.

115
00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:21.520
And that takes in what you're already familiar with that data list and then that layout parameter.

116
00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:26.570
So just like we did with a normal scatterplot completely what we can do is after mode provide something

117
00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:33.690
like a marker dictionary and then here we're going to say size.

118
00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:38.020
Let's go ahead and kind of play around with this we can give it a size we can give them colors.

119
00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:40.520
So let's go ahead and give it in our G-B color.

120
00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.750
This is just a string code for red green blue values.

121
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:49.600
So you can play around with this and I'm just kind of choosing some values here from the notes and comma

122
00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:50.190
here.

123
00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:57.130
Let's go ahead and give it kind of a wacky symbol maybe Pentagon like we've seen before and I'll shoot

124
00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:57.850
one more.

125
00:08:57.850 --> 00:08:59.890
Maybe you want to add in a line here.

126
00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:05.060
So if we wanted a particular line for these points that can take in another dictionary of parameters

127
00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.520
so you can see here.

128
00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.240
It can get complicated quite quickly.

129
00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:12.340
So just keep that in mind and give that with two.

130
00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:12.570
All right.

131
00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:15.050
So that so we can adjust stuff with the markers.

132
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:20.020
And is always Leah can also take in more arguments so it can take in maybe not just for the basic title.

133
00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:22.090
You want to title your x axis as well.

134
00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:29.650
That's no problem you just say x axis is equal to and here you pass and a dictionary of title and then

135
00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:33.210
you know some x title.

136
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:35.650
OK so let's get a bird's eye view of this.

137
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:37.350
Real quick.

138
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:43.680
Remember we just do our imports create the dash create the layout have this div that takes on a list

139
00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:44.760
inside of that list.

140
00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:45.720
We have this graph.

141
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:51.990
We give it an ID then we create the figure parameter which is a dictionary with that data key takes

142
00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:53.310
in that list we're familiar with.

143
00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:57.320
Again you could just copy and paste this from all the other plot like we've done before as well as really

144
00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.930
how you can insert that from again all the poly we've done before.

145
00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:05.660
So let's go ahead and rerun Python basic but PI and check it out.

146
00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.130
Whoops looks like my error I forgot to say.

147
00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:09.200
X axis.

148
00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.440
I just said access here.

149
00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.510
So really isn't to make a typo here.

150
00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:17.140
Make sure you are careful that Title X axis and I'll try this again.

151
00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:21.560
Python's basic potpie will hit enter and hopefully that fixes the issue.

152
00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:22.450
Looks like it's running.

153
00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:23.820
Let's go to the browser.

154
00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:25.200
OK there we go.

155
00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:28.370
We see Dash's running and we can see the different changes we did.

156
00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:33.400
So here we have Pentagons we have those lines that with around the Pentagon you can kind of see a black

157
00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.320
line there.

158
00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:35.690
We did some x title.

159
00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:40.030
You could have also said Y-axis pass on the title there and you can also affect things like the hover

160
00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:44.820
mode and all those other options you can pass and to lay out as well as that scatterplot call.

161
00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:45.460
All right.

162
00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:50.320
The last thing I want to show you the I can think of more as a preview than actually officially part

163
00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:54.980
of this lesson is how you can put multiple plot plots on this dashboard.

164
00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:58.270
So let's go ahead and insert a scatterplot right below this one.

165
00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:01.460
We can even duplicate it if we want but something I want to make clear.

166
00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:06.280
Think of this more as a preview than an actual official discussion on the lecture because later on we're

167
00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:11.630
going to dive in a lot more detail on having multiple components inside of your dashboard.

168
00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:15.040
So let's exit this and go back to our text editor.

169
00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:15.360
All right.

170
00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:21.740
The last thing I want to show you is how we can insert multiple graph objects into our dashboard so

171
00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:22.460
to do this.

172
00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:27.510
I've zoomed out a bit because essentially I'm going to be copying pasting are scatterplot twice.

173
00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:30.770
So what happens here is recall that we have this H2 melded.

174
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.550
And inside of that div. it's taking in a list.

175
00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:38.050
And right now this list only has one really large graph object.

176
00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:43.310
And in fact we could define this graph object outside of this and then insert it as some variable name.

177
00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:47.770
But what it going to do and pay really close attention here to what I'm copying.

178
00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:50.910
I'm going to copy from this square bracket.

179
00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.080
Zoom in here just a little bit from this square bracket.

180
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:55.670
I'm not including it just starting there.

181
00:11:55.690 --> 00:12:00.910
I'm going to copy the Telegraph object up to that square bracket right there.

182
00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:04.480
So essentially I'm just grabbing everything that's in that first item of the list.

183
00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.830
I'm going to copy this.

184
00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:13.540
So let's copy that control See command see and then right after that I'm going to just paste it as the

185
00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:17.220
second item in that list of the div.

186
00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.180
So again all we're doing here is remember that's HTL div.

187
00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.740
It had a list of a single graph object.

188
00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:25.810
I just went ahead and then inserted the graph object.

189
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:31.030
What I want to make sure to do now is give this another ID name scatterplot to the way the ashes get

190
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:31.720
confused.

191
00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.970
And let's just go ahead and make this a little bit different.

192
00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:36.090
So we can get an idea.

193
00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:42.590
So I'm going to set the read value to something higher so let's give it to 200 and let's get the green

194
00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:51.150
is something lower like 53 and we'll go ahead and say this is my scatterplot second plot.

195
00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:55.490
OK so that should be enough to get an idea that this is a different plot.

196
00:12:55.610 --> 00:13:00.310
Again all we did is we copy and pasted this graph and duplicated it.

197
00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:04.440
So now it's a relative list has to graph items in it.

198
00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:10.210
If you're getting any errors here just be really cautious with your copy and paste thing because it's

199
00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:11.070
super easy.

200
00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:12.130
So you get a mix up.

201
00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:13.860
So just keep that in mind.

202
00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:17.920
I want to run this on basic pie.

203
00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.770
Enter Alice check it out.

204
00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:22.580
OK it looks like it's running so I copy that correctly.

205
00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:25.360
So I'm going to head over to my browser and see what the two plots look like.

206
00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:30.080
You know I dashboard and now here I am in my dashboard and I get to see now these two graph objects

207
00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:32.490
contained inside that single div..

208
00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:38.180
So I have one single ASML here and it's containing two graph objects that we can kind of play around

209
00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:38.810
with.

210
00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:42.530
Later on we're going to see how we can connect different objects specially if things like drop down

211
00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:44.830
menu sliders all that fun stuff.

212
00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:49.790
But that's the very basics of creating a simple dashboard especially when I want to focus on here is

213
00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:55.550
that you can just take everything you learned about flatly and easily insert it using that graph that

214
00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:57.850
core component so keep that in mind.

215
00:13:58.190 --> 00:13:58.460
OK.

216
00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:03.410
Coming up next we're going to focus a little more on HTL components graph components and mark that components

217
00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:08.580
separately and then we'll set you loose on an exercise where you can create your first simple dashboard.

218
00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:09.370
Thank you so much.

219
00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:10.820
And we'll see you at the next lecture.
