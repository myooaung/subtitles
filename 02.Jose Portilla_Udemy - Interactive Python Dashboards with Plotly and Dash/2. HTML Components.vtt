00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.120
Welcome back and this lecture we're going to talk about HMO components in more detail.

2
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.620
Now as I previously mentioned dasht allows you to leverage previous knowledge of H.M. and see access

3
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.950
to create very customized dashboards and the main process is you pick the relevant HTL component from

4
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:28.740
the HMO component library with dash and you can insert parameters into the HTML components and then

5
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.680
you adjust a CSI style dictionary which allows you to also define a general CSO style dictionary for

6
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.380
your entire web application.

7
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.220
Now I want to stress something.

8
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.470
Technically no knowledge of HTL or CSSA is truly needed to create a dash dashboard because we're never

9
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.670
actually writing pure HTML or pure CSSA.

10
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.470
Instead we're just doing calls to a Python library that does it for us.

11
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.840
But in order to actually stylize and customized dash dashboards especially to your specific liking it's

12
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:06.170
really going to be helpful to understand H.M. and CSSA to really get an idea of what these actual Python

13
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.600
calls are doing.

14
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.350
So I want to give you a quick rundown about the most basic HTL concepts you should know just for dash

15
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.940
and dashboard.

16
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.500
So there's two main things I want to clarify when you're using HTL components with your dash dashboard

17
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.200
and the main one you're going to be seeing on the HTL side is the div element and added element is a

18
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.390
division which basically means that's going to be a section or block of the web application.

19
00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.790
And in our case the web application is just a dashboard so you can think of that as just a square block

20
00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.770
somewhere on the page and then you can adjust things about it such as how large it is what's actually

21
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:42.670
going inside of it.

22
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.660
Usually for us it's going to be craft objects and then it's border it's styling et cetera.

23
00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.240
So CSSA itself allows you to style those h HTML elements.

24
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.800
And mainly we're just going to be using div elements and then we'll be using a dictionary in order to

25
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.790
style that.

26
00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:04.090
So CSSA that allows you to do things like give it a special font give a particular color borders and

27
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.350
so on and Dasch uses dictionaries to pass NCSA style calls.

28
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.750
So if you're already familiar of CSSA essentially what are doing here is instead of writing a CSSA file

29
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.800
or a cascading style sheet all you're doing is providing a dictionary for that each time element.

30
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.360
All right so let's see all these concepts in action by jumping over to our text editor.

31
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.780
OK here I am at my text editor.

32
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.860
Let's get started by just going over it.

33
00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.960
HTL components.

34
00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.970
First we need to do is import Dasch that will allow us to actually create our dash application.

35
00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.160
And then we're going to import dash underscore each team all components as H.

36
00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:51.800
Timo then we create our Dasch application by say dash dash and it's time to edit the layout.

37
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:57.950
But before we do that I'm going to say at the very bottom if name is equal to mean grab our application

38
00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.610
and run the server.

39
00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:06.110
So right now there's not anything in our application so let's provide it by grabbing the label attribute

40
00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.660
of our application and adjusting it.

41
00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.070
So this case as we've done before we're going to assign this to h T.M. div..

42
00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.420
So this is a division inside the page and you've taken a list here.

43
00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.850
And then provide any other things you want to insert into the page.

44
00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.410
So previously we've done things like insert other divisions or insert core components such as graphs.

45
00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.110
But the most basic thing you can insert here is just the string to be displayed in your dashboard.

46
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:39.150
So let's say this is the outermost div.

47
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:45.790
So that's all we're doing just passing a single string into that list and I'm going to run my application

48
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:53.050
will say Python basic about pi hit enter and Ellis jump over to the browser to write here 6:59 dash

49
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:59.380
and you probably have the saved as a favorite already OK there we go we have our outermost div essentially

50
00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:00.740
just the text.

51
00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.690
Now let's go ahead and see how we would be able to style this if we wanted to it's going to minimize

52
00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:06.940
that again.

53
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.420
Well let's kill our server of control C and add in a spiled dictionary.

54
00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:17.600
So as I mentioned you're going to pass in the content into this list and then each div can take in outside

55
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.910
of the list a style dictionary or style parameter I should say.

56
00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.810
So here's our style parameter.

57
00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.870
And that's going to be a dictionary where you can passen essentially any normal CSSA calls so familiar

58
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.700
of the SS that is going to feel really normal to you can do things like color.

59
00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:39.390
So let's give this a color green and then we can also do things like give it a border.

60
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.720
So essentially just key value pairs.

61
00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:47.490
Very familiar to you if you've already done stuff in C Ss and if you're really not familiar CSSA you

62
00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:53.910
can check out the links in our actual guidebook which will help you learn CSSA so will say Tupi to pixel

63
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.230
green.

64
00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:00.930
Give me a solid border there and you can do things like adjust the margin with we'll just do that for

65
00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:01.600
now.

66
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.400
So let's check out how those stylings affect their dashboard.

67
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:11.380
We'll head back over to our browser and now as I'm in the browser I can see the font is now green.

68
00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:16.780
That's from the color parameter and I can also see I have this border around that entire div and you

69
00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:23.230
can do things like that at the margin and width of this actual border or div in order to make the smaller

70
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.230
or larger as you see fit.

71
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.550
So now let's add in more divisions into our actual dashboard.

72
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.870
Right now we just have one.

73
00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:37.330
All right so what I want to do now is actually add in more divisions into our outermost div and the

74
00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.200
way you do that is inside of this division list.

75
00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.340
You can add in another HTL.

76
00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.210
So I'm going to zoom out just so we can see the whole picture here.

77
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:49.800
T.M. div..

78
00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:58.140
And then we can add in some other call here so I can say this is an inner div and just like that we

79
00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.680
can also provide a style parameter.

80
00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.890
And let's just make it obvious with let me put this on a new line.

81
00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:07.760
Something like color red.

82
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.110
So give this inner div color red.

83
00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.730
Make sure that's a string.

84
00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:17.740
Now something I want to point out here is you may be wondering why that this div here need a list but

85
00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.070
this div on the inside is not an list.

86
00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.180
It's just that string.

87
00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:26.560
Well the reason for that is because when you have multiple components inside your div then you do need

88
00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:27.360
a list.

89
00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:33.040
If you have a single component such as a single string or a single graph then you don't technically

90
00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:33.770
need a list.

91
00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:38.570
However you won't actually get an error if you do provide a list of just a single item.

92
00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:44.650
So sometimes for safety so to speak in order to make sure you don't get any bugs you can also pass this

93
00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:48.780
inside a list here for a single item inside this inner div.

94
00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.610
It's not going to make a difference but notice how this div now has two items in it.

95
00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:58.840
It has this outermost div string and then the second item inside that list is this inner div.

96
00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:04.110
So keep that in mind as you're working with a dash and these divs again.

97
00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.510
It's super easy to make a typo especially with the number of brackets.

98
00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:11.770
So I would recommend if you're ever getting a syntax error on the typo you copy and paste over from

99
00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:13.460
are provided notes.

100
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:17.460
So let's save this and see if we can now see this iterative.

101
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.470
So I'm going to run our dashboard again and hop over to the browser.

102
00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:23.360
All right.

103
00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:28.360
And there we see this interactive and notice here what's inside of this outermost div.

104
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:33.740
So it's being essentially encapsulated by that green border so we can see the red font indicating that

105
00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:38.780
it's iterative and we have an outermost sieve and this may appear a little smaller screen so I can zoom

106
00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:40.340
in to show you more clearly here.

107
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:43.180
Just keep in mind when you run this it won't be as large.

108
00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:48.560
So let's go back and add in another div that's inside of this outermost div.

109
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:50.730
So I'm going to close this.

110
00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:55.550
Here we are back to a text editor and inside this initial list right here.

111
00:07:55.630 --> 00:08:00.850
And what's nice about Adam if you kind of put your cursor right for it you should see an underline saying

112
00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:01.720
what bracket.

113
00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.540
It's kind of aligned with.

114
00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:14.630
So we're going to add in another div we'll say H T.M. div here and we'll say in another inner div and

115
00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:16.880
let's give this guy also a style dictionary.

116
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:20.110
Now how my style dictionary is going outside of that initial list.

117
00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:27.050
So say style and here let's give this the color let's say blue.

118
00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:30.530
And let's also give these guys borders just to make it really clear.

119
00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:40.980
Well say border let's give this guy a three pixel blue solid.

120
00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:44.240
And let's also give this red one a border itself.

121
00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.080
So border

122
00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:54.400
let's say two pixel red solid OK.

123
00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:58.270
So essentially these are a CSI style calls inside this dictionary.

124
00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:04.610
And now this outermost div inside of this list has this string and then two divs inside of it.

125
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.910
And if it makes more sense to you you can't separate these out.

126
00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:09.980
It's a variable called outside of this layout.

127
00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:15.360
And then inject them inside here that we don't get confused with so many things inside of the single

128
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:16.310
call.

129
00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:23.030
But let's go ahead and run this and see if we get back those two inner divs.

130
00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:23.660
All right.

131
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:24.280
Here we are.

132
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:26.460
And now I can see this outermost div..

133
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:31.600
Notice how if you kind of zoom in here that the green border is all the way on the outside.

134
00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:36.590
And then we have these two divisions the red one and the blue one right next to each other.

135
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:41.250
So that's really the basics of using Dasch HTL components especially the way we're going to be using

136
00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:43.490
them in our dash dashboard.

137
00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:48.300
Essentially we're just creating divisions and then inserting whatever we want into those divisions right

138
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.120
now where we're just inserting simple text.

139
00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:57.330
But later on we'll be inserting dash core components things like plot like graphs or sliders or callbacks

140
00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.540
or interactions into each device.

141
00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:03.400
Hopefully this gives you an understanding of how this is related to the team.

142
00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:07.420
And CSSA So let's quickly go over the main ideas here.

143
00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:11.310
Okay so to quickly review and conclude this lecture.

144
00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:15.490
Remember for Timo components mainly where you're going to be doing is you're going to be creating that

145
00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:21.040
H team l div and if you have multiple items inside that div then you just create a list to hold the

146
00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:26.920
components then outside of that list can be a style dictionary with a general form it is your style

147
00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:32.380
parameter is equal to a dictionary where we have a particular CSSA property and then a particular value

148
00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:33.970
for that property.

149
00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:36.070
All right that's it for this lecture.

150
00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:41.020
Coming up next we're going to talk about that core components and how we can integrate those with H.T.

151
00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:42.280
of all components.

152
00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:42.850
We'll see if there.
