00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.380
Welcome back.

2
00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:12.530
We just learn how we can use hover data in order to interact with our graphs retrieve information from

3
00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:13.280
the graph.

4
00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.260
When you hover over a specific point on the graph and then use the information internally in our script.

5
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.850
Now we're going to learn just how easy it is to switch from hover data to collect data that you may

6
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:23.360
have guessed.

7
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.070
All you really need to do is change that stream code for the property ID of the component.

8
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.610
Let's go back to our text editor back to the code from the previous lecture.

9
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.490
And then just simply switch out hover data for click data.

10
00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.700
All right.

11
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.300
Here we are at the exact same file I was working with the previous lecture on.

12
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.010
And we're going to do here is just at the bottom where we previously said hover data.

13
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.920
I'm going to change this to just say click data.

14
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.190
So let's do that.

15
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:56.800
Well change over data to quick data and then we're going to save this and run this again.

16
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.840
Now let's head on over to our dashboard and see what happens.

17
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:07.700
As far as changes with that dashboard or mbak here on my dashboard if I zoom in.

18
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.060
Notice nothing's happening.

19
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:16.040
As I hover over my cursor I still get the graph information read three blue three or yellow two etc.

20
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.540
but it only occurs when I click on an actual point that I get to see the image itself.

21
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.480
And if I click on a something that's not a point I don't actually get any information back.

22
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.360
I have to be clicking on a point where I can send back information such as the color and the number

23
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.990
in order to see the image that pops up.

24
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.850
OK so that's it for this lecture really.

25
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.580
All you need to do now is just switch up that string.

26
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.500
Coming up next we're going to show you a quick example of switching out the string for select data and

27
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.100
we'll play around the File a little bit more than we did in this lecture.

28
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.370
All right.

29
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:50.390
We'll see at the next lecture.
