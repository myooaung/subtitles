1
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:06,370
Welcome back.

2
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:11,740
Now that we've seen how to connect two components of a simple dash callback Let's expand on this idea

3
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,440
to use Dasch callbacks with graphs.

4
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:17,850
I'm first going to show you with the finished dashboard we're going to create looks like.

5
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:20,520
And then we will code it out in our text editor.

6
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:25,110
Keep in mind this is going to be one of the more complex codes we've done so far.

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,840
Let's check at the dashboard now.

8
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,640
All right here we can see our actual dashboard.

9
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:35,880
Notice how we have essentially a scatterplot and this is the life expectancy and GDP per capita.

10
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,400
And notice we also have a logarithmic scale.

11
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:44,250
So it goes from 10000 to 10 k to 100 K because of the differences between some of these countries.

12
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:46,790
So you'll also notice there's a drop down menu.

13
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:51,320
And the drop down menu is actually directly connected to the data behind this plot.

14
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:56,800
So I can choose something like 1992 and the plot will automatically update to show the life expectancy

15
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:00,280
and GDP per capita for these countries for 1992.

16
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:05,860
You'll also notice that this is actually a mini scatterplot on the same figure.

17
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:11,670
Which means I can then adjust by clicking on this legend for different continents.

18
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,110
So if I only want in Asia and Europe I could select these and then I can also double click to only select

19
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:21,060
that one or click them all to bring them all back in.

20
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:26,350
And again we also have this dropdown menu that's connected for any year we're interested in.

21
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,590
OK let's code this out by jumping toward text editor.

22
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:29,850
Right.

23
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,530
Here we are at the text editor to save a little bit of time.

24
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:38,150
I've already done the imports and I've read in the CSP File we've imported Dasch core components and

25
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:42,010
each team l components input and output from dasht dependencies.

26
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:46,880
And since we're going to be applauding that scatterplot We've also imported polygraph objects and pand

27
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,900
those in order to read in the data set.

28
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:54,130
So the data is that we're going to be using is the gap minder data five year that CXXVI let's print

29
00:01:54,130 --> 00:02:00,120
it out at least ahead of the dataset so we can get an idea of what it looks like I'm going to run Python.

30
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:06,020
Well first let me say this then I'm going to run Python and I've called this file basic about pi.

31
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:11,270
So I run this and we print out those first few lines of the actual dataset.

32
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:17,530
So every row represents a country in a particular year the population has what continent it belongs

33
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:17,980
to.

34
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:23,000
The life expectancy during that year and the GDP per capita.

35
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:28,390
So you'll notice in the very beginning it's all Afghanistan but later on once you've done all the years

36
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:31,700
for Afghanistan they'll move on to the next country and so on.

37
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,830
You'll also notice that the years have five year jumps between them.

38
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,110
So another way understand what the status looks like.

39
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:44,120
Really what we're interested in is grabbing all this data and then filtering out based on the year or

40
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,030
at the continent.

41
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,410
So let's expand on this.

42
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,130
We have our data set ready to go.

43
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:57,220
We're going to create our application by saying dash dash.

44
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:03,270
And then we will begin by actually creating our LEO or it's going to be quite simple.

45
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,500
It's going to be an aged female div..

46
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:12,470
And this is going to be a list of essentially just two components one is going to be the graph.

47
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:16,260
So they'll be Dash core graph.

48
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:25,620
And here we're just going to give it an ID so we'll call this ID.

49
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,130
And then the second component we're going to create is that the core components drop down

50
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:42,690
and this drop down will go ahead and say call it year picker and if we take a look at the actual dropdown

51
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:46,360
documentation we bring it over.

52
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,860
You'll notice that for just a normal default drop down a dash core component drop down.

53
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:56,130
If we zoom in here it's going to have an I.D. which you're going to use later on to connect for the

54
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,140
actual callback.

55
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:02,500
And then it has a list of options and each thing in the option is essentially a label.

56
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:08,880
That's what the actual user sees and the value that's what we're going to work with inside of our dashboard

57
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,670
code.

58
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:16,140
So we need to somehow create this options list for every year inside of that data frame and luckily

59
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:21,230
we can use a for loop along the little bit of this code to make that relatively simple.

60
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:23,750
Let's jump back toward sex ed. to make that happen.

61
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,730
So inside of this dropdown again what we want is to create that options.

62
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,260
So say options is equal to.

63
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:39,070
And we're going to say year underscore options and let's define a year underscore options above this

64
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:44,070
layout call when Create a couple more lines here and I will do the following.

65
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:53,230
I will say that your options is going to start off as an empty list and then for every year in DMF year

66
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:59,350
unique because remember years are going to be repeated per country.

67
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:07,450
So for every unique year essentially every five years I'm going to grab your options and I will append

68
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:10,500
to it that one of those dictionaries.

69
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:15,760
So remember that dictionary takes in a label and the label will have the string version of the year

70
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:20,830
and then the value will just be the integer version of the year.

71
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:26,020
The reason I'm passing this in as a string here is because we wanted to split a string in the dashboard

72
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:29,970
and then the value we want to play around with that as the actual integer.

73
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:35,650
So the data type of this column happens to be an integer for the year if you want to show it as label

74
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,560
will want to convert that to a string here.

75
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,860
And now we have our year options.

76
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,590
So that's the options here.

77
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:51,060
And let's finally give it a default value will say the default value is just the minimum year say the

78
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:56,730
full value is year min save that and we have earlier.

79
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,120
So really simple.

80
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:01,870
Most of the code that we need to update is actually in our function.

81
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:10,880
So we'll come down here and we'll create our function we'll create an up figure function this figure

82
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,850
function is essentially going to connect that drop down to the actual figure.

83
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:20,320
So we will say selected ear.

84
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:24,040
And then at the end we want to return something.

85
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:30,020
So right now we'll just have it commented out and we might as well fill this out now since we're at

86
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:37,370
the bottom will say if name is equal to main ticker app and run the server.

87
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:37,980
All right.

88
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,200
So we figure we're going to have a bunch of code in here.

89
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:50,100
But before we add in that code let's add in the callback will see at at the callback and let's see what

90
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,720
we actually want to connect.

91
00:06:51,780 --> 00:07:01,410
I want to connect the input from the dropdown menu to the output of this graph so our callback will

92
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:02,610
start the output.

93
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:10,430
We're going to grab graph that's our component ID and then the property we want to connect.

94
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,020
So it's actually going to be connecting to a figure.

95
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,380
We're going to pass and figure here and then for the input.

96
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:24,850
Remember that goes inside of a list will say input here and then that one is called Year picker

97
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,950
and then the thing we want to adjust there.

98
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:36,840
Basically as our input is the value chosen so we'll say value.

99
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:42,840
So all this is saying is that you want the input to be this year Pickert drop down selection and you

100
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,610
want to grab the value that's the property you're grabbing from this component ID.

101
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:52,800
So we're saying grab the year picker value and then you'll put that in the output for this graph and

102
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,400
then the figure is what we have left to create in this update figure.

103
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:02,370
So what we will do here is based off the selected year that's passed in as an input.

104
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:05,850
We're going to filter our data frame for that.

105
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:13,160
So I'll say that the filtered data frame is going to be equal to our data frame where the Year

106
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,300
is equal to that passed and selected year.

107
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:29,150
So right now for this step this is data only for selected year from the dropdown menu.

108
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,190
So now we have our filtered data frame.

109
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:36,500
It's time to actually create the traces for each continent.

110
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,880
So I will say Trace's is an empty list.

111
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:48,730
And then for every continent's name wherever you want to call this variable in my filtered data from

112
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,950
four continents unique

113
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,810
what I'm going to do is create a scatter plot.

114
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,070
So I'll say DSF by continents

115
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:20,020
is equal to that filter T.F. where the filter T.F. content column is equal to that continent name.

116
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:26,770
So what this is saying right now is for every continent name in the list of unique continents.

117
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:32,710
Essentially this is just going to be for America for Asia for Africa and so on.

118
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,040
Take that data frame filtered again.

119
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,100
Now by that content.

120
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,820
So we've already filtered it by ear.

121
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:42,440
Now we're going to filter it by that particular continent and for each of these continents we're going

122
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:51,320
to create a trace so grab our traces list and we're going to pen go that scatter.

123
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:58,370
And this is we're going to pass in our x y values so X that's going to be DMF by continents.

124
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:09,650
And our x axis that's the GDP per capita the y values repassing in that's going to be the life expectancy.

125
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:17,430
So again that death by continents and I will say life expectancy.

126
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,150
And we want this to be a scatterplot.

127
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,230
So we'll say mode is equal to marker's.

128
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,300
Hopefully this feels really familiar from everything we learned about plotless.

129
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,240
Essentially all we're doing right now is creating a scatterplot and then appending that to the trace

130
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:33,860
for every single continent after it's been filtered by the year.

131
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:38,640
And you can do this essentially updating each time a new year are selected.

132
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,390
So we have moed markers and let's give them some opacity.

133
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,170
So that way we can see through them a little bit.

134
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,900
So I'll leave that as like 0.7 and you can add more styling if you want.

135
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:56,670
We'll increase the marker size a little bit by passing in a dictionary here where the size will set

136
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:03,800
it to 15 and then finally the name will have it be linked to a consonant name.

137
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:09,720
So remember a continent name right here at this variable is essentially going to be America's Oceana

138
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,940
Africa Asia and so on.

139
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:18,850
So that is our main update function I will zoom out a little bit so we can see the entire picture.

140
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,100
Now we still need to return something.

141
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:27,720
So what we need to return is the actual dictionary that's going to go inside of this graph.

142
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:29,660
Call.

143
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,650
So that's how we're going to do the following.

144
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,340
We'll return the dictionary.

145
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:38,530
Mean are these dictionaries for these graphs that take in a data and a layout.

146
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:40,870
So let's first do the data.

147
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:41,520
That one's easy.

148
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:49,420
That's just the Trace's list then for the lay out what we can do is we pasan it go that way outcall

149
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:53,850
and then it's up to you how much detail you want to go in here.

150
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,150
Let's go ahead and give it a title.

151
00:11:56,310 --> 00:12:04,240
We'll say the title is just equal to my plot and let's give it a title for the x axis and the title

152
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,330
for the y axis so x axis.

153
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:08,530
Remember this one's a little different.

154
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,040
You passen a dictionary here.

155
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:15,680
So the x axis that's GDP per capita.

156
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,990
And we want this to be logarithmic.

157
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:25,380
So the way we do that is we say type and pass and log in just in case you're wondering.

158
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:28,320
I definitely don't memorize all these parameter calls.

159
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,970
I'm always referencing the documentation and dash for things like lay out and scatter plots.

160
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:33,990
So keep that in mind.

161
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:40,000
We want to become experts in looking up information not having to memorize all these calls.

162
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,510
And let's give a Y-axis title as well.

163
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:45,830
So the title for this.

164
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:52,910
That one's going to be life expectancy.

165
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,740
OK so we have life expectancy there.

166
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,060
Let's make sure I spell that right.

167
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,220
There you go.

168
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:57,810
Save it.

169
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,570
And that should be all we need.

170
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:03,350
Let's make sure this actually runs and then we'll do a final review of it.

171
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:07,200
My basic thought PI make sure I'll have any errors or typos there.

172
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:10,180
All right let's go to our browsers see if it's running.

173
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,890
All right so here I am at the browser.

174
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:16,360
It looks like all traces ended up on the scatterplot we can see the x and y axis.

175
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:22,820
I can see that I have my logarithmic scale and let's see if our dropdown actually affects this.

176
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:26,840
So I'll choose something like 2007 and then we can see definitely the changes.

177
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:33,080
And let's go pick another year 1982 and it looks like it is updating for all the years.

178
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:39,300
So we can see here Kuwait over at the very right end of the scale in 1982 shoes a different year in

179
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:45,290
1952 we could see Kuwait now much much further ahead in 1952 versus all the other countries.

180
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:50,870
And that actually has to do more with the fact that it has such a low population that year and it comes

181
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:55,210
back closer to everyone else as everyone else as populations ends up growing.

182
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:55,760
OK.

183
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:59,480
So let's do a final review of all the code that actually created all of this.

184
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:03,080
And we can also check to see here if traces can be isolated.

185
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,390
Looks like they can be.

186
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,350
So let's do a final review.

187
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,320
All right a lot going on here.

188
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,190
First off we have all our imports so that should be pretty straightforward.

189
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:19,310
Then we read in our data then we create our application and then we had to create these your options

190
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,750
specifically for this drop them component.

191
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,030
So let's skip ahead and look at lay out our app.

192
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,080
It's actually very simple.

193
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:32,870
It's just a graph and a dropdown and this dropdown needed the options and the options needed to be in

194
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:35,630
this dictionary format of label and value.

195
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:41,540
So we created this little for loop here in order to conveniently put that as the options then the default

196
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:41,860
value.

197
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:46,580
It was just the minimum year then we have this update figure function.

198
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:53,010
We connected a callback so that the output would connect to the figure of this graph and the input would

199
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:57,830
be whatever value was chosen in this dropdown year picker.

200
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,040
Then we have this update figure that takes that selected here from the dropdown menu.

201
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:08,310
It filters the data frame by that year and then it's going to create traces for every continent.

202
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:10,850
I remember now we've already filtered by that year.

203
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,430
So this is the main thing that's updating all the traces.

204
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:18,910
When you pick a specific year because you're essentially running this command of filtering that data

205
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:19,880
frame.

206
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:26,410
So for every continent in the list of continents in that filter data frame you're going to then grab

207
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:32,740
the data frame by a particular continents and then you're going to append a new scatter.

208
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:37,600
The reason we're doing this by continent is that we each continent can have its own trace meaning we

209
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,580
can have that little Legin that we can click on and off so that legend is actually created automatically

210
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:46,730
by politely when you have many scatter plots in the same Trace's list.

211
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:49,120
We are x and y values.

212
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:53,650
We set the mode to markers and then we set some style calls here.

213
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:56,850
Finally we need to return what the figure is actually going to look like.

214
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:02,400
So remember this is essentially the dictionary that's going to be inserted into this graph right here.

215
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:05,170
So that's the figure for this graph.

216
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:10,390
So we have our data traces just as we've done before.

217
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,520
And then we have our ileo.

218
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:14,230
And again you can say whatever really you want in this layout.

219
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:17,480
We just did the title the x axis and the y axis.

220
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,460
OK.

221
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:23,020
So that's definitely a lot of code you're going to want to check out the guidebook for a breakdown of

222
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:23,830
all these lines.

223
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:26,520
But if you have any questions feel free to post the Kewney forums.

224
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,270
If you are getting the syntax errors.

225
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:32,050
Make sure to copy and paste our code to make sure you weren't making a typo.

226
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:37,330
It's very easy to make a typo give given how many open and close print season bracket calls there are

227
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,340
when using plot line dash.

228
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:41,640
Thanks everyone and we'll see you at the next lecture.
