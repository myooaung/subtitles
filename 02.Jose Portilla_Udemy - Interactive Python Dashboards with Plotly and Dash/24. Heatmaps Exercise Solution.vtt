00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:06.130
Welcome back.

2
00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.570
Let's now go over the solution for the heat map exercise question.

3
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.920
All right so the first thing we need to do is our imports as always.

4
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:22.670
So we're going to import slightly off line as well and we're going to import plot the graph flips always

5
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:29.060
Simoncini graph objects as go ancestries and pand those will import pandas as PD.

6
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.740
We already have this line of code which is going to read the flight data set for us.

7
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.780
So let's move ahead to the finer data variable now are they the variable.

8
00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.300
It's actually pretty straightforward.

9
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:44.300
We're just going to create our list and say Go dots and remember it's heat map.

10
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:53.480
And here we just need to find that X Y and Z column for X we'll choose off the data frame the year for

11
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.920
y off the state of frame.

12
00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:05.990
We're going to choose the month and then for Z we're going to choose the passengers.

13
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.740
There we go.

14
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.220
So there's our data and if you want me to go ahead and create a lay out maybe just for a simple title

15
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:20.470
we'll say lay out is it well to go lay out and we'll just say title sequel to let's say flights.

16
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:21.580
There we go.

17
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.050
Ambitious plot the whole creative figure object.

18
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.100
Go figure.

19
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:39.720
And then say that is what the data and layout physical Tulio than we say up plot pasand fig and save

20
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.200
that in looking at this before I run that it looks like I'm forgetting a comma here to separate my Y

21
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.900
and Z.

22
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.440
BOWLES let me save this.

23
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.080
And check it out.

24
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.860
We're going to say Python and I'm going to run the file it was writing it.

25
00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:54.620
And there we go.

26
00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:00.250
Here is our heat map as expected with the months on the y axis and the years on the X-axis.

27
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.520
And we can see that trend of increasing passengers throughout the years as well as increasing passengers

28
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.060
during the summer months which is what a heat map is really good for the splaying.

29
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:10.580
Thanks.

30
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:11.670
And we'll see at the next lecture.
