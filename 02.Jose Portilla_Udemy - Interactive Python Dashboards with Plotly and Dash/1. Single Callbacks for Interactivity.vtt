00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:06.670
Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.780
I'm really excited for this section of the course because we can finally begin understanding how to

3
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.700
interact with our dashboards.

4
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.700
In this case we'll start off by discussing dash callbacks.

5
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:22.680
So we already understand now how we can adjust the layout of a dash application through the use of components

6
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.070
either HTL components or dash core components.

7
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.200
Now we're going to learn how to interact and connect those same components through the use of callbacks

8
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.810
So let's talk about the main steps to actually create a callback for interactions and then we'll jump

9
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.990
to the code editor and create a simple callback.

10
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.640
So the first step is to actually create a function that's going to return some desired output to your

11
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.210
dashboard or update something or dashboard.

12
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.100
For example let's imagine that we wanted to have the user be able to input some text into a box and

13
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.310
then have the dashboard reply back with that same text.

14
00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.080
What we would do is we would create some sort of update function that takes in the input text and then

15
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.940
simply returns the input text.

16
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.550
So that's a very simple function takes in a string and then returns it back then.

17
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:14.490
What you can do is you can decorate that function with an X app callback decorator and then inside that

18
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.670
decorator what you do is you set an output to a component ID.

19
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.250
Remember back when we're discussing components we can actually give them IDs.

20
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.140
And that was the purpose.

21
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.530
So we could link them in the callback decorator and then you go ahead and send input to a component

22
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.310
ID.

23
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:35.220
So you're setting an input and output in that actual decorator that we do is you can connect the desired

24
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.460
properties so you connect the desired input property to be connected to some desired output property

25
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.600
of another component.

26
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.760
So that's how we can actually connect components.

27
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.490
And this whole concept will become a lot clearer when we actually work through a simple example.

28
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.320
So we're going to code out how to add a callback to just one component.

29
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.190
I want you to just please note there's a lot of useful explanation in the guidebook that goes along

30
00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.130
this lecture.

31
00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.480
We're definitely going to do a lot of explanation as video.

32
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.190
But if you want to see it written out step by step as far as what's the process that's actually happening.

33
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.500
Definitely check out the guidebook.

34
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.280
There's a full two pages on how this all works.

35
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:15.060
So let's jump to our text editor and create our first interaction through a callback.

36
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.260
All right.

37
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.520
Here I am in a basic pie file.

38
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:24.240
I'm going to do my first couple of imports will import dash and then we'll import dash core components

39
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:32.160
as DCC and as you may have guessed we're also going to import that H T.M. components as h t l and then

40
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.950
the next thing that we haven't seen before.

41
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:45.920
We're going to say from dash dot dependencies we're going to import input and output and notice those

42
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.500
are capitalized there.

43
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.070
Then we're going to create art Dasch application.

44
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.860
So we'll say app is equal to dash dash.

45
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.120
And then we're going to adjust our layout.

46
00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.600
So we'll say app layout is equal to.

47
00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.870
And we're going to put this inside of a div and the Stiv is going to be a list.

48
00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.620
And there's going to be two components in here.

49
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.450
One is going to be a core component.

50
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.810
So I'll say DCC dot input.

51
00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:22.830
And this is going to be ID is equal to let's say my ID there we're going to give it some initial value.

52
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.770
So we'll say initial text

53
00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.530
and then we're going to say type is equal to text.

54
00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.410
So all this is a core component that allows you to actually input some text then a comma here because

55
00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.750
this is a list we're going to have one more div.

56
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.390
So h l div.

57
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:51.710
And we'll just have to say ID is equal to my div OK.

58
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:58.830
Something to note is don't get confused between this dash core component input and this dependency input.

59
00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.310
These are actually separate.

60
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.830
This DCC input that is a core component input input.

61
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.630
We're going to be using later on inside the decorator but for now we want to do is just see what our

62
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.660
application looks like with no connection.

63
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.190
So we're just going to say here at the bottom if name is equal to main.

64
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.120
We're going to say app run server OK let's save this.

65
00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.250
And let's actually run this and see what appears.

66
00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.290
OK so here I am at the dashboard.

67
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.570
Notice how I have this little input box and to zoom in here.

68
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:37.500
So I have this input box and I can actually then adjust the text in here so I can say something like

69
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.720
hello but if I hit enter or click somewhere else nothing's actually going to happen.

70
00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.620
This is just a single core component that takes in text as an input.

71
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.830
So that's the core component input.

72
00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:54.070
And below this even though we can't see it there's actually a div because remember we have the outermost

73
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.610
div.

74
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.510
Then we have this core component and there's a div right here which is just empty.

75
00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:59.890
There's actually nothing there.

76
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.140
So let's style it with a little bit of a border so we can clearly tell that it's there.

77
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.170
We're going to close this.

78
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.220
We're going to come back here and inside this div we're just going to assign a style dictionary.

79
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:16.670
And the style dictionary is going to be just a border.

80
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.030
Let's go ahead and give it a two pixel blue solid border.

81
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.700
Going to save this.

82
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:28.310
Let's rerun our dashboard and this is just going to color that for us so we can see it when we actually

83
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.570
looking at the dashboard.

84
00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.460
All right so back at the actual dashboard you should now see just a blue single border.

85
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.460
And the reason you don't see a square is because this div is essentially empty.

86
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:39.460
It doesn't have any text.

87
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:44.140
It doesn't have any objects in it it just has an ID identifier.

88
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.750
That's not actually going to output anything.

89
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.880
It's just the dash core component of text.

90
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.860
And then this blue border.

91
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.220
So that's just to show you that it is there.

92
00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:54.700
So keep that in mind.

93
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.700
Let's go ahead and go back to our text editor or so here we are back at the text editor to keep things

94
00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:00.410
simple.

95
00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:05.490
I'm not actually going to keep the styling that was more just to show you that this device does exist

96
00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:06.300
there.

97
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:10.410
So we have these two components a dash core component and an HD component.

98
00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:14.350
Now it's time to actually connect them through the use of a callback.

99
00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:23.370
So to do this I first need to create a function I'm going to say DMF and let's say update the output

100
00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:24.840
div..

101
00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.730
And this is going to take in a parameter called it's really up to you whatever you want to call it.

102
00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:41.130
We're going to call it input value and it's just going to return a string saying you entered and we're

103
00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:46.190
going to use that format to insert that string there in P-value.

104
00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:53.190
So all this function does right now it takes in some input value and then returns you entered and then

105
00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:56.070
that particular input value through the use of formatting.

106
00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:01.410
What I'm going to do now is I'm going to connect the text box input from the core component to actually

107
00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:04.590
be displayed inside of this div.

108
00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:05.370
To do that.

109
00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:06.930
We use a decorator.

110
00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:13.430
So then I say at app dot callback.

111
00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:18.830
And here is where I'm going to provide an output and put some going to say output

112
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:27.890
and in this output I'm going to provide a component ID so the component ID for my output is going to

113
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:31.420
be my div because that's what I want the output to be.

114
00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:35.850
So I'll say my div is the ID for the output.

115
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:39.680
And then we're also going to add in a component property here.

116
00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:46.410
So the component property we're going to assign it to is children and that's essentially the default

117
00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:47.860
property of a div.

118
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.840
So if you're just to pass in a string like Hello into div if you do a help call on div you'll notice

119
00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.560
that children is actually the very first thing that pops up there.

120
00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:00.670
So that's essentially the string that's displayed out in that div.

121
00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:03.280
So that's the component property that we want for the output.

122
00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:04.710
So we have an app callback.

123
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:09.980
We have an output the component ID which connects to my div and the component property.

124
00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:11.900
Now we need to adjust the input.

125
00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:19.450
Now the way you add in an input is as a second callback parameter you're going to have a list.

126
00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.480
So those are going to put square braces here.

127
00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:26.330
And then we call input and we'll say component ID for the input.

128
00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:28.090
Is this input right here.

129
00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:37.680
So I'll say my ID say my ID and then the actual component property that we want to connect is the value.

130
00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:43.880
So say component's property is value.

131
00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:46.970
OK so this actually is all we needed to do.

132
00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:49.540
So lets quickly cover what's actually happening here.

133
00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:56.240
I create in my dash component I've adjusted my layout to have two main components inside of it a core

134
00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:06.140
component for input which just takes in some text value and in H.M. div which right now is just empty.

135
00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:12.410
Then I created a function called up the output div takes in some input value and returns back.

136
00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:15.770
You entered and then format the input value.

137
00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:18.650
So it's going to say you entered whatever that input value is.

138
00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:23.060
And later on we're going to see much more complicated functions that can actually adjust things like

139
00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:29.900
graphs and plots but once we created that function we assigned a decorator app that callback and then

140
00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:36.080
we said it's going to have an output so the output is connected to this div right here through the component

141
00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:42.180
ID and the property we want to effect inside of this component is the children property.

142
00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:50.570
Then we have a list for the input and the component ID for the input is my ID right here and the component

143
00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:56.650
property we're going to be taking as input is this value which in this case is initial text.

144
00:09:56.990 --> 00:10:01.640
And as you get more experience that the different components choosing a property is going to become

145
00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:02.710
a lot more intuitive.

146
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:07.140
So right now I think the hard part for beginners is figure out what's the actual property.

147
00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:08.200
They should be connecting.

148
00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:12.640
But as you become more experienced and you work that documentation and you use the help function it

149
00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:16.000
will become clearer throughout time what properties should be connected.

150
00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.300
As far as the component IDs hopefully those should be obvious because you get to choose them.

151
00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:22.350
You could call this my idea whatever you want.

152
00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:22.790
OK.

153
00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:25.040
So let's go ahead and run this.

154
00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:29.460
I'm going to say Python basic that PI enter.

155
00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:29.920
OK.

156
00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:35.210
So if you look at the dashboard now it will say initial text and you entered initial text and this is

157
00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:36.530
where it gets really cool.

158
00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:41.080
Notice how it's going to keep updating as I update this text box.

159
00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:43.930
So right now it's updating live with that decorator callback.

160
00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:46.440
So this is really the power of dashboards.

161
00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:54.630
So now we can say dashboards are awesome and we keep going as far as you want but now you've just seen

162
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:56.890
an example of us taking one component.

163
00:10:56.910 --> 00:11:02.520
In this case this input component from a core dashboard and you connected it to an HMO component.

164
00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:07.560
So this is the main idea we're going to be using as far as connecting things through callbacks.

165
00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:09.920
Now there's a undo button here.

166
00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:11.820
It's OK in some cases.

167
00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:16.270
In this case you can kind of obviously see what's happening here is just undoing what I did.

168
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:21.460
Sometimes it breaks depending on what actual components you're connecting for this particular one.

169
00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.990
It's quite obvious what the UNDO reaction should be.

170
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.510
So it works clearly.

171
00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:31.590
Keep in mind with more complex dashboards we create later on the UNDO will show up and it may or may

172
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:32.310
not be useful.

173
00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:33.880
So just keep that in mind.

174
00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:34.890
OK.

175
00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:37.660
If you have any questions feel free to post the Q&amp;A forums.

176
00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:43.280
But I also wanted to stress again that we have a fully written guide for you for the price on dashboards.

177
00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:45.830
I'm going to bring it over so you can see what it looks like.

178
00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:49.280
Here is what we were just discussing interactive components.

179
00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.920
So we have the example code here.

180
00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:56.040
But more importantly we have a step by step written explanation for everything that's occurring.

181
00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:00.330
So keep that in mind the guidebook is a really great resource to help break down the steps in great

182
00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:01.500
detail.

183
00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:06.270
All right let's go ahead and move on to the next lecture we're going to be connecting two components

184
00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:07.440
with callbacks.

185
00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.160
We'll see if they're.
