00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:11,930
Welcome back in this lecture we're going to discuss line charts a line chart displays a series of data

2
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:15,160
points called markers connected by line segments.

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,210
So this actually means that a lighter is essentially the same thing as a scatterplot except this time

4
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,820
we're just having line segments that connect each of the points.

5
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:28,850
One of the main differences however between a typical line chert versus just taking a scatterplot and

6
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:35,210
connecting all those points together is that the x value on the x axis is going to be sorted or ordered

7
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:36,260
in some way.

8
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:41,300
So that makes it really useful to use a line chart to visualize a trend then data over an interval of

9
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,750
time which is known as a time series.

10
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:48,470
So that's typically why you see an actual difference between a light chert versus just a scatterplot

11
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:49,990
with lines connecting the points.

12
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:55,460
It's that on the x axis there's some sort of designation of order from left to right.

13
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:01,550
So here's an example of a simple white Chur that we can see here that essentially we have some sort

14
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:04,700
of series of points that have all been connected with lines.

15
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,320
And in this case we're actually not even designating those points of markers.

16
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,270
Instead we're just showing the line and the x axis is ordered.

17
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:19,060
So we can think that as we go from left to right the x axis goes and grows bigger.

18
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:21,380
Now we can use different styles for the line charts.

19
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:25,380
And here we can see the three styles that are available to us with Clottey.

20
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:26,810
And that's just lines.

21
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:31,790
So just a line by itself here and blue at top lines and the markers we can see here.

22
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,800
Each marker point and the line segment that connects them.

23
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,720
Or if you want.

24
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:40,790
You can stick with just markers and the recall that's essentially just a scatterplot like we did before.

25
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:45,920
And in fact when we work on the off line charts completely it's going to be the same and go scatterplot

26
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,810
call that we saw in the previous scatterplot lecture.

27
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:54,650
Except now we're going to add in things like calling lines or lines plus markers as her actual mode

28
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,360
instead of just saying markers.

29
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,140
OK.

30
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:01,520
So let's explore all of this with her actual code inside of a text editor.

31
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,610
All right so here we are our text editor.

32
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:10,880
I've already imported some pies and P as well as partly off line and plot lead graph objects as go and

33
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:15,500
if a random seed again you can choose whatever random seed you want but if you want your results to

34
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,040
look exactly like they are in our notes go ahead and choose the number 56.

35
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,540
In this case because that's the number that gave me a nice scatter that I could connect with.

36
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,050
So we have that random seed.

37
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:30,410
So let's go ahead and create some x values and y values will say x values for this.

38
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:36,970
We're going to use NPE lens space which is going to allow us create 100 evenly spaced values so I'll

39
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:39,040
say from 0 to 1.

40
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,450
Give me 100 evenly spaced values.

41
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:47,540
So that's going to be our ordered x axis to use for our line chart and for y values or we're going to

42
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:55,150
say just a bunch of random points we'll say and P random and we'll go from a random normal distribution

43
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:58,120
random end and which can pass and 100 there.

44
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,360
So give me 100 random values for those y values.

45
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,240
And now it's time to actually create the line charts.

46
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:11,200
So the syntax that platies documentation likes to use is that every single line chart we're going to

47
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,890
put on to our figure is called a trace.

48
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:20,810
So you usually see something like this you'll see a trace and then that will be assigned from Go-Kart

49
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:26,440
scatter your x value your y values and then you can give it a mode and a name.

50
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,010
So we're going to start off of one trace.

51
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:31,950
Put that into our data call edit the layout a little bit and then plot that figure.

52
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:37,190
And hopefully this will start to bring some sort of clarification to using data and layout.

53
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,830
So we have trace go that scatter.

54
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,450
And what I'm going to do here is provide the arguments.

55
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:51,740
So for ex that's going to be x values then for the Y on the scatterplot it's going to be let's say oops

56
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:59,280
Y is equal to y values and we're going to say y values plus 5.

57
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:06,260
So what is going to do is it's going to add 5 to every single value from that random set of numbers.

58
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:13,300
So we have X and Y and we're also going to then say the following will add in mode is equal to.

59
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:22,640
And in this case we'll just keep it as markers and the name we're going to keep here is markers as well.

60
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:31,000
So right now I just have one trace and then what platies documentation likes to do is inside our data

61
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,550
list.

62
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,370
We just pass in that trace.

63
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:39,160
So before we were passing in Go-Kart scattered directly into this list now for organization we're going

64
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,480
to just set it as a variable.

65
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:47,010
Trace and then put in that trace into this data variable then we're going to continue on with our lay

66
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:56,680
out call and our layout is just going to be go lay out and we'll give this tidal just like chart's

67
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,090
OK.

68
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:08,220
So then we just say our figure object is equal to go figure we'll say data is equal to that data list

69
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:12,010
and lay out is equal to earlier options that we just created.

70
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,450
Now we're ready to actually plot this.

71
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:21,210
So we say Wyo. plot passen that figure and you can give this a file name if you want.

72
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,410
I'll go in and get the file name.

73
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:25,710
So it's just going to overwrite temp Dasch plot each time.

74
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,520
So let's say this emic sure we see what we've done.

75
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:32,800
We created some random data for line chart we need x values and y values.

76
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:37,980
We went ahead and we still use Go-Kart scatter and we'll see how we can edit this in just a minute to

77
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,200
actually create the line chart.

78
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:45,430
Right now our mode is just markers that we take taken that go scatter put insider data list creator

79
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,430
to layer object which technically is optional.

80
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:54,380
It's just added things like the title the x axis the y axis titles then we pass that into data and layout

81
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:57,270
in this figure object and we plot that figure object.

82
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,710
So hopefully it's starting to make sense the separation between data and layout and then using figure

83
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:08,840
and dot plot with that figure let's make sure to save this and run the file we run Python basic that

84
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:14,270
pie or whatever you happen to actually call this file and then that should bring up the age T.M. and

85
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,250
automatically open it for you.

86
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,710
So we're going to bring over the actual plot we just created.

87
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:25,270
And right now it looks like a scatterplot which makes sense because we set the mode equal to just markers.

88
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,430
So now let's explore how we could add in the actual line segments themselves.

89
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:35,570
So we'll come back to our code and what we're going to do here is we're going to instead of editing

90
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,050
our trace right here.

91
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:43,280
Well we're going to do is create another trace we'll say trace 0 is equal to this first scatter call

92
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:51,520
and then I'm going to make trace one equal to another scatterplot.

93
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:58,960
But this time when I'm going to say is X X values y is equal to y values.

94
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:05,320
And now instead of saying mode is equal to marker's I'm going to say that the mode is equal two lines

95
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,290
and we'll give it the same name.

96
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,890
Technically the name can be whatever you want it to be called.

97
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,760
So you can say like my lines.

98
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:13,050
That's not a special string code.

99
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,430
There is just the name.

100
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:20,500
As you hover over it what slightly thinks the sexual figure plot is called.

101
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,270
OK.

102
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:26,290
So right now hopefully you have an understanding that this first plot we created is just the markers

103
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,190
themselves.

104
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,880
And it took the y values and added five of them.

105
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,100
So the original value is now kind of in the middle of our graph.

106
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:34,810
It's just going to be the straight lines.

107
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,110
And now we can see that data.

108
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:43,000
The reason it's a list here is because this allows me to easily add in multiple plots.

109
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,540
So now I can have a list of plots like Trace's 0 trace 1 in my data list and that's the real reason

110
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,780
why it was a list.

111
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:55,350
When you're plotting just a single plot it kind of doesn't make sense that it's a list of a single item

112
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,210
but it really makes sense when you want to put in multiple plots onto the same figure.

113
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:03,240
So again just adding another scatterplot except this time they didn't.

114
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,120
The mode is lines.

115
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,600
So we're going to save this and run our file again.

116
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,800
Then it should overwrite that temp plot that each T.M. and open it up for you.

117
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,210
So let's go ahead and grab this guy and bring it over.

118
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,440
And now we can see the line plot that we just created and you'll notice as you hover over you can see

119
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:27,270
the actual name you can see my lines on that orange It may be a little small free to see on my screen

120
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,470
but if you're following along on your screen you'll be able to see that name you gave the plot so you

121
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:36,540
can move along and see the difference between just using markers versus calling lines.

122
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:43,830
And finally we're going to do here is add in one more trace so you can see the last option which is

123
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,430
lines and markers put together.

124
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,570
So we'll just copy and paste here.

125
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:56,580
We'll say trace 2 0 1 2 and the mode that we're going to specify here is going to be equal to instead

126
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:00,410
of just lines all sight lines plus markers.

127
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:08,350
And I can give this name again whatever I want so we'll say we can even say like my favorite save that

128
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:15,040
and then we just need to add in that trace to our data that we're passing in we'll say traced to save

129
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,680
this.

130
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:21,280
And if we run this again then we should see three different line charts on that same plot.

131
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:25,140
And whoops looks like I forgot to actually subtract five.

132
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,390
So let me subtract 5 from this y.

133
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,450
Otherwise these two plots are going to be right on top of each other.

134
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,910
Let me save that again.

135
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:32,970
Run that.

136
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:38,590
So again just to reiterate I have plus five the original values and minus 5 because if we set them all

137
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:42,640
as y values then they're all going to be right on top of each other in Knoxville to see all three of

138
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,150
them.

139
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,420
So that's where we have the plus five and minus five.

140
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,810
So it's going to run that again.

141
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,060
Some basic pi.

142
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:51,550
And let me grab that each time I'll file so we can show it off here.

143
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:55,620
So grabbing that HTML file here we can see the markers the my lines.

144
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:58,280
And then at the bottom that green my favorite.

145
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,760
And you can see that now has zoom in closer.

146
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,040
