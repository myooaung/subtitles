Welcome back.

2
00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.590
Now that we understand how to create massive plotless.

3
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:13.250
Let's go ahead and test new skills with an exercise and this lecture will do a quick overview of the

4
00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.100
exercise and with the expected outputs should be.

5
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:16.340
All right.

6
00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.940
Here we are at the heat map exercise file.

7
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.320
Your objective is using the flights CXXVI data set available from the data file there as flights CSP

8
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.600
create a heat map with the following parameters.

9
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.930
The X axis of the heat map should represent the year the y axis to represent the month and the z axis.

10
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.720
That is the color bar should represent the number of passengers who flew on that particular month of

11
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.320
that particular year.

12
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.280
So you'll do your imports you'll read in that data frame define your data variable create the layout

13
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:44.470
and then plot it out.

14
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.880
So the fight is we file looks something like this.

15
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.760
Basically it's a year 1949 all the way through late fifties then the month of that year and how many

16
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.080
passengers on average flew for that particular month of that particular year.

17
00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.600
So that's in the thousands.

18
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.030
OK so let's go in and take a look at what the final result should look like.

19
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.570
OK here's what the final plot her map ends up looking like.

20
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.790
We can see on the X-axis we have the years on the y axis we have the months and this color bar represents

21
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.650
how many hundreds of thousands of passengers or how many thousands were on average traveling for that

22
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:16.770
particular month.

23
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.710
So we can see here that as you go further in time you get more flights and you can also see the seasonal

24
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.630
effect that summer has because it looks like throughout the years summer tends to be the most popular

25
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:27.720
month to travel.

26
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.600
OK.

27
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.170
If you have any questions feel free to post the Q&amp;A forums.

28
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.900
And the next lecture will go over the solution.
