Welcome back.

2
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.460
Now that you know how to create box plots of Plumley Let's test your new skills for exercise.

3
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.650
This lecture will go over the exercise file and the next lecture will go over the solutions.

4
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.090
Let's head over to that file.

5
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.680
All right.

6
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.380
So for the box plus exercise your objective is to make a data frame using the abalone that is set so

7
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.360
that's underneath the data folder and you're going to take two independent random samples of different

8
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.000
sizes from the Rings field so you can go ahead and print out that data frame to see what I'm saying.

9
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.230
But here's a big hint as far as how to do this what to copy and paste this thing and see the syntax

10
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.350
highlighting that basically using pede that random choice and then passing in your rings column from

11
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.220
that data frame then the number 10 and then replace equals false.

12
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:58.140
This will grab 10 random samples from this column D rings with no replacement so it's not going to end

13
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.950
up replacing values or picking them twice.

14
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:07.200
So you're going to do this twice to end up grabbing two batches of random samples then those two batches

15
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.950
you're going to make a box plot to essentially compare two samples taken from the same population.

16
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.360
So this is sometimes a nice way to see that samples do derive from the same population.

17
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.150
So you should see similar box plots.

18
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.390
They won't be exactly the same but they shouldn't be too different either.

19
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.600
So let's go in and see an example solution of what this may look like.

20
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.360
So here we can see two box plots since really just comparison of two samples taken from that same population

21
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.860
from that data set.

22
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.860
OK.

23
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.940
That's all there is to it.

24
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.580
If you have any questions feel free to post the Q&amp;A forms in the next lecture.

25
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.090
We'll go over an example solution.
