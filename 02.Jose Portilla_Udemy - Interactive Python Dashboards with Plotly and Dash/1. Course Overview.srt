1
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,880
Everyone welcome to this course overview lecture before we get started.

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,710
I have one quick favorite to ask of you and that is to please do not skip this lecture even if you've

3
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,960
already taken other you to me courses in the past.

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,420
Or if you've even taken some of my own courses in the past we've packed in a lot of useful information

5
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,550
in this one lecture so don't be tempted to jump straight ahead to the technical material.

6
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,720
In fact we are even going to go over the course curriculum in this lecture.

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,370
So a lot of useful information here.

8
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,080
Go ahead and just watch the whole thing.

9
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,870
And I thank you very much for that favor.

10
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,280
So what do we actually talk about in this course.

11
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:36,510
Overview lecture.

12
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:40,680
We're going to discuss how to get help during the course some useful course taking tips so you can get

13
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:45,070
the best course experience how to get the notes for this course how this course curriculum is structured

14
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:50,050
and also please check your automated welcome message for some nice useful information and useful links

15
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:54,220
there including information about how to access our chat channels.

16
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,840
So let's get started with how to get help.

17
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,920
During the course the very first thing you should do is if you're on an air.

18
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,500
That's just a simple typo.

19
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,960
Or are you getting an error that says maybe something like Module not found.

20
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,770
Please double check that you're running are provided notes directly for every single lecture.

21
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:13,570
There's a set of files or notes that correspond to that lecture.

22
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:17,080
They should be able to run and get the exact same result we do.

23
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:22,810
Also keep in mind that we're going to discuss this in more detail later that we actually have an environment

24
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:24,610
file for you to use.

25
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:29,100
That way you can make sure your run of the same code in the same environment that we developed it in.

26
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,630
Because plotline dash they're really new libraries.

27
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:36,700
So I'm certain they'll change in the future and in order to avoid any simple typos mistakes or errors

28
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:40,390
go ahead and run our provided notes in our provided environment.

29
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:45,660
If that still doesn't work for you then you have a more general question that is not related to something

30
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,700
that simply running the nose will fix.

31
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,880
I would actually suggest that you do a quick search in plotless in-dash documentation.

32
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,990
There's a lot of useful links and information there that may quickly get you an answer.

33
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:01,890
Or we can also try using Google or Stack Overflow search those Eliab to get a really fast response because

34
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:05,610
it's simply just searching in your browser for useful information.

35
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,910
Now let's say that still doesn't work for you.

36
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:13,290
You can go ahead and search the previous question answer forum posts and see if a student had a similar

37
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,560
question to you in the past.

38
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:17,760
That's most likely already been answered in the question answer posts.

39
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:22,410
If none of those solutions work for you feel free to post a new question to the question answer forums

40
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:27,130
and either I or one of the teaching assistants will be happy to get back to you and help you out.

41
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,550
One quick note on getting help in general.

42
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:37,100
If you're having trouble with the TO ME platform are you having issues such as video player issues or

43
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:42,380
you have questions about your certification or things like payment issues or enrollment issues where

44
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,630
the Course is missing.

45
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:48,560
I can't actually help you if that your best way to get help with that is to either open a support ticket

46
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,750
on the support page for you to me or to email them directly support you to meet DOT com.

47
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:59,240
Again those are things like platform issues issues it's a video players or certification etc..

48
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:05,510
Some quick useful tips for getting the best course experience you can use the gear settings on the video

49
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,530
player to adjust the playback speed.

50
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:12,170
So for a lot of people including myself they like to kind of zip through the videos especially if they

51
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:18,260
already have the corresponding notes so personally I tend to watch lectures at 2 x speed or maybe English

52
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,300
isn't your first language.

53
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,540
You want to slow it down a bit.

54
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:27,350
You can do things like captions or slower playback speeds on the gear settings on the video player.

55
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:31,430
You can also feel free to jump around sections if you already feel familiar of some material.

56
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:35,370
And we're going to go over the curriculum in just a little bit to give you a better idea of what sections

57
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:38,970
you can skip if you're already an experienced Python developer.

58
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,850
OK so this is the overall course curriculum.

59
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,410
Now these are the main topics.

60
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:47,730
These are exactly lined up with the sections but you can think of these as the overall theme so we're

61
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,580
going to cover throughout this course.

62
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:54,170
We first start off with the introduction section and that's basically the section you're in right now.

63
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:58,290
It consists of the Course overview lectures such as the curriculum overview that we're going through

64
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:58,920
right now.

65
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:04,470
A frequently asked questions lecture that you can quickly check and also a general overview of the data

66
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:07,740
visualization ecosystem for Python and what plotline.

67
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,130
Use Cases are.

68
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:15,790
So the data visualization ecosystem for Python is very new and it updates very frequently.

69
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:21,360
So what we're going to have here as the last lecture for this kind of introduction section is the broad

70
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:27,120
overview explanation of what poly is what that is what different types of problems they solve for you

71
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,900
and just more general information.

72
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,640
So you can be informed of what you're going to learn throughout the course.

73
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,310
So that's going to be the end of that introduction section that we're in right now.

74
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,880
Then after that we're going to have a pint pand this crash course section.

75
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:46,160
So in order to actually create dashboards and plots we need data and we're going to be using some PI

76
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:51,490
to generate random data sometimes or we'll be using pandas to read in existing data sets.

77
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:56,550
And if it never actually worked with them pi or panderers we need to teach those just a little bit first

78
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,800
in order to move on to learning about plot Lee and dash.

79
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:05,040
So in that crash course we teach you just a very very basics of Pi and the very basis of the Panthers.

80
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,980
You're not going to be an expert in either of those.

81
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:11,440
You're going to know just enough in order to continue off the course with pottery and dash.

82
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:15,960
If you've already taken one of my previous courses in data science or machine learning or Python and

83
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,330
you're already familiar with those libraries you can probably go ahead and skip that crash course section.

84
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:25,020
We do have a quick exercise overview so you can check out what skill level you need to be to continue

85
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,220
on the course.

86
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,850
After that we start off with plotless basic charts and plots.

87
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:37,780
So plot Lee has a python visualization library already and it's called plot Lee and it can produce interactive

88
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,780
plots on its own in Python.

89
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:44,380
So in this section we're going explain how to reproduce the main types of plots with just Python and

90
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:44,930
plot.

91
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,660
So it's not dashboards yet.

92
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:49,150
It's just interactive individual plots.

93
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:55,300
Once we understand that then we move on to actually learning about Dasch basics for dashboards.

94
00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:01,120
So here we begin working with the actual Dasch library from plot to begin serving components and several

95
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,640
plots as a web app in our browser.

96
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:07,480
So that's going to be a little different than just a singular plot plot.

97
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:12,160
Instead we're going to be able to combine multiple things and have a full service dashboard that's actually

98
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,370
basically a web service or web app in your browser.

99
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:20,630
So once we learn about the dash basics we'll move on to discussing summative asked dashed topics.

100
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:25,520
So that has several more advanced and complex features are definitely worth exploring and I think that

101
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,540
this is really where the awesome part of the course comes into play.

102
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:34,090
We'll deal with things like multiple inputs and outputs interactive components control and callbacks

103
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,330
with state and linking together group plot plots.

104
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:43,090
So a lot of really cool things that advanced topics then because we've learned so much by this point

105
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:48,690
in the course we go ahead and try to wrap everything together with a code along milestone project.

106
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,980
So we'll bring in together everything we've learned so far at this point in the course of a larger code

107
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:55,370
along milestone project and we're going to be doing.

108
00:06:55,390 --> 00:07:00,040
And you may have seen a little glimpse of it in some of the preview videos is that we create a basic

109
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:06,430
web app that will automatically look up and serve stock ticker data for you in two sets of time stamps

110
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:11,020
that you get to choose and it's all done through a dash dashboard in pure Python.

111
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:15,110
It's a really cool project and I'm super excited for you guys to work through it.

112
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:19,570
Then once you've done that milestone project we just need to finish up with some more advanced topics

113
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:23,730
on basically having your dashboards interact with other people.

114
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:27,700
So one of those things is will he live real time updating.

115
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:32,050
So we're going to see how we can let dashboards update themselves in real time with a continuous stream

116
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:39,040
of data and we'll have a really cool project there where we read in live flight radar data and serve

117
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:42,190
dashboard that's constantly updating information about that.

118
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,320
And then finally we'll talk about deployment authorization.

119
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:50,030
So throughout the course we're really just going to be serving dashboards locally on a single computer.

120
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:53,830
But eventually most likely you're not going to be the only person using your dashboard.

121
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:58,570
Other people at your company or maybe other people around the world are going to want to see it dashboard

122
00:07:58,570 --> 00:07:59,200
you create.

123
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:04,240
So we're going to walk you through how to host dashboards on a server such as Heroku.

124
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:09,640
And then we'll also talk about securing dashboards to only be seen by authorized viewers.

125
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:12,790
So maybe you want to host something online but only let certain people see it.

126
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:16,700
We'll show you how to do that with Dash and dashboards as well.

127
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:17,860
OK.

128
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:21,610
So last but not least a huge thank you for enrolling in this course.

129
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:27,790
I'm always so humbled that students decide to choose my courses as resources for them to learn and continue

130
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:32,040
to build an understanding of Python programming in a variety of topics.

131
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:37,000
So thank you so much for enrolling in this course and I'm really excited to start teaching you politely

132
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,560
and dash for dashboards if at this point you have some sort of question of something you've already

133
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,200
discussed.

134
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:45,640
Go ahead and send me a message on to me I'll be happy to get back to you.

135
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,240
All right let's get started.
