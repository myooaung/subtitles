00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:06,120
Welcome back.

2
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:09,790
Let's not go over the solution for the distribution plot exercise.

3
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:12,120
OK here we are at the exercise file.

4
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:19,870
Let's go ahead and start off with our imports will import plot lead off line lips not config.

5
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:20,570
Off line.

6
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,080
As p y o.

7
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:26,400
And then since we're using distribution plots we're going to import plots.

8
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:34,070
And here we import your factory as F F and then import Pandurs as PD.

9
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:41,140
OK so those are imports then we want to read in the data frame from the iris data set that's equal to

10
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:42,040
PD.

11
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:50,830
I read C S V and in my case I'll say data Irus thought V.

12
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,500
Then when need to find the traces we gave you this hint which basically tells you how you can do this

13
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:02,930
or one method of doing this so will say Trace's 0 is equal to and that will be where the class is equal

14
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:09,170
to Irus and we're going to do this for each one of these so Irus a Tosa is one of the flowers so will

15
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,270
copy and paste that.

16
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:16,370
And this grabs that pedal length column values where only the classes Irus at Tosa.

17
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:23,120
So let me copy and paste this two more times because we have two other classes of flowers So this sets

18
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,120
up for traces and then we need to replace.

19
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:34,490
I was at Tosa with the other species so that would be Irus versicolor and then ires virginica.

20
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,980
So again all these lines are doing.

21
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:40,420
Is it saying grab me the data frame with the data frame class is equal to.

22
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:45,520
This particular species and then off with this data frame only grab the pedaling for a column.

23
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,120
Technically this can be done in two steps but it's really common with Pancho's to see it all done in

24
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,280
one line like this.

25
00:01:51,280 --> 00:02:02,830
Then you will need to find that data variable all say this data is equal to trace 0 trace 1 and trace

26
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:10,580
to and then we can create our group labels so the group labels essentially is going to be the list of

27
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,780
species names.

28
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,880
So let's just grab that from here.

29
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:18,140
Since you've already provided that for the classes just got to make sure that it's in the same order

30
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,510
as your traces such should be Seto's the first color virginica.

31
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:24,590
And if a piece is here it looks like the same order.

32
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,210
Then we just need a creator figure.

33
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:36,500
So I'll say fig is equal to f f create underscore this plot and we're going to pass in that data as

34
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,730
well as the group labels.

35
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:42,270
Let me make sure that I have this as an L there.

36
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,020
There we go group labels.

37
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:52,470
Save that and then we say P wheel and we'll plot that figure save this and let's run it.

38
00:02:52,550 --> 00:03:01,930
Let me pull up my terminal and I will say Python basic but PI enter and we should see it as an output.

39
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,720
So going to bring that over and there we see the distributions.

40
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,990
And again this basically confirms that Seto says pedal lengths are quite different than virginica and

41
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:15,300
versicolor so Stoessel flowers are quite separable from virginica inverse colorize.

42
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:20,090
OK if you have any questions on that feel free to post any forms and make sure check out our solution

43
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,130
up-I script.

44
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,260
We'll see you at the next lecture.
