00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:10,460
Welcome back to the final part of our milestone project where we're going to replace our input component

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:16,970
with a drop down component and connect that to a c a c file that contains a list of NASDAQ ticker and

3
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:17,880
company names.

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,310
That way a person can actually go to the dropdown menu select the tickers are interested in and then

5
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,630
hit the submit button and see the historical price information.

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,680
Let's get started.

7
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:32,540
OK here we are back our text editor what we need to do is actually just import pandas.

8
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:39,570
As PD and then we're going to read and see as we file and construct a list of options.

9
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:45,350
So to do that let's create a variable called an SD Q for Nasdaq.

10
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:54,760
Now we're going to read in the CXXVI file from the data folder to the Nasdaq company list that cxxviii

11
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,700
essentially this is a CXVII file that has a list of symbols and then a list of company names.

12
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,790
Or I should say a column of company names and a column of symbols.

13
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:09,150
We're going to take that column of symbols and set that to the index we'll type out.

14
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:17,750
And as the queue set the index and we're going to set it to be the symbol column and we can say in place

15
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,250
is equal to true which allows us to not need to reassign this.

16
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:29,410
So if you didn't say in place it equals a true you need to say and as the queue is equal to an SD queue

17
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,060
set index symbol.

18
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,060
So essentially this line and this line are actually the same thing except with this one.

19
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,920
If you say in places equal to true you don't need to do the re-assignment.

20
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,580
So that's where we do that right now that we have our set index.

21
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:50,070
The index is now the symbol meaning that column represents the name we're going to create a list of

22
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,010
options.

23
00:01:51,920 --> 00:02:02,380
We'll say options is equal to a list and then we're going to go for every tick in the queue index.

24
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:15,390
We'll say whoops options and we need to append a dictionary and this dictionary remember it's in the

25
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,240
form that looks something like this.

26
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:26,920
It's going to have a label which is the string the user sees and then a value which is what our script

27
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,660
sees.

28
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,860
So let's actually construct this dictionary and then append it.

29
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:40,800
So my dictionary we're going to set that equal to an empty dictionary first and then we're going to

30
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,600
grab the actual label so label is going to be what the user sees.

31
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:52,230
Let's have that be both a concatenation of the symbol and the name of the company.

32
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:53,530
So we're going to do the following.

33
00:02:53,540 --> 00:03:03,400
We'll say that the label is equal to N.S. dequeue I EHLO see tick.

34
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,850
So that's the company name.

35
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:07,990
And then we're going to concatenate that.

36
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:12,010
Let's actually make that into a string.

37
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:18,980
So that's the company name and then we're going to concatenate it with a space and then add on the tick.

38
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,350
So what does that actually mean.

39
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,260
It means the label should look something like this.

40
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:27,300
It should say maybe Apple company and then APL.

41
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:31,780
So that's going to be the label the user sees in the dropdown as far as the value we're going to pass

42
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,650
back.

43
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,710
For that we just need the actual Ticker.

44
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:38,410
So we're just get that synthetical to tick and then we're going to pen that.

45
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,260
So now this options is a list of dictionaries of labels and values for our dropdown menu.

46
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:44,860
And you can check out the guidebook.

47
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:51,580
We did this in a kind of Wisam a little bit jujitsu we did it in one line but for explanation purposes

48
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:53,420
I think it's a little clearer over multiple lines.

49
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,210
But check out the guidebook for a way to do this all in just one line.

50
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:00,470
Going to save that will come back down here.

51
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,360
Change is input to be a drop down.

52
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:08,950
We'll go ahead and keep the same ID my ticker symbol the value the sexy note needs to be inside of a

53
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:13,130
list due to the weight dropped on works.

54
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:19,290
And we're also going to add in the options list will say options as you go to the options list we just

55
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:26,220
constructed and we can actually take away these style calls and instead right here for this style We're

56
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,950
going to keep it inline block as well as vertical line but we're going to give it a little more room.

57
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,010
Since now a person can choose more than one stock we're going to say that the width of this.

58
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,930
Let's put this in as a string is going to be 30 percent with.

59
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,710
All right.

60
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:45,160
So now that we set that up the only thing that's left to do.

61
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:50,910
There's actually one more thing we want to do and that's that set multiply equal to true.

62
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:54,550
It's going to allow someone to choose more than just one option in the drop down.

63
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:57,910
All right so we have the options value multa is equal to true.

64
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:02,620
We've edited to give a little bit of a wider width since they can now choose multiple stocks in that

65
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:11,190
drop down will come back down here and now we just need to add our function to take in those stocks.

66
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,570
Right now we're just grabbing a single stock ticker.

67
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:18,390
But now the stock ticker coming from that drop down menu instead of the input is going to be a list

68
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:25,170
meaning we want to create a set of Trace's for every stock ticker in that list will say Trace's is a

69
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:35,920
list and then for tick in stock ticker take my data frame and say actually we can just use this come

70
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:36,740
in right here.

71
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:42,560
So we already constructed that take my data frame and build out that for that particular tick.

72
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:50,010
So no longer stock ticker but instead we will say tick and then we're going to append the trace.

73
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:57,060
So we'll say Trace's append and we're going to append a dictionary that essentially looks like this.

74
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:01,840
This X will be that different index and then that data frame is close.

75
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:07,100
So we're going to pin that there and we can say close either of these methods is okay.

76
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:15,900
And let's also then give it a name attribute we'll say name is tick that way when someone's hovering

77
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,650
over it they get to see the name as well.

78
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,680
And this Trace's is already a list.

79
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:24,900
So this data instead of being a list is just going to be the traces be constructed and that should be

80
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,530
all we need to do.

81
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:29,220
Let's do a quick review make sure we didn't miss anything coming back from the top that we're doing

82
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:29,930
here.

83
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:35,250
We're reading in a CSP file of company illis then setting the index to be the symbol and then creating

84
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:40,230
our empty options list then for every ticker that's now in that index we're going to construct a dictionary

85
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:43,260
that looks like this and append that to this list of options.

86
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:50,550
We create an empty dictionary the label we want that to be the name and then the company's ticker.

87
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:56,400
So we're saying grab that location and this is actually just b l o c.

88
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,110
In fact they messed that up a little bit here.

89
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,530
There should be name.

90
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:01,070
There we go.

91
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:08,200
So this is now saying saying Nasdaq at the location of this particular ticker index value grabbed the

92
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,800
value of the name column and that itself should then be a string.

93
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,120
We'll see if this works then put a space and then put in the ticker.

94
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:15,480
OK.

95
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:16,300
That's the correct code.

96
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,420
My apologies for that.

97
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:23,500
And then we're going to do here is say my dictionary values equal to tick and then we're appending it

98
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:30,440
passing that into the options in this dropdown and then all the way down here is creating all the traces

99
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,300
for every stock chosen.

100
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:38,650
Let's see this and see if we need to debug any further say Pythonesque the API looks like it's running.

101
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,050
So let's head over toward dashboard.

102
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:40,910
OK here I am.

103
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,390
My dashboard looks like Tesla is the default.

104
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:48,680
And now when I click on this I get to see that company name followed by their stock ticker.

105
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:54,290
So then I can click on alphabet Google and then if I hit submit this updates and then I get to see Google

106
00:07:54,350 --> 00:08:00,400
versus Tesla here and I can change the dates to get more information hit submit to update that they'll

107
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:06,310
update that those dates and I can choose multiple things such as a bunch of other stocks from the drop

108
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,360
down and I can also type them out.

109
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:13,100
So if I'm interested in Microsoft I can begin typing up Microsoft and eventually I'll see it Microsoft

110
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,980
Corporation hit submit.

111
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:18,070
And then depending on how many stocks you deal take a little bit of time.

112
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,010
But there we go.

113
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,910
We get to see him all in our dashboard.

114
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:21,810
OK.

115
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,560
So that's it for the mouse some project.

116
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:27,920
I hope it gave you lots of ideas of the kind of dashboards you can create with all your plotline and

117
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,140
dash skills.

118
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,590
We'll see you at the next lecture.
