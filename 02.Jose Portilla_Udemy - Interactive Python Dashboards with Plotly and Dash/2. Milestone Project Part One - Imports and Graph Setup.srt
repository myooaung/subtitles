00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:09,830
Welcome to our first part for the Milestone project here we're just going to build a skeleton of what

2
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:11,290
the dashboard is going to look like.

3
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:16,000
By setting up our basic imports and then setting up our layout Let's get started.

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,550
Let's begin by importing dash.

5
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:29,570
And we'll also import Dasch core components as DCC and we'll import h T.M. components as h tim L. Then

6
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:35,290
we'll create our application by saying app is equal to dash dash.

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:43,600
And then we will say app layout is equal to h team l div and let's add some components here will str.

8
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,240
have an HDMI component.

9
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:52,980
This will just be an H T.M. head or one such as the title we see at the top and we'll call this our

10
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,170
stock ticker dashboard

11
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:03,900
then we'll say HTL H-3 and this will be the text right above that dropdown.

12
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:09,860
So it will say enter a stock symbol and because we want it to be right above that drop down the very

13
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:15,730
next component should be that drop down and that is going to be a core component called input.

14
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:22,410
We'll get an idea so we can later link it to a callback we'll call it my stock picker for its ID and

15
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:28,040
let's give it a default value just for the sake of seeing something when we run this will give a default

16
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,580
value of the Tesla stock.

17
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:40,370
Then after this we'll put in a graph later on we'll expand this graph to be something a little more

18
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:40,970
complex.

19
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:46,130
But right now I should say the idea is my graph and I'm going to create a few more lines here so I can

20
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:47,590
scroll down.

21
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:53,880
So the idea is my graph and then we added the figure parameter which remembers just a dictionary.

22
00:01:54,020 --> 00:02:00,170
And right now let's make it a very simple and key value pair of data member data as a list.

23
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:03,350
And in this case we'll give it just a simple dictionary value.

24
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:07,760
Recall that if you just pass in a dictionary instead of passing and something like go that scatter probably

25
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:12,760
will automatically create a line chart for you given x and y points you provide inside this dictionary.

26
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:18,810
So I'll say are x coronets are 1 and 2 in our White coordinates are three in one.

27
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:23,960
So what we see here is going to be a line chart from points 1 and Weikel 3.

28
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,830
So 1 3 2 point 2 1.

29
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,880
So just be kind of a very simple downward slope line.

30
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:34,170
Once we've done that let's make sure everything worked out by running our server.

31
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,840
Say app run server.

32
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:37,310
OK.

33
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:40,880
And this code correlates to what the stock ticker one pie.

34
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,090
Remember you have a separate guidebook for this project.

35
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:48,240
I'm going to run Python basic Bajpai make sure that I'm missing anything up.

36
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,250
And we are running.

37
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,770
So let's head over to the dashboard.

38
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:55,240
Okay looks like our basic layout matches up what we wanted.

39
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:00,070
We have our dashboard header Interesse stock symbol this input box which later we're going to expand

40
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:05,770
to be an actual drop down option where we have a list of Nasdaq stocks and then we have our graph here

41
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,720
which again we're going to update later on.

42
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:08,320
OK.

43
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:13,470
Now it's time to go to the next step where we can edit this further by adding in some more features.

44
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:20,620
So in part two we're going to end up doing is adding in things like an input box that can have a basic

45
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:24,940
callback to display the input value that is the ticker on this graph.

46
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,200
We'll see you at the next lecture.
