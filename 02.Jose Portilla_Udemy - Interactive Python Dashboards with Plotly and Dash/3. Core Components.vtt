00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:06.510
Welcome back.

2
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:11.660
Now that we understand that HTL components let's cover the core components and a little more detail

3
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.780
as we previously mentioned that core components are the more abstract or higher level calls that slides

4
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.730
quickly insert common components into your dashboard and later on we're going to be exploring how to

5
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.850
interact with these core components with our data sets.

6
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.280
But right now let's go ahead and do two things.

7
00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.870
First there's a reference to all the available dash core components and it can be found at this your

8
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.500
L address which you can also find by searching the dash documentation.

9
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.250
And then once we actually covered that documentation and go over what core components are available

10
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.630
we're going to explore how we can actually insert them in toward dashboard.

11
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.980
So let's go ahead and jump to this.

12
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.440
Your in our browser explore what components are available and then walk through a few simple examples

13
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.750
in the dashboard.

14
00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.150
I'm going to head over to that dashboard components documentation page.

15
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.370
Right now OK here we are at that documentation page for Dasch core components.

16
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.040
Something to note is that it's likely in the future more core components are added.

17
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.460
So you should be careful in referencing what actual version of Dasch core components you're using right

18
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.820
now.

19
00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.870
This is that 0.2 2.1 which is the same version we use in our pit freeze list.

20
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.530
But keep in mind in the future this may be upgraded and you may see some more core components available

21
00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.510
in which case you'll need to update Dasch core components and politely.

22
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.270
So right now let's go ahead and review what components are available.

23
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.560
So there are things like drop down which allows you to basically have a dropdown list of options like

24
00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.110
New York City San Francisco Montreal.

25
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.890
There's also the ability to add and select on your dropdown.

26
00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.330
So Adam and select multiple things like New York and San Francisco.

27
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.450
And there's things like sliders so we can see here we have slider's of ranges.

28
00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.800
You can also have range sliders so different labels and ranges here you can see the different versions

29
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.360
of those range sliders.

30
00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.720
We also have things like input so we can enter a value so I can say something like Hello.

31
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.480
And there's an input reference there's a text area checkboxes.

32
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.920
Basically a lot of the stuff that you've seen if your experience with something like bootstrap for example

33
00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:24.550
that you have radio items buttons that you can work with so you can submit items such as text and we

34
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.900
can see here the input value SD and the button was clicked one time.

35
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.920
So as I clicked this more and more times you can see that number being changed.

36
00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.620
And later on we're going to show you how to do that with callbacks.

37
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.120
There's also picker's so you can see here you can easily grab a calendar that's going to be a big part

38
00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.060
of one of our projects later on.

39
00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.290
Then there's also mark down which we're going to talk about in the very next lecture and there's more

40
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.380
advanced things like interactive tables.

41
00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.940
So this also has to do with Dash H.T. Melk components so you can kind of check this out.

42
00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.280
Again this is experimental at the time of the filming.

43
00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.670
But they do have more advanced examples.

44
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.200
You can also do things like upload components with DCC upload in order to upload data files yourself.

45
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.950
So that's a really useful feature in case you're going to have other people using your dashboard.

46
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:14.740
You can upload a CSP file in an expected format and then kind of display the table or do other things.

47
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.030
So there's lots of examples and references linked to this in the documentation.

48
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.360
And again more advanced things like tabs and graphs.

49
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.790
So if you look down here you have this nice graph here.

50
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.680
Again this is all the components that are available.

51
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:28.180
All right.

52
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:34.480
So let's go ahead and go back to our text editor and experiment a little more with some basic core components.

53
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.970
Some of the core you saw here are more advanced.

54
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.920
Now we're going to be covering them later on.

55
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.750
So right now we're going to do some very simple components like drop downs and sliders and radio items.

56
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.290
Let's head over to our actual text editor now.

57
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.550
Already Here we are at the text editor and I've already done a few imports I've imported dash imported

58
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.430
core components and imported components.

59
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.960
I created my Dasch application and then at the very bottom once I run the script it will run the server

60
00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:59.980
for me.

61
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:07.210
So the last thing to do is to edit our aptly out so we can say app thought lay out and then synthetical

62
00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.980
to an HTL div as we've done before.

63
00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.250
And inside this div we're going to have a list of different components.

64
00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.840
So let's go ahead and maybe add in a dropdown a slider and some radio items.

65
00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.050
So a lot of the strategy here is essentially just copying and pasting the components you need from that

66
00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.180
documentation page.

67
00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.330
We just did.

68
00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:32.810
So we're going to do is start off with a label call from the H team l component and that basically allows

69
00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.010
us to connect the label to whatever core component we're discussing.

70
00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:46.180
So first off let's just call this one dropdown and then we're going to insert from core components a

71
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.620
drop down component.

72
00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:55.150
And for this one you basically reference documentation and in this case there are options as a parameter

73
00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:01.930
and the options is a list of dictionaries where the dictionary is going to have some label so we'll

74
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:13.440
say the label of this one is New York City and then the other key value pair here is the actual value.

75
00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:19.170
So this is a value that's going to get passed back when we actually select it from the dropdown menu.

76
00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:23.430
Later on we'll learn how to actually deal with these values through interactivity and what's known as

77
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:24.940
callbacks in-dash.

78
00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:29.230
But the value we want to pass back is something simpler like NYC.

79
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.730
So basically the user on their end they'll say New York City in our dashboard application will see NYC

80
00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:35.500
past.

81
00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:42.060
So if we want to do some logic for example if user value is equal to NYC then we can do something and

82
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.180
have it look a little nicer on the front end with that label.

83
00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.170
So that's what the dictionary is doing.

84
00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.320
Label value and let's add in another one.

85
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.950
So it's a list of dictionaries in this format.

86
00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:57.970
So I'm just going to copy and paste this dictionary actually and then insert it here.

87
00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:04.590
Let's make sure the spacing is OK and let's give this another label we'll say this one is San Francisco

88
00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.630
on the front end label.

89
00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:11.160
And for our value on the back and we'll just say S.F. OK.

90
00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.020
So that's the label dropped down.

91
00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.970
We have dash cork opponent dropped down.

92
00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:20.780
We given the options and then finally we can give a value to this actual drop down itself.

93
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:23.930
So in this case what we can do is set a default value

94
00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:30.760
so that's a parameter that goes inside the dropdown.

95
00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:31.850
So we'll see value.

96
00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:37.590
Let's go ahead and say S.F. So that's a default value right there.

97
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:44.120
And the last thing I want to make clear right now is that these actual dash core components they're

98
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.580
not really going to do anything.

99
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:47.870
People can select and play around with them on the front end.

100
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.670
But until we learn about callbacks we're actually going to be able to interact with these particular

101
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:53.650
core components.

102
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:59.030
Right now we just want to show you how you can add core components to your dash application and then

103
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:02.130
later I'll show you how we can work with them with callbacks.

104
00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:03.060
OK.

105
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:04.850
So we have this drop down.

106
00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:08.710
So that's this entire component right here as well as the label for it.

107
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:16.600
So what I want to do now is let's insert a comma after this and we're going to say to him I'll insert

108
00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:21.290
another label and let's right now put in a slider.

109
00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:25.240
So again it's up to you what you want to call this label essentially just a string that's going to go

110
00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.530
next to the dash core component inside your dashboard.

111
00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:38.550
We'll call Dasch core components and let's choose the slider components and hear the parameters are

112
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:39.360
going to be different.

113
00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:43.770
So what you do is you just reference that documentation page for the parameters Slider it's going to

114
00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:47.000
take at a minimum value a max value and a step size.

115
00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:53.630
So I'll say the minimum value goes from negative 10 the max value goes to 10.

116
00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:54.980
We can provide a step size.

117
00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:56.800
A lot of these are optional.

118
00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:03.840
So if we say step size is 0.5 then Ill only go in step sizes of 0.5 and then we can also do is add marks

119
00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:04.460
to this.

120
00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:09.240
So if you want you can add a dictionary of marks but let's go ahead and just give it a default value

121
00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:10.850
of 0.

122
00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:15.840
OK so we have enough I think to play around with.

123
00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:20.430
So let's go ahead and run this and see what it looks like inside her application.

124
00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:22.620
So I'm going to run both Python but pi.

125
00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:25.260
And let's head over to the browser.

126
00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:30.620
OK so here I am at our actual dashboard I should know I'm very zoomed in right now so you can see this

127
00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:36.170
clearly on your screen but on your own application will probably look much much smaller something like

128
00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:39.940
you know around this size but I'm going to zoom in so we can see it clearly.

129
00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:45.680
Notice here we just have dropped out of New York and San Francisco and that value that we chose is going

130
00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.710
to be the default date chosen.

131
00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:48.960
Notice how our slider.

132
00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:53.270
Right here it's right in the middle which makes sense because it went from negative 10 to 10.

133
00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.070
Now in our default value was zero.

134
00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:56.140
So I can move around.

135
00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.130
There's actually no markings right now.

136
00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:03.080
So in order to add marks the slider what we need to do is add in a dictionary and you can use a dictionary

137
00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.880
comprehension in order to do that.

138
00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:12.470
So let's go back and show you how we can add that in so in order slider here we're going to say is add

139
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:18.700
one last parameter called the marks and we're going to set that equal to a dictionary.

140
00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:23.190
I where I for I in range.

141
00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:26.170
I for I in range.

142
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:35.100
And we're going to go from negative 10 to 10 so save this and run it again and make sure those marks

143
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.010
were added in OK.

144
00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:38.410
Go back to our browser now.

145
00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:42.790
OK now I can see those markings there.

146
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:46.240
Notice how because I didn't specify step size in that range.

147
00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:49.550
I don't have markings for those negative 2.5 or those.

148
00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:54.550
Essentially 0.5 steps I can still access them as you can see from the slider being in in-between two

149
00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:55.160
numbers.

150
00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.650
But I don't actually see those marks and it's up to you.

151
00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:01.000
And how much detail you want to give to these marks in the slider.

152
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.490
And as always you're really going to be just copying and pasting or referencing that core component

153
00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:10.120
documentation page to get the finer details about what parameters are available.

154
00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:15.610
So hopefully this just gives you an idea of how you would go to the documentation page grab the component

155
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:21.670
and then put it into your Dasch application and then edit whatever parameters you see fit then later

156
00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:26.720
on you'll use callbacks which you're going to learn about later in order to actually interact with your

157
00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:27.790
plots.

158
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:34.700
OK let's add in one more label and value pair so we have a dropdown.

159
00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:36.420
We have a slider.

160
00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:43.420
Let's go ahead and put a comma after that slider and add in one more label say the labels going to be

161
00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:47.680
some radio items so it'll say some radio items.

162
00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:54.480
Comma and then that label is essentially linked to whatever that core component comes after it.

163
00:10:54.480 --> 00:11:03.550
So we'll say radio items and here we give a list of options or an options parameter which is a list

164
00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:07.390
of very similar dictionaries of label and value pairs.

165
00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:13.580
So essentially what we have up here and in fact I'm just going to copy this and paste it here.

166
00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:18.960
So we have the label New York City and the value the value that was sent back when we actually learned

167
00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.360
how to interact with these core components.

168
00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:24.070
Label is what the person sees on the front end.

169
00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:27.030
And if we want we can give this a filled in value.

170
00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:36.780
So we can say value is equal to some default option so say S.F. is already pre-selected and let's save

171
00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:40.220
this run a dashboard again.

172
00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:43.750
And now we should see some raido items right below our slider.

173
00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:44.080
Okay.

174
00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:46.530
So if you're following along you should see something like this.

175
00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:51.080
However notice we have an issue even though it looks like our radio buttons are working and San Francisco

176
00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:54.250
is pre-filled in and it looks like we can switch between them.

177
00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:57.510
Summary two items is overlapping right now with our slider.

178
00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:01.660
And even if you zoom out you'll still have that issue if you're following along with me.

179
00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:09.030
All right so let's solve that problem of the some radio items label kind of overlapping with the slider.

180
00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:11.170
Now there's many ways to actually fix this problem.

181
00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:17.970
One way is to stick this entire thing into its own ASML Div. call and then edit the style dictionary

182
00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:23.160
property to give it more of a border or higher margins and you could technically do that for all these

183
00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:26.880
stickum into their own lives and then edit their style properties there.

184
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.810
And that's going to be a very common approach that we're going to see later on through some of our examples

185
00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:34.840
of kind of sticking each core component into it's own div That's way.

186
00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:37.200
It's easy to actually add it style.

187
00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:41.520
For now though we're going to show you a very simple fix which is using the template that p tag which

188
00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:45.860
stands for a paragraph and then allows you to essentially insert a line break.

189
00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:51.810
So we can say to him all dopy and I'm going to wrap this entire label.

190
00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:58.160
In this Piccola right here which stands for a paragraph that essentially inserts a line break.

191
00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:03.080
And you could wrap as many of these as you want into the paragraph to give you a little more spacing

192
00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:09.710
going to save this and let's just run this as Python basic the pie and then when we run this now we

193
00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:11.150
should see that issue fixed.

194
00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:13.350
So let's head over to our dashboard.

195
00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:13.780
OK.

196
00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:15.310
So check out our dashboard now.

197
00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:21.350
It does look like some radio items is no longer overlapping with the actual numbers of the slider as

198
00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:22.260
far as this.

199
00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:26.510
Some radio items labeled being maybe too close to these actual numbers.

200
00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:31.700
That's the kind of thing that you can it with style calls by putting this entire core component and

201
00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:36.710
the label inside it's own div and then adding things like a higher border or higher margin.

202
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:39.140
So those are things better fixed by Stiles.

203
00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:44.600
A quick little fix for that overlap is using that paragraph call to essentially insert the break.

204
00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:49.310
So again it's up to you how much styling I want to put into these dashboards in order to make things

205
00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:50.480
nicely spaced.

206
00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:55.220
But the main idea you should have gotten from this lecture is you can visit the core component documentation

207
00:13:55.220 --> 00:14:00.980
page see what looks interesting to you and then grab it essentially copy and paste edit the parameters

208
00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:01.990
as you see fit.

209
00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:07.970
And if you want to edit the styling to stick it into it's own div and edit with a style dictionary later

210
00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:12.770
on we're going to see how we can take these core components and add interactivity with callbacks to

211
00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:15.220
finish off the series of lectures in the next lecture.

212
00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:19.750
We'll discuss a little bit about markdown and then the lecture after that we'll talk about the very

213
00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:21.700
useful help function with Dash.

214
00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:24.160
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
