00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:06.190
Welcome back.

2
00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.240
Let's now go over the solution for the barter exercise.

3
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.890
OK here we are at the exercise pie script.

4
00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.650
First thing I wanted to do is perform our usual imports.

5
00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.560
I'm just going to copy and paste these to save a little bit of time.

6
00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:24.490
But essentially it's just the usual imports of poly off line polygraph objects and pandas as PD then

7
00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:33.150
we want to go ahead and read in the data frame will say the F is equal to PD read C S V and it's under

8
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.410
neath my data folder Mark surveyed thought cxxviii and it's quickest.

9
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.900
You should have set the index column to 0 to save yourself a little bit of work later on.

10
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.500
Again it's up to you if you want to do this.

11
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.230
But we mentioned that in the actual exercise over you don't want to create Trace's.

12
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.880
And in this case we use a list comprehension to do that.

13
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.800
Again it's up to you whether you prefer a list comprehension versus a normal for loop but list comprehensions

14
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.970
tend to be a little smoother as far as the way they're depicted in your syntax.

15
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:11.430
So in this case we create our data list or say go bar and we want to create a bar plot for essentially

16
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.440
every response in the columns.

17
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.080
So that means we'll say go up bar and set X equal to that index.

18
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.270
And if you hadn't set index underscore column equal to zero then instead of saying exercycle the index

19
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:32.990
you would have set it to that first column then we'll say Why that's going to be equal to ZF response

20
00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.530
and then we'll set the name equal to response.

21
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:48.470
And we're going to be creating this bar plot for and let's put this over a couple of lines for response

22
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.780
in the columns.

23
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.920
All right so again what we're doing here is we're creating a bar chart for every response in the columns.

24
00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.590
And here we're setting X equal to the index in y equal to the column of that response and then setting

25
00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.390
the name equal to response.

26
00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:14.290
So there's our data list for the bar plots and now it's time to actually create our oleo.

27
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.430
So for Lay we'll say lay out is equal to go lay out.

28
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:20.580
And here we're going.

29
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.850
A tidal survey results.

30
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.420
And then since we want a stacked bar plot what we need to specify is bar mode is equal to the string

31
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.860
stack.

32
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:43.530
They'll say fig is equal to that figure or date is equal to data and layout is equal to lay out the

33
00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.840
plot or figure plot Fig.

34
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.530
All right let's say that and make sure it runs correctly.

35
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:57.500
I just call my script basic thought PI and looking at my script it looks like everything I have or want

36
00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.540
is here.

37
00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.120
So now let's quickly show you how you can create this as a horizontal bar plot.

38
00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.900
So this was the solution for the vertical bar plot in order to make this horizontal what you need to

39
00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:15.560
do is reverse your X and Y and then also say orientation

40
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.130
is equal to the string h.

41
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.920
So that's how you can actually specify this to be horizontal you just say orientation equals H.

42
00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.580
Keep in mind if you only say orientation is equal to that string H.

43
00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.540
If you were to run this file again Python basic thought pi then you're going to get a weird bar plot

44
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.890
because you'll see something that looks like this.

45
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.810
Essentially you kept the same x and y axes but you whores.

46
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.690
You made everything horizontal.

47
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.840
So to fix that we need to do is essentially reverse this X and Y value.

48
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.720
So you'll say Y is now equal to the index.

49
00:03:53.910 --> 00:04:02.340
And then you can say x is equal to response so running that then you should get this correct version

50
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.230
right here.

51
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:04.190
OK.

52
00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.850
So again that's all there was to it.

53
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.570
If you have any questions feel free to post the Q&amp;A forums.

54
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.270
But definitely also check out our actual solution files for you.

55
00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.100
Thanks everyone and we'll see you at the next lecture.
