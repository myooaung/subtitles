00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:09,710
Welcome back and this lecture we're going to have a brief overview of the notes and explain how they're

2
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:13,360
structured as well as the guidebook that you get along this course.

3
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:19,000
As far as where to find these resources you can check the resource links in this lecture for the link

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,250
to the get up for the notes a zip file of the notes as well as a link for the google doc for the guidebook.

5
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:27,980
And a lot of this was also linked in your automated welcome message.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,710
Let's get started by explaining the note structure on the page and then we'll also explain how the guidebook

7
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:33,790
works.

8
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:34,060
All right.

9
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:39,400
Here we are at the hub page if you want to download this as a zip file what you can do is click on the

10
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,960
screen button where it says clone or download and then just say download it and then it will download

11
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,390
a zip version of all of this to your computer where you can then unzip it.

12
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:51,570
Or if you're familiar of a hub you can fork or clone this yourself.

13
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:56,590
The way this is organized it's just in chronological order as it's presented during the lectures.

14
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:01,360
So we can start off a like Crash Course upon this crash course and so on partly basics.

15
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:06,140
And this is basically lining up exactly how it's presented during the course lectures.

16
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:11,800
As far as the numbering scheme it's basically the first number is the order of a overall topic.

17
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:15,960
And the second number is going to be kind of a subtopic of that larger topic.

18
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:21,520
So zero here represents crash courses and then 0 1 is not pi 0 2 is painless and so on.

19
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:27,040
These actual numbers they don't relate to any numbers in the lectures or the sections on the videos

20
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:30,340
and that's really because you to me automatically read numbers everything.

21
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,410
If we add in a new lecture or section.

22
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:37,060
So that would mean we would have to come back and manually be constantly renumbering all these if we

23
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,750
ever added in more content.

24
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:41,820
So it's that you can just imagine all of this being chronological order.

25
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,160
Overall it's actually pretty self-explanatory.

26
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,990
If you go along for the course you'll just be going from the top and down.

27
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:55,020
If there's exercise folders such as exercises here usually what you'll end up seeing is an exercise

28
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,320
and then a solution file.

29
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:58,140
So X stands for exercise.

30
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,830
S L stands for solution.

31
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:04,090
And then there's an e-mail file which as you learn about poly you'll understand just what the actual

32
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,950
output is.

33
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,790
The last thing I wanted to know is for some of the more advanced topics we usually end up creating a

34
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:13,160
very large script during the video.

35
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,960
So for example if we take a look at one of the more complex topics such as control and callbacks which

36
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:25,000
state you'll notice here that I have three files callback six six eight and six B during the video.

37
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:30,960
We actually show all of this and essentially the final result is callback 6 B.

38
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,600
So that would look something like this right here callback 6.

39
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:41,560
But to not overwhelm you by providing you the final entire script a thirty four lines what we liked

40
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,460
to do is break it up into chunks.

41
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:48,470
So if you look at callbacks 6 It starts off with what we show in the video at first.

42
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,880
So we basically break it down for you step by step.

43
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,170
So we'll start off with this kind of very basic structure and then we'll keep adding on to it.

44
00:02:55,190 --> 00:03:00,490
We have callbacks 6 A and then keep adding on to that with callback 6B with more and more stuff.

45
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:05,420
So if you ever see that in the folders where you have like an A or B or Version 1 version 2 it's most

46
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,060
likely that we're just adding onto it.

47
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,750
So you can see the various steps taken during the videos.

48
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,210
Now this is further explained in the guidebook.

49
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,300
So have a python dashboard guidebook for you.

50
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:21,950
And this basically is an entire book that goes along with all the videos and all the lectures in the

51
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:22,640
course.

52
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,650
So not only do you get all the videos you also get this entire guidebook and there's a content's table

53
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:32,090
here that you can click on any of these topics such as line charts and then click on the link and it

54
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:36,630
will automatically take you to the link for line charts where we have a little bit of an explanation.

55
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:41,330
We actually tell you what the that PI script matches up with the video lecture and then some sort of

56
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,280
image for explanation.

57
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,530
We also for the more complex topics if we start scrolling down here we'll break down all these complex

58
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:51,430
topics step by step along with the videos.

59
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,850
So you have an entire book for reference here and we do special highlighting to show you what's being

60
00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:01,280
added throughout the video so you can see an explanation for callback one PI OK.

61
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:05,690
So you'll definitely want to make use of this guidebook as a resource especially when we start getting

62
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:07,470
into more complicated topics.

63
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:11,210
Again you basically just got an entire book here along with the video course.

64
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:16,610
So we really hope that you enjoy this guidebook as you go along through the course.

65
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,760
That's really all there is as far as the notes and the guidebook.

66
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:24,020
If you have any questions feel free to post the Q&amp;A forums but I really hope that you find these resources

67
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,870
helpful during your studies.

68
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,920
We'll see you at the next lecture.
