00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:12,810
Welcome back to this quick lecture on Mark and dash so dash dashboards can also display a marked down

2
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:19,080
tax indication of familiar if marked down text it allows for things like links italics bold text bootlace

3
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,660
and a lot more functionality.

4
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,490
More than just a normal string.

5
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:27,720
And if you want to quickly learn about mark down a great Web site to learn about it is common Mark dot

6
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,080
org slash help.

7
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,180
And we also link that in the guidebook.

8
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,100
So we're just going to quickly see how this works with Dasch we actually won't be typing anything out

9
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,570
in this particular lecture.

10
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,980
We're just going to show you the actual mark down that PI script that's associated with this lecture.

11
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,120
So let's check it out and see how it works.

12
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:48,030
OK so here I have opened the mark down PI file that goes along with this lecture.

13
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,410
The only things you really need to be concerned about here are basic imports.

14
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:58,320
We created the dash application and then we create a multi-line string with sets of triple quotes and

15
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,580
here's where we can put in marked down syntax so Keeshan familiar.

16
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:06,030
Again go ahead and go to common mark or slash help.

17
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:11,880
And there's a great 60 second mark on tutorial but essentially allows you to do syntax such as embedding

18
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,280
links through particular calls.

19
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,970
So for example here you can see Square braces combin mark and then you can see a web site.

20
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,420
If you come over to the actual running of this dashboard you'll see that common Mark is now an actual

21
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:25,130
link.

22
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,980
They can then click open a new tab to get help.

23
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,760
So there's links there's 60 second tutorials lots of really helpful stuff here so you can learn markdown

24
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:33,630
very quickly.

25
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:38,360
This is more just a reference for you to understand that it's available in dashboards.

26
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:41,360
So how do you actually implement this sort of thing in a dashboard.

27
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:48,060
Well from Dasch core components all you need to call is DCC the markdown and then set children equal

28
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,020
to whatever the markdown text is.

29
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:55,350
And typically you're going to be creating a variable to hold your markdown text as we've done here instead

30
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:59,060
of having to write it all inside of this markdown court component.

31
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,880
That's really all there is to this lecture.

32
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,080
If you're already familiar mark them they should have been a helpful study in how you can just insert

33
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,840
it to this core component call.

34
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:09,710
If you're not familiar mark them it's really not a big deal.

35
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,800
We won't really be using it that thoroughly throughout the rest of the Course.

36
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,800
This is more just to show you what's available.

37
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,390
Ok thanks and we'll see at the next lecture.
