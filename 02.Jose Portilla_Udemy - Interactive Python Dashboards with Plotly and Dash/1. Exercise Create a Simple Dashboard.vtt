00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:06.650
Welcome back.

2
00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:12.320
So we've just been discovering how to create dashboards with basic Dasch syntax as well as how to answer

3
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.840
a polygraph which you're already really Miller.

4
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.980
That syntax into a dash dashboard.

5
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.880
So let's test your skills with a simple dashboard exercise and this lecture will give you a little bit

6
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.770
of background for the exercise.

7
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.990
Show you an example of what the finished product should look like and then the next lecture will go

8
00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.180
over the actual solution.

9
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.490
So in case you're not familiar Old Faithful is a cold geyser located in Yellowstone National Park in

10
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.590
Wyoming United States and you can see there a picture of it.

11
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:47.330
And since 2000 it's intervals have varied from 44 to 125 minutes between eruptions.

12
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.270
So it's really interesting.

13
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.090
Is that Old Faithful is currently bi modal.

14
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.710
It has two eruptions durations.

15
00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:00.390
They're either long eruptions over four minutes or they're short eruptions two to two and a half minutes.

16
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:07.350
So the short eruptions lead to an interval of just over an hour of weight and long eruptions lead to

17
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.730
an interval of about one to one and a half hours.

18
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.460
So we're going to be plotting out that data that we already have stored for you in a scatterplot.

19
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.570
So now we understand kind of the background behind that data.

20
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.270
Let's go ahead and explore that actual exercise file a little more and then show you what the actual

21
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.630
solution should look like when you create the dashboard.

22
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.170
OK so here we are at the exercise file.

23
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.190
So again the objective here is going to be build a dashboard that imports Old Faithful that CXVII.

24
00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.240
So that's in the data directory and it's going to display a scatterplot.

25
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:47.470
So the field names inside that CACP file is D which is the date of the recordings in month and the month

26
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.970
was in August that X is a duration of the current eruption in minutes.

27
00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.840
And then why is the waiting time until the next eruption in minutes.

28
00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.270
So we're going to be doing is just following along here you'll perform imports and then launch the application

29
00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.560
create a data frame creat that Daschle out that contains that graph component.

30
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.370
Use what you know about bluntly and then eventually run this.

31
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.960
And I believe there ad server clause.

32
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.200
So let me go in and show you what the actual finished dashboard is going to look like.

33
00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.680
So you can understand how to actually use these field names.

34
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.180
All right so here we have the dashboard that you're going to be creating centrally.

35
00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.970
Just a single scatterplot here.

36
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.940
And what you're doing is on the x axis you're going to be plotting out that duration of the current

37
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:28.800
eruption.

38
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.900
So the x axis is going to be that X column and the y axis is the interval until the next eruption in

39
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:35.650
minutes.

40
00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.140
So that's going to be that y column.

41
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.850
And essentially the date of the actual recording column D you don't really need to use it for this scatterplot

42
00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.600
so it'll just be plenty X versus Y on the scatterplot.

43
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.810
So pretty straightforward.

44
00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.770
The thing that's interesting to see here is kind of these two groupings.

45
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.140
So when you have a short duration of eruption typically they travel to the next your option is not as

46
00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.660
long.

47
00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.640
And then when you have a longer interruption you have a longer interval until the next eruption.

48
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.330
So you kind of see this by motile behavior.

49
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.750
All right.

50
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.160
So if you have any questions feel free to post the Kewney forums but basically here you're just building

51
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.400
this scatterplot dashboard.

52
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.570
Best of luck and we'll see you at the next lecture.

53
00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:14.820
We go over the solutions.
