00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.630
Welcome back in the previous lecture we set up our scatterplot and we added a little bit of jitter to

2
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.700
the year column to actually see a nicer flow of that scatterplot.

3
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:22.510
Now lets enable a user to interact and then grab the data they're hovering over and use that to update

4
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.610
another graph on the dashboard.

5
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:25.730
Let's get started.

6
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.470
OK.

7
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.490
Here we are back at our text editor.

8
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.560
We've done the imports and we set up our single graph.

9
00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:37.210
Now what we're going to do is put another graph that's going to display the acceleration in order to

10
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.530
do this in a clean manner.

11
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:44.980
Let's go ahead and take our entire graph object here and stick it into its own HTL div in order to have

12
00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.820
a div for our other graph.

13
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.380
That way we can also add styling such as setting the with the 50 percent for each graph.

14
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.340
So they don't overlap with each other.

15
00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:05.120
So I will say T.M. div here and then I'm going to get my list grab everything from this graph.

16
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.860
Cut it out and then paste it into this div.

17
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:09.590
There we go.

18
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:20.350
And I'm going to write after this div do another h team l div and this is where our second plot is going

19
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.000
to go.

20
00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:27.300
So let's first start off by zooming back in and adding a little bit more to these divs.

21
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.380
So hopefully that was a nice zoom out so you could see them actually just grabbing everything from the

22
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.200
previous graph and sticking it inside of that list for the div..

23
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:44.650
So I wanted to add some style after that list bracket of that first div So the styles related to that

24
00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:45.620
div itself.

25
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:52.710
And we're going to say that style dictionary will set the with 50 percent.

26
00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:59.650
So it only takes up 50 percent of the screen and also for formatting purposes will display to be in

27
00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:00.840
line.

28
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.210
BLOCK All right so that adds a little bit style to make room for the output graph.

29
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:13.510
Now we're going to do is have a new div here and this is going to contain our acceleration output graph.

30
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.790
So I'll say DCC graph.

31
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.270
And inside of this graph object I'm going to give an ID.

32
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.710
Let's give this one mpg underscore line ID.

33
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:31.140
So this is going to be some sort of line that displays information about the car in the MPG data such

34
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:39.050
as its acceleration and then we'll set the figure to be a dictionary and we're going to do here is this

35
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.300
is essentially going to be a scatterplot.

36
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:50.760
So our data and our layouts are going to be simple scatter plots.

37
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.200
Let's zoom in a little more so we can get an idea of what we're passing in for the data.

38
00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:02.400
Remember that data is going to be a list that takes in your scatterplot call and we're going to do here

39
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:11.380
is the following I would say X equal to a list of just two points zero to one or zero and one.

40
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.240
And I'm going to then set y equal to the same points.

41
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.990
So this plot just goes from 0 1 and 0 1.

42
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:25.600
Very simple scatterplot and it's technically not going to be a scatterplot because I'm points set the

43
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.380
mode to be lines.

44
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.490
So I'm going to have a line and I'm going to change its slope based off the acceleration.

45
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:40.120
Now we're going to see how we do that in just the second from Al let's finish this out by setting up

46
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.910
our LEO.

47
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.420
We'll see.

48
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.300
Go lay out and I'm going to a title here.

49
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:54.040
This is just going to be acceleration and then I will add in one more parameter margin for the styling

50
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.350
and the stakes in a dictionary where the key can be l r t b.

51
00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.720
So that's left right top bottom.

52
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:07.060
So I'm going to say lowercase L so that the left margin and we'll set it equal to a zero margin on the

53
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.460
left hand side that way the actual acceleration plot doesn't have that much of a margin between it and

54
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.170
the scatterplot.

55
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.570
So it's a little bit closer together.

56
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.740
All right so that's the style we've laid out for this graph.

57
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.040
And then what we're going to do is be changing the pitch or slope of this particular plot that's going

58
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.420
to appear like a line and we're also going to be able to change that thickness depending on the number

59
00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:29.450
of cylinders.

60
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.240
So let's go down here to.

61
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.620
Right above if name is equal to Maine.

62
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.580
This is where we're going to create our function and our callback.

63
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:44.740
And if you have any questions on maybe some syntax here we can check out the guidebook and it kind of

64
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.250
breaks it down for you as far as the elements we're adding.

65
00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.280
And if you check our notes you'll notice that we have kind of four different versions of the script

66
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.780
that show each step being added on.

67
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:59.620
So all we did here is we took our graph stick in a div and then created another div and create another

68
00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.940
graph so for a function we're going to say the following.

69
00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:11.680
Say the F callback underscore graph and we're going to take in the hover data.

70
00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:17.510
So as a user hovers over a scatter point we want to display information about that particular car.

71
00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:23.270
So let's start off by just getting the callback set up the callback takes an output.

72
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:24.580
Let's check the IDs.

73
00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:30.500
So the output is going to go to this mpg line graph.

74
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:34.830
And what we want to add is the actual figure dictionary parameter.

75
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:45.740
So we're going to edit that figure ID and then for the input member that's a list will say input the

76
00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:46.790
ID for that one.

77
00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.360
If we come back up here that was mpg scatter.

78
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:50.500
So let's copy that.

79
00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.750
And again you can call these IDs whatever you want as long as you're consistent.

80
00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:03.690
And then we're going to accept the hover data string or property ID from that graph object then we're

81
00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.630
passing it into this graph callback.

82
00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:12.010
And the next step we need to do here is actually grab a corresponding index for the vehicle that's being

83
00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.090
hovered over.

84
00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:19.240
And the way we can do that is I will create a variable called the index that stands for vehicle index

85
00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:24.280
and we're going to use that along for data frame to actually look up information about the particular

86
00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:30.940
car being hovered over the way we would do this is if you were to grab the hover data dictionary it's

87
00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:36.710
going to have a points key to it and that contains a single list.

88
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.020
Tryna grab that first item from the list which is in itself a dictionary.

89
00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:45.360
And then there's a property in that called points index.

90
00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:51.390
And if you want you can edit this graph to just be in other HTL div and return back children.

91
00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:57.070
So you can actually then see that Jason File but will also show you later on how we can display that

92
00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.510
Jason in a marked down.

93
00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:02.920
But for now you can kind of take my word for it that if you look at that Jaisalmer file yourself just

94
00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:07.660
like we did in some earlier lectures especially on that select that data and the click data and hover

95
00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:13.900
data lectures that you get back that Jason File has a dictionary with the key points you grab the first

96
00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:18.820
item in that list and then that's another dictionary with a point index and the index is actually the

97
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:21.670
vehicle index for our data frame.

98
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:25.960
From there it actually becomes pretty easy to edit the figure.

99
00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:33.150
So what we can do here is get back a figure dictionary or start setting it up.

100
00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:36.630
This is the dictionary we're going send back to this guy right here.

101
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:40.880
This dictionary and let's make sure that we actually close off this dictionary.

102
00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:42.190
There we go.

103
00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.520
So we have our figured dictionary ready to go.

104
00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:50.840
So we set up our data or data is going to be a list and then we set up our layout

105
00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:56.380
so serves the layout because it's a little simpler.

106
00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:00.730
Zoomin couple more lines give us some more space.

107
00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:06.050
So the left will say go the layout and here we're going.

108
00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:10.560
A title so the title is the name of the car at that index position.

109
00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:18.710
So I'm going to say from my data frame I L O C and that stands for integer location and then you can

110
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:20.810
actually passen an index number.

111
00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:26.480
And in this case the index will be that number because that's the point index of the point that's being

112
00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.830
hovered over that's the index right here.

113
00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:33.200
So that brings back that entire row of information for that car.

114
00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:36.470
But in this case I'm only going that the title for the name of that car.

115
00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:39.540
So off of that data frame that's an entire row.

116
00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:44.420
I just want the name column value so that's how he set the title of that little acceleration plot.

117
00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:53.380
Then we're going to do here is make sure that margin is reset again to what we had it before.

118
00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:58.810
So that's basically this value because remember since we're going to be updating this every time someone

119
00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:05.560
hovers over these actual things like the layout style calls they need to be sent back to otherwise it'll

120
00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.310
only work the first time you see it.

121
00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:12.640
So you have this margin of L and zero so left hand side margin has zero.

122
00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:16.240
And we can even set the height here of our plot.

123
00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:21.360
So we'll set height in that layout equal to the value 300.

124
00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:23.220
Let's just set that for now.

125
00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:26.140
Well let's save something else we're going to need to do later on.

126
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.430
Is that the x axis and y axis.

127
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:31.160
But we'll set that in just a second.

128
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:36.990
What I want to do now is focus on this data list so the data list that's going to be the scatterplot

129
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:46.660
that's being passed back to this acceleration graph meaning I will say go that scatter I'll set my x

130
00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:50.020
axis values to just be zero and 1 again.

131
00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:55.880
However my y values are going to change because I actually want to change the slope of the line being

132
00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:59.320
presented based on how much of an acceleration this car has.

133
00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:04.170
So I will say it y is equal to zero.

134
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:06.350
And we're going to do a little bit of math.

135
00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:14.720
We're going to say 60 divided by DMF I ellos see the underscore index.

136
00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.800
Remember this by itself.

137
00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:18.310
I Alosi the index.

138
00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:22.340
That's just the row of that particular model car that's being hovered over.

139
00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:28.670
Then what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab the acceleration value for that car and I'm going to

140
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:31.340
say 60 divided by that.

141
00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:36.160
The reason for that is because we're not sure we're going to show the true acceleration of this car.

142
00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:41.850
Instead we're going to represent is how many seconds it takes to go from zero to 60.

143
00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:47.570
Essentially Delta velocity or miles per minute which is basically why we have this 60 here since there's

144
00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:53.560
60 Minutes in an hour and we're going from zero to 60 mph in how many seconds.

145
00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:58.430
So that's how this acceleration is going to be represented essentially showing how many seconds is it

146
00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:00.080
can it go from zero to 60.

147
00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:03.080
So the slower the acceleration the flatter the slope.

148
00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:09.270
So now we're essentially resetting our y axis to go from zero to that acceleration value.

149
00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:18.120
So the range is going to be higher for a faster or should I say higher acceleration car than the mode

150
00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:21.710
itself is still going to be lines here.

151
00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:28.710
So karma mode will still set that equal two lines OK.

152
00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:32.000
Let's save this and see what kind of plot this ends up updating.

153
00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:34.090
And then we're going to add a couple of things to this plot.

154
00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:40.120
We still need to adjust the layout specifically the x and y axis and then we also still need to adjust

155
00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:44.080
a couple of things as far as styling is concerned on the lines.

156
00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:48.910
This plot especially so we can make it thicker if it has more cylinders.

157
00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:50.300
So let's see what we have so far.

158
00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:55.310
We still need a lot to adjust but just so we are not staring at this text editor all day.

159
00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.000
Looks like I forgot to import output.

160
00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.910
So let's check that up here.

161
00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:11.560
Graph object says go let's say from dasht dot dependencies import and put an output.

162
00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:13.380
OK let's say that Trever running this again.

163
00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:16.800
Make sure we have no more errors.

164
00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:17.350
OK good.

165
00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:19.540
So let's go to our dashboard now.

166
00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:21.840
OK so this is what a dashboard looks like.

167
00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:26.250
Now notice we have mpg data and we have acceleration those right now.

168
00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:31.170
They're not on the same line and it's because we haven't set the display parameter in that style dictionary

169
00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:34.680
to be inline block that allows them to be in line with each other.

170
00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:37.870
And also we forgot to set the acceleration with Eielson those.

171
00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.700
Notice something's actually not working here.

172
00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:43.890
As I hover over my points I'm not seeing that acceleration plus change.

173
00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:49.610
And the reason for that is probably because I forgot to return the new figure object that I'm updating.

174
00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.920
Remember that function actually needs to return what it wants to update.

175
00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:55.370
So let's go back to our text editor.

176
00:12:55.410 --> 00:13:00.590
So there is here I have my finger with its data and its layout being defined by the hover data.

177
00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:03.600
However I forgot to return this new figure object.

178
00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:07.860
So it is come back down here and make sure you get the and then stationery here.

179
00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:14.130
But essentially are going to return this figure dictionary to be inserted to the figure of the MPG line

180
00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:14.900
graph right here.

181
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:17.320
So we're going to overwrite what's shown here.

182
00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:23.660
Let's save this restart our dashboard and then later on we can come back and edit some stylings.

183
00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:24.090
OK.

184
00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:25.120
Back at the dashboard.

185
00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:28.740
Now as I hover over this you can see the acceleration start to change.

186
00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:32.550
Specifically you can see the y axis bars.

187
00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:38.600
Hopefully it's clear on your screen but you can see the scale of my y axis is actually starting to change.

188
00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:42.220
The line stays the same but the y axis scale is changing.

189
00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:48.180
So I would like to do is actually edit the Y-axis range so that you can see it more clearly in the actual

190
00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:53.730
pitch because right now technically you're just seeing the same pitch line but the access that is being

191
00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:55.770
shown on changes for faster cars.

192
00:13:55.890 --> 00:14:01.800
So let's edit that by changing the Y-axis dictionary specifically the range parameter.

193
00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.810
So I'm going to close this going to come back here.

194
00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.870
Let's stop our dashboard for now.

195
00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:10.070
And there was a couple of things we want to change.

196
00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:14.380
The first one is let's go ahead and take care of that styling on the acceleration graph.

197
00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:22.250
So the styling that's going to go for this Divx we'll say style is equal to.

198
00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:27.830
And let's set the width to be just let's say 20 percent here.

199
00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:32.980
And we also set the height to be a little shorter.

200
00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.530
Let's set the height to be 50 percent.

201
00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:45.500
And finally let's say the splay inline block that way it actually shows up on the same line as this

202
00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:46.470
other graph.

203
00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:48.720
So that takes care of some of the styling issues.

204
00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:52.980
However we still need to take care of that Y-axis not changing and that one is going to be a little

205
00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:56.180
more complicated and it goes inside of this layout call.

206
00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:03.680
So we set our margin and we set our height defaults what we need to do is really anywhere here will

207
00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:13.380
need to reset our x axis and I'm going to not have it visible because technically those units aren't

208
00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:15.300
really going to match up.

209
00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:21.120
So I'll say visible is false by default visible is true that we're going to set it to false and then

210
00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:23.450
y axis.

211
00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:32.180
I will also say it's too invisible so say visible is false but what I'm going to do is change the range

212
00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:38.030
of the y axis that way instead of seeing those grid lines change as you hover over points you actually

213
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:48.760
see the line itself change and for this we're going say go from zero to whatever the let's say 60 divided

214
00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:58.620
by DSF acceleration value what that minimum acceleration value is there we go.

215
00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:03.620
So now let's save this and let's try running this figure again.

216
00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:10.600
See Python basic but PI and let me make sure that I'm getting errors margin looks like I'm forgetting

217
00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.700
a comma right after this.

218
00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:14.780
OK let's save that.

219
00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.150
Run it again OK.

220
00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.540
Let's go to our dashboard.

221
00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:20.410
OK here's our dashboard now.

222
00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:25.530
You'll notice that the x axis is actually still visible because technically it won't get visible is

223
00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:27.850
false until I hover over something.

224
00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:32.380
So then once I hover over something I should see all those layout changes take effect.

225
00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:36.210
And if you want you could take some of those layout changes and set them on that initial default where

226
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:38.770
you don't get such a drastic change on your first hover over.

227
00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:41.660
But now we're actually seeing that line shift.

228
00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:46.990
So you notice the slope of the line is changing as I hover over particular vehicles.

229
00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:50.950
Now what I want to do and will do this in part three of the lecture will change the thickness of the

230
00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:54.190
line to be related to the actual number of cylinders.

231
00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:59.020
And then we'll also add a little bit of markdown techs down here so we can see the well a little more

232
00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:01.490
information about the number cylinders and the acceleration.

233
00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:02.180
OK.

234
00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:07.750
So right now we are successfully able to create the changing slope based of the acceleration of the

235
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:08.160
car.

236
00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:13.420
And you can check the guidebook for a full formula as far as what's going on here with this 60 divided

237
00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:15.290
by acceleration value.

238
00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:17.200
It's nicely laid out in the guide book.

239
00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:21.640
It's a little hard for me to type it out here for you but we haven't in the guidebook as far as how

240
00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.820
we're actually calculating the acceleration value.

241
00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:28.230
So this 60 divided by acceleration helps make a little more sense.

242
00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:33.910
OK we'll see you through the lecture where we edit the thickness of that line and then we also add that

243
00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:35.400
mark down information.

244
00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:35.880
See there.
