00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.580
Welcome back everyone in this lecture we're going to have a brief overview and discussion of plotless

2
00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.550
dash and that of his late zation for Python.

3
00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.200
So our main goals for this lecture is just to get some context and understanding of what visualization

4
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.660
libraries already exist for Python and then to understand what plotline is and when to use it and also

5
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.420
understand what Dasch is how it's different and partly and when to use Dasch by itself.

6
00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:29.960
So let's get started by answering the question.

7
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.400
What libraries already exist to visualize data with Python.

8
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.620
Now there's actually a ton of visualization libraries are we're not going to go through all of them

9
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:37.160
here.

10
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.450
We're just going to go through some main ones that have some characteristics similar to politely and

11
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.490
the very first library that we discuss is map plot live.

12
00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.030
This is kind of the grandfather of all the data visualization libraries for Python.

13
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.570
And it was modeled after Matlab and other programming language.

14
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.980
Matt leps own plotting capabilities the creator of map plot lib.

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.310
One of those plotting capabilities for Python.

16
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:05.000
So a lot of its syntax and characteristics stem from the language of Matlab and what map plot lib is

17
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.670
good for is to create static image files.

18
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.920
That is something like a j peg or pian g file something that doesn't really change once it's already

19
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:13.750
been created.

20
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.010
And what's nice about that polyp is even though has a bit of a complex syntax to learn.

21
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.690
It allows you to create almost any plot type gives you a ton of flexibility and it comes a little bit

22
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:30.410
at the cost of having to learn this kind of tricky syntax because it stems from matlab that you live.

23
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.430
It's going to be for static image files.

24
00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.070
And then another really common visualisation library to learn with Python is called Seaborn and C-One

25
00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.830
actually uses map lib on the back end and what it does it's really designed to create nice looking statistical

26
00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:45.390
plots.

27
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.930
And again these are static plots.

28
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.040
These are interactive plots.

29
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:55.630
However seaborne has some cleaner syntax and you can do really nice plots and just a single line of

30
00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.560
code but you can only create the statistical plots that are available in the documentation.

31
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.630
If you want to go to different plot types that see more and those that support you'll have to go back

32
00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.820
and start using Map Cutlip again because seaborne is basically built on top of that live as kind of

33
00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.540
almost like a nice API for some statistical visualizations.

34
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.490
That we can move on to pandas.

35
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.980
Now the main purpose of Panchos is actually data analysis but just like many other libraries in python

36
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.620
we see a common theme here.

37
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.480
Panas uses map Cutlip on the backend through a simple dot plot call you can call off a Panas data frame

38
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.430
and there's a limited scope of the plot types.

39
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.220
You can do here.

40
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.970
But again are static plots and you can do them with one single line of code with Panas but all the plots

41
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.830
you've seen so far are static that is once you generate the image file you can't interact with in any

42
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:43.260
way.

43
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.300
It's basically like creating a chip jpeg or a PMG file.

44
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:53.270
Now let's shift our discussion to answering the question what is Plumley and bluntly that term can cause

45
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.050
confusion sometimes because plotless is both a company and an open source library.

46
00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.550
So let's differentiate those two for a second.

47
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.960
Partly the company is a company focused on data visualization for business intelligence and they do

48
00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:11.540
things such as reporting dashboards and hosting business intelligence visualization solutions.

49
00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:12.770
So that's the company.

50
00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.920
But that company released an open source library by the same name.

51
00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.290
It's also called plot Polly and plotless the open source library.

52
00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.540
As a general data visualization library focused on interactive visualizations in public is actually

53
00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.480
not just unique to Python it has libraries for javascript re-act are in Python.

54
00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:39.500
It just happens to be that the most popular version of this plotline library is for Python so how is

55
00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.510
plot Platini the Open-Source library different than things like that plot lib or seaborne and the way

56
00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:50.600
it's different is because using the motley Python library by itself creates interactive plots as HVM

57
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.240
l files.

58
00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.440
So these aren't exactly static plots.

59
00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.580
You can actually do things like zoom in select and hover.

60
00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:02.180
So keep in mind that while users can still interact with these new plot leape plots that are HTL files

61
00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.430
these plots themselves can't really be connected to changing data sources.

62
00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.930
Which is where we need something like that.

63
00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:15.350
So when partly once the interactive plot the plot is generated that data that the plot represents is

64
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.570
essentially going to be locked in to the export of State of the plot.

65
00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:22.680
And you would need to somehow rerun that PI script in order to regenerate that.

66
00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.890
Each time L5 to see any updates and constantly having to rerun that Paice scripts that's not really

67
00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.650
what we want or thinking about dashboards.

68
00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:36.650
So plotline by itself is really great when you just want some nice little interactive image that you

69
00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.500
know that datasource behind that is going to be static and not changing.

70
00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.520
So let's discuss the other option when we actually want something like a dashboard that will be able

71
00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.190
to update and manipulate and interact with.

72
00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:54.800
So often like I was just mentioning users want plots to be able to interact with each other interactive

73
00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.440
components or have the plots up in real time and to accomplish this level of tasks we need some sort

74
00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.200
of a dashboard which is a step beyond what normal plot can provide for us.

75
00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:12.020
So dash is an open source library from the plot the company that allows you to create the full dashboard

76
00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.360
with multiple components interactivity and multiple plots.

77
00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.980
And that's really the main focus of this course.

78
00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:25.450
We're going to start off by learning about plot lead and then shift into really diving deep in-dash.

79
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:31.200
So instead of creating HVM all file like plot leave the open source library would have done dash will

80
00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:37.260
produce a dashboard web application that ends up being open at a local Yoro and then you can visit and

81
00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.160
interact with that dashboard in the web application.

82
00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:46.500
So instead of just a simple HVM file being exported we actually get a full blown web app as our dashboard

83
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.870
where we're using the dash library.

84
00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:54.980
Now since that renders a full web app you can then actually deploy dashboards online for other people

85
00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.020
to use.

86
00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:02.270
So in conclusion Python has many visualization libraries including many static initialization libraries

87
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.580
and there's a lot more libraries that we didn't have time to mention for this particular lecture.

88
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:12.230
But when you want to go beyond the static visualization you then have that plot the open source library

89
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.430
which can create interactive images.

90
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:19.340
And when you want to go a step further and have the actual data source be changing or have interactive

91
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.910
components things like sliders or picking dates.

92
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:26.650
Then you can use dash and dash is going to create a dashboard web application.

93
00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:31.710
They'll actually be able to see in your browser or deploy online for others to use.

94
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:34.710
Now it's a big jump just to go straight into cash.

95
00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:39.870
So what we're going to first do is get really comfortable with plot leave that open source library.

96
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:42.850
We're going to learn how to create lots of different plot types with it.

97
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:48.200
And then once we feel really comfortable of Lee we'll go ahead and do a deeper dive into dash and creating

98
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.370
dashboards.

99
00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:49.790
All right.

100
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:52.120
I'm really excited to get started of the technical concepts.

101
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.020
So we'll see you at the next lecture.
