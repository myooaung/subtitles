00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:06,640
Welcome back.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,860
In part five of this milestone project we're going to use callback with state in order to add a submit

3
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:15,490
button that we can then click when we want our plot update.

4
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,740
Let's head over to our text editor and get started.

5
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:19,470
All right here we are back at our file.

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:25,360
We need to make sure to do is from dashed out dependencies also import state which you may have done

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:25,760
already.

8
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:30,280
Or in just case you haven't McCreevy imported it then we're going to do is we're going to add a button

9
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:32,910
element and we're going to do that inside it's own div.

10
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:39,100
So remember we have this div with H-3 and input later on I'll change that to be a dropdown but continuing

11
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:43,420
on that you have H-3 and date picker with its own style.

12
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:50,650
What we'll do is after that H team L that second one the second div I'm going say H team l div here

13
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:57,000
and then add one on my own and it's just going to contain an H team I'll button inside of it.

14
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,310
So let's set that up.

15
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:09,690
Zoom in inside this div I'm going to call h t m l dot button and let's give this ID of Submit button

16
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:18,520
we'll say and clicks is equal to zero.

17
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:29,160
All say children is equal to submit and we can give it its own style dictionary here.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,270
Such as editing the font size to match up with what we have for some of the other components and to

19
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:44,080
give it a little bit of space we'll see margin left and we'll that to 30 pixels.

20
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:49,910
Now that we have our button set up we're going to do is also set the div to be have some styling basically

21
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:51,350
just inline block.

22
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:52,970
So I'll say style here.

23
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:57,450
Display to inline block

24
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:05,330
that way that button is right next to that picker as well as that input lock.

25
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:06,830
So we set up our style.

26
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,780
We set up that div.

27
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,850
Now it's time to edit the state.

28
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,290
So come back down here.

29
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,290
So right now if you look at our callback we have three inputs the value start and end dates.

30
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:21,390
However we don't actually want to process these until we click on that button.

31
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:25,200
So instead we're going to change these from being inputs to being state calls.

32
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:30,390
So all three of these are properties and component IDS will stay the same but we're going to change

33
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:40,530
them to be states then then after output I'm going to add in an input call here inside of its list

34
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,980
put a comma there and then.

35
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:50,150
Here is where we're going to call submit button ID.

36
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,890
And then just take in and clicks

37
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,410
so we'll save that.

38
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:03,810
Basically we're doing is keep the value start and end date registered in that state but don't actually

39
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:09,230
send it to update graph until we input or click on that submit button and then we'll need to do here

40
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:13,370
is we have to make sure these are all going into the same order and of clicks values start.

41
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,120
And they so value here that stock ticker start and they line up here.

42
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:21,090
But that input button and clicks that's going to be sent first.

43
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:22,710
So we need to provide.

44
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:25,500
And click here.

45
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:26,260
All right so then we have.

46
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,260
And clicks are going to pass that into the output function.

47
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,690
Save that and that should be all we need to do here.

48
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:36,290
So let's restart our dashboard make sure we didn't have any typos here.

49
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,110
All right.

50
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,920
Perfect.

51
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:38,830
So it looks like it's running.

52
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,220
Let's check that it's working.

53
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,530
I'm back at my dashboard.

54
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:47,830
I'm going to try editing the stock symbol as well as the dates just to make sure nothing is being updated.

55
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,560
OK so it looks like it's not being updated.

56
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:53,210
Let's check if I hit submit now that it is being updated.

57
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,560
So it's a myth and there we go.

58
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,600
It does update.

59
00:03:55,610 --> 00:04:01,580
Notice how since I chose a various are quite a short time line I don't have as many markers here but

60
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:07,250
if I choose a much longer time line and then put this one further into the future and hit submit then

61
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,540
I get the Slyne plot.

62
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:09,230
OK.

63
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:14,180
So it looks like we're able to successfully add and they submit button and then edit the stock symbol

64
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:19,760
and the start end dates to then be part of the state instead of directly part of the input for the last

65
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,630
part of this series of lectures.

66
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:26,810
We're going to do is change this input to be a drop down and we're going to connect it to a C as we

67
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,960
file of NASDAQ listed companies.

68
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:32,060
That way we can actually select multiple stocks at the same time.

69
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,140
We'll see what the next lecture.
