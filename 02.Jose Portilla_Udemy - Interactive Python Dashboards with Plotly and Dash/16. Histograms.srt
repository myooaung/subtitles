00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:06,850
Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:12,990
And this lecture we're going to be talking about histograms a histogram displays an accurate representation

3
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:18,360
of the overall distribution of a continuous feature in order to create a histogram what we end up doing

4
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:25,100
is we divide that entire range of values of the continuous feature into a series of intervals and these

5
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,750
series of intervals are known as Binz.

6
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:33,290
We then count the number of occurrences per been basically per interval range and then we can change

7
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:33,990
the bin size.

8
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,000
Either get more or less detail.

9
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,870
So let's actually give you some examples of what this looks like visually.

10
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:44,990
So here we're looking at the same data as before the mpg that see every file.

11
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:49,910
And what we're doing is we're just plotting out the distribution of a single continuous variable.

12
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:53,210
So in this case we're just planning out mpg of vehicles histogram.

13
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,990
So this is taking a single column of data in on the x axis.

14
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:02,620
We see the miles per gallon range and on the y axis that's the actual count of vehicles that fall in

15
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:03,760
between that range.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,640
For example if you look all the way to that bottom left here we can see that Ben whose interval range

17
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:14,710
goes between 0 and 10 and it looks like our count on the y axis is just one.

18
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:20,100
And what that means is there is only one car that had an MPG between 0 and 10.

19
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:25,720
And as you go further into the right of the histogram along the x axis we can see that we have higher

20
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:33,620
council vehicles during the 1970s that had a mpg of 15 or 20 or 25 somewhere in those ranges.

21
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:38,290
And then as we get higher and higher in the value of miles per gallon we get lower and lower counts

22
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:44,350
on our y axis until we only really have one vehicle that has a miles per gallon of greater than 45 miles

23
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,340
per gallon.

24
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:51,010
Now something we can do here depending if we want finer detail or more broad analysis is to actually

25
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:57,280
change the interval range so we can make those bends wider or narrower.

26
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:03,410
For example if we increase the size that is to say if we make that interval range wider than we're actually

27
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:06,060
decreasing the total number of bends.

28
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:09,380
So increasing the size means make the bends wider.

29
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:15,080
So now that very first been on the left instead of just going from zero to 10 it now goes from zero

30
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,680
to 15 miles per gallon.

31
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:19,680
So they're going to be a lot more vehicles that fall inside that bin.

32
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:25,810
But in doing so increasing in that bin size range we've decreased the total number of bins on the histogram.

33
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:31,040
And in fact you can see quite clearly here that it looks there's only one two three four five six seven

34
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,380
bins total.

35
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:36,960
Now if you want more detail you could do is decrease the interval range.

36
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:42,710
So if you decrease the bin size then in total there's going to be a lot more bins in your data set.

37
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,010
So you get a little bit more detail here.

38
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:50,150
Now there is a problem with just decrease in the bin size smaller and smaller because sometimes you're

39
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,380
going to want to see a lot of detail.

40
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:56,960
But if you go too far in this direction what happens is if you look all the way to the right you're

41
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:01,520
going to have gaps where there are no counts which is sometimes not super useful.

42
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:06,160
So you'll notice kind of in between 40 mpg and 45 mpg.

43
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:11,210
There's essentially just a blank bin and that means there were zero counts for that particular interval

44
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:12,090
range.

45
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:12,890
OK.

46
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:16,180
So you're going to want to be careful when choosing a correct bin size.

47
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,720
A lot of times these defaults are going to work fine.

48
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,440
So just keep that in mind.

49
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:20,660
All right.

50
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,140
Here we are.

51
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:24,290
Our text editor I've gone ahead an important plot line off line.

52
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:27,550
Polygraph objects and pandas PD for a little warm up.

53
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,630
We're just going to plot a histogram of that MPG data set.

54
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,390
So do this.

55
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:38,930
We're going to read in our dataset we have read CSP because it's a CSP file and then we'll say data

56
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,220
slash mpg.

57
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:50,570
And then here will create our data list and we'll say go histogram and for histogram we just need one

58
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:51,820
continuous feature.

59
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:56,950
So in this case we'll say x is equal to mpg.

60
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:02,530
Remember that if you're trying to do the similar thing for a categorical feature you want a bar chart

61
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:08,640
not a histogram histograms or for a continuous feature analysis then what we are going to do here is

62
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,290
say Puno plot and let's plot out our data.

63
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:18,270
So in case you want a Leo let's go ahead to do that as well so we can give this a title will say go

64
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:30,830
lay out I'll say title is equal to histogram and then let's say fig is to go that figure El Paso.

65
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:36,030
That is all data and layout equals wups way out.

66
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,410
And now I'm just going to plot out that figure.

67
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:40,690
OK.

68
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:45,330
Save that and let's say Python and in my case I'm calling it basic about pi.

69
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:47,990
And then we'll get a little HTL file here that we can play around with.

70
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,440
So we have this nice plot file and what's nice is you can actually see the counts.

71
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:56,370
So you don't need to line up your eyes carefully which is really hard to do especially over here on

72
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:57,390
the right hand side.

73
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,990
It's hard to tell what actual value is based off the y axis all the way on the left hand side but with

74
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:06,410
partly as you hover over it gives you that nice little count of the actual size of that been.

75
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:06,960
Oh it's nice.

76
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,190
Also reports back the range of the men on the x axis.

77
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,400
So you can see here as they hover over along the bottom of the x axis.

78
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:18,050
It's telling you that actual interval range that this bin is representing.

79
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:18,310
OK.

80
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:19,990
So we have this very basic histogram.

81
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,410
Let's go ahead and expand on this idea now.

82
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:22,770
All right.

83
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:27,580
So usually where are you going to be editing with a histogram is the actual size of those bins.

84
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,930
And there's several options here.

85
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:34,830
But first what you're going to do is inside this go the histogram call you will say X Beenz is equal

86
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:37,020
to the ICC.

87
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,590
So we'll call that dictionary and there's a couple of arguments we can provide here.

88
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:45,530
We can actually provide a start and an end range for a histogram.

89
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:51,900
So let's imagine that we had millions of cars in this dataset for whatever reason and we had some experimental

90
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,120
cars that had like 200 miles per gallon.

91
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:59,460
And for whatever reason that wasn't actually useful to us what we could do is say or only show me cars

92
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:05,040
from 0 miles per gallon to 25 miles per gallon and that we are not displaying the histogram for your

93
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,990
entire dataset.

94
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,410
If that's not useful to you or you could say Give me from zero to 50 mpg.

95
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,580
So sometimes that's what you're going to want to be able to do.

96
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,270
So you have to start an end in order to do that.

97
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:20,150
If you just want to do the entire dataset you could just say start is equal to the minimum value and

98
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,740
end physical to the max value or zero to the max value whatever you feel most comfortable doing here.

99
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,300
Remember each situation is going to be slightly different.

100
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:31,870
Now the most important one here is the actual size parameter.

101
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:36,350
So what you're going to do here is you will say the size of the actual bin you want.

102
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:42,830
For example if I say size is equal to 10 than each bin is going to represent a range of 10 mpg.

103
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:48,750
So we'll have the number of cars MPG from 0 to 10 10 to 20 20 30 and so on.

104
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:53,240
Let's go ahead and run this so we can see what it looks like price on base up high.

105
00:06:53,610 --> 00:07:00,800
And now when I bring this over I can see here the actual bins represent the range of 0 to 10 mpg 10

106
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:04,560
to 20 20 30 30 40 40 50.

107
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,310
So right off the bat I can see that the majority of cars are between 20 and 40 miles per gallon.

108
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:13,980
So that's what's nice about having these really wide been values what's not so nice here is I don't

109
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:18,120
have a lot of detail for more refined characteristics in the MPG.

110
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:23,550
If I wanted that detail all I would need to do is change the size to a smaller bin size for example

111
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:26,840
give me range interval ranges of two miles per gallon.

112
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:32,310
So now when I run this you see an increased number of bends and the size is going to be smaller.

113
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:36,210
So it's going to be a little finer here and we can see we get something that's actually pretty close

114
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:37,250
to the default.

115
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:37,980
All right.

116
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:41,370
So that's how you can edit the bin size for your data sets.

117
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:41,710
All right.

118
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:46,810
And that's really the very basics of histograms since it's quite a pretty straightforward plot.

119
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:52,110
We're going to do next is discuss the distribution plot which is a very similar plot except that adds

120
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:55,750
in another layer of information on top of a histogram.

121
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,210
We'll talk about it in the next lecture.
