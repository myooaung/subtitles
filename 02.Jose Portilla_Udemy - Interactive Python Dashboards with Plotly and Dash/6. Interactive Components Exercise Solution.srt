1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,510
Welcome back.

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:10,930
Let's go ahead and work out an example solution for the interactive components exercise.

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,380
We'll head over toward text editor.

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,650
Now let's get started.

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:18,840
By performing the imports we know we're going to need cash to create or dash replication and we're going

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,510
to have core components as well as h team components.

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:29,260
So we'll import dash core components as DCC loops as the CC.

8
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:40,740
And then we will also import dash HVM components as each team will then from dash dot dependencies we

9
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:47,750
will import input and output.

10
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,670
OK so then we'll create our application.

11
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:55,410
So that's launching the application app equal to dash dash.

12
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:02,620
And then we need to set up the layout so we will call app lay out and let's create a couple lines here

13
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:06,830
and then zoom in a little bit so we can get a clearer idea.

14
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,030
So we have our aptly our first things first.

15
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:15,580
We create that outermost Div. and we're going to create two objects and here will create a range slider

16
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:23,200
as well as another div or an H1 so say DCC let's put this on a new line.

17
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:29,990
So the first component is DCC dashboard component and we're going to use a range slider and hopefully

18
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,800
you're able to get this from documentation.

19
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,950
And the second component is really up to you.

20
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,590
It's going to be the output component.

21
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:43,010
So it can be another div or it can be another something more specific like H-1.

22
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:47,550
We're going to use HTL dot H-1 to make a header.

23
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:48,920
It could have also been div..

24
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,510
Either one is totally fine.

25
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,880
Again you have a lot of flexibility here.

26
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:57,310
So we're going to say H-1 there as our output let's get these IDs.

27
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,100
So we don't get confused.

28
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:07,880
So the range slider will get this idea of just range slider and will say this has an ID of the product

29
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,760
because remember we're going to be multiplying the two numbers together.

30
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,310
Otherwise known as the product of two numbers.

31
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,140
So that's all we need to do for that matter.

32
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,750
So basically you're going to report back whatever that output is for the range Schlyter.

33
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,550
We're going to give it a couple more options.

34
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,830
You have a lot of leeway here as far as what minimum values to choose.

35
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:31,160
Let's say it will go from minimum to negative 10 and we'll say Max we'll have it go to 10 which means

36
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:37,100
because indexing starts at zero we have to actually say Max is 11 so that when you see the actual range

37
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,030
Schlyter it will go from negative 10 to positive 10.

38
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,180
So keep that in mind when you're working out of range Schlyter and probably one of the hardest parts

39
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,310
of setting this up is the mark's parameter.

40
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,370
So this marks parameter.

41
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:54,380
If you check it out in the documentation you need to create a dictionary so you could then if a for

42
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,860
loop or with a dictionary comprehension.

43
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,010
So we'll show you how to do if a dictionary comprehension.

44
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:08,180
We're going to say I colon string I for I in range.

45
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:14,360
And we're going to go from negative 10 to 11 here.

46
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,440
OK so that's how we can create the marks.

47
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,860
Again you could have done this for a for loop.

48
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,690
Lots of different ways to create this.

49
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:25,040
And finally let's go ahead and give it some values to start off with.

50
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,380
We'll say that the marks start.

51
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,870
Excuse me the initial values.

52
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,250
It takes it in as a list.

53
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,300
We need one for the men and one for the max.

54
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:38,660
Essentially one on the left side one on the right hand side will go from negative one to one as our

55
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,940
starting values.

56
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,310
All right.

57
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:44,670
So this one this one part of the marks is probably the trickiest part.

58
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,300
You could miss a variety of ways.

59
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:52,870
Maybe a for loop so you could say for I in range from negative 10 to 11 and then you would have constructed

60
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:56,790
this dictionary by adding more keys and values to it.

61
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,070
So we have our general lay out.

62
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:03,590
Let's create our value function.

63
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,970
Our value function.

64
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,710
It's going to take in a list of values.

65
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:10,160
Again the range Schlyter returns a list of values.

66
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,850
The one on the left hand side and the one on the right hand side.

67
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,970
So that's our value list.

68
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:22,290
We're going to want to return the first value of the list so we can index that 0 and we're going to

69
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:27,450
multiply it by the second value in that list will say a value list index 1.

70
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:31,880
Again one of the trickier parts because you had a look at the documentation realize that the range player

71
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,480
returns back this list.

72
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,220
So you grab the first item in that list.

73
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,150
The second item multiply it and there is a product.

74
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:44,660
Now all that's left is to connect this to the IDs in order to successfully grab these with the callback.

75
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:50,630
So the app called back will start with the output.

76
00:04:50,690 --> 00:05:01,170
The output should be the product in the H1 and then it's going to be children just like it was for Divx.

77
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:07,940
So that's just the normal text that goes into each time component and then the input remember it goes

78
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,080
inside of a list.

79
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,320
Here we just have a single input.

80
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:18,190
The idea for this one we decided it would be a range slider and then we want to insert or basically

81
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:22,360
grab the value so that list and that's all we had to do.

82
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,440
And then finally we finish it off with if name is equal to mean.

83
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:30,420
So the app runs server will save this.

84
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,180
And let's take a quick look at what we just did.

85
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:39,740
We did all our imports we create her application then we set up our application lay out application

86
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:44,870
layer has two main components a core component with this range slider and then some time component to

87
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,830
show the output.

88
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:50,780
You had a lot of flexibility here could have been H-1 Divx slug's give it an ID and then remember that

89
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:55,270
children is the actual property you want to edit here for the range slider.

90
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,110
You can set up any M.R. any Max you want.

91
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,140
Mark's this is actually even optional.

92
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:04,790
You could technically not have any marks there and just see an empty slider with no marks but it would

93
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:05,720
still work.

94
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,190
And then you have a value.

95
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:12,520
This is a default value one for the left hand side and one for the right hand side on that range slider.

96
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,640
OK so let's save this.

97
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:20,040
Run it and make sure it all worked out well say Python basic but apply enter let expand this to make

98
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,700
sure it's running.

99
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:24,050
OK I'm going to go to my online dashboard and see if it all worked out.

100
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,530
OK here I am at my dashboard so let's say negative six times four.

101
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,380
So that equals negative 24.

102
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,330
It looks like it's working.

103
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,300
So I'll say that 10 times negative five.

104
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,360
That's 50.

105
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,070
Perfect.

106
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,000
So it looks like a range slider is working just fine.

107
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:46,530
And looking back at this I think something I just realized that we may have done incorrectly.

108
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,350
Is this can actually go up to 11 because I set the max at 11 but I didn't take that into account when

109
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:56,880
creating the marks so I can either adjust the max or the markings.

110
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,940
Let's go ahead and just the max value so I'll set the max value to 10.

111
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,600
That was my mistake let's go ahead and go back and fix that.

112
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,770
So back here on points set the max as 10.

113
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:13,510
And the reason it's 11 here is because range goes up to but not including this last number.

114
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,540
So that was a mistake on my part.

115
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,800
Let's fix that.

116
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:20,310
Pythonesque that pi had back and there we go.

117
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,350
Now we see the market only go up to 10.

118
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,740
So my apologies for that kind of slight typo.

119
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,470
You can check out the documentation the guy had but for more details.

120
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:34,440
But again min and max that defines what the actual min and max for that range slider is for the marks

121
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,750
that defines the actual markings we see here those numbers that we see.

122
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:43,800
So if your marks are different than your min and max value you'll still see the range slider hit your

123
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,800
min and max values.

124
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:48,010
There just won't be markings there for them OK.

125
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,430
That's really all there was to this dashboard.

126
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:55,010
If you have any questions feel free to post the Q&amp;A forms and make sure to check out the guidebook as

127
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,850
well as our provided solution code.

128
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,540
Again I just want to stress lots of different ways you could get done this.

129
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,960
So feel free to share your alternatives in the CUNY forums.

130
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,310
We'll see you at the next lecture.
