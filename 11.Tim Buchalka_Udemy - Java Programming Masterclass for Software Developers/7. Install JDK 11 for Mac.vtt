00:00:05.150  -->  00:00:05.983
<v Narrator>So in this video</v>
2

2

00:00:05.983  -->  00:00:07.100
we're gonna download and instal
3

3

00:00:07.100  -->  00:00:10.250
Amazon Corretto for the Mac platform.
4

4

00:00:10.250  -->  00:00:12.770
Amazon Corretto is the JDK version 11
5

5

00:00:12.770  -->  00:00:14.490
that we're gonna be using in this course.
6

6

00:00:14.490  -->  00:00:16.350
And there's a video in this section of the course
7

7

00:00:16.350  -->  00:00:18.332
that talks about the reasoning behind this particular
8

8

00:00:18.332  -->  00:00:20.799
version of the JDK, if you're interested.
9

9

00:00:20.799  -->  00:00:23.872
All right, so first we're gonna do a search for Amazon
10

10

00:00:23.872  -->  00:00:24.811
Corretto.
11

11

00:00:24.811  -->  00:00:26.720
C-O-R-R-E-T-T-O
12

12

00:00:27.660  -->  00:00:28.700
And we're gonna just click on the link
13

13

00:00:28.700  -->  00:00:29.903
to go to the page.
14

14

00:00:31.430  -->  00:00:32.700
Come over and select...
15

15

00:00:32.700  -->  00:00:34.840
Click on download Amazon Corretto 11.
16

16

00:00:34.840  -->  00:00:36.370
Because we wanna use version 11
17

17

00:00:36.370  -->  00:00:38.091
of the JDK.
18

18

00:00:38.091  -->  00:00:40.490
And then we're gonna scroll down for the Mac version .
19

19

00:00:40.490  -->  00:00:42.463
And we're gonna go ahead and download that.
20

20

00:00:45.280  -->  00:00:46.950
I'll save that.
21

21

00:00:46.950  -->  00:00:48.290
Leave it a moment to complete.
22

22

00:00:48.290  -->  00:00:49.500
Once it's completed we'll go through
23

23

00:00:49.500  -->  00:00:50.923
the installation process.
24

24

00:00:53.010  -->  00:00:54.900
All right, so I'm gonna click on the downloaded file
25

25

00:00:54.900  -->  00:00:55.970
now that it's finished downloading,
26

26

00:00:55.970  -->  00:00:57.680
which starts the installer.
27

27

00:00:57.680  -->  00:00:58.880
I'm closing the browser.
28

28

00:00:59.920  -->  00:01:01.650
And the installation's pretty simple.
29

29

00:01:01.650  -->  00:01:02.751
Click on continue.
30

30

00:01:02.751  -->  00:01:04.230
Click on instal.
31

31

00:01:04.230  -->  00:01:05.724
Type your password.
32

32

00:01:05.724  -->  00:01:08.297
(types)
33

33

00:01:08.297  -->  00:01:09.140
(confirmation chime)
34

34

00:01:09.140  -->  00:01:12.090
And you can see it was quite a quick process.
35

35

00:01:12.090  -->  00:01:14.130
I'm going to select the option after clicking close
36

36

00:01:14.130  -->  00:01:15.180
to move to bin.
37

37

00:01:15.180  -->  00:01:17.490
Because we no longer need the downloaded files.
38

38

00:01:17.490  -->  00:01:21.760
Now I'm gonna do Control + Space and type terminal.
39

39

00:01:21.760  -->  00:01:22.593
Press Enter.
40

40

00:01:22.593  -->  00:01:24.200
I'm going to type Java + Space
41

41

00:01:25.950  -->  00:01:26.913
Dash + version.
42

42

00:01:28.120  -->  00:01:29.590
And what we're looking for is
43

43

00:01:29.590  -->  00:01:33.440
It says open Open JDK 64-Bit Server VM Corretto-11.
44

44

00:01:33.440  -->  00:01:36.280
So the 11 there stands for JDK version 11.
45

45

00:01:36.280  -->  00:01:37.250
So that's good.
46

46

00:01:37.250  -->  00:01:40.180
We can see that it's all installed successfully.
47

47

00:01:40.180  -->  00:01:41.370
Now one last thing we need to do
48

48

00:01:41.370  -->  00:01:43.860
is just open a finder window.
49

49

00:01:43.860  -->  00:01:45.460
All right so after clicking that actually
50

50

00:01:45.460  -->  00:01:46.790
we'll go back to main.
51

51

00:01:46.790  -->  00:01:47.820
This is the main disc.
52

52

00:01:47.820  -->  00:01:49.550
And we're gonna go into the library folder.
53

53

00:01:49.550  -->  00:01:50.990
This is where the installation's going to be.
54

54

00:01:50.990  -->  00:01:52.093
Come down to Java.
55

55

00:01:53.200  -->  00:01:55.760
And under Java virtual machines.
56

56

00:01:55.760  -->  00:01:57.610
All right, so that's the location.
57

57

00:01:57.610  -->  00:01:58.660
On our computer.
58

58

00:01:58.660  -->  00:02:01.740
The main disc, Library, Java, Java virtual machines
59

59

00:02:01.740  -->  00:02:03.570
and then Amazon Corretto.
60

60

00:02:03.570  -->  00:02:04.710
But other than that, that's now
61

61

00:02:04.710  -->  00:02:08.460
the installation of Amazon Corretto JDK version 11.
62

62

00:02:08.460  -->  00:02:09.293
Done and dusted.
