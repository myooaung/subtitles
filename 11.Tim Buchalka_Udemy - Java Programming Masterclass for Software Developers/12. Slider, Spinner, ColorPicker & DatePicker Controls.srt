1

00:00:05,430  -->  00:00:09,850
so let's continue on with our study of
controls and look at the slider
2

2

00:00:09,850  -->  00:00:14,330
control and the slider control is used when
we want to user to provide a numeric
3

3

00:00:14,330  -->  00:00:19,250
value and it's perfect for that so it
consists of a tract and a thumb that the
4

4

00:00:19,250  -->  00:00:23,530
user can drag so let's have add one to our grid to see what it looks like so we
5

5

00:00:23,530  -->  00:00:27,640
need a fair amount of horizontal space
for this so gonna moved into the second row
6

6

00:00:27,640  -->  00:00:31,930
gonna set the grid pane column span property to 4 so I'll go ahead and do
7

7

00:00:31,930  -->  00:00:35,180
that so....
8

8

00:00:35,180  -->  00:00:45,220
....
9

9

00:00:45,220  -->  00:00:55,240
.....
10

10

00:00:55,240  -->  00:00:58,260
....
11

11

00:00:58,260  -->  00:01:10,740
...
12

12

00:01:10,740  -->  00:01:17,420
....
13

13

00:01:17,420  -->  00:01:31,890
...if we do that see if we can run
that so it does work and it's quite long then
14

14

00:01:31,890  -->  00:01:37,820
it's good but there's no indication of
the value range so that is not really very
15

15

00:01:37,820  -->  00:01:41,380
helpful so the user might want to see
what the ranges is actually mean what
16

16

00:01:41,380  -->  00:01:48,660
the numbers are so let's add some labels
to the slider and close it down and we do
17

17

00:01:48,660  -->  00:01:55,250
that by setting the show ticks label
property to true so we just type...
18

18

00:01:55,250  -->  00:02:05,530
...and we run again we should see
the range of numbers you can see now
19

19

00:02:05,530  -->  00:02:10,520
a visual representation so they
got some idea of the actual number that
20

20

00:02:10,520  -->  00:02:13,900
they are actually selecting this time so that's
good but what if the use wanted to set the
21

21

00:02:13,900  -->  00:02:16,900
value to sixty is really difficult to
see how to do that right now
22

22

00:02:16,900  -->  00:02:21,350
so let's add some marks to the slider
to help guide the user because really we
23

23

00:02:21,350  -->  00:02:25,770
need that to make a little bit easy so
we can set the show tick marks property
24

24

00:02:25,770  -->  00:02:27,620
to true
25

25

00:02:27,620  -->  00:02:36,920
obviously we set show labels we can also do show...see what that looks like
26

26

00:02:36,920  -->  00:02:43,470
and that's obviously better now we actually got
ticks here as you can see so it's getting
27

27

00:02:43,470  -->  00:02:49,190
better but still not really helpful if you wanted to set the value to exactly 60
28

28

00:02:49,190  -->  00:02:53,470
so which one we would actually select here to
make it sixty and the problem is that
29

29

00:02:53,470  -->  00:02:58,090
sixty doesn't fall on one of those tick marks
mark so let's show some more tick marks
30

30

00:02:58,090  -->  00:03:01,900
by setting the minor tick properly
or tick count property and this property of
31

31

00:03:01,900  -->  00:03:06,290
the slider control allows us to specify
how many tick marks that we want between
32

32

00:03:06,290  -->  00:03:11,130
any two major ticks right now we can see just three minor ticks
33

33

00:03:11,130  -->  00:03:15,900
between each major ticks that's these
three here you can see between these major
34

34

00:03:15,900  -->  00:03:22,010
ones which are obviously have got a number
in that tick and their are 3 sub ticks on each sections
35

35

00:03:22,010  -->  00:03:23,060
so lets change that
36

36

00:03:23,060  -->  00:03:27,520
to 4 because the major to the tick marks are set in
increments of 25 so we wanted to divide
37

37

00:03:27,520  -->  00:03:32,320
that area between major tick marks
into five pieces so the way we do that
38

38

00:03:32,320  -->  00:03:38,260
is we come down here and change that to minor tick count...
39

39

00:03:38,260  -->  00:03:50,840
...so we do that instead of 3 minor ticks we are making it 4 if we run that you can see
40

40

00:03:50,840  -->  00:03:53,180
that is going to be there that would
actually be sixty so we could actually
41

41

00:03:53,180  -->  00:03:57,830
specify that now that we've got the right
number of ticks there but there's still a
42

42

00:03:57,830  -->  00:04:03,600
little bit of an issue in that when we dragged their we don't know if we are exactly at 61 or 59 how do
43

43

00:04:03,600  -->  00:04:07,660
we actually know well we can often use even more help by sending the snap to
44

44

00:04:07,660  -->  00:04:11,620
ticks properly when we set that the true
the thumbs is always gonna snap to the nearest
45

45

00:04:11,620  -->  00:04:16,960
tick mark no matter where the user left
thumb go so if we close it down and change that
46

46

00:04:16,960  -->  00:04:19,400
to....
47

47

00:04:19,400  -->  00:04:28,720
...and run that and now we specify you can see
48

48

00:04:29,520  -->  00:04:36,030
how its snapping now so I can go their but as soon as I let go it snaps back to whatever its the closest tick one
49

49

00:04:36,030  -->  00:04:41,920
before or one after it that way we now know a much
more precise now so that slider it can be
50

50

00:04:41,920  -->  00:04:46,100
useful for numeric values as I mentioned
and just as a final note before we move
51

51

00:04:46,100  -->  00:04:49,860
on the slider can also be displayed
vertically by setting its orientation
52

52

00:04:49,860  -->  00:04:54,720
property to vertical so moving on now
the next one is our next controller we want to
53

53

00:04:54,720  -->  00:04:59,340
look at is the spinner now the spinner is a new control that was just added to java
54

54

00:05:00,030  -->  00:05:05,430
8u40 sort of sub version Java 8 and if you're running an earlier
55

55

00:05:05,430  -->  00:05:09,940
version of Java you won't have the spinner
control so 8u40 or higher is the
56

56

00:05:09,940  -->  00:05:13,660
one that you will be running and just as a
refresher if you're not sure which
57

57

00:05:13,660  -->  00:05:17,250
version you've got you can
just right click here
58

58

00:05:17,990  -->  00:05:24,070
open module settings and we have a
look here under the project sdk that
59

59

00:05:24,070  -->  00:05:27,800
would normally tell you and in this case I've got 1.8.0_73
60

60

00:05:29,000  -->  00:05:33,370
so the version would be 40 it would be something like
8u40 or something like that
61

61

00:05:33,370  -->  00:05:37,570
or in this case it's the 73 so 73 is obviously
much newer version than 40 so I'll be
62

62

00:05:37,570  -->  00:05:42,270
able to use the spinner if you've got an
older version running java 1.8 prior to
63

63

00:05:42,270  -->  00:05:46,300
40 its not going to work so make sure
you do update its free to update and its
64

64

00:05:46,300  -->  00:05:50,960
recommended anyway so we have determine
that I have got it and we can use that so
65

65

00:05:50,960  -->  00:05:56,830
how do we go about using the spinner well
we just star with typing in the name
66

66

00:05:56,830  -->  00:06:09,040
which is spinner and let's put on row index as well 2 so....
67

67

00:06:09,040  -->  00:06:17,120
...because on line
68

68

00:06:17,120  -->  00:06:24,160
91 we set the slider to use a column span of 4 so lets use column 0 to 3 so...
69

69

00:06:24,160  -->  00:06:25,720
....
70

70

00:06:25,720  -->  00:06:29,240
...in the spinner we can set a maximum and minimum range as
well
71

71

00:06:30,210  -->  00:06:34,350
and if I type this in and we run it you will see why we want to use this as an alternative to
72

72

00:06:34,350  -->  00:06:47,170
the slider so.....and if we run this you can see here now
73

73

00:06:47,170  -->  00:06:51,570
with the spinner they can actually specify a range we
can be pretty precise and if I hold this
74

74

00:06:51,570  -->  00:07:02,670
down all the way up to a hundred if you wanted to my finger is going to be worn out before
75

75

00:07:02,670  -->  00:07:08,950
we get there but obviously the
advantage of this is as far more precise
76

76

00:07:08,950  -->  00:07:13,620
so if you wanted to enter a specific value
their is hundreds as the maximum because we used the
77

77

00:07:13,620  -->  00:07:17,620
minimum and the maximum there and it
shows in then shown as a range so obviously
78

78

00:07:17,620  -->  00:07:23,590
if we wanted a value like 92 you
couldn't really do that with the slider
79

79

00:07:23,590  -->  00:07:27,900
because we need some more precision so
this is the spinner is just a way to be
80

80

00:07:27,900  -->  00:07:31,970
more precise to enable you to do it but you notice at the moment I can't type
81

81

00:07:31,970  -->  00:07:37,210
in their we could if I actually type a number if we knew what the number we can do that and the way to
82

82

00:07:37,210  -->  00:07:44,830
do that is to just set the property
editable to be true so....
83

83

00:07:44,830  -->  00:07:47,360
....
84

84

00:07:47,360  -->  00:07:55,450
we can go and type a number in there so here
57 and its now got a number and we can't type a number
85

85

00:07:55,450  -->  00:08:04,180
like...you can see what happened when I press enter their we got it to crash and that's because we chose
86

86

00:08:04,180  -->  00:08:07,010
a number that was too large
87

87

00:08:07,010  -->  00:08:10,010
cancel and run it again
88

88

00:08:11,640  -->  00:08:24,070
and obviously type a value that is a valid number and it will
work nicely and notice when I type a number
89

89

00:08:24,070  -->  00:08:29,960
that's beyond the maximum its only gonna select the maximum but where we ran into
90

90

00:08:29,960  -->  00:08:32,780
difficulties before was typing a number
that was too large for the computer to
91

91

00:08:32,780  -->  00:08:36,290
handle and that's why it actually crash
like that but we talking more about
92

92

00:08:36,290  -->  00:08:40,170
that later and we can trap rather those exceptions and do some
93

93

00:08:40,170  -->  00:08:44,400
processing to confirm rather than just crashing
ungracefully like we did their but we'll
94

94

00:08:44,400  -->  00:08:48,970
talk about that later the point here is that we have given the user the option to
95

95

00:08:48,970  -->  00:08:53,970
type in the number as well as using the
upper and lower range if they wanted to
96

96

00:08:53,970  -->  00:08:58,730
and again just a confirmation that you need to press enter the user needs
97

97

00:08:58,730  -->  00:09:03,070
to press enter to actually sort of confirm
that value if they want if they don't do that this
98

98

00:09:03,070  -->  00:09:07,370
spinner is still going to be set to the previous
value and as an example if the spinner was
99

99

00:09:07,370  -->  00:09:11,090
display some sort of a dialog and the user change the value then
100

100

00:09:11,090  -->  00:09:15,600
press the ok button in the dialogue but they did't press enter in the spinner then
101

101

00:09:15,600  -->  00:09:19,370
the application code wouldn't see that the
spinner value change and so it is important if you see
102

102

00:09:19,370  -->  00:09:24,150
editable to true for the user perspective they've got to press enter to sort of see that change
103

103

00:09:24,150  -->  00:09:29,280
one other thing that we can do with the
spinner is we can set the initial values
104

104

00:09:29,280  -->  00:09:36,820
so it can be quite handy in that case if your setting a
minimum and maximum range to set an
105

105

00:09:36,820  -->  00:09:43,410
initial value say halfway just to save having to do all the
clicking like I did initially so we put....
106

106

00:09:43,410  -->  00:09:48,410
....and run that
107

107

00:09:51,710  -->  00:10:01,610
...we now see we got a default value start of being 50 and what I was saying here was if you type in a new value and I click away the
108

108

00:10:01,610  -->  00:10:04,760
value still hasn't been updated that is until
I press Enter
109

109

00:10:04,760  -->  00:10:07,670
that's what when its been updated you
can see that more if you put something
110

110

00:10:07,670  -->  00:10:12,570
invalid moved away from it nothing's
changed but if I comeback and press enter
111

111

00:10:12,570  -->  00:10:17,990
you can see that's been processed and in
this case because we specified the maximum range of a
112

112

00:10:17,990  -->  00:10:22,800
hundred its gone back to a 100 so that's one thing to keep in mind if you are editing from a user
113

113

00:10:22,800  -->  00:10:26,980
perspective if you setting editable to true
you got to press enter for the change to be
114

114

00:10:26,980  -->  00:10:32,600
updated so moving on that's the spinners
lets actually have a look at something
115

115

00:10:32,600  -->  00:10:38,570
completely different and this is the
color picker so in terms of setting that up
116

116

00:10:38,570  -->  00:10:54,780
we're going to type color picker......and go to the new row index so....
117

117

00:10:54,780  -->  00:11:05,880
....
118

118

00:11:05,880  -->  00:11:15,810
...and when we run
it will see the color picker in operation you see we get a drop
119

119

00:11:15,810  -->  00:11:23,340
down here we can actually specify the color we want so if we click on the color and that is the hex code equivalent
120

120

00:11:23,920  -->  00:11:28,450
you can click on custom color and we can move it
around you probably see these controls
121

121

00:11:28,450  -->  00:11:32,460
in other applications and it's a little
bit different depending on the platform
122

122

00:11:32,460  -->  00:11:38,590
your running on click on use and the hex code is updated and
123

123

00:11:38,590  -->  00:11:42,760
pretty cool depending which color you
pick the color picker is going to display
124

124

00:11:42,760  -->  00:11:48,130
the color name or the web color the hash and
followed by six hex digits and the reason
125

125

00:11:48,130  -->  00:11:52,500
for that is if we just pick a general one this is just
the standard colors but we can sort of
126

126

00:11:52,500  -->  00:11:57,680
override that you get a specific one
with the hex digits as I mentioned so does really
127

127

00:11:57,680  -->  00:12:00,530
depend on which color you pick as to which
one you get
128

128

00:12:00,530  -->  00:12:05,850
and you saw me when I clicked on custom
color before you get another dialogue so pop
129

129

00:12:05,850  -->  00:12:09,850
up there we got
different options to choose a different
130

130

00:12:09,850  -->  00:12:14,560
particular shade or whatever being a really
precise with the color we actually want
131

131

00:12:14,560  -->  00:12:18,470
and the hex code gets updated on the screen and the
other thing I didn't show you was just
132

132

00:12:18,470  -->  00:12:22,520
is that you can also type in the codes you can click on these if you want to
133

133

00:12:22,520  -->  00:12:28,220
put it in a different shade their do it that way web and just type in the code if you want to do
134

134

00:12:28,220  -->  00:12:34,620
it that way and obviously you can just change here and we got a quite detail
135

135

00:12:34,620  -->  00:12:39,100
options to really choose the color and
be really quite precise and how you go about it
136

136

00:12:39,700  -->  00:12:44,550
one thing to remember though if you do click
Save if you do that now now we have
137

137

00:12:44,550  -->  00:12:48,410
save that next time we open the dialog we should see its save on the custom
138

138

00:12:48,410  -->  00:12:52,490
color selection and those save colors will stick around for the life of the application
139

139

00:12:52,490  -->  00:12:56,130
and then be thrown away unless you save and
restore them between application runs so
140

140

00:12:56,130  -->  00:12:58,830
that's another good thing that you can
actually do you notice the custom color
141

141

00:12:58,830  -->  00:13:03,620
here now as well that's because I've
actually clicked on the save button well that is pretty
142

142

00:13:03,620  -->  00:13:06,110
cool how it does that automatically
143

143

00:13:06,110  -->  00:13:11,290
and let's do one more control now before we end this video and I'm gonna show you
144

144

00:13:11,290  -->  00:13:14,360
something you probably will use a lot
more than the color picker that's the
145

145

00:13:14,360  -->  00:13:25,730
date picker very handy for calendars and
any applications that use date so....
146

146

00:13:25,730  -->  00:13:33,930
...
147

147

00:13:33,930  -->  00:13:36,930
so click on run...
148

148

00:13:39,470  -->  00:13:44,480
and their is our date picker and it is quite flexible
its come up we can go back
149

149

00:13:45,220  -->  00:13:49,520
to different months and notice when I went back
to January it went back to the previous
150

150

00:13:49,520  -->  00:13:55,150
year to 2014 choosing a particularly date and it puts
the date on the field automatically this
151

151

00:13:55,150  -->  00:13:58,950
may look a little bit different
depending on how your dates are in your
152

152

00:13:58,950  -->  00:13:59,740
part of the world
153

153

00:13:59,740  -->  00:14:06,030
Australia we always use day first and month and year that you have a different one
154

154

00:14:06,030  -->  00:14:11,760
depending on how you set your date on
your computer and we are gonna use this date
155

155

00:14:11,760  -->  00:14:15,700
picker in the later lectures so you can find out more about
it then but you can see how that once
156

156

00:14:15,700  -->  00:14:22,440
you've selected the date it is updated
and puts it in the date picker so I'm going to finish this video
157

157

00:14:22,440  -->  00:14:24,500
here now in the next video
158

158

00:14:24,500  -->  00:14:29,110
we are gonna continue on we got a few more
controls to go through yet and will do
159

159

00:14:29,110  -->  00:14:29,930
that in the next video
