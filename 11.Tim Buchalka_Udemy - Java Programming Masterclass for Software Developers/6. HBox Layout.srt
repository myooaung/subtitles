1

00:00:05,510  -->  00:00:10,770
ok so continuing on just run our program
again to see where up to and we still got
2

2

00:00:10,770  -->  00:00:15,040
some long buttons as you can see there a
long button and we've now that we've
3

3

00:00:15,040  -->  00:00:18,630
commented out the column constraints again
we've got to the width to the left hand side and the
4

4

00:00:18,630  -->  00:00:22,530
right hand side so I mentioned that we're
going to start looking at alignment
5

5

00:00:22,530  -->  00:00:27,030
so let's start looking at doing that
now at the moment you can see in the grid
6

6

00:00:27,030  -->  00:00:31,030
pane on line 8 the alignment is set to
center and obviously that was centered
7

7

00:00:31,030  -->  00:00:35,550
in the middle of the entire window
so we can change that lets try changing center to
8

8

00:00:35,550  -->  00:00:45,370
top center.......and if you run that you can see what's happened
9

9

00:00:45,370  -->  00:00:51,780
there is and lets just span it so its big enough to contain
the full columns you can see it is now
10

10

00:00:51,780  -->  00:00:55,240
at the top of the screen but still
centered in the middle so top center
11

11

00:00:55,240  -->  00:00:59,490
means just that top and then centre now one
of the things you might notice by doing
12

12

00:00:59,490  -->  00:01:05,130
that is that there is no gap between where the title ends the top of
13

13

00:01:05,130  -->  00:01:10,910
the window and where
the actual columns start or where the row starts in
14

14

00:01:10,910  -->  00:01:15,160
other words so it would be nice to have some
padding at the top there to do we
15

15

00:01:15,160  -->  00:01:19,800
actually add a padding element to the
grid pane itself and within that we add a
16

16

00:01:19,800  -->  00:01:23,940
inset child element to the padding
element so what I mean by that if I just go
17

17

00:01:23,940  -->  00:01:29,230
here and do that so close that down just to see what it does and in here within the
18

18

00:01:29,230  -->  00:01:39,000
grid pane we add padding then we add the inset so......
19

19

00:01:39,000  -->  00:01:45,980
...and does this like we think it will do basically its add a ten pixel gap between the first row and the title bar so if we run
20

20

00:01:45,980  -->  00:01:50,820
that we should see that has worked you can see that gap at the top but again
21

21

00:01:50,820  -->  00:01:57,540
between the title bar and the first row thats good now that is working so lets try now moving the 4th button
22

22

00:01:57,540  -->  00:02:01,440
down to the fourth row so we are
going to change the grid pane row index to
23

23

00:02:01,440  -->  00:02:07,900
3 come down here and add it to the fourth one make that 3 their and get rid of some
24

24

00:02:07,900  -->  00:02:10,770
of the actual text now because we don't need
it anymore we just go back to the really
25

25

00:02:10,770  -->  00:02:15,080
long button before so I don't have to expand so much each time I run it
26

26

00:02:15,580  -->  00:02:18,580
so if we run that
27

27

00:02:19,520  -->  00:02:23,860
..so the spacing is now reasonable again now I've actually
put it down into that row by itself
28

28

00:02:23,860  -->  00:02:29,430
and that brings up another interesting thing
to note is that we don't need to have
29

29

00:02:29,430  -->  00:02:32,490
these in order so I've got row index three here then we would skip back to row
30

30

00:02:32,490  -->  00:02:36,240
index 2 and the fxml is quite
happily will render things in the
31

31

00:02:36,240  -->  00:02:41,840
right order so in other words you don't need to
define it just row 0 row 1 row 2
32

32

00:02:41,840  -->  00:02:44,890
row 3 and so on you can put that in any
order and likewise for the column
33

33

00:02:44,890  -->  00:02:48,460
index as well then the other thing you
can do is children can also span
34

34

00:02:48,460  -->  00:02:52,740
across multiple rows so we haven't seen
that working yet and we just need to set
35

35

00:02:52,740  -->  00:02:57,020
the grid pane.row span property to do
that and this is might be where you want this
36

36

00:02:57,020  -->  00:03:03,950
button here to take both columns columns
0 and column 1 up so you do that we just
37

37

00:03:03,950  -->  00:03:07,310
add a col span or a row span
property and we do that on the actual
38

38

00:03:07,310  -->  00:03:16,850
button itself so down here and add that......
39

39

00:03:16,850  -->  00:03:27,920
..and if we run that you can see how it is taking up two
columns and what we want to do now is changed
40

40

00:03:27,920  -->  00:03:31,710
that column index to 0 so it starts in the
very first columns so if we do that
41

41

00:03:31,710  -->  00:03:39,160
run that again you can see that is now correctly not adding a new
row its actually starting on a new
42

42

00:03:39,160  -->  00:03:45,390
column starting on column 0 and
moving over including column 1 as well
43

43

00:03:45,390  -->  00:03:50,000
so that's what the column span does
enable you to span more than one column
44

44

00:03:50,000  -->  00:03:54,190
now right now looking at the screen all
the buttons are left aligned in their
45

45

00:03:54,190  -->  00:03:59,640
cells so let's change the horizontal alignment of button 1 so that it's right align just to see
46

46

00:03:59,640  -->  00:04:03,830
what that looks like and to do that we use
the h alignment properties so close this
47

47

00:04:03,830  -->  00:04:18,430
down and set that now so in here
for button 1 and we use the.....
48

48

00:04:18,430  -->  00:04:23,610
...if you run that we
should be able to see that the first
49

49

00:04:23,610  -->  00:04:27,810
button is now right aligned and you can
see there within the
50

50

00:04:28,400  -->  00:04:35,560
cell it's now right aligned within that cell and just there is a h alignment their is also a
51

51

00:04:35,560  -->  00:04:40,350
v alignment property that you can use as well that let's us change controls vertical
52

52

00:04:40,350  -->  00:04:41,820
alignment within a cell if you want to do that
53

53

00:04:41,820  -->  00:04:46,440
ok so that's it that's only basic overview of grid pane and I'm just gonna close it down so
54

54

00:04:46,440  -->  00:04:53,970
next we are going to take a look at the h box
lay out now h box lays out its children horizontally
55

55

00:04:53,970  -->  00:04:59,110
in a single row and sizes its children to their preferred widths now if there's any
56

56

00:04:59,110  -->  00:05:04,130
horizontal space left over it is gonna stretch
itself to fill the excess rather than
57

57

00:05:04,130  -->  00:05:08,150
stretching its children if that makes sense so what it does with any extra height
58

58

00:05:08,150  -->  00:05:12,360
will depend on the fill height property
and we will see this in action shortly but when
59

59

00:05:12,360  -->  00:05:16,930
fill height is true which is by default the h box is gonna stretch itself to fill
60

60

00:05:16,930  -->  00:05:22,540
any height and if it's false
its gonna try to resize its children to fill
61

61

00:05:22,540  -->  00:05:27,890
that extra height now some children
can't be resized that way and in that case
62

62

00:05:27,890  -->  00:05:33,370
the extra height's gonna remain empty so we
often use a h box layout to lay out a
63

63

00:05:33,370  -->  00:05:38,340
set of buttons in a dialogue because of
the layout inherit from the same parent
64

64

00:05:38,340  -->  00:05:43,270
class which is pane they share a lot of the
same properties so we won't go over
65

65

00:05:43,270  -->  00:05:47,140
properties that we have already covered for grid pane but bear in mind that everything we
66

66

00:05:47,140  -->  00:05:52,770
do with layouts can also be done in code using the appropriate set methods and then
67

67

00:05:52,770  -->  00:05:55,690
we can check the documentation
for the layout to see what properties it
68

68

00:05:55,690  -->  00:05:59,840
actually support so in the fxml let's remove all the buttons in
69

69

00:05:59,840  -->  00:06:07,240
the padding element and change grid pane to h box so close the run window so gonna remove
70

70

00:06:07,240  -->  00:06:15,200
all the buttons we don't need those anymore and also the padding and also remove the commented out column constraints which
71

71

00:06:15,200  -->  00:06:21,860
we are not gonna be using so we left just with the standard grid pane we are gonna change grid pane to h box now so
72

72

00:06:21,860  -->  00:06:29,430
make that h box......
73

73

00:06:30,430  -->  00:06:35,420
...and you will see now that h gap v gap and
grid lines visible don't actually exist
74

74

00:06:35,420  -->  00:06:38,550
for h box so we need to remove those
as well because they aren't applicable
75

75

00:06:38,550  -->  00:06:49,510
for this layout so now we have done that we are gonna live alignment to top center let's actually add three buttons three
76

76

00:06:49,510  -->  00:06:58,140
simple buttons an ok cancel and a
help so.......
77

77

00:06:58,140  -->  00:07:17,360
...and if we run this you can see our 3 buttons laid out
78

78

00:07:17,360  -->  00:07:21,260
horizontally at the top center of
the window and that's happening of
79

79

00:07:21,260  -->  00:07:26,110
course because as you see we've got on line 9 alignment set to
80

80

00:07:26,110  -->  00:07:29,110
top_center so it's doing
that as we talked about previously
81

81

00:07:29,110  -->  00:07:34,420
and that also there's no space between the
three buttons and now because the
82

82

00:07:34,420  -->  00:07:38,910
h box fill height property is set to
true which is by default it would
83

83

00:07:38,910  -->  00:07:42,820
have herself to take up any
extra height in this case the extra height is
84

84

00:07:42,820  -->  00:07:47,950
actually below the buttons so to see that
the h box has stretch itself to fill any
85

85

00:07:47,950  -->  00:07:52,270
excess width and height lets actually add
a border around the h box and I'm
86

86

00:07:52,270  -->  00:07:55,960
gonna do this using CSS which were gonna
cover in more detail on a later lesson
87

87

00:07:55,960  -->  00:08:00,760
but for now we just type in these commands
and will be able to see a border
88

88

00:08:00,760  -->  00:08:07,080
around it so close it down close the run
window and we are gonna be adding it to the
89

89

00:08:07,080  -->  00:08:10,080
h box line after the alignment I'm gonna start on a new line and
90

90

00:08:12,880  -->  00:08:22,820
gonna type....which add some CSS commands to the h box and you might be familiar with CSS
91

91

00:08:22,820  -->  00:08:28,080
for web development which is a way to sort of style a website similar
92

92

00:08:28,080  -->  00:08:31,730
principles so we type in a style which in this case is going to be
93

93

00:08:31,730  -->  00:08:34,990
......
94

94

00:08:34,990  -->  00:08:41,440
....and notice how IntelliJ is picking that for us first one is color...
95

95

00:08:41,440  -->  00:08:47,920
.....and again IntelliJ is helpfully picking that up
for us the semicolon their because we want issue
96

96

00:08:47,920  -->  00:08:56,980
another couple of commands here next one is.....
97

97

00:08:56,980  -->  00:09:14,100
...and notice on line 10
98

98

00:09:14,100  -->  00:09:18,380
in red which its showing us what the color
is that we have selected which is very
99

99

00:09:18,380  -->  00:09:27,980
nice just here in this next to the line number
so now if we run this you can see a lot better now
100

100

00:09:27,980  -->  00:09:31,970
you can see clearly that the h box is
occupying the entire width and height of
101

101

00:09:31,970  -->  00:09:36,560
its parent so adding border around layouts
and their children is a great way to
102

102

00:09:36,560  -->  00:09:40,620
visualize how much space is being given
to the child this can help tremendously
103

103

00:09:40,620  -->  00:09:45,210
when a layout isn't behaving the way we
expect and is usually happens because
104

104

00:09:45,210  -->  00:09:52,970
we made assumptions about how much space will be allocated and turns out that the assumption isn't true let's so lets change
105

105

00:09:52,970  -->  00:09:59,740
the alignment now to bottom right because that's
what buttons often appear so will do that so we'll change
106

106

00:09:59,740  -->  00:10:10,610
this now to bottom right.........and if you run this you see
that h box has stretch itself
107

107

00:10:10,610  -->  00:10:13,260
above the buttons to fill the extra
height
108

108

00:10:13,260  -->  00:10:17,580
and will also add a gap now between the buttons by setting the spacing properties
109

109

00:10:17,580  -->  00:10:27,620
to 10 so the way we do that is within
the set up for our h box and we can
110

110

00:10:27,620  -->  00:10:33,250
set up we put....which tells us that we are gonna be adding 10
111

111

00:10:33,250  -->  00:10:40,490
pixels between each child so if we run this we can see that 10 pixels are now in between
112

112

00:10:40,490  -->  00:10:49,270
each child in the h box layout and note now if I
resize the window the buttons are actually
113

113

00:10:49,270  -->  00:10:52,480
remaining at the bottom right because
the way we specified it
114

114

00:10:53,870  -->  00:10:58,810
so we probably want to add some space now between the buttons on the bottom edge of the window and the
115

115

00:10:58,810  -->  00:11:04,230
buttons on the right edge of the window
so the way we do this its actually the same for was in grid pane
116

116

00:11:04,230  -->  00:11:13,590
so we are gonna use padding and insets so we do the same thing
here within the h box.....
117

117

00:11:13,590  -->  00:11:21,570
.....
118

118

00:11:21,570  -->  00:11:30,570
...and now if we run that we could see now that we have
119

119

00:11:30,570  -->  00:11:35,620
at the bottom we have a 10 gap but also on
the right hand side we also got a 10 gap
120

120

00:11:35,620  -->  00:11:39,660
as well and that should stay the same
no matter how small or how big we make it
121

121

00:11:39,660  -->  00:11:45,000
its still going to maintain that now that we have set
that up so the buttons are now spaced
122

122

00:11:45,000  -->  00:11:48,470
much better than they were but it would be nice if
they all had the same width just having
123

123

00:11:48,470  -->  00:11:54,270
a consistent size for all buttons and we recalled that when controls are
124

124

00:11:54,270  -->  00:11:58,970
place in a h box they take on their
preferred width by default as long
125

125

00:11:58,970  -->  00:12:02,730
as there's enough room for them to do so
now to make all the buttons have the
126

126

00:12:02,730  -->  00:12:06,790
same width will set the
preferred width to the same value for
127

127

00:12:06,790  -->  00:12:10,280
every button so let's go ahead and do
that and we need to set the pref width
128

128

00:12:10,280  -->  00:12:14,500
button to 90 so lets do that which is
going to be approximately the right size
129

129

00:12:14,500  -->  00:12:21,140
to handle the buttons so we go into the
button set up and we change......
130

130

00:12:21,140  -->  00:12:24,960
......
131

131

00:12:29,770  -->  00:12:39,240
...and now if we run that you can see that they all got a uniform width and
our little dialog screen is starting to
132

132

00:12:39,240  -->  00:12:44,310
look good so that's actually it's for h box it's not
really a complex layout and normally we
133

133

00:12:44,310  -->  00:12:48,300
wouldn't be using it as a layout for
top-level window as I mentioned is
134

134

00:12:48,300  -->  00:12:53,340
commonly used in a dialogue situation
would normally add the h box as a child of
135

135

00:12:53,340  -->  00:12:54,920
another layout
136

136

00:12:54,920  -->  00:12:58,730
now another layout is the V Box layout and as you
might guess it's closely related to the
137

137

00:12:58,730  -->  00:13:03,400
h box so rather than laying them out
horizontally and its gonna lay them vertically rather than that
138

138

00:13:03,400  -->  00:13:04,930
it's pretty similar
139

139

00:13:04,930  -->  00:13:07,890
so that's it for this video in the next
one we're going to start looking at the
140

140

00:13:07,890  -->  00:13:10,560
border pane layout so we'll see you
in the next video
