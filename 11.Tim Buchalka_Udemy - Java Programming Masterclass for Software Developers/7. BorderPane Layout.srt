00:00:05,430  -->  00:00:09,600
so now we're going to look at the border pane layout now the border pane
2

2

00:00:09,650  -->  00:00:14,220
layout is one of the most commonly used
layouts for top-level windows so when
3

3

00:00:14,220  -->  00:00:18,820
you're using a border pane you can place
controls into one of five positions top
4

4

00:00:18,820  -->  00:00:24,580
bottom left right and center so here is a diagram of the layout taken from the
5

5

00:00:24,580  -->  00:00:28,710
border pane documentation so you can see what I mean just bring over the screen their you can see
6

6

00:00:28,710  -->  00:00:34,180
there now so the layout works well for
typical client application now one
7

7

00:00:34,180  -->  00:00:37,230
where you will often have a menu or a toolbar near the top
8

8

00:00:37,820  -->  00:00:42,280
some type tree or list to the left and
the central area that displays data or
9

9

00:00:42,280  -->  00:00:46,510
allows the user to enter data a status
at the bottom and sometimes an
10

10

00:00:46,510  -->  00:00:51,510
information panel or something else to the
right hand now border pane sizing
11

11

00:00:51,510  -->  00:00:55,960
and resizing behaviour
is usually what we expect as well which
12

12

00:00:55,960  -->  00:00:59,360
is pretty good so children in the top
and bottom positions will have
13

13

00:00:59,360  -->  00:01:03,990
there preferred heights and extend the width
of the border pane which we'll see
14

14

00:01:03,990  -->  00:01:07,960
later that isn't always the case now
children in the left and right positions
15

15

00:01:07,960  -->  00:01:11,960
will have their preferred widths and
extend the full height between the top
16

16

00:01:11,960  -->  00:01:16,580
and bottom positions and the set position will get whatever spaces left over
17

17

00:01:16,580  -->  00:01:21,740
and will fill that entire space now
we don't have to place something to every
18

18

00:01:21,740  -->  00:01:27,210
position when a position is empty then
no spaces allocated to it to for example
19

19

00:01:27,210  -->  00:01:30,570
if the right position is empty then
whatever is placed in the center
20

20

00:01:30,570  -->  00:01:34,900
position will extend to the right edge
of the border pane sort of filling it
21

21

00:01:34,900  -->  00:01:39,860
that entire right hadn section up so let's play around
with border pane and I'm going to keep our
22

22

00:01:39,860  -->  00:01:46,060
h box layout which we got on the screen their now but it's no
longer gonna be the top level layout instead
23

23

00:01:46,060  -->  00:01:50,340
what we gonna do is will place it inside
a border pane by surrounding it by
24

24

00:01:50,340  -->  00:01:54,140
opening and closing border pane tags and
we're also going to remove the border for
25

25

00:01:54,140  -->  00:01:59,610
now and will move the fx controller and XML ns attributes from the
26

26

00:01:59,610  -->  00:02:03,460
h box to the border pane and will also
move the alignment property from the
27

27

00:02:03,460  -->  00:02:09,110
h box to the border pane and
will also remove the padding and inset elements so lets go ahead and do that
28

28

00:02:09,110  -->  00:02:16,700
i'm gonna start with putting the code here and clean this up a little bit we some things here we've had
29

29

00:02:16,700  -->  00:02:18,060
because I've actually changed
30

30

00:02:18,060  -->  00:02:25,840
layouts etc so starting on line 6 I'm gonna
make that a border pane so....
31

31

00:02:25,840  -->  00:02:50,540
.....
32

32

00:02:50,540  -->  00:03:00,000
....
33

33

00:03:00,000  -->  00:03:08,130
....because it no
34

34

00:03:08,130  -->  00:03:17,670
longer has got this attributes because we put them into the border pane so delete some of those and we will actually
35

35

00:03:17,670  -->  00:03:22,710
delete the style as well because we are not gonna be using the border as I mentioned we'll just leave the spacing
36

36

00:03:22,710  -->  00:03:32,270
in though as it was before and we get rid of the padding we are using that anymore and we leave our buttons in so we've now got a border  pane and we've now
37

37

00:03:32,270  -->  00:03:35,980
made h box layout a child of the
border pane layout and we put the major
38

38

00:03:35,980  -->  00:03:46,910
attributes that were on h box onto border pane now so if we run it now you'll find
39

39

00:03:46,910  -->  00:03:50,740
we actually get an error and you can see
there that at about halfway down property
40

40

00:03:50,740  -->  00:03:55,240
alignment does not exist or is read only
so the thing to remember is when using
41

41

00:03:55,240  -->  00:03:59,710
border pane we specify where control
should go by placing them into one of
42

42

00:03:59,710  -->  00:04:02,190
the border panes 5 positions
43

43

00:04:02,190  -->  00:04:05,970
talked about earlier in this video so it
wouldn't make sense to tell border
44

44

00:04:05,970  -->  00:04:10,220
pane that we want its children at the bottom
of the pane and align to the right as we
45

45

00:04:10,220  -->  00:04:14,640
did for the h box in other words border pane doesn't support the alignment
46

46

00:04:14,640  -->  00:04:19,660
property but as we see later we can align the
border pane children
47

47

00:04:19,660  -->  00:04:24,200
within their positions in the border
pane itself so lets actually remove the
48

48

00:04:24,200  -->  00:04:28,770
alignment that property and run the
application again so remove this on line 8.....
49

49

00:04:30,300  -->  00:04:41,230
...so if we run it now we should find it actually works this time
and you see we now got something really weird going on with the
50

50

00:04:41,230  -->  00:04:47,220
buttons in our h box that their positioned at the
top left of the window as you can see and
51

51

00:04:47,220  -->  00:04:50,970
it doesn't matter whether we try to resize it
bigger or smaller nothing seems to
52

52

00:04:50,970  -->  00:04:55,120
change they're not actually using their
preferred widths that we set that's
53

53

00:04:55,120  -->  00:04:57,900
really the point with all of this and
obviously their
54

54

00:04:57,900  -->  00:05:02,810
not actually moving at all and that seems to be
a problems so the reason we get
55

55

00:05:02,810  -->  00:05:07,400
this behaviour is because we haven't set
the h boxes position within the
56

56

00:05:07,400  -->  00:05:12,320
border pane and consequently the layout
doesn't know what to do with it so let's
57

57

00:05:12,320  -->  00:05:17,780
put our h box into the bottom
position and will do so by placing the h box
58

58

00:05:17,780  -->  00:05:22,420
within a bottom element and when we run the
application we should hopefully see that
59

59

00:05:22,420  -->  00:05:27,000
it actually works better so we need to come
through here within the border pane before
60

60

00:05:27,000  -->  00:05:33,830
the h box we need to specify bottom.......and we need to put out a h box within that
61

61

00:05:36,200  -->  00:05:43,340
paste that so now we've told the border
pane layout where we want our button or our h box
62

62

00:05:43,340  -->  00:05:47,660
layout to be which contains
our buttons within the border pane layout so
63

63

00:05:47,660  -->  00:05:55,060
if we run it again now we've now actually got our buttons appearing on the screen so the buttons are their and
64

64

00:05:55,060  -->  00:05:58,380
are now sized correctly because we can see they are
all the same size and we can read the
65

65

00:05:58,380  -->  00:06:03,100
text obviously but they are left aligned
so one thing to mention here is that
66

66

00:06:03,100  -->  00:06:08,350
with nesting layouts which we've done here
we obviously we got our
67

67

00:06:08,350  -->  00:06:10,150
our border pane and we got our nested layout
68

68

00:06:10,150  -->  00:06:14,280
our h box is nested within the border pane this is the concept of nesting
69

69

00:06:14,280  -->  00:06:18,590
layouts by adding h box where we have
nested the layout within another layout
70

70

00:06:18,590  -->  00:06:23,030
when using border pane nested layouts is
the only way to add a row of buttons
71

71

00:06:23,030  -->  00:06:27,530
into the bottom position we couldn't
have added each button individually to the
72

72

00:06:27,530  -->  00:06:30,690
bottom position and that's because each
position can only have one child
73

73

00:06:31,750  -->  00:06:35,590
so nesting layouts is a very common technique
for positioning control where you
74

74

00:06:35,590  -->  00:06:39,680
actually want them in and that really to
help you get the behaviour you expect
75

75

00:06:39,680  -->  00:06:43,940
when a window is resized so we'll see
more of this technique in later videos
76

76

00:06:43,940  -->  00:06:49,310
so what we are gonna do is we are gonna add the alignment property back to h box not
77

77

00:06:49,310  -->  00:06:53,280
to the border pane because we established
that the alignment properly doesn't
78

78

00:06:53,280  -->  00:06:57,450
exist for the border pane so we add it back to
the h box but this time we can set it to
79

79

00:06:57,450  -->  00:07:02,070
the top right center or right or bottom right
and we'll see the same result no
80

80

00:07:02,070  -->  00:07:06,070
matter which one we use because the alignment
property specifies how layouts children
81

81

00:07:06,070  -->  00:07:13,960
should be aligned within it so let me run this and just explain and we can see what's going to do so going to create
82

82

00:07:13,960  -->  00:07:22,230
try top left so....
83

83

00:07:22,230  -->  00:07:34,340
.....
84

84

00:07:35,940  -->  00:07:46,540
so now we run again and you can see it's
now at the bottom right you might be wondering hang on I specified
85

85

00:07:46,540  -->  00:07:49,840
top right so why is that happening well
the thing to remember here is no matter
86

86

00:07:49,840  -->  00:07:53,620
what we use the results is going to be the
same and that's because of course we
87

87

00:07:53,620  -->  00:07:59,370
specified for the border pane that
h box is up here is being inserted into the
88

88

00:07:59,370  -->  00:08:03,840
bottom part of the layouts so there is now it can be put up there when
89

89

00:08:03,840  -->  00:08:07,760
we're very told the border pane layout
what's coming into the bottom part of it
90

90

00:08:07,760  -->  00:08:11,450
so the point I'm getting at here is that
no matter which result we use top
91

91

00:08:11,450  -->  00:08:15,780
right center-right or bottom right
the alignment on line ten we gonna get it
92

92

00:08:15,780  -->  00:08:19,450
showing in the right position and that's
because the alignment property specifies
93

93

00:08:19,450  -->  00:08:24,280
how our layout's children should be aligned
within it and because the h boxes is in the
94

94

00:08:24,280  -->  00:08:28,580
border panes bottom position which I was
getting at its tall enough to fit buttons but no
95

95

00:08:28,580  -->  00:08:33,070
taller so therefore aligning child as
children vertically within won't
96

96

00:08:33,070  -->  00:08:36,700
actually make a difference so lets quickly
try all three alignments just to confirm that
97

97

00:08:36,700  -->  00:08:41,660
so we set it to top right first so close it down lets also just to
98

98

00:08:41,660  -->  00:08:43,930
confirm it try center right and see what
happens
99

99

00:08:43,930  -->  00:09:03,750
center-right run that....notice the same results still at the bottom right and
the other one we can try bottom right and if we run that again
100

100

00:09:03,750  -->  00:09:06,420
exactly the same result so clearly it
doesn't make a difference that is
101

101

00:09:06,420  -->  00:09:11,920
what is established because of the way we adding
this ultimately to the border pane layout so basically
102

102

00:09:11,920  -->  00:09:16,830
its the same each time we run it so lets put
controls into the other border pane
103

103

00:09:16,830  -->  00:09:21,170
position just to see what it looks
like so what we're going to do is add firstly a label
104

104

00:09:21,170  -->  00:09:22,340
to the top position
105

105

00:09:22,340  -->  00:09:27,190
so lets go ahead and do that so how we  do that well
we close down this run window first and
106

106

00:09:27,190  -->  00:09:33,770
I'm gonna move this down and stat on line 9 by typing....which tells the border pane layout that
107

107

00:09:33,770  -->  00:09:36,510
were adding an element to the top
108

108

00:09:36,510  -->  00:09:47,230
so we use labels so....
109

109

00:09:48,840  -->  00:09:54,020
...so lets try running that
110

110

00:10:00,640  -->  00:10:10,060
...and I didn't try import ok so I need to accept that import to obviously make this valid try again and
111

111

00:10:10,060  -->  00:10:14,790
it didn't quite work as you can see we try to use alignment = center but obviously that's not centered
112

112

00:10:14,790  -->  00:10:19,240
it still in the top left hand corner so it's
left justified so why is the label is still
113

113

00:10:19,240  -->  00:10:23,590
aligned to the left well the alignment
property for a label control determines
114

114

00:10:23,590  -->  00:10:27,380
where the labels content will sit
when there's empty space within the
115

115

00:10:27,380  -->  00:10:32,080
label so we place the label into the top
position of the border pane and that
116

116

00:10:32,080  -->  00:10:36,930
means that the layout has given the label
the entire width the pane because of that
117

117

00:10:36,930  -->  00:10:40,130
we expect that aligning the text to
the center would mean that the text will
118

118

00:10:40,130  -->  00:10:44,440
be centered within the top position but
the thing to remember is most controls
119

119

00:10:44,440  -->  00:10:48,260
won't stretch to fill the width they have been
allocated and that's how the label
120

120

00:10:48,260  -->  00:10:51,920
control behaves so this means that even
though the border pane is given the
121

121

00:10:51,920  -->  00:10:56,360
label the entire window width of the
window in this case the label remains at
122

122

00:10:56,360  -->  00:11:02,020
its preferred width which is the width it required to
accommodate the texts and no more now
123

123

00:11:02,020  -->  00:11:05,360
since their isn't any empty space within the label the
alignment property doesn't do anything
124

124

00:11:05,360  -->  00:11:11,150
now if the label did occupy the entire width of
the pane their would be empty space within it
125

125

00:11:11,150  -->  00:11:16,420
and setting the alignment to center would
have centered the text so to see this we are gonna place a
126

126

00:11:16,420  -->  00:11:21,360
border around the label so let's go ahead and do that too so we can sort of see whats happening and it
127

127

00:11:21,360  -->  00:11:28,630
can be very useful to add a border in this situations where we are trying to figure out something so I'm going to do that and we need a
128

128

00:11:28,630  -->  00:11:44,860
style....
129

129

00:11:44,860  -->  00:11:53,180
....you can see
the Blue is appearing on line 12
130

130

00:11:53,180  -->  00:11:58,380
the little to the right of the line number telling us that is what is going to be used if
131

131

00:11:58,380  -->  00:12:04,040
you run this to confirm you can see now the
label isn't occupying the entire width
132

132

00:12:04,040  -->  00:12:08,020
of the top position and you can see why
hasn't centered because it's only used the
133

133

00:12:08,020  -->  00:12:12,210
preferred width and just shown just useenough to make it
134

134

00:12:12,210  -->  00:12:15,830
fit so well understand why centering the text
didn't give us what we wanted so if we
135

135

00:12:15,830  -->  00:12:20,210
widen the window the label remains the
same size so if I try this you will see that
136

136

00:12:20,210  -->  00:12:24,640
nothing's changing the label isn't actually moving even though our buttons
137

137

00:12:24,640  -->  00:12:30,320
move when I'm resizing things so what we need to do is
center the label itself within the top
138

138

00:12:30,320  -->  00:12:35,070
position rather than centering its text
now as I mentioned earlier we can't set
139

139

00:12:35,070  -->  00:12:38,620
the alignment of the border pane itself
but we can set an alignment for each
140

140

00:12:38,620  -->  00:12:42,870
of its children so I'm going to use the border pane alignment property when we want to
141

141

00:12:42,870  -->  00:12:47,940
align a child within its position in the border pane so we set the border pane alignment to center for
142

142

00:12:47,940  -->  00:12:55,330
the label to so come down here to the
label and I'm going to type....
143

143

00:12:55,330  -->  00:13:03,670
...and now if we run it we should find it now that is centered you can see the text the label I should say is
144

144

00:13:03,670  -->  00:13:08,200
now centerd in the middle of the window
alright I'm gonna finish the video here in the
145

145

00:13:08,200  -->  00:13:12,500
next video we are gonna continue on talking a bit more
about border panes before we start
146

146

00:13:12,500  -->  00:13:15,260
looking at a few other layouts as well so see you in the next video
