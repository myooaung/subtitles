00:00:05.000  -->  00:00:07.040
alright so it's now time to code the
2

2

00:00:07.040  -->  00:00:09.520
various insert methods so let's start
3

3

00:00:09.520  -->  00:00:13.130
with the insert artist method and that's
4

4

00:00:13.130  -->  00:00:14.380
going to need the artist name so we're
5

5

00:00:14.380  -->  00:00:16.910
going down to the bottom here and start
6

6

00:00:16.910  -->  00:00:20.840
work on this so it's going to be...
7

7

00:00:20.840  -->  00:00:24.080
...
8

8

00:00:24.080  -->  00:01:04.600
...
9

9

00:01:04.600  -->  00:01:10.460
...in other
10

10

00:01:10.460  -->  00:01:12.110
words if we get a number back from our
11

11

00:01:12.110  -->  00:01:14.420
first query we know that in this case
12

12

00:01:14.420  -->  00:01:16.900
the artist is already on file so we're
13

13

00:01:16.900  -->  00:01:18.500
returning the id of the existing
14

14

00:01:18.500  -->  00:01:20.500
artist and exiting method because
15

15

00:01:20.500  -->  00:01:21.790
we don't actually need to insert the
16

16

00:01:21.790  -->  00:01:23.540
artist because they're already on file
17

17

00:01:23.540  -->  00:01:25.520
we get down to here we're going to put
18

18

00:01:25.520  -->  00:01:26.570
an else in here
19

19

00:01:26.570  -->  00:01:30.220
this means we need to insert the artist
20

20

00:01:30.220  -->  00:01:33.740
that's because they're not on file so to
21

21

00:01:33.740  -->  00:01:35.420
do that we're going to...
22

22

00:01:35.420  -->  00:01:40.400
...
23

23

00:01:40.400  -->  00:01:57.290
...
24

24

00:01:57.290  -->  00:01:59.900
so that should not only save the record
25

25

00:01:59.900  -->  00:02:02.390
it will actually tell us how many rows were
26

26

00:02:02.390  -->  00:02:04.880
updated in this case should only one and
27

27

00:02:04.880  -->  00:02:06.500
we do a test...
28

28

00:02:06.500  -->  00:02:09.200
....
29

29

00:02:09.200  -->  00:02:22.670
....
30

30

00:02:22.670  -->  00:02:25.010
alright so assuming we are down this far
31

31

00:02:25.010  -->  00:02:27.590
though we know that our record was
32

32

00:02:27.590  -->  00:02:29.480
successfully updated so we're going to
33

33

00:02:29.480  -->  00:02:29.990
do...
34

34

00:02:29.990  -->  00:02:34.400
....
35

35

00:02:34.400  -->  00:03:16.250
....
36

36

00:03:16.250  -->  00:03:19.070
...just going over what
37

37

00:03:19.070  -->  00:03:21.320
we've done again so the first thing we
38

38

00:03:21.320  -->  00:03:24.200
did is we actually queering the artist
39

39

00:03:24.200  -->  00:03:26.330
table to see if the artist already exists
40

40

00:03:26.330  -->  00:03:29.540
if it does then we return the ID that we
41

41

00:03:29.540  -->  00:03:32.630
retrieved from the result set and return
42

42

00:03:32.630  -->  00:03:34.040
the value because we no
43

43

00:03:34.040  -->  00:03:36.080
longer going to insert anything because we
44

44

00:03:36.080  -->  00:03:39.320
found the artist on file and it's going
45

45

00:03:39.320  -->  00:03:40.760
to be in column 1 by the way that's why
46

46

00:03:40.760  -->  00:03:43.510
using the dot get int 1 here we always
47

47

00:03:43.510  -->  00:03:45.110
know that that will be on column one since we
48

48

00:03:45.110  -->  00:03:47.120
created the prepared statement for the
49

49

00:03:47.120  -->  00:03:49.190
query we only ask that the ID column
50

50

00:03:49.190  -->  00:03:50.290
should be returned
51

51

00:03:50.290  -->  00:03:52.970
now in the case of the artist not being
52

52

00:03:52.970  -->  00:03:54.760
in the artist table we're going to
53

53

00:03:54.760  -->  00:03:56.030
insert the artist so the code flow
54

54

00:03:56.030  -->  00:03:58.940
comes through to here so we
55

55

00:03:58.940  -->  00:04:00.170
do a similar thing here we set the
56

56

00:04:00.170  -->  00:04:02.420
indicies to 1 and the name being the name
57

57

00:04:02.420  -->  00:04:04.640
of the artist we want to insert we then
58

58

00:04:04.640  -->  00:04:07.850
execute this line here on line 354
59

59

00:04:07.850  -->  00:04:10.010
now that we're not using the execute
60

60

00:04:10.010  -->  00:04:10.850
method here
61

61

00:04:10.850  -->  00:04:12.680
that's because the execute method
62

62

00:04:12.680  -->  00:04:15.380
returns a boolean indicating what type
63

63

00:04:15.380  -->  00:04:17.480
of result the executed sql statement
64

64

00:04:17.480  -->  00:04:20.630
return here using execute update because
65

65

00:04:20.630  -->  00:04:22.160
that returns the number of rows affected
66

66

00:04:22.160  -->  00:04:25.490
by the sql code that ran now since
67

67

00:04:25.490  -->  00:04:27.890
we're inserting a single row we actually
68

68

00:04:27.890  -->  00:04:30.350
expect only one record to be returned
69

69

00:04:30.350  -->  00:04:32.870
that's the code here and if it isn't
70

70

00:04:32.870  -->  00:04:35.450
we thrown an sqlexception obviously
71

71

00:04:35.450  -->  00:04:37.910
something's gone badly wrong if
72

72

00:04:37.910  -->  00:04:40.490
we've got a result that's a not equal to
73

73

00:04:40.490  -->  00:04:42.350
exactly one rows that have been
74

74

00:04:42.350  -->  00:04:45.500
created by the database failing that we
75

75

00:04:45.500  -->  00:04:48.080
get down to here and we used the get
76

76

00:04:48.080  -->  00:04:50.120
generated keys method to get a result
77

77

00:04:50.120  -->  00:04:53.240
set that contains the generated key so it
78

78

00:04:53.240  -->  00:04:55.040
can be keys depending on the insert in
79

79

00:04:55.040  -->  00:04:56.420
this case is just the one
80

80

00:04:56.420  -->  00:04:58.790
so get the key value the artist_id
81

81

00:04:58.790  -->  00:05:00.800
in this case by using
82

82

00:05:00.800  -->  00:05:03.260
this generated keys .get int
83

83

00:05:03.260  -->  00:05:05.300
result and again the key will be at
84

84

00:05:05.300  -->  00:05:08.180
position one since we only expect one key to
85

85

00:05:08.180  -->  00:05:10.550
be returned and finally what we've been
86

86

00:05:10.550  -->  00:05:13.070
doing is we're returning that value
87

87

00:05:13.070  -->  00:05:15.680
back to the caller and if no key was
88

88

00:05:15.680  -->  00:05:17.870
returned for some reason throwing an
89

89

00:05:17.870  -->  00:05:19.760
sqlexception that in theory shouldn't
90

90

00:05:19.760  -->  00:05:22.280
happen then obviously you have seen
91

91

00:05:22.280  -->  00:05:25.070
their that I'm throwing sqlexception in
92

92

00:05:25.070  -->  00:05:26.870
the method and that's because we want
93

93

00:05:26.870  -->  00:05:29.600
the caller to handle these and we'll see
94

94

00:05:29.600  -->  00:05:31.640
how this makes things cleaner in a
95

95

00:05:31.640  -->  00:05:34.310
little while so the query album
96

96

00:05:34.310  -->  00:05:36.050
method is pretty much the same except we
97

97

00:05:36.050  -->  00:05:37.640
have to change some variable names and
98

98

00:05:37.640  -->  00:05:40.010
messages we have to set two values in a
99

99

00:05:40.010  -->  00:05:41.660
prepared statement so what I'm going to
100

100

00:05:41.660  -->  00:05:44.180
do is take a copy of this method will
101

101

00:05:44.180  -->  00:05:45.410
just go through it carefully and make
102

102

00:05:45.410  -->  00:05:46.550
sure that we make all the necessary
103

103

00:05:46.550  -->  00:05:49.700
changes just to save typing and
104

104

00:05:49.700  -->  00:05:51.320
paste that in go back up to the top
105

105

00:05:51.320  -->  00:05:53.240
there and this one's going to being
106

106

00:05:53.240  -->  00:05:57.680
called the insert album so....
107

107

00:05:57.680  -->  00:06:01.310
this one's got two parameters the string
108

108

00:06:01.310  -->  00:06:03.740
name is the first one and the second one
109

109

00:06:03.740  -->  00:06:07.520
is the int artist ID the artist ID will
110

110

00:06:07.520  -->  00:06:10.310
come from the call from this instead of
111

111

00:06:10.310  -->  00:06:13.430
artist method so in terms of the code change
112

112

00:06:13.430  -->  00:06:15.230
the first bit is going to be the same
113

113

00:06:15.230  -->  00:06:16.910
i'm going to query instead of artists
114

114

00:06:16.910  -->  00:06:20.630
we going to query album...
115

115

00:06:20.630  -->  00:06:22.880
...so we are setting
116

116

00:06:22.880  -->  00:06:24.630
the name of the album we are searching for
117

117

00:06:24.630  -->  00:06:27.300
to the query album query and again
118

118

00:06:27.300  -->  00:06:31.380
I'll change this to query album so the
119

119

00:06:31.380  -->  00:06:32.910
results were looking to execute the same
120

120

00:06:32.910  -->  00:06:36.540
query results dot next returns the fact
121

121

00:06:36.540  -->  00:06:38.070
that there is a record their we're going
122

122

00:06:38.070  -->  00:06:40.110
eturn results . get int one that
123

123

00:06:40.110  -->  00:06:41.700
means that the albums already on file
124

124

00:06:41.700  -->  00:06:44.220
and will return the ID of the album to
125

125

00:06:44.220  -->  00:06:45.330
the calling method
126

126

00:06:45.330  -->  00:06:47.580
otherwise we go insert the album at this
127

127

00:06:47.580  -->  00:06:51.690
point instead insert into artists going
128

128

00:06:51.690  -->  00:06:56.040
to be insert into albums so the....
129

129

00:06:56.040  -->  00:06:57.630
...the first ones still
130

130

00:06:57.630  -->  00:07:00.840
correct one comma name but you also need a
131

131

00:07:00.840  -->  00:07:03.210
second one here and insert into albums
132

132

00:07:03.210  -->  00:07:06.210
again dot this time it's the key the
133

133

00:07:06.210  -->  00:07:11.850
artists key or artist ID....
134

134

00:07:11.850  -->  00:07:16.710
...
135

135

00:07:16.710  -->  00:07:26.430
...
136

136

00:07:26.430  -->  00:07:28.260
we're looking at the number of affected
137

137

00:07:28.260  -->  00:07:30.120
rows same deal with them even though
138

138

00:07:30.120  -->  00:07:32.550
we've got to filter updating we still
139

139

00:07:32.550  -->  00:07:35.130
only inserting one record so checking the
140

140

00:07:35.130  -->  00:07:36.300
same thing here to check that the
141

141

00:07:36.300  -->  00:07:38.760
affected rows is not equal to 1 i'm
142

142

00:07:38.760  -->  00:07:40.050
going to throw that sql exception
143

143

00:07:40.050  -->  00:07:42.840
and will change the error message to
144

144

00:07:42.840  -->  00:07:45.750
...
145

145

00:07:45.750  -->  00:07:50.370
...
146

146

00:07:50.370  -->  00:07:52.320
that is the key there if there is we're
147

147

00:07:52.320  -->  00:07:55.050
going to return the the first column that has
148

148

00:07:55.050  -->  00:07:56.490
returned from the key which will be the
149

149

00:07:56.490  -->  00:07:57.180
key
150

150

00:07:57.180  -->  00:07:59.040
basically the id for the inserted
151

151

00:07:59.040  -->  00:08:01.230
album record an put a note right here
152

152

00:08:01.230  -->  00:08:04.170
that album couldn't get id for album for
153

153

00:08:04.170  -->  00:08:07.710
some reason so lets go ahead and
154

154

00:08:07.710  -->  00:08:09.990
create the insert song method before we
155

155

00:08:09.990  -->  00:08:11.700
finish the video I'm going to a similar
156

156

00:08:11.700  -->  00:08:13.260
thing going to copy this case the
157

157

00:08:13.260  -->  00:08:17.940
insert album method and paste that in
158

158

00:08:17.940  -->  00:08:23.580
and then i'm going to call insert songs
159

159

00:08:23.580  -->  00:08:26.930
...
160

160

00:08:26.930  -->  00:08:29.690
perimeter is the title as the title
161

161

00:08:29.690  -->  00:08:32.000
of the song and we don't want artist id
162

162

00:08:32.000  -->  00:08:33.530
this time we actually want the name....
163

163

00:08:33.530  -->  00:08:37.640
...
164

164

00:08:37.640  -->  00:08:42.300
...
165

165

00:08:42.300  -->  00:08:44.720
...and do
166

166

00:08:44.720  -->  00:08:46.010
something a little bit different here so
167

167

00:08:46.010  -->  00:08:49.350
i'm going to change that we're not going to
168

168

00:08:49.350  -->  00:08:50.970
throw the exception so we're going to
169

169

00:08:50.970  -->  00:08:56.250
start off with is a try to wrap our code all in
170

170

00:08:56.250  -->  00:08:58.800
that...
171

171

00:08:58.800  -->  00:09:03.660
...
172

172

00:09:03.660  -->  00:10:06.950
...
173

173

00:10:06.950  -->  00:10:08.610
first we're going to do in the try block
174

174

00:10:08.610  -->  00:10:12.870
now we're going to do...
175

175

00:10:12.870  -->  00:10:14.610
...
176

176

00:10:14.610  -->  00:10:49.280
...
177

177

00:10:49.280  -->  00:10:53.120
ok so i'm going to copy this code
178

178

00:10:53.120  -->  00:10:55.550
because some of it will still be relevant
179

179

00:10:55.550  -->  00:10:58.370
so let's just copy this code to save typing
180

180

00:10:58.370  -->  00:11:03.890
just up to there and I'm gonna
181

181

00:11:03.890  -->  00:11:07.070
put that in the try after the...
182

182

00:11:07.070  -->  00:11:11.660
...alright so what
183

183

00:11:11.660  -->  00:11:14.120
we need to do first is we need to get the ID for the
184

184

00:11:14.120  -->  00:11:17.060
artist and the album based on the artist
185

185

00:11:17.060  -->  00:11:19.130
name and album name that have been
186

186

00:11:19.130  -->  00:11:21.980
passed this method so the wawhy we do that we
187

187

00:11:21.980  -->  00:11:27.650
can put int...
188

188

00:11:27.650  -->  00:11:30.980
...that is
189

189

00:11:30.980  -->  00:11:32.270
one of the methods we just wrote so it
190

190

00:11:32.270  -->  00:11:34.610
can return the ID either at the existing
191

191

00:11:34.610  -->  00:11:37.190
artist if it exists on file or the newly
192

192

00:11:37.190  -->  00:11:40.640
inserted record and secondly...
193

193

00:11:40.640  -->  00:11:45.080
ID is equal to insert album album
194

194

00:11:45.080  -->  00:11:47.870
....see how we
195

195

00:11:47.870  -->  00:11:50.870
are passing the artist ID to the insert
196

196

00:11:50.870  -->  00:11:52.940
album method and also passing album
197

197

00:11:52.940  -->  00:11:56.150
which is the album name we need to set
198

198

00:11:56.150  -->  00:11:59.000
the various fields for our insert...
199

199

00:11:59.000  -->  00:12:04.340
...
200

200

00:12:04.340  -->  00:12:30.180
...
201

201

00:12:30.180  -->  00:12:33.420
...we don't use the
202

202

00:12:33.420  -->  00:12:35.460
artist ID again because the artist ID
203

203

00:12:35.460  -->  00:12:38.070
was used to help us search for
204

204

00:12:38.070  -->  00:12:40.050
the album so we don't need to insert that into
205

205

00:12:40.050  -->  00:12:41.640
the songs because we're using the album
206

206

00:12:41.640  -->  00:12:45.510
ID at that point and then the code gonna
207

207

00:12:45.510  -->  00:12:47.790
get rid of some of these other code we need
208

208

00:12:47.790  -->  00:12:49.830
these queries anymore but what we do need
209

209

00:12:49.830  -->  00:12:54.020
though down here and execute our update
210

210

00:12:54.020  -->  00:12:57.830
so int affected rows is going to be
211

211

00:12:57.830  -->  00:13:00.480
inserted into songs . execute update
212

212

00:13:00.480  -->  00:13:05.880
...
213

213

00:13:05.880  -->  00:13:15.020
...
214

214

00:13:15.020  -->  00:13:16.500
that's doing a check to see whether
215

215

00:13:16.500  -->  00:13:18.390
we've got a number of rows back and if
216

216

00:13:18.390  -->  00:13:19.440
we haven't got one there's a problem
217

217

00:13:19.440  -->  00:13:20.850
we're actually not going to throw an
218

218

00:13:20.850  -->  00:13:23.850
exception we are going to do a different way...
219

219

00:13:23.850  -->  00:13:26.820
...
220

220

00:13:26.820  -->  00:13:46.170
...
221

221

00:13:46.170  -->  00:13:49.580
alright can see that's clean things up
222

222

00:13:49.580  -->  00:13:52.830
now so let's end the video here now in
223

223

00:13:52.830  -->  00:13:54.180
the next video we'll just go over what
224

224

00:13:54.180  -->  00:13:55.770
we've done for this insert song method
225

225

00:13:55.770  -->  00:13:57.330
then we'll get to the stage of actually
226

226

00:13:57.330  -->  00:13:59.130
trying out i'll see you in the next
227

227

00:13:59.130  -->  00:14:04.520
video
