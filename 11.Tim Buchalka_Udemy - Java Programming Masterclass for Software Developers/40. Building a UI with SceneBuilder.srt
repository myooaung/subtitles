00:00:05,500  -->  00:00:07,890
alright so it's time now to start seeing if
2

2

00:00:07,890  -->  00:00:09,610
we can build some sort of really basic
alright so it's time now to start seeing if
3

3

00:00:09,610  -->  00:00:12,670
user interface using scene builder so
we can build some sort of really basic
4

4

00:00:12,670  -->  00:00:14,860
what I'm going to do is with scene builder
user interface using scene builder so
5

5

00:00:14,860  -->  00:00:16,840
opened the scene builder
what I'm going to do is with scene builder
6

6

00:00:16,840  -->  00:00:19,380
tab opened going to drag some controls
opened the scene builder
7

7

00:00:19,380  -->  00:00:22,150
over so will click on controls and select
tab opened going to drag some controls
8

8

00:00:22,150  -->  00:00:25,330
the button and drag that in release
over so will click on controls and select
9

9

00:00:25,330  -->  00:00:28,900
the mouse like so they're going to
the button and drag that in release
10

10

00:00:28,900  -->  00:00:30,690
do the same for two more buttons i'm going to
the mouse like so they're going to
11

11

00:00:30,690  -->  00:00:31,810
click on
do the same for two more buttons i'm going to
12

12

00:00:31,810  -->  00:00:33,970
the button again drag it over to the
click on
13

13

00:00:33,970  -->  00:00:37,360
right of the first button release and do
the button again drag it over to the
14

14

00:00:37,360  -->  00:00:39,340
the same for third button on the
right of the first button release and do
15

15

00:00:39,340  -->  00:00:41,620
right-hand side move over move to the
the same for third button on the
16

16

00:00:41,620  -->  00:00:43,320
right hand side of the second button and
right-hand side move over move to the
17

17

00:00:43,320  -->  00:00:45,300
release and you can see we now got
right hand side of the second button and
18

18

00:00:45,300  -->  00:00:49,320
three buttons and note that the row and
release and you can see we now got
19

19

00:00:49,320  -->  00:00:50,920
column indicators are appearing now for
three buttons and note that the row and
20

20

00:00:50,920  -->  00:00:52,930
the grid pane and also the reference
column indicators are appearing now for
21

21

00:00:52,930  -->  00:00:54,370
here is changed to say that it's
the grid pane and also the reference
22

22

00:00:54,370  -->  00:00:56,730
consuming one row theirs now three elements
here is changed to say that it's
23

23

00:00:56,730  -->  00:01:00,780
in this case buttons 0 to 2 so let's
consuming one row theirs now three elements
24

24

00:01:00,780  -->  00:01:02,680
change the text now offer each for
in this case buttons 0 to 2 so let's
25

25

00:01:02,680  -->  00:01:04,440
to make it easy to know which button
change the text now offer each for
26

26

00:01:04,440  -->  00:01:06,870
we're dealing with now you can select the
to make it easy to know which button
27

27

00:01:06,870  -->  00:01:09,360
buttons into ways we can click on it
we're dealing with now you can select the
28

28

00:01:09,360  -->  00:01:10,930
within the content area like here for
buttons into ways we can click on it
29

29

00:01:10,930  -->  00:01:13,420
example the second button or i can
within the content area like here for
30

30

00:01:13,420  -->  00:01:14,830
notice when I do that that actually
example the second button or i can
31

31

00:01:14,830  -->  00:01:17,170
just selected here in the scene graph
notice when I do that that actually
32

32

00:01:17,170  -->  00:01:17,890
area
just selected here in the scene graph
33

33

00:01:17,890  -->  00:01:19,240
alternatively i can just click
area
34

34

00:01:19,240  -->  00:01:20,400
on there as well either way will
alternatively i can just click
35

35

00:01:20,400  -->  00:01:22,390
actually select the button once we've
on there as well either way will
36

36

00:01:22,390  -->  00:01:24,610
done that up here where the text is
actually select the button once we've
37

37

00:01:24,610  -->  00:01:27,250
showing as button going to change that
done that up here where the text is
38

38

00:01:27,250  -->  00:01:30,640
to ok and press enter and notice that the
showing as button going to change that
39

39

00:01:30,640  -->  00:01:32,110
user interface is updated to reflect
to ok and press enter and notice that the
40

40

00:01:32,110  -->  00:01:34,270
that also the scene graph on the left
user interface is updated to reflect
41

41

00:01:34,270  -->  00:01:36,570
hand side is updated to reflect that and
that also the scene graph on the left
42

42

00:01:36,570  -->  00:01:38,170
just if you're not seeing that make sure
hand side is updated to reflect that and
43

43

00:01:38,170  -->  00:01:39,700
you've got properties if you happen
just if you're not seeing that make sure
44

44

00:01:39,700  -->  00:01:42,150
to have layout open you'd see that so you
you've got properties if you happen
45

45

00:01:42,150  -->  00:01:43,450
click on properties because we want
to have layout open you'd see that so you
46

46

00:01:43,450  -->  00:01:45,700
to actually update those let's update
click on properties because we want
47

47

00:01:45,700  -->  00:01:48,570
the other two can will actually add the
to actually update those let's update
48

48

00:01:48,570  -->  00:01:51,900
text canceled for the second button and
the other two can will actually add the
49

49

00:01:51,900  -->  00:01:53,040
for the third button
text canceled for the second button and
50

50

00:01:53,040  -->  00:01:56,760
let's make that one help
for the third button
51

51

00:01:56,760  -->  00:01:59,070
so lets now switch back to the text
let's make that one help
52

52

00:01:59,070  -->  00:02:01,590
tab to see the code that scene
so lets now switch back to the text
53

53

00:02:01,590  -->  00:02:05,820
builder has generated and looking at
tab to see the code that scene
54

54

00:02:05,820  -->  00:02:07,410
that you can see that it's different
builder has generated and looking at
55

55

00:02:07,410  -->  00:02:09,270
from the code that we write by hand
that you can see that it's different
56

56

00:02:09,270  -->  00:02:12,510
it's actually very verbose and also
from the code that we write by hand
57

57

00:02:12,510  -->  00:02:14,190
note that scene builder has generated
it's actually very verbose and also
58

58

00:02:14,190  -->  00:02:17,730
some optional elements also since we
note that scene builder has generated
59

59

00:02:17,730  -->  00:02:20,250
only have one row it's actually relying
some optional elements also since we
60

60

00:02:20,250  -->  00:02:22,950
on just the default values for some of
only have one row it's actually relying
61

61

00:02:22,950  -->  00:02:25,290
the grid pane . row index and grid pane .
on just the default values for some of
62

62

00:02:25,290  -->  00:02:26,790
column index settings are not
the grid pane . row index and grid pane .
63

63

00:02:26,790  -->  00:02:29,160
specifically specified as we did in the
column index settings are not
64

64

00:02:29,160  -->  00:02:31,380
case of our code when were actually coding
specifically specified as we did in the
65

65

00:02:31,380  -->  00:02:32,220
it by head
case of our code when were actually coding
66

66

00:02:32,220  -->  00:02:35,850
let's go back to scene builder again
it by head
67

67

00:02:35,850  -->  00:02:37,410
now if it's not already selected in my
let's go back to scene builder again
68

68

00:02:37,410  -->  00:02:39,510
cases its not click on the grid pane over
now if it's not already selected in my
69

69

00:02:39,510  -->  00:02:42,360
here to the left and when I selected
cases its not click on the grid pane over
70

70

00:02:42,360  -->  00:02:44,610
the grid pane the color of the row
here to the left and when I selected
71

71

00:02:44,610  -->  00:02:47,070
column indicators changes to let us know
the grid pane the color of the row
72

72

00:02:47,070  -->  00:02:48,510
that we're now going to be working on the
column indicators changes to let us know
73

73

00:02:48,510  -->  00:02:51,360
grid pane itself and so what I can then
that we're now going to be working on the
74

74

00:02:51,360  -->  00:02:52,980
do is click on this button over here to
grid pane itself and so what I can then
75

75

00:02:52,980  -->  00:02:56,450
the left the row 0 indicator which is
do is click on this button over here to
76

76

00:02:56,450  -->  00:02:58,140
at the left of the ok button if click on
the left the row 0 indicator which is
77

77

00:02:58,140  -->  00:03:00,200
that you see that the settings area
at the left of the ok button if click on
78

78

00:03:00,200  -->  00:03:02,700
displays the row constraints
that you see that the settings area
79

79

00:03:02,700  -->  00:03:05,430
for that row if i click on the zero tab
displays the row constraints
80

80

00:03:05,430  -->  00:03:08,850
above the button notice how the column contraints
for that row if i click on the zero tab
81

81

00:03:08,850  -->  00:03:11,400
are now showing in the settings
above the button notice how the column contraints
82

82

00:03:11,400  -->  00:03:13,200
pane on the right hand side so if we
are now showing in the settings
83

83

00:03:13,200  -->  00:03:14,480
want to change the row or column
pane on the right hand side so if we
84

84

00:03:14,480  -->  00:03:15,660
constraints
want to change the row or column
85

85

00:03:15,660  -->  00:03:17,370
that's how you actually get to them
constraints
86

86

00:03:17,370  -->  00:03:19,760
alright so let's see what happens now if
that's how you actually get to them
87

87

00:03:19,760  -->  00:03:22,500
we add a label above the buttons so i'm
alright so let's see what happens now if
88

88

00:03:22,500  -->  00:03:25,650
going to do is open this controls and
we add a label above the buttons so i'm
89

89

00:03:25,650  -->  00:03:28,110
grab a label got
going to do is open this controls and
90

90

00:03:28,110  -->  00:03:29,550
a place above the ok button i'm just
grab a label got
91

91

00:03:29,550  -->  00:03:32,430
going to drag it over and place it above
a place above the ok button i'm just
92

92

00:03:32,430  -->  00:03:37,950
the ok button somewhere so you can see that
going to drag it over and place it above
93

93

00:03:37,950  -->  00:03:40,080
when I've done that the row index for
the ok button somewhere so you can see that
94

94

00:03:40,080  -->  00:03:42,150
the buttons is now been updated the
when I've done that the row index for
95

95

00:03:42,150  -->  00:03:43,620
buttons are now in the second row this
the buttons is now been updated the
96

96

00:03:43,620  -->  00:03:47,280
one down here at row index 1 alright so
buttons are now in the second row this
97

97

00:03:47,280  -->  00:03:49,080
with the label selected I'm going to
one down here at row index 1 alright so
98

98

00:03:49,080  -->  00:03:51,260
click here i'm going to click over here
with the label selected I'm going to
99

99

00:03:51,260  -->  00:03:53,910
to the left hand side to change its
click here i'm going to click over here
100

100

00:03:53,910  -->  00:03:55,800
properties or select this display its
to the left hand side to change its
101

101

00:03:55,800  -->  00:03:58,980
properties and change the text going to
properties or select this display its
102

102

00:03:58,980  -->  00:04:03,330
call that my label instead that's
properties and change the text going to
103

103

00:04:03,330  -->  00:04:05,630
reflected now as you can see on screen
call that my label instead that's
104

104

00:04:05,630  -->  00:04:07,670
and we go back to our text and take a
reflected now as you can see on screen
105

105

00:04:07,670  -->  00:04:11,840
look notice that the fmx generated by
and we go back to our text and take a
106

106

00:04:11,840  -->  00:04:13,460
the scene builder as we notice before
look notice that the fmx generated by
107

107

00:04:13,460  -->  00:04:16,370
it's still relying on default values so
the scene builder as we notice before
108

108

00:04:16,370  -->  00:04:18,230
the default value for grid pane . row
it's still relying on default values so
109

109

00:04:18,230  -->  00:04:20,230
index and grid pane . column index is 0
the default value for grid pane . row
110

110

00:04:20,230  -->  00:04:22,940
and there's no obviously row index or
index and grid pane . column index is 0
111

111

00:04:22,940  -->  00:04:24,290
column index specified for that
and there's no obviously row index or
112

112

00:04:24,290  -->  00:04:26,750
label now scene buidler doesn't generate
column index specified for that
113

113

00:04:26,750  -->  00:04:28,700
these properties for the label because
label now scene buidler doesn't generate
114

114

00:04:28,700  -->  00:04:30,620
it's at position 0 comma 0
these properties for the label because
115

115

00:04:30,620  -->  00:04:32,420
it also doesn't generate the column
it's at position 0 comma 0
116

116

00:04:32,420  -->  00:04:34,760
index for the ok button because it's at
it also doesn't generate the column
117

117

00:04:34,760  -->  00:04:37,550
column 0 so unfortunately this makes the
index for the ok button because it's at
118

118

00:04:37,550  -->  00:04:39,950
FXml more difficult to read because we
column 0 so unfortunately this makes the
119

119

00:04:39,950  -->  00:04:41,180
have to fill in the blank ourselves
FXml more difficult to read because we
120

120

00:04:41,180  -->  00:04:43,400
generally speaking it's better to spell
have to fill in the blank ourselves
121

121

00:04:43,400  -->  00:04:45,410
out all the properties and we obviously
generally speaking it's better to spell
122

122

00:04:45,410  -->  00:04:47,000
had been doing that and I've been
out all the properties and we obviously
123

123

00:04:47,000  -->  00:04:48,110
showing you how to do that when we've
had been doing that and I've been
124

124

00:04:48,110  -->  00:04:49,310
been writing fxml ourselves
showing you how to do that when we've
125

125

00:04:49,310  -->  00:04:51,770
in the case of scene builder it's using
been writing fxml ourselves
126

126

00:04:51,770  -->  00:04:53,840
these default properties
in the case of scene builder it's using
127

127

00:04:53,840  -->  00:04:55,040
alright so let's go back to scene builder
these default properties
128

128

00:04:55,040  -->  00:04:58,790
again notice the scene graph
alright so let's go back to scene builder
129

129

00:04:58,790  -->  00:05:00,620
area list all the controls we added on
again notice the scene graph
130

130

00:05:00,620  -->  00:05:03,110
the left-hand side here now to see what
area list all the controls we added on
131

131

00:05:03,110  -->  00:05:04,940
the graphic the grid pane ui
the left-hand side here now to see what
132

132

00:05:04,940  -->  00:05:06,890
when we run we just have to click
the graphic the grid pane ui
133

133

00:05:06,890  -->  00:05:08,690
on an empty part of the content area to
when we run we just have to click
134

134

00:05:08,690  -->  00:05:11,090
remove the row column indices in my case
on an empty part of the content area to
135

135

00:05:11,090  -->  00:05:13,310
just going back to the screen and reset
remove the row column indices in my case
136

136

00:05:13,310  -->  00:05:14,510
it and that's actually showing this is
just going back to the screen and reset
137

137

00:05:14,510  -->  00:05:16,580
basically representation at the moment
it and that's actually showing this is
138

138

00:05:16,580  -->  00:05:18,170
of what it would look like if we
basically representation at the moment
139

139

00:05:18,170  -->  00:05:20,810
actually run now since the label is
of what it would look like if we
140

140

00:05:20,810  -->  00:05:23,330
wider than the ok button is now more
actually run now since the label is
141

141

00:05:23,330  -->  00:05:26,090
space between the buttons and as we
wider than the ok button is now more
142

142

00:05:26,090  -->  00:05:27,980
typically do let's actually put the
space between the buttons and as we
143

143

00:05:27,980  -->  00:05:31,100
buttons into a h box by dragging a
typically do let's actually put the
144

144

00:05:31,100  -->  00:05:34,190
h box over the buttons so i'm going
buttons into a h box by dragging a
145

145

00:05:34,190  -->  00:05:35,900
to actually do that going to get a h box
h box over the buttons so i'm going
146

146

00:05:35,900  -->  00:05:43,790
and drag it over the buttons noting that
to actually do that going to get a h box
147

147

00:05:43,790  -->  00:05:45,230
I'm just selecting that area they're
and drag it over the buttons noting that
148

148

00:05:45,230  -->  00:05:48,800
releasing but you can see at the moment
I'm just selecting that area they're
149

149

00:05:48,800  -->  00:05:51,500
the h box hasn't wrapped the buttons
releasing but you can see at the moment
150

150

00:05:51,500  -->  00:05:53,990
instead it's actually added itself as
the h box hasn't wrapped the buttons
151

151

00:05:53,990  -->  00:05:55,370
you can see over here the scene pane and
instead it's actually added itself as
152

152

00:05:55,370  -->  00:05:58,370
we can see on screen at row index one
you can see over here the scene pane and
153

153

00:05:58,370  -->  00:06:00,290
column index one and just to confirm
we can see on screen at row index one
154

154

00:06:00,290  -->  00:06:03,230
that we get back to the text view and see
column index one and just to confirm
155

155

00:06:03,230  -->  00:06:05,030
that it's added itself column index one
that we get back to the text view and see
156

156

00:06:05,030  -->  00:06:08,000
row index one that isn't what we want we
that it's added itself column index one
157

157

00:06:08,000  -->  00:06:10,280
want the h box to go to row index one
row index one that isn't what we want we
158

158

00:06:10,280  -->  00:06:12,710
column index zero we want the buttons
want the h box to go to row index one
159

159

00:06:12,710  -->  00:06:14,690
added to the h box rather than added
column index zero we want the buttons
160

160

00:06:14,690  -->  00:06:16,020
directly to a grid pane
added to the h box rather than added
161

161

00:06:16,020  -->  00:06:19,110
let's get back to the scene builder and
directly to a grid pane
162

162

00:06:19,110  -->  00:06:20,880
what we're going to do is right-click
let's get back to the scene builder and
163

163

00:06:20,880  -->  00:06:24,360
the h box over here in the scene graph and
what we're going to do is right-click
164

164

00:06:24,360  -->  00:06:26,490
select delete to remove it
the h box over here in the scene graph and
165

165

00:06:26,490  -->  00:06:29,370
that's now deleted so how do
select delete to remove it
166

166

00:06:29,370  -->  00:06:30,540
we actually achieve this how do we
that's now deleted so how do
167

167

00:06:30,540  -->  00:06:31,740
actually get those buttons wrapped
we actually achieve this how do we
168

168

00:06:31,740  -->  00:06:32,850
within a h box
actually get those buttons wrapped
169

169

00:06:32,850  -->  00:06:36,240
well there's two ways to do this so we
within a h box
170

170

00:06:36,240  -->  00:06:37,590
can actually select all three buttons in
well there's two ways to do this so we
171

171

00:06:37,590  -->  00:06:39,990
the scene graph area and we can select
can actually select all three buttons in
172

172

00:06:39,990  -->  00:06:41,730
three buttons clicking on the first
the scene graph area and we can select
173

173

00:06:41,730  -->  00:06:44,130
button holding down shift and selecting
three buttons clicking on the first
174

174

00:06:44,130  -->  00:06:45,660
the third one and that's actually going
button holding down shift and selecting
175

175

00:06:45,660  -->  00:06:47,160
to highlight the three of them or i can
the third one and that's actually going
176

176

00:06:47,160  -->  00:06:49,860
also individually click on my command
to highlight the three of them or i can
177

177

00:06:49,860  -->  00:06:52,020
key to select them and you could use a
also individually click on my command
178

178

00:06:52,020  -->  00:06:55,350
ctrl key for windows or linux so
key to select them and you could use a
179

179

00:06:55,350  -->  00:06:56,580
basically want to select the three that
ctrl key for windows or linux so
180

180

00:06:56,580  -->  00:06:58,800
way and the other way of doing it would
basically want to select the three that
181

181

00:06:58,800  -->  00:07:00,750
be just to selected just too select
way and the other way of doing it would
182

182

00:07:00,750  -->  00:07:02,760
them here same principle holding a
be just to selected just too select
183

183

00:07:02,760  -->  00:07:04,890
command because i'm on a mac and you do
them here same principle holding a
184

184

00:07:04,890  -->  00:07:06,930
a similar thing with ctrl key on Windows
command because i'm on a mac and you do
185

185

00:07:06,930  -->  00:07:09,000
or Linux to select the three buttons
a similar thing with ctrl key on Windows
186

186

00:07:09,000  -->  00:07:10,590
at this point we've now got the three
or Linux to select the three buttons
187

187

00:07:10,590  -->  00:07:13,710
buttons selected in the scene graph
at this point we've now got the three
188

188

00:07:13,710  -->  00:07:15,270
and in the content area as you can see
buttons selected in the scene graph
189

189

00:07:15,270  -->  00:07:18,600
we then actually hover over that right
and in the content area as you can see
190

190

00:07:18,600  -->  00:07:20,850
click over here in the scene graph actually
we then actually hover over that right
191

191

00:07:20,850  -->  00:07:23,760
click select rather wrap in and then we
click over here in the scene graph actually
192

192

00:07:23,760  -->  00:07:26,400
gotta choose h box so go ahead and do
click select rather wrap in and then we
193

193

00:07:26,400  -->  00:07:30,210
that h box when we did that you can
gotta choose h box so go ahead and do
194

194

00:07:30,210  -->  00:07:33,120
see that the layout got screwed up if
that h box when we did that you can
195

195

00:07:33,120  -->  00:07:35,070
we switch back to the text view and have
see that the layout got screwed up if
196

196

00:07:35,070  -->  00:07:37,230
a look you can see that everything's
we switch back to the text view and have
197

197

00:07:37,230  -->  00:07:40,770
been placed in a single row so the point
a look you can see that everything's
198

198

00:07:40,770  -->  00:07:42,390
going to make here to you is that scene
been placed in a single row so the point
199

199

00:07:42,390  -->  00:07:45,060
builder isn't perfect so let's go
going to make here to you is that scene
200

200

00:07:45,060  -->  00:07:46,290
back to the scene builder and see if we
builder isn't perfect so let's go
201

201

00:07:46,290  -->  00:07:48,960
can fix this but do notice just over here
back to the scene builder and see if we
202

202

00:07:48,960  -->  00:07:50,880
now that I can click on the + and the
can fix this but do notice just over here
203

203

00:07:50,880  -->  00:07:52,440
three buttons are certainly in the h
now that I can click on the + and the
204

204

00:07:52,440  -->  00:07:54,360
box but again we've got this display
three buttons are certainly in the h
205

205

00:07:54,360  -->  00:07:55,830
issue so how do we actually go about
box but again we've got this display
206

206

00:07:55,830  -->  00:07:58,050
fixing that we're going to select the
issue so how do we actually go about
207

207

00:07:58,050  -->  00:07:59,910
h box over here in the scene graph
fixing that we're going to select the
208

208

00:07:59,910  -->  00:08:02,430
and we need to set it row index and
h box over here in the scene graph
209

209

00:08:02,430  -->  00:08:03,810
column index properties to what we need
and we need to set it row index and
210

210

00:08:03,810  -->  00:08:05,130
to do is come over and click on layout
column index properties to what we need
211

211

00:08:05,130  -->  00:08:08,220
you can see the row index and
to do is come over and click on layout
212

212

00:08:08,220  -->  00:08:09,420
column index will just make a little
you can see the row index and
213

213

00:08:09,420  -->  00:08:13,380
wider are both set to 0 at the moment so we're
column index will just make a little
214

214

00:08:13,380  -->  00:08:15,090
going to set the row index here to 1
wider are both set to 0 at the moment so we're
215

215

00:08:15,090  -->  00:08:21,090
press enter and we can see now that the UI
going to set the row index here to 1
216

216

00:08:21,090  -->  00:08:22,530
will look the way that we want to look
press enter and we can see now that the UI
217

217

00:08:22,530  -->  00:08:24,720
and there when we look at the scene graph
will look the way that we want to look
218

218

00:08:24,720  -->  00:08:26,220
area you can see that the h box over
and there when we look at the scene graph
219

219

00:08:26,220  -->  00:08:29,180
here has been expanded to show
area you can see that the h box over
220

220

00:08:29,180  -->  00:08:31,610
the buttons and collapsed hide the
here has been expanded to show
221

221

00:08:31,610  -->  00:08:32,990
buttons would also like to do that if we
the buttons and collapsed hide the
222

222

00:08:32,990  -->  00:08:36,890
want to expand all or hide them and
buttons would also like to do that if we
223

223

00:08:36,890  -->  00:08:39,080
again the main thing is that interface
want to expand all or hide them and
224

224

00:08:39,080  -->  00:08:41,150
and click something somewhere outside of
again the main thing is that interface
225

225

00:08:41,150  -->  00:08:43,880
our controls we can see that we got our
and click something somewhere outside of
226

226

00:08:43,880  -->  00:08:45,920
three buttons showing nicely and
our controls we can see that we got our
227

227

00:08:45,920  -->  00:08:48,800
they're actually in the h box now one
three buttons showing nicely and
228

228

00:08:48,800  -->  00:08:50,990
caution here if we did decide at
they're actually in the h box now one
229

229

00:08:50,990  -->  00:08:52,670
this point I don't want these buttons in
caution here if we did decide at
230

230

00:08:52,670  -->  00:08:54,620
a h box if you thought that you
this point I don't want these buttons in
231

231

00:08:54,620  -->  00:08:55,910
actually just come over here and click
a h box if you thought that you
232

232

00:08:55,910  -->  00:08:57,650
on the h box right click and select
actually just come over here and click
233

233

00:08:57,650  -->  00:08:59,780
delete which i'm not going to do now
on the h box right click and select
234

234

00:08:59,780  -->  00:09:02,420
that would actually delete the container
delete which i'm not going to do now
235

235

00:09:02,420  -->  00:09:04,370
and the three buttons which you probably
that would actually delete the container
236

236

00:09:04,370  -->  00:09:06,590
definitely wouldn't want to do now there
and the three buttons which you probably
237

237

00:09:06,590  -->  00:09:08,600
is a there is also undo capabilities
definitely wouldn't want to do now there
238

238

00:09:08,600  -->  00:09:11,300
here and so I was going to show you that
is a there is also undo capabilities
239

239

00:09:11,300  -->  00:09:12,710
by actually clicking it and
here and so I was going to show you that
240

240

00:09:12,710  -->  00:09:15,110
selecting undo but unfortunately the
by actually clicking it and
241

241

00:09:15,110  -->  00:09:16,940
mac version undo seems to be broken
selecting undo but unfortunately the
242

242

00:09:16,940  -->  00:09:18,710
because every time i do that
mac version undo seems to be broken
243

243

00:09:18,710  -->  00:09:20,360
intellij seems to lock up and go a
because every time i do that
244

244

00:09:20,360  -->  00:09:22,340
little bit weird so I'm not gonna try to undo
intellij seems to lock up and go a
245

245

00:09:22,340  -->  00:09:24,140
ut you could actually try
little bit weird so I'm not gonna try to undo
246

246

00:09:24,140  -->  00:09:25,580
doing it and see whether it works just
ut you could actually try
247

247

00:09:25,580  -->  00:09:27,980
right click click on delete and once
doing it and see whether it works just
248

248

00:09:27,980  -->  00:09:29,780
you've done that you could do a command
right click click on delete and once
249

249

00:09:29,780  -->  00:09:31,790
z to undo on a mac or control z
you've done that you could do a command
250

250

00:09:31,790  -->  00:09:34,280
on a windows or linux machine or come
z to undo on a mac or control z
251

251

00:09:34,280  -->  00:09:35,720
up here and click on undo
on a windows or linux machine or come
252

252

00:09:35,720  -->  00:09:37,280
but again I'm not going to do that now
up here and click on undo
253

253

00:09:37,280  -->  00:09:40,100
because on my mac it seems to hang bottom
but again I'm not going to do that now
254

254

00:09:40,100  -->  00:09:41,450
line here is that you're deleting
because on my mac it seems to hang bottom
255

255

00:09:41,450  -->  00:09:43,640
container that's got embedded
line here is that you're deleting
256

256

00:09:43,640  -->  00:09:45,890
controls you are going to delete
container that's got embedded
257

257

00:09:45,890  -->  00:09:47,660
everything selected so be
controls you are going to delete
258

258

00:09:47,660  -->  00:09:49,190
very careful when you're selecting that
everything selected so be
259

259

00:09:49,190  -->  00:09:51,830
so how do you remove them well if you
very careful when you're selecting that
260

260

00:09:51,830  -->  00:09:53,570
want to actually remove them out of the hbox
so how do you remove them well if you
261

261

00:09:53,570  -->  00:09:55,760
instead what you do is you click on
want to actually remove them out of the hbox
262

262

00:09:55,760  -->  00:09:58,400
the h box you right click and click on
instead what you do is you click on
263

263

00:09:58,400  -->  00:10:00,410
unwrapped and that would actually take
the h box you right click and click on
264

264

00:10:00,410  -->  00:10:02,780
them out so I can do that now and you
unwrapped and that would actually take
265

265

00:10:02,780  -->  00:10:04,070
can see that's actually remove them from
them out so I can do that now and you
266

266

00:10:04,070  -->  00:10:05,270
the h box that h box has
can see that's actually remove them from
267

267

00:10:05,270  -->  00:10:07,460
disappeared completely from our layout
the h box that h box has
268

268

00:10:07,460  -->  00:10:09,920
in this case so i actually want
disappeared completely from our layout
269

269

00:10:09,920  -->  00:10:12,950
it back so lets actually fix this
in this case so i actually want
270

270

00:10:12,950  -->  00:10:14,690
up first we go back and change our
it back so lets actually fix this
271

271

00:10:14,690  -->  00:10:16,610
buttons which now actually in the
up first we go back and change our
272

272

00:10:16,610  -->  00:10:18,650
wrong row so let's put changes back to
buttons which now actually in the
273

273

00:10:18,650  -->  00:10:28,000
one we just add the h box back
wrong row so let's put changes back to
274

274

00:10:28,000  -->  00:10:30,010
and what I should probably been doing
one we just add the h box back
275

275

00:10:30,010  -->  00:10:32,110
they're changing the column index to 2
and what I should probably been doing
276

276

00:10:32,110  -->  00:10:34,540
i'll do that to column 2 for the third
they're changing the column index to 2
277

277

00:10:34,540  -->  00:10:35,980
button for the second button change that
i'll do that to column 2 for the third
278

278

00:10:35,980  -->  00:10:40,240
to column index 1 alright so we're got our
button for the second button change that
279

279

00:10:40,240  -->  00:10:41,590
interface back here we had it again
to column index 1 alright so we're got our
280

280

00:10:41,590  -->  00:10:43,570
and we got this spacing issues
interface back here we had it again
281

281

00:10:43,570  -->  00:10:45,310
which are we going to be addressing in
and we got this spacing issues
282

282

00:10:45,310  -->  00:10:47,440
the next video but we go back and
which are we going to be addressing in
283

283

00:10:47,440  -->  00:10:50,260
add our hbox again come back here we can add
the next video but we go back and
284

284

00:10:50,260  -->  00:10:53,890
it and and that still not how we
add our hbox again come back here we can add
285

285

00:10:53,890  -->  00:10:56,320
want it and the moment it's not
it and and that still not how we
286

286

00:10:56,320  -->  00:10:57,700
wrapping so I'm just going to
want it and the moment it's not
287

287

00:10:57,700  -->  00:11:02,140
delete that and use the mechanism i
wrapping so I'm just going to
288

288

00:11:02,140  -->  00:11:04,060
recommend which is selecting the three
delete that and use the mechanism i
289

289

00:11:04,060  -->  00:11:08,140
buttons right clicking wrapping h box
recommend which is selecting the three
290

290

00:11:08,140  -->  00:11:10,330
then we need to do that last change
buttons right clicking wrapping h box
291

291

00:11:10,330  -->  00:11:13,210
which was changed the row index for the h box
then we need to do that last change
292

292

00:11:13,210  -->  00:11:16,750
to 1 and that leaves it wrap in a h box
which was changed the row index for the h box
293

293

00:11:16,750  -->  00:11:21,250
ok let's now select the ok button again
to 1 and that leaves it wrap in a h box
294

294

00:11:21,250  -->  00:11:23,860
i can click on here or i can expand this
ok let's now select the ok button again
295

295

00:11:23,860  -->  00:11:25,930
window over here in the scene graph
i can click on here or i can expand this
296

296

00:11:25,930  -->  00:11:28,240
expand the container should say click on
window over here in the scene graph
297

297

00:11:28,240  -->  00:11:30,910
ok so we've got the property showing now
expand the container should say click on
298

298

00:11:30,910  -->  00:11:33,220
button isn't a layout but it still has
ok so we've got the property showing now
299

299

00:11:33,220  -->  00:11:36,040
the layout area therefore controls we
button isn't a layout but it still has
300

300

00:11:36,040  -->  00:11:38,260
can use this area to set properties that
the layout area therefore controls we
301

301

00:11:38,260  -->  00:11:40,660
influence how the control behaves within
can use this area to set properties that
302

302

00:11:40,660  -->  00:11:43,240
its parent container now for containers
influence how the control behaves within
303

303

00:11:43,240  -->  00:11:45,670
the properties in the layout area affect
its parent container now for containers
304

304

00:11:45,670  -->  00:11:47,230
how the container is laid out within its
the properties in the layout area affect
305

305

00:11:47,230  -->  00:11:49,600
parent or how controls are laid out
how the container is laid out within its
306

306

00:11:49,600  -->  00:11:51,760
within the container that's actually
parent or how controls are laid out
307

307

00:11:51,760  -->  00:11:54,190
change the ok button the margin so what
within the container that's actually
308

308

00:11:54,190  -->  00:11:56,470
I'm going to do is over here now the
change the ok button the margin so what
309

309

00:11:56,470  -->  00:11:57,820
little graph i'm going to really expand
I'm going to do is over here now the
310

310

00:11:57,820  -->  00:11:59,410
this on the screen really quite largely
little graph i'm going to really expand
311

311

00:11:59,410  -->  00:12:01,240
you can see it we got these 4 little
this on the screen really quite largely
312

312

00:12:01,240  -->  00:12:03,820
fields here and notice that the little
you can see it we got these 4 little
313

313

00:12:03,820  -->  00:12:05,740
graphic above each input box is telling
fields here and notice that the little
314

314

00:12:05,740  -->  00:12:07,630
us which margin is going to set so
graphic above each input box is telling
315

315

00:12:07,630  -->  00:12:08,770
that's obviously the first one is the
us which margin is going to set so
316

316

00:12:08,770  -->  00:12:10,960
top margin the right margin the bottom
that's obviously the first one is the
317

317

00:12:10,960  -->  00:12:13,660
margin and the left margin going to the
top margin the right margin the bottom
318

318

00:12:13,660  -->  00:12:15,670
enter the value of five in the second box one here
margin and the left margin going to the
319

319

00:12:15,670  -->  00:12:18,670
which is the right margin if i do that
enter the value of five in the second box one here
320

320

00:12:18,670  -->  00:12:22,210
press ENTER we notice we now got a
which is the right margin if i do that
321

321

00:12:22,210  -->  00:12:24,850
space between the ok button and the
press ENTER we notice we now got a
322

322

00:12:24,850  -->  00:12:27,190
cancel button that's because i added 5
space between the ok button and the
323

323

00:12:27,190  -->  00:12:29,620
pixel margin to the right of the ok
cancel button that's because i added 5
324

324

00:12:29,620  -->  00:12:31,930
button so that actually put some space
pixel margin to the right of the ok
325

325

00:12:31,930  -->  00:12:34,330
between the ok and cancel buttons but
button so that actually put some space
326

326

00:12:34,330  -->  00:12:36,400
another and perhaps better way to do it
between the ok and cancel buttons but
327

327

00:12:36,400  -->  00:12:38,260
would be to set the spacing for the
another and perhaps better way to do it
328

328

00:12:38,260  -->  00:12:40,690
h box so that all controls in the h
would be to set the spacing for the
329

329

00:12:40,690  -->  00:12:41,440
box
h box so that all controls in the h
330

330

00:12:41,440  -->  00:12:42,640
have the same amount of space between
box
331

331

00:12:42,640  -->  00:12:44,710
them so let's go ahead and try doing
have the same amount of space between
332

332

00:12:44,710  -->  00:12:46,750
that I'm going to get back here
them so let's go ahead and try doing
333

333

00:12:46,750  -->  00:12:50,320
change it back to zero again enter their
that I'm going to get back here
334

334

00:12:50,320  -->  00:12:52,180
to back to see what it was or to
change it back to zero again enter their
335

335

00:12:52,180  -->  00:12:54,580
the value that it was going to come over
to back to see what it was or to
336

336

00:12:54,580  -->  00:12:56,110
here and select the h box in the
the value that it was going to come over
337

337

00:12:56,110  -->  00:12:58,870
scene graph area and expand the layout
here and select the h box in the
338

338

00:12:58,870  -->  00:13:00,370
window if it's not already expanded in
scene graph area and expand the layout
339

339

00:13:00,370  -->  00:13:03,550
this case which already is
window if it's not already expanded in
340

340

00:13:03,550  -->  00:13:05,440
let's now set the left and right-hand
this case which already is
341

341

00:13:05,440  -->  00:13:10,750
margins over here to 5 for all controls
let's now set the left and right-hand
342

342

00:13:10,750  -->  00:13:16,000
also the left so that is the left and the right
margins over here to 5 for all controls
343

343

00:13:16,000  -->  00:13:18,910
margins but also to actually affect all
also the left so that is the left and the right
344

344

00:13:18,910  -->  00:13:20,140
the individual controls lets actually
margins but also to actually affect all
345

345

00:13:20,140  -->  00:13:23,890
change the spacing to 5 as well and you
the individual controls lets actually
346

346

00:13:23,890  -->  00:13:24,970
can see that is now affected the
change the spacing to 5 as well and you
347

347

00:13:24,970  -->  00:13:28,840
space between all three buttons now if
can see that is now affected the
348

348

00:13:28,840  -->  00:13:30,670
we actually click over somewhere
space between all three buttons now if
349

349

00:13:30,670  -->  00:13:33,700
outside of the user interface notice now
we actually click over somewhere
350

350

00:13:33,700  -->  00:13:35,920
there's a lot of space to the right of
outside of the user interface notice now
351

351

00:13:35,920  -->  00:13:37,660
the Help button and if we click on the
there's a lot of space to the right of
352

352

00:13:37,660  -->  00:13:41,050
h box you can see it's not the h
the Help button and if we click on the
353

353

00:13:41,050  -->  00:13:42,310
box is causing that because you can
h box you can see it's not the h
354

354

00:13:42,310  -->  00:13:43,480
actually see this sort
box is causing that because you can
355

355

00:13:43,480  -->  00:13:45,370
of margin here to the right and that
actually see this sort
356

356

00:13:45,370  -->  00:13:47,620
seems to be quiet ok if we click on the
of margin here to the right and that
357

357

00:13:47,620  -->  00:13:50,290
grid pane we can see that's the culprit
seems to be quiet ok if we click on the
358

358

00:13:50,290  -->  00:13:51,940
that's the grid pane is what is
grid pane we can see that's the culprit
359

359

00:13:51,940  -->  00:13:54,190
actually selecting or using that extra
that's the grid pane is what is
360

360

00:13:54,190  -->  00:13:57,940
space and if we have a look over here we
actually selecting or using that extra
361

361

00:13:57,940  -->  00:13:59,200
can see the problem here is in the
space and if we have a look over here we
362

362

00:13:59,200  -->  00:14:01,600
properties for the grid pane is that the
can see the problem here is in the
363

363

00:14:01,600  -->  00:14:04,270
horizontal gap settings 10 now we only
properties for the grid pane is that the
364

364

00:14:04,270  -->  00:14:06,220
have one column so we don't need a gap
horizontal gap settings 10 now we only
365

365

00:14:06,220  -->  00:14:08,230
that separates columns going to set the
have one column so we don't need a gap
366

366

00:14:08,230  -->  00:14:13,150
h gap back to zero and that then fix
that separates columns going to set the
367

367

00:14:13,150  -->  00:14:14,920
our problem if i click outside here now
h gap back to zero and that then fix
368

368

00:14:14,920  -->  00:14:16,990
we can see that in
our problem if i click outside here now
369

369

00:14:16,990  -->  00:14:18,850
terms of the buttons
we can see that in
370

370

00:14:18,850  -->  00:14:21,160
we've got a nicely sort of position in
terms of the buttons
371

371

00:14:21,160  -->  00:14:22,930
the middle there essentially the extra
we've got a nicely sort of position in
372

372

00:14:22,930  -->  00:14:25,480
space disappeared so a simple level
the middle there essentially the extra
373

373

00:14:25,480  -->  00:14:27,130
that's really all there is to building a
space disappeared so a simple level
374

374

00:14:27,130  -->  00:14:29,170
UI using scene builder you dragged
that's really all there is to building a
375

375

00:14:29,170  -->  00:14:30,730
components from the left-hand side on
UI using scene builder you dragged
376

376

00:14:30,730  -->  00:14:32,830
into the content area and we set their
components from the left-hand side on
377

377

00:14:32,830  -->  00:14:35,050
properties on the right-hand side and we
into the content area and we set their
378

378

00:14:35,050  -->  00:14:36,940
can select the component we want to work
properties on the right-hand side and we
379

379

00:14:36,940  -->  00:14:39,820
with by clicking on its content area or
can select the component we want to work
380

380

00:14:39,820  -->  00:14:41,860
in the scene graph area and we usually
with by clicking on its content area or
381

381

00:14:41,860  -->  00:14:43,480
select containers in the scene graph
in the scene graph area and we usually
382

382

00:14:43,480  -->  00:14:44,980
area when you wanna run the application
select containers in the scene graph
383

383

00:14:44,980  -->  00:14:47,290
we run it in the usual way by clicking
area when you wanna run the application
384

384

00:14:47,290  -->  00:14:47,800
on the run
we run it in the usual way by clicking
385

385

00:14:47,800  -->  00:14:50,050
and over here i can just right-click
on the run
386

386

00:14:50,050  -->  00:14:52,750
I could have just run over here as
and over here i can just right-click
387

387

00:14:52,750  -->  00:14:59,980
well run and there's our simple little
I could have just run over here as
388

388

00:14:59,980  -->  00:15:02,260
interface at the moment
well run and there's our simple little
389

389

00:15:02,260  -->  00:15:09,550
ok the other what I find annoying
interface at the moment
390

390

00:15:09,550  -->  00:15:12,610
little thing that this scene builder
ok the other what I find annoying
391

391

00:15:12,610  -->  00:15:14,700
does if you click on controls we go back
little thing that this scene builder
392

392

00:15:14,700  -->  00:15:16,770
to say the text and go back to the scene
does if you click on controls we go back
393

393

00:15:16,770  -->  00:15:18,610
builder it seems to lose the focus of
to say the text and go back to the scene
394

394

00:15:18,610  -->  00:15:19,480
where we're at and you got to
builder it seems to lose the focus of
395

395

00:15:19,480  -->  00:15:22,950
re-expand to get access to the
where we're at and you got to
396

396

00:15:22,950  -->  00:15:25,240
particular controls you want again but i
re-expand to get access to the
397

397

00:15:25,240  -->  00:15:26,290
will be talking I'll be talking about
particular controls you want again but i
398

398

00:15:26,290  -->  00:15:28,810
using the standalone scene builder in a
will be talking I'll be talking about
399

399

00:15:28,810  -->  00:15:30,450
future video probably in the next video
using the standalone scene builder in a
400

400

00:15:30,450  -->  00:15:32,170
depending on how long that takes to go
future video probably in the next video
401

401

00:15:32,170  -->  00:15:33,250
through some of the other things i want
depending on how long that takes to go
402

402

00:15:33,250  -->  00:15:36,510
to show you bottom line is that it's
through some of the other things i want
403

403

00:15:36,510  -->  00:15:38,580
still a very useful tool so let's end
to show you bottom line is that it's
404

404

00:15:38,580  -->  00:15:40,510
the video here now in the next video
still a very useful tool so let's end
405

405

00:15:40,510  -->  00:15:41,950
we're going to have a look at this code
the video here now in the next video
406

406

00:15:41,950  -->  00:15:43,360
menu we haven't really talked it more we
we're going to have a look at this code
407

407

00:15:43,360  -->  00:15:44,950
talked a little bit about it but haven't
menu we haven't really talked it more we
408

408

00:15:44,950  -->  00:15:46,810
done anything with it so let's start
talked a little bit about it but haven't
409

409

00:15:46,810  -->  00:15:53,510
working with that in the next video
done anything with it so let's start
