00:00:04.700  -->  00:00:06.439
In this video we're going to go
2

2

00:00:06.439  -->  00:00:08.599
ahead and create our first Java
3

3

00:00:08.599  -->  00:00:11.480
FX applications. So make sure that if
4

4

00:00:11.480  -->  00:00:12.949
you haven't already, that you've watched
5

5

00:00:12.949  -->  00:00:15.289
the last video and if you're running on JDK
6

6

00:00:15.289  -->  00:00:17.090
11, you'll need to go through the steps
7

7

00:00:17.090  -->  00:00:18.980
to find the global library because
8

8

00:00:18.980  -->  00:00:21.050
we're going to be using that in this video
9

9

00:00:21.050  -->  00:00:23.300
Alright so IntelliJ is got a plug-in
10

10

00:00:23.300  -->  00:00:26.240
that supports Java FX applications
11

11

00:00:26.240  -->  00:00:27.859
when you installed IntelliJ the plugin
12

12

00:00:27.859  -->  00:00:29.900
was installed and enabled by default.
13

13

00:00:29.900  -->  00:00:31.099
So we're going to go ahead and use that
14

14

00:00:31.099  -->  00:00:33.170
in this project. So you click on create
15

15

00:00:33.170  -->  00:00:36.560
new project as you normally would and
16

16

00:00:36.560  -->  00:00:37.670
you'll notice the option here to the left
17

17

00:00:37.670  -->  00:00:39.079
you probably see that before we've got
18

18

00:00:39.079  -->  00:00:40.370
Java which we've used traditionally
19

19

00:00:40.370  -->  00:00:42.199
but there's also this Java FX. We're going
20

20

00:00:42.199  -->  00:00:43.609
to be using that in this section, every
21

21

00:00:43.609  -->  00:00:45.379
time and create a new Java FX
22

22

00:00:45.379  -->  00:00:48.199
application, make sure your project SDK is set to 11
23

23

00:00:48.199  -->  00:00:49.879
in this case if you're running JDK 11
24

24

00:00:49.879  -->  00:00:52.850
running JDK 8 obviously it'll be JDK
25

25

00:00:52.850  -->  00:00:56.480
8. Click on next we need to define a
26

26

00:00:56.480  -->  00:00:59.179
name. So I'm going to call this one
27

27

00:00:59.179  -->  00:01:01.879
"HelloWorldFX". So effectively we're going to
28

28

00:01:01.879  -->  00:01:03.890
be creating our first Hello World
29

29

00:01:03.890  -->  00:01:06.560
project but using Java FX. We're going to click on
30

30

00:01:06.560  -->  00:01:14.270
finish now and create the project. Now if
31

31

00:01:14.270  -->  00:01:16.159
you're running JDK 8, you should find
32

32

00:01:16.159  -->  00:01:17.540
that this is ready to go and you won't need
33

33

00:01:17.540  -->  00:01:19.159
to take the steps I'm about to go
34

34

00:01:19.159  -->  00:01:21.950
through but if you're running JDK 11, click
35

35

00:01:21.950  -->  00:01:23.990
over to main. You can see right away that there's
36

36

00:01:23.990  -->  00:01:25.549
some errors. So we've got the errors
37

37

00:01:25.549  -->  00:01:28.399
and that's because the JavaFX libraries
38

38

00:01:28.399  -->  00:01:30.920
are no longer part of the JDK. So
39

39

00:01:30.920  -->  00:01:33.439
we need to actually configure it and set
40

40

00:01:33.439  -->  00:01:34.759
it up so that the global library
41

41

00:01:34.759  -->  00:01:36.530
we've defined is used for this project. So
42

42

00:01:36.530  -->  00:01:37.490
you will need to do the following
43

43

00:01:37.490  -->  00:01:40.280
steps every time you create a new Java
44

44

00:01:40.280  -->  00:01:42.590
FX project if you're running JDK 11
45

45

00:01:42.590  -->  00:01:43.850
The first things first, we want to click
46

46

00:01:43.850  -->  00:01:46.460
on the project right-click and select
47

47

00:01:46.460  -->  00:01:51.229
open module settings. Come up to project
48

48

00:01:51.229  -->  00:01:52.969
Well firstly check the project SDK
49

49

00:01:52.969  -->  00:01:55.490
is correctly configured, 11 in my case
50

50

00:01:55.490  -->  00:01:57.140
the project language level needs to be
51

51

00:01:57.140  -->  00:01:59.509
configured the same as the project SDK
52

52

00:01:59.509  -->  00:02:01.880
so the same number. In the case of 11
53

53

00:02:01.880  -->  00:02:03.920
JDK 11, obviously I'm selecting 11
54

54

00:02:03.920  -->  00:02:05.539
if you're in JDK-8, you would select
55

55

00:02:05.539  -->  00:02:07.670
8 there. By doing that then if you
56

56

00:02:07.670  -->  00:02:09.170
come over to modules you should then
57

57

00:02:09.170  -->  00:02:10.640
follow that because we're using the
58

58

00:02:10.640  -->  00:02:12.739
project defaults and that's now also set
59

59

00:02:12.739  -->  00:02:16.580
to version 11. Now for JDK 11 users the next
60

60

00:02:16.580  -->  00:02:18.340
step we also need to do is go to
61

61

00:02:18.340  -->  00:02:20.530
global libraries remember that we defined
62

62

00:02:20.530  -->  00:02:22.360
that in a previous video then you need to
63

63

00:02:22.360  -->  00:02:24.400
right-click here we need to click on
64

64

00:02:24.400  -->  00:02:26.650
add to modules. So what that's doing
65

65

00:02:26.650  -->  00:02:28.150
is adding this module that we've
66

66

00:02:28.150  -->  00:02:29.260
defined, this global module.
67

67

00:02:29.260  -->  00:02:30.849
We're telling IntelliJ that we want to
68

68

00:02:30.849  -->  00:02:33.099
use that in this particular IntelliJ
69

69

00:02:33.099  -->  00:02:34.660
project. So we click on that. So its a once
70

70

00:02:34.660  -->  00:02:36.430
only setup and it confirms and it's
71

71

00:02:36.430  -->  00:02:37.780
going to be added to the selected
72

72

00:02:37.780  -->  00:02:39.340
modules, which in this case is the
73

73

00:02:39.340  -->  00:02:42.840
name of our project click. OK. click OK again.
74

74

00:02:42.840  -->  00:02:45.069
Now you can see that that has actually
75

75

00:02:45.069  -->  00:02:46.720
fixed some of the import errors. We're
76

76

00:02:46.720  -->  00:02:48.760
now no longer getting any errors but
77

77

00:02:48.760  -->  00:02:50.620
you'll find that if you go to run this now
78

78

00:02:50.620  -->  00:02:51.850
just expand this out so you can see a
79

79

00:02:51.850  -->  00:02:55.840
little bit better, we will find that we'll
80

80

00:02:55.840  -->  00:03:01.120
get an error. So I'll click on run we've
81

81

00:03:01.120  -->  00:03:03.010
got an error there, "JavaFX runtime
82

82

00:03:03.010  -->  00:03:05.440
components are missing". basically what we've done
83

83

00:03:05.440  -->  00:03:07.630
so far is we've added the global library
84

84

00:03:07.630  -->  00:03:10.330
to our JDK 11 application but at this stage
85

85

00:03:10.330  -->  00:03:12.010
it's not working because we need to
86

86

00:03:12.010  -->  00:03:13.900
configure it so that it works when we're
87

87

00:03:13.900  -->  00:03:15.459
running the application as well
88

88

00:03:15.459  -->  00:03:18.190
and again this is only for JDK 11, but JDK
89

89

00:03:18.190  -->  00:03:19.780
8 you won't have this issue it should
90

90

00:03:19.780  -->  00:03:22.060
work out of the box. So what we need to do
91

91

00:03:22.060  -->  00:03:24.220
to actually fix this is we need to add
92

92

00:03:24.220  -->  00:03:27.430
a module - info.java file so that
93

93

00:03:27.430  -->  00:03:30.220
we've defined the JavaFX control so that
94

94

00:03:30.220  -->  00:03:32.170
will actually work and the way we do that
95

95

00:03:32.170  -->  00:03:33.819
for JDK 11 is we right-click the
96

96

00:03:33.819  -->  00:03:36.069
source folder. Noting that I'm not clicking
97

97

00:03:36.069  -->  00:03:37.690
on the package name. We're clicking
98

98

00:03:37.690  -->  00:03:41.260
at source level right click select new
99

99

00:03:41.260  -->  00:03:42.250
we need to select module
100

100

00:03:42.250  -->  00:03:44.890
- info dot Java and that should open up
101

101

00:03:44.890  -->  00:03:46.959
a little file like this and by the
102

102

00:03:46.959  -->  00:03:48.549
way, if you don't see the option here
103

103

00:03:48.549  -->  00:03:50.799
when you right-click and select new
104

104

00:03:50.799  -->  00:03:52.329
if you don't see an option there we won't
105

105

00:03:52.329  -->  00:03:53.410
see module info there now because
106

106

00:03:53.410  -->  00:03:55.269
you've already created it but prior to
107

107

00:03:55.269  -->  00:03:57.040
that next what I'll do is just undo it just
108

108

00:03:57.040  -->  00:03:57.790
to show you
109

109

00:03:57.790  -->  00:04:04.560
so we cancel that, right-click again new
110

110

00:04:04.560  -->  00:04:06.730
so if you don't see this module.info.
111

111

00:04:06.730  -->  00:04:08.620
Java package what that means
112

112

00:04:08.620  -->  00:04:11.769
is you haven't correctly configured
113

113

00:04:11.769  -->  00:04:14.560
in project, the project language levels
114

114

00:04:14.560  -->  00:04:17.079
so 11 is either not set there or set there
115

115

00:04:17.079  -->  00:04:18.729
because once you do that, that
116

116

00:04:18.729  -->  00:04:20.380
option should come up for you automatically
117

117

00:04:20.380  -->  00:04:21.519
so I'm going to go ahead and create that
118

118

00:04:21.519  -->  00:04:25.120
file again module - info dot Java
119

119

00:04:25.120  -->  00:04:26.530
and what we now need to do is add a few
120

120

00:04:26.530  -->  00:04:29.229
commands here so that Java FX will
121

121

00:04:29.229  -->  00:04:32.020
work. So first one I'm going to type is requires
122

122

00:04:32.020  -->  00:04:37.930
JavaFX dot it's going to be FXML
123

123

00:04:37.930  -->  00:04:40.500
that's number one and the second one requires
124

124

00:04:40.500  -->  00:04:45.250
Java FX dot controls then the last
125

125

00:04:45.250  -->  00:04:48.670
one we need to add then is opens, then we
126

126

00:04:48.670  -->  00:04:51.130
go sample. Sample is the name
127

127

00:04:51.130  -->  00:04:53.470
that we've defined here, basically the package
128

128

00:04:53.470  -->  00:04:56.290
name. So we specify that there. At that
129

129

00:04:56.290  -->  00:04:58.840
point we will now find that this application
130

130

00:04:58.840  -->  00:05:00.040
which previously would have worked
131

131

00:05:00.040  -->  00:05:03.670
for JDK 8 will now also work for JDK 11
132

132

00:05:03.670  -->  00:05:09.280
so let's actually give that a test run
133

133

00:05:09.280  -->  00:05:10.870
and you can see now we've got basically
134

134

00:05:10.870  -->  00:05:12.940
a GUI interface. There's no controls
135

135

00:05:12.940  -->  00:05:14.710
on this state and that's normal because
136

136

00:05:14.710  -->  00:05:16.150
we haven't added any controls to
137

137

00:05:16.150  -->  00:05:17.890
the application yet. Bottom line is that
138

138

00:05:17.890  -->  00:05:19.690
it's now working. We've correctly
139

139

00:05:19.690  -->  00:05:23.140
configured the Java FX library the global library
140

140

00:05:23.140  -->  00:05:24.550
we've configured and added it to
141

141

00:05:24.550  -->  00:05:25.150
this project
142

142

00:05:25.150  -->  00:05:27.250
We've also added the module - info
143

143

00:05:27.250  -->  00:05:29.080
.Java file so at this point in time it's
144

144

00:05:29.080  -->  00:05:31.720
now working under JDK 11 and also
145

145

00:05:31.720  -->  00:05:33.820
you didn't need to make the change to module
146

146

00:05:33.820  -->  00:05:36.880
info.Java for JDK 8 users but
147

147

00:05:36.880  -->  00:05:38.320
in your case, they'll also be working
148

148

00:05:38.320  -->  00:05:39.820
as well. So we're going to finish the
149

149

00:05:39.820  -->  00:05:41.650
video here now. Now that we know that we've
150

150

00:05:41.650  -->  00:05:43.270
got an application that's configured to
151

151

00:05:43.270  -->  00:05:47.260
work for both JDK 8 and JDK 11, moving forward
152

152

00:05:47.260  -->  00:05:49.240
we can now start focusing on the Java
153

153

00:05:49.240  -->  00:05:51.580
FX controls and how to actually use them
154

154

00:05:51.580  -->  00:05:52.690
and not be too worried about which
155
