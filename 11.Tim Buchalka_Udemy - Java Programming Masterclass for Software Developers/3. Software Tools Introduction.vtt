00:00:04.381  -->  00:00:06.691
<v ->All right so that's now the house keeping done.</v>
2

2

00:00:06.691  -->  00:00:09.440
Let's talk about installing the software
3

3

00:00:09.440  -->  00:00:11.080
we need for this course.
4

4

00:00:11.080  -->  00:00:15.140
So we're going to be using JDK version 11 in this course.
5

5

00:00:15.140  -->  00:00:16.950
Now JDK stands for the Java Development Kit
6

6

00:00:16.950  -->  00:00:19.920
and it's the software that is used to create
7

7

00:00:19.920  -->  00:00:22.180
and run Java programmes.
8

8

00:00:22.180  -->  00:00:25.170
Now we're also gonna be using IntelliJ IDEA
9

9

00:00:25.170  -->  00:00:27.530
and that's much like a word processor
10

10

00:00:27.530  -->  00:00:29.960
but for creating programmes.
11

11

00:00:29.960  -->  00:00:32.760
Now on I'm one of the early adopters of IntelliJ.
12

12

00:00:32.760  -->  00:00:35.730
I started using it way back in the early 2000s
13

13

00:00:35.730  -->  00:00:38.150
and it's a very powerful piece of software
14

14

00:00:38.150  -->  00:00:39.690
packed with lots of features for
15

15

00:00:39.690  -->  00:00:42.110
both beginners and pro developers,
16

16

00:00:42.110  -->  00:00:43.650
but the great thing about it
17

17

00:00:43.650  -->  00:00:45.820
is it's extremely beginner friendly as well
18

18

00:00:45.820  -->  00:00:47.580
and there's a free community edition
19

19

00:00:47.580  -->  00:00:49.570
or paid ultimate edition.
20

20

00:00:49.570  -->  00:00:50.570
So either of these will work.
21

21

00:00:50.570  -->  00:00:51.570
You don't need to spend any money
22

22

00:00:51.570  -->  00:00:53.230
for either of those tools actually
23

23

00:00:53.230  -->  00:00:55.550
and in the upcoming videos in this section of the course
24

24

00:00:55.550  -->  00:00:58.100
I'm gonna show you how to get the Java Development Kit
25

25

00:00:58.100  -->  00:01:01.500
and IntelliJ IDEA working for Windows, Mac,
26

26

00:01:01.500  -->  00:01:03.020
and also for Linux.
27

27

00:01:03.020  -->  00:01:04.490
Now if you wanna to use another IDE,
28

28

00:01:04.490  -->  00:01:07.010
Integrated Development Environment, Eclipse,
29

29

00:01:07.010  -->  00:01:09.030
or something of that nature, you're welcome to do that.
30

30

00:01:09.030  -->  00:01:10.180
It'll work fine.
31

31

00:01:10.180  -->  00:01:11.933
Other than that, let's get started.
