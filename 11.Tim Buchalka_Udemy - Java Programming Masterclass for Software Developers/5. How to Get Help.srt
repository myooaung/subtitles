00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:07,600
<v ->Because of the size of this course and the sheer amount</v>
1

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,200
of content covered in it, from time to time
2

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,580
you may have the need to have a question answered.
3

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:13,413
So you might have a question,
4

5
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:15,600
you might be stuck and need some help.
5

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,970
This video is all about showing you
6

7
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:19,460
how to get help in that situation.
7

8
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,380
So firstly, what you need to do to get help is to log in
8

9
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,730
to the course, and when you log in, you've got
9

10
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,750
these options, as you can see in the screen there.
10

11
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,400
Choose Q&amp;A.
11

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,520
When you do that, you can click
12

13
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,440
on Ask a Question, and enter a title about the question
13

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,880
and a detailed description, and I'll talk more
14

15
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,677
about the tops of how to go about
15

16
00:00:37,677 --> 00:00:40,280
describing the problem, and then post the question.
16

17
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,640
So it's literally that easy.
17

18
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,120
And myself, or Goren, my teaching assistant,
18

19
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,870
or even another student, a member of the community,
19

20
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:49,860
will pop in there and actually help you out.
20

21
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,110
Here's an example post, just to give you an idea.
21

22
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,130
So note the title and the description there.
22

23
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:56,980
But also, the other thing I wanna show you is
23

24
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,540
if you've got some source code that's not working,
24

25
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:00,780
and this is a programming course,
25

26
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,620
that's, probably a large amount of cases,
26

27
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,430
the reason why you're posting...
27

28
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,670
So if it's not working, don't do a screen image.
28

29
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,740
I suggest you actually post the code.
29

30
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:13,090
So click here and you can paste the code directly in.
30

31
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,730
And notice that when you do that,
31

32
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,080
it gets all nicely colour coded and formatted.
32

33
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,280
So that's the preference.
33

34
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,430
That makes it easy for other people
34

35
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,630
to actually take that code and try and use it.
35

36
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:25,440
Because if you post an image, if you take a screenshot
36

37
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,440
of the problem you're having, it's not possible
37

38
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,110
for someone to grab your code and paste it
38

39
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:32,710
into their IDE, into IntelliJ, and get a result,
39

40
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,070
and try and figure out what's going on.
40

41
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,300
So if you posted a source code, it just makes it
41

42
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,690
a lot easier, and again, doing it that way means
42

43
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:40,470
that it's all nicely colour coded and formatted.
43

44
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,210
And you're just increasing the chances,
44

45
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,940
is what I'm trying to say, of getting your resolution.
45

46
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,730
All right, but keep in mind that I mentioned images.
46

47
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:48,860
You can upload images.
47

48
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,810
Sometimes images are preferable.
48

49
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,440
You've got some other issue where you want
49

50
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,960
to supplement what you've shown,
50

51
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,190
or you put in your description with an image,
51

52
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,760
that's how you can upload an image, as well.
52

53
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,930
So that's also a clue to this, and do that if you need to.
53

54
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,230
And the other thing I wanna point out, though,
54

55
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,400
is before you actually ask a question,
55

56
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,710
try and take advantage of the search facility,
56

57
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,580
because the chances are pretty high
57

58
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,780
there's been another student who's had a similar
58

59
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,910
or the same exact problem that you're having right now.
59

60
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:15,830
I say right now, but you're still
60

61
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,090
watching this video, not coding.
61

62
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,710
But as you go through, chances are pretty high
62

63
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:23,130
that you'll find someone who's been in a similar situation.
63

64
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:25,160
Now the search, very simple, as you can see there.
64

65
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,350
Just type the question here, as you can see,
65

66
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,750
and it brings up an answer.
66

67
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,560
Notice that you can search all questions,
67

68
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,840
all lectures rather, or a specific lecture.
68

69
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,500
So you might want to hone
69

70
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,860
your results to a specific lecture.
70

71
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,270
That can be a good idea, if you've got a problem
71

72
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,747
with a specific lecture, to try
72

73
00:02:40,747 --> 00:02:42,600
and search just within that lecture.
73

74
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,800
But you can also search across all lectures, as well.
74

75
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,393
And there's lots and lots of questions.
75

76
00:02:46,393 --> 00:02:48,931
I think at last count, there's 38,000 questions
76

77
00:02:48,931 --> 00:02:50,670
that have been answered, or more,
77

78
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,430
so huge amount of questions here.
78

79
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,020
So make sure you take advantage of that.
79

80
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,520
It'll definitely help you out.
80

81
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,570
All right, now the other thing I wanted to quickly raise
81

82
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:01,491
is just some tips on actually asking questions.
82

83
00:03:01,491 --> 00:03:03,680
And this'll help you in your future career
83

84
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,240
as a programmer, as well.
84

85
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,131
Firstly, be as specific as you possibly can.
85

86
00:03:08,131 --> 00:03:12,491
So if you're getting stuck on a particular lecture,
86

87
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:14,717
if you just post a question and say,
87

88
00:03:14,717 --> 00:03:16,297
"I can't get this code to work.
88

89
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:18,750
"I can't get the code from this lecture to work."
89

90
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,330
That's technically correct.
90

91
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:21,880
It's probably not working for you.
91

92
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,900
But it makes it really hard for anyone else to try
92

93
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,140
and help you, because you haven't
93

94
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,060
given us any information to work with.
94

95
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,130
So basically, let us know the lecture
95

96
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:31,422
that you're working on, paste in the code you've used,
96

97
00:03:31,422 --> 00:03:33,790
using what I showed you earlier in the video,
97

98
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,840
and maybe a screenshot of the exact area,
98

99
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,930
if you need to do that, as opposed to the code,
99

100
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,641
the actual error message and so forth you're getting.
100

101
00:03:39,641 --> 00:03:42,357
And this is great practise for you
101

102
00:03:42,357 --> 00:03:44,180
for when you become a programmer in the real world,
102

103
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,320
because that's what you need to do.
103

104
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,460
If you're starting out at a new job,
104

105
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,360
and you go to your team leader
105

106
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,300
or your senior programmer who's working with you,
106

107
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,110
or even to a peer programmer, you need
107

108
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,870
to give them as much information as possible.
108

109
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,279
People aren't gonna be happy if you just say,
109

110
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:59,270
"This is not working, can you help me?"
110

111
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,080
Because we're all busy in today's society.
111

112
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,730
So basically what I'm saying is,
112

113
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:05,748
be as specific as possible, and that's gonna really help you
113

114
00:04:05,748 --> 00:04:07,990
get some answers quicker and make you
114

115
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,210
a better programmer in the longer term.
115

116
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,700
The other thing that's also useful is,
116

117
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,580
it's usually better to ask a new question,
117

118
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,120
rather than appending your question
118

119
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,390
to another question that's been previously answered,
119

120
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:21,040
unless your question is completely related
120

121
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,400
to that one, if that makes sense.
121

122
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,380
And the reason for that is, some of this depends
122

123
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,890
on the notification system of Udemy.
123

124
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:29,080
Sometimes some of the older questions,
124

125
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,140
if you post a follow-up question to a question
125

126
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,159
that's maybe been answered six months ago,
126

127
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:36,360
those notifications don't always come through to the people
127

128
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,800
who are trying to answer these questions for you.
128

129
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,680
So it's usually better to post a new question,
129

130
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,600
and get an answer to it that way.
130

131
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,470
But again, always make sure
131

132
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,910
you use the search facility first because
132

133
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,340
that's gonna help you a lot, and give you the skills
133

134
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,210
to make you a great, productive programmer.
134

135
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:50,070
All right, so that's support.
135

136
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,440
I'll finish the video here.
136

137
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,290
Let's move on now, to the next video.
