Welcome to section 8 of the course.

00:00:09.070  -->  00:00:11.650
Tim [INAUDIBLE] here again,
and as promised this is
3

3

00:00:11.650  -->  00:00:15.500
part 2 of the object orientated
programming sections of the course.
4

4

00:00:15.500  -->  00:00:18.550
We've now down the basics of object
orientated programming in the previous
5

5

00:00:18.550  -->  00:00:21.740
section, but
it's now time to look at the remaining 3
6

6

00:00:21.740  -->  00:00:24.450
major components of object
orientated programming.
7

7

00:00:24.450  -->  00:00:28.780
Which is composition, Polymorphism and
also Encapsulation, so
8

8

00:00:28.780  -->  00:00:32.820
by the end of this section you should have
a solid overview of what they are and
9

9

00:00:32.820  -->  00:00:34.960
also have to use that in your programs.

10

00:00:34.960  -->  00:00:36.510
So lets make a start on that right now.
