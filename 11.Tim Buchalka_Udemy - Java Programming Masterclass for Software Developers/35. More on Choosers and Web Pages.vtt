00:00:05.330  -->  00:00:06.560
alright so continuing on with our
2

2

00:00:06.830  -->  00:00:09.030
directory and file chooses let's
alright so continuing on with our
3

3

00:00:09.030  -->  00:00:10.590
actually go back now we're going to
directory and file chooses let's
4

4

00:00:10.590  -->  00:00:12.270
actually change this directory chooser
actually go back now we're going to
5

5

00:00:12.270  -->  00:00:15.060
back to the file chooser again now we've
actually change this directory chooser
6

6

00:00:15.060  -->  00:00:16.460
already seen how to show an open
back to the file chooser again now we've
7

7

00:00:16.460  -->  00:00:18.360
dialogue which would do when the user
already seen how to show an open
8

8

00:00:18.360  -->  00:00:20.520
wants to open a file when the user wants
dialogue which would do when the user
9

9

00:00:20.520  -->  00:00:22.880
to save a file we actually call the show
wants to open a file when the user wants
10

10

00:00:22.880  -->  00:00:25.350
save dialog method instead of the show
to save a file we actually call the show
11

11

00:00:25.350  -->  00:00:26.670
open dialogue method so let's actually
save dialog method instead of the show
12

12

00:00:26.670  -->  00:00:27.750
do that now
open dialogue method so let's actually
13

13

00:00:27.750  -->  00:00:29.520
so first thing I'm going to uncomment
do that now
14

14

00:00:29.520  -->  00:00:33.180
the file chooser we're going to comment out
so first thing I'm going to uncomment
15

15

00:00:33.180  -->  00:00:35.810
the directory chooser and we're going to
the file chooser we're going to comment out
16

16

00:00:35.810  -->  00:00:37.500
do....
the directory chooser and we're going to
17

17

00:00:37.500  -->  00:00:38.700
...
do....
18

18

00:00:38.700  -->  00:00:59.640
...
...
19

19

00:00:59.640  -->  00:01:02.180
...now if you actually run this
...
20

20

00:01:02.180  -->  00:01:10.800
i'm going to open the save dialog as you
...now if you actually run this
21

21

00:01:10.800  -->  00:01:12.930
can see there and on a mac which is a
i'm going to open the save dialog as you
22

22

00:01:12.930  -->  00:01:14.400
little bit different to the how the pc
can see there and on a mac which is a
23

23

00:01:14.400  -->  00:01:16.290
and linux will work i can actually
little bit different to the how the pc
24

24

00:01:16.290  -->  00:01:19.320
choose a folder like my desktop i can
and linux will work i can actually
25

25

00:01:19.320  -->  00:01:22.260
then expand it out and I can go to
choose a folder like my desktop i can
26

26

00:01:22.260  -->  00:01:24.360
sub folder like test and I could save it
then expand it out and I can go to
27

27

00:01:24.360  -->  00:01:27.840
in there i can save it as...
sub folder like test and I could save it
28

28

00:01:27.840  -->  00:01:31.800
click on save and you can see that the
in there i can save it as...
29

29

00:01:31.800  -->  00:01:34.380
entire path has been now is showing
click on save and you can see that the
30

30

00:01:34.380  -->  00:01:36.090
there in the output so that's the path
entire path has been now is showing
31

31

00:01:36.090  -->  00:01:40.380
that has come back from the chooser if
there in the output so that's the path
32

32

00:01:40.380  -->  00:01:43.140
you just open that again notice here
that has come back from the chooser if
33

33

00:01:43.140  -->  00:01:44.700
also it's not open this time but its
you just open that again notice here
34

34

00:01:44.700  -->  00:01:46.680
save and that should be the same both
also it's not open this time but its
35

35

00:01:46.680  -->  00:01:48.780
for linux and windows as well
save and that should be the same both
36

36

00:01:48.780  -->  00:01:51.390
now depending on the operating system
for linux and windows as well
37

37

00:01:51.390  -->  00:01:52.620
that you're running on your might
now depending on the operating system
38

38

00:01:52.620  -->  00:01:54.330
also get a type field underneath the
that you're running on your might
39

39

00:01:54.330  -->  00:01:56.280
file name now i haven't actually got that
also get a type field underneath the
40

40

00:01:56.280  -->  00:01:59.040
here I don't see a file type i can see
file name now i haven't actually got that
41

41

00:01:59.040  -->  00:02:02.130
tags but on windows or linux you'll
here I don't see a file type i can see
42

42

00:02:02.130  -->  00:02:04.710
actually see the type fjeld and the file name
tags but on windows or linux you'll
43

43

00:02:04.710  -->  00:02:07.860
and that looks like a combo box and
actually see the type fjeld and the file name
44

44

00:02:07.860  -->  00:02:09.480
right now that combo box is actually
and that looks like a combo box and
45

45

00:02:09.480  -->  00:02:11.700
empty and typically an application will
right now that combo box is actually
46

46

00:02:11.700  -->  00:02:14.280
deal with files of a certain type and so
empty and typically an application will
47

47

00:02:14.280  -->  00:02:15.660
that it will actually expect to save
deal with files of a certain type and so
48

48

00:02:15.660  -->  00:02:18.150
files with a specific file extension
that it will actually expect to save
49

49

00:02:18.150  -->  00:02:20.570
that type fie food will display the file
files with a specific file extension
50

50

00:02:20.570  -->  00:02:22.040
extension or extensions that the
that type fie food will display the file
51

51

00:02:22.040  -->  00:02:24.510
application knows about now the field
extension or extensions that the
52

52

00:02:24.510  -->  00:02:26.130
isn't displaying anything because we
application knows about now the field
53

53

00:02:26.130  -->  00:02:28.140
have to set the extensions when
isn't displaying anything because we
54

54

00:02:28.140  -->  00:02:29.760
configuring the file chooser and again
have to set the extensions when
55

55

00:02:29.760  -->  00:02:31.760
this is applicable depending on which
configuring the file chooser and again
56

56

00:02:31.760  -->  00:02:33.540
operating system you're actually running
this is applicable depending on which
57

57

00:02:33.540  -->  00:02:35.900
on but we can still do that on a mac so
operating system you're actually running
58

58

00:02:35.900  -->  00:02:37.140
go back and do this and this will work
on but we can still do that on a mac so
59

59

00:02:37.140  -->  00:02:40.170
on all operating systems we can actually
go back and do this and this will work
60

60

00:02:40.170  -->  00:02:42.710
set the file chooses extension filters
on all operating systems we can actually
61

61

00:02:42.710  -->  00:02:44.990
so let's actually go ahead and actually
set the file chooses extension filters
62

62

00:02:44.990  -->  00:02:48.030
do that we do that by calling or get
so let's actually go ahead and actually
63

63

00:02:48.030  -->  00:02:49.260
the filters first by
do that we do that by calling or get
64

64

00:02:49.260  -->  00:02:51.450
calling get extension filters and then
the filters first by
65

65

00:02:51.450  -->  00:02:52.950
we're going to add to those extensions
calling get extension filters and then
66

66

00:02:52.950  -->  00:02:54.480
filters to the existing list so lets
we're going to add to those extensions
67

67

00:02:54.480  -->  00:02:55.380
actually go and have a look at how to
filters to the existing list so lets
68

68

00:02:55.380  -->  00:02:58.460
do that so...
actually go and have a look at how to
69

69

00:02:58.460  -->  00:03:02.640
...
do that so...
70

70

00:03:02.640  -->  00:03:42.080
...
...
71

71

00:03:42.080  -->  00:03:44.180
..
...
72

72

00:03:44.180  -->  00:03:49.320
...
..
73

73

00:03:49.320  -->  00:03:55.760
...and our file
...
74

74

00:03:55.760  -->  00:03:57.870
statement..
...and our file
75

75

00:03:57.870  -->  00:04:01.430
...alright so now that
statement..
76

76

00:04:01.430  -->  00:04:03.180
we've done that you should be able to
...alright so now that
77

77

00:04:03.180  -->  00:04:05.240
run this so lets actually see what gives
we've done that you should be able to
78

78

00:04:05.240  -->  00:04:14.270
us open now this time we've got the
run this so lets actually see what gives
79

79

00:04:14.270  -->  00:04:16.710
the file name and tags as the where before
us open now this time we've got the
80

80

00:04:16.710  -->  00:04:18.740
but notice this is actually showing
the file name and tags as the where before
81

81

00:04:18.740  -->  00:04:21.330
now we've got text and PDF and depending on
but notice this is actually showing
82

82

00:04:21.330  -->  00:04:23.040
your operating system this will show my
now we've got text and PDF and depending on
83

83

00:04:23.040  -->  00:04:25.430
show elsewhere and notice also when I'm
your operating system this will show my
84

84

00:04:25.430  -->  00:04:27.270
doing that the actual file name is being
show elsewhere and notice also when I'm
85

85

00:04:27.270  -->  00:04:28.950
changed automatically the end of the
doing that the actual file name is being
86

86

00:04:28.950  -->  00:04:31.290
file extension so i can put...
changed automatically the end of the
87

87

00:04:31.290  -->  00:04:35.880
...
file extension so i can put...
88

88

00:04:35.880  -->  00:04:38.940
actually saves us there as the full path
...
89

89

00:04:38.940  -->  00:04:41.970
their so openeing that again we can select either
actually saves us there as the full path
90

90

00:04:41.970  -->  00:04:46.140
type and the file name appears and of
their so openeing that again we can select either
91

91

00:04:46.140  -->  00:04:47.520
course we can also click on cancel
type and the file name appears and of
92

92

00:04:47.520  -->  00:04:50.330
without to us selecting anything we get
course we can also click on cancel
93

93

00:04:50.330  -->  00:04:52.560
the cancellation coming through
without to us selecting anything we get
94

94

00:04:52.560  -->  00:04:56.880
alright so basically when we construct
the cancellation coming through
95

95

00:04:56.880  -->  00:04:58.920
an instance of extension filter we
alright so basically when we construct
96

96

00:04:58.920  -->  00:05:00.660
passed in a description of the files
an instance of extension filter we
97

97

00:05:00.660  -->  00:05:02.790
that have the file extension as the
passed in a description of the files
98

98

00:05:02.790  -->  00:05:04.580
first parameter and the file extension
that have the file extension as the
99

99

00:05:04.580  -->  00:05:06.720
as the second parameter now the
first parameter and the file extension
100

100

00:05:06.720  -->  00:05:08.250
description is a string as you saw there
as the second parameter now the
101

101

00:05:08.250  -->  00:05:09.540
in the code and I'll just that on
description is a string as you saw there
102

102

00:05:09.540  -->  00:05:13.530
the screen now the code on line 44 so
in the code and I'll just that on
103

103

00:05:13.530  -->  00:05:14.940
the descriptions are string as i
the screen now the code on line 44 so
104

104

00:05:14.940  -->  00:05:16.740
mentioned so you can be more than one
the descriptions are string as i
105

105

00:05:16.740  -->  00:05:19.020
word there and you saw that the type
mentioned so you can be more than one
106

106

00:05:19.020  -->  00:05:20.910
field gives you an option to select the
word there and you saw that the type
107

107

00:05:20.910  -->  00:05:22.950
type and again as I mentioned a few
field gives you an option to select the
108

108

00:05:22.950  -->  00:05:24.170
times this will look slightly different
type and again as I mentioned a few
109

109

00:05:24.170  -->  00:05:26.460
on Windows and Linux but essentially
times this will look slightly different
110

110

00:05:26.460  -->  00:05:28.200
it's the same concept in that you can
on Windows and Linux but essentially
111

111

00:05:28.200  -->  00:05:30.750
now choose the type of file that
it's the same concept in that you can
112

112

00:05:30.750  -->  00:05:33.060
you would be willing to save another
now choose the type of file that
113

113

00:05:33.060  -->  00:05:34.470
thing to note is its
you would be willing to save another
114

114

00:05:34.470  -->  00:05:35.480
important to know that the user is
thing to note is its
115

115

00:05:35.480  -->  00:05:37.670
limited to file names that have one of
important to know that the user is
116

116

00:05:37.670  -->  00:05:39.110
the extensions so in other words i can
limited to file names that have one of
117

117

00:05:39.110  -->  00:05:44.580
still go back and run this again open
the extensions so in other words i can
118

118

00:05:44.580  -->  00:05:48.110
now we can select PDF or whatever
still go back and run this again open
119

119

00:05:48.110  -->  00:05:50.160
I can change that to something else like
now we can select PDF or whatever
120

120

00:05:50.160  -->  00:05:54.690
maybe my ext for my extension and click
I can change that to something else like
121

121

00:05:54.690  -->  00:05:58.410
on save and we can get that path their but
maybe my ext for my extension and click
122

122

00:05:58.410  -->  00:05:59.670
note in the case of the mac it's
on save and we can get that path their but
123

123

00:05:59.670  -->  00:06:03.360
automatically appended the PDF that you
note in the case of the mac it's
124

124

00:06:03.360  -->  00:06:04.670
will just do that just to confirm we're
automatically appended the PDF that you
125

125

00:06:04.670  -->  00:06:06.000
going back to actually check this again
will just do that just to confirm we're
126

126

00:06:06.000  -->  00:06:13.170
text leave it on text and I put Tim there you
going back to actually check this again
127

127

00:06:13.170  -->  00:06:14.420
can click on that if you wanted to hide the
text leave it on text and I put Tim there you
128

128

00:06:14.420  -->  00:06:17.790
extension click on save and we've now got
can click on that if you wanted to hide the
129

129

00:06:17.790  -->  00:06:19.560
still the file name but with the dot txt
extension click on save and we've now got
130

130

00:06:19.560  -->  00:06:22.260
added to the end so closing
still the file name but with the dot txt
131

131

00:06:22.260  -->  00:06:26.190
it down so what's the use so of these
added to the end so closing
132

132

00:06:26.190  -->  00:06:27.540
file extensions why would we want to
it down so what's the use so of these
133

133

00:06:27.540  -->  00:06:29.220
actually use that these extensions
file extensions why would we want to
134

134

00:06:29.220  -->  00:06:31.790
filters well file extension
actually use that these extensions
135

135

00:06:31.790  -->  00:06:34.200
filters are useful because they limit
filters well file extension
136

136

00:06:34.200  -->  00:06:36.690
the files that the user sees now obviously
filters are useful because they limit
137

137

00:06:36.690  -->  00:06:38.070
we're using a saved dialogue at the
the files that the user sees now obviously
138

138

00:06:38.070  -->  00:06:39.630
moment but in the case of an open
we're using a saved dialogue at the
139

139

00:06:39.630  -->  00:06:41.940
dialogue we can actually limit the files
moment but in the case of an open
140

140

00:06:41.940  -->  00:06:43.560
that the user sees which can be
dialogue we can actually limit the files
141

141

00:06:43.560  -->  00:06:44.910
convenient for the user
that the user sees which can be
142

142

00:06:44.910  -->  00:06:46.560
when the file chooser is displaying a
convenient for the user
143

143

00:06:46.560  -->  00:06:48.920
directory with lots of files now when
when the file chooser is displaying a
144

144

00:06:48.920  -->  00:06:51.080
filters are set the file choose will only
directory with lots of files now when
145

145

00:06:51.080  -->  00:06:52.830
show files that have an extension that
filters are set the file choose will only
146

146

00:06:52.830  -->  00:06:56.130
matches the filter so basically we're in
show files that have an extension that
147

147

00:06:56.130  -->  00:06:57.750
this case where I am about to show you i'm
matches the filter so basically we're in
148

148

00:06:57.750  -->  00:07:00.360
just gonna run this one more time
this case where I am about to show you i'm
149

149

00:07:00.360  -->  00:07:02.160
what we'll do first is will change
just gonna run this one more time
150

150

00:07:02.160  -->  00:07:05.910
this let's get to change this out so
what we'll do first is will change
151

151

00:07:05.910  -->  00:07:07.920
we're going to temporarily stop the
this let's get to change this out so
152

152

00:07:07.920  -->  00:07:12.060
filters comment those out we're going to
we're going to temporarily stop the
153

153

00:07:12.060  -->  00:07:13.440
change the chooser from...
filters comment those out we're going to
154

154

00:07:13.440  -->  00:07:17.540
....I'm going to run
change the chooser from...
155

155

00:07:17.540  -->  00:07:23.220
that again back to main so we can run it
....I'm going to run
156

156

00:07:23.220  -->  00:07:30.480
open at the moment we've go this
that again back to main so we can run it
157

157

00:07:30.480  -->  00:07:33.140
test folder we've got a zip file and mp4
open at the moment we've go this
158

158

00:07:33.140  -->  00:07:36.060
and a PDF file lets actually cancel
test folder we've got a zip file and mp4
159

159

00:07:36.060  -->  00:07:39.450
out of that and will close the code down
and a PDF file lets actually cancel
160

160

00:07:39.450  -->  00:07:41.670
and we'll go back and we'll change this
out of that and will close the code down
161

161

00:07:41.670  -->  00:07:48.630
now and will uncomment this again what
and we'll go back and we'll change this
162

162

00:07:48.630  -->  00:07:50.580
we'll do is we're going to put zip
now and will uncomment this again what
163

163

00:07:50.580  -->  00:07:57.480
...
we'll do is we're going to put zip
164

164

00:07:57.480  -->  00:08:01.410
...
...
165

165

00:08:01.410  -->  00:08:04.410
just run this again and now when we open
...
166

166

00:08:04.410  -->  00:08:06.810
the dialogue should only see files of
just run this again and now when we open
167

167

00:08:06.810  -->  00:08:10.290
type zip now depending on your operating
the dialogue should only see files of
168

168

00:08:10.290  -->  00:08:12.830
system in the case of a mac now that we
type zip now depending on your operating
169

169

00:08:12.830  -->  00:08:16.230
specified zip and PDF only will actually
system in the case of a mac now that we
170

170

00:08:16.230  -->  00:08:18.390
highlight the files make them bold
specified zip and PDF only will actually
171

171

00:08:18.390  -->  00:08:21.600
the ones that are part of the filter and
highlight the files make them bold
172

172

00:08:21.600  -->  00:08:23.130
for selected zip if we go and select PDF
the ones that are part of the filter and
173

173

00:08:23.130  -->  00:08:25.470
you notice that it highlights the
for selected zip if we go and select PDF
174

174

00:08:25.470  -->  00:08:28.530
PDF file so it wilkl actually do either but in the
you notice that it highlights the
175

175

00:08:28.530  -->  00:08:31.260
case of windows or linux the chooser will
PDF file so it wilkl actually do either but in the
176

176

00:08:31.260  -->  00:08:32.580
only show files that match those
case of windows or linux the chooser will
177

177

00:08:32.580  -->  00:08:34.700
extensions so just a slight difference
only show files that match those
178

178

00:08:34.700  -->  00:08:37.320
in terms of the operating system but the
extensions so just a slight difference
179

179

00:08:37.320  -->  00:08:38.640
bottom line is you can't actually select
in terms of the operating system but the
180

180

00:08:38.640  -->  00:08:40.790
these other files in the case of the
bottom line is you can't actually select
181

181

00:08:40.790  -->  00:08:42.210
mack when I can select that one but if I
these other files in the case of the
182

182

00:08:42.210  -->  00:08:45.530
changes to PDF i can select the PDF and
mack when I can select that one but if I
183

183

00:08:45.530  -->  00:08:47.310
then i can't select the other ones so
changes to PDF i can select the PDF and
184

184

00:08:47.310  -->  00:08:49.590
bottom line here is it's a filter that
then i can't select the other ones so
185

185

00:08:49.590  -->  00:08:52.620
you can specify and there's the file
bottom line here is it's a filter that
186

186

00:08:52.620  -->  00:08:54.630
that actually selected and it ensures
you can specify and there's the file
187

187

00:08:54.630  -->  00:08:56.780
that the user can only select files of
that actually selected and it ensures
188

188

00:08:56.780  -->  00:08:58.120
that particular type
that the user can only select files of
189

189

00:08:58.120  -->  00:09:00.730
and as an example of why you want to do
that particular type
190

190

00:09:00.730  -->  00:09:01.450
that
and as an example of why you want to do
191

191

00:09:01.450  -->  00:09:03.040
so what happens when the user wants to
that
192

192

00:09:03.040  -->  00:09:05.500
open a file with an extension that
so what happens when the user wants to
193

193

00:09:05.500  -->  00:09:07.150
doesn't match one of those filters for
open a file with an extension that
194

194

00:09:07.150  -->  00:09:08.650
example the user might have downloaded
doesn't match one of those filters for
195

195

00:09:08.650  -->  00:09:10.960
file when they did so they gave that
example the user might have downloaded
196

196

00:09:10.960  -->  00:09:12.310
file a name with an extension that
file when they did so they gave that
197

197

00:09:12.310  -->  00:09:14.620
doesn't match any filters when they want to
file a name with an extension that
198

198

00:09:14.620  -->  00:09:16.570
open that file in the application they
doesn't match any filters when they want to
199

199

00:09:16.570  -->  00:09:18.130
could type the filename into the filename
open that file in the application they
200

200

00:09:18.130  -->  00:09:19.750
field because the filters don't
could type the filename into the filename
201

201

00:09:19.750  -->  00:09:21.400
prevent them from opening files with
field because the filters don't
202

202

00:09:21.400  -->  00:09:23.680
other file extensions but that's not
prevent them from opening files with
203

203

00:09:23.680  -->  00:09:25.600
really as convenient for the user to type
other file extensions but that's not
204

204

00:09:25.600  -->  00:09:27.640
the name so it's customary in that
really as convenient for the user to type
205

205

00:09:27.640  -->  00:09:29.590
situation to include a catchable filter
the name so it's customary in that
206

206

00:09:29.590  -->  00:09:32.230
with the open file chooser case the
situation to include a catchable filter
207

207

00:09:32.230  -->  00:09:33.880
worst that can happen is the user will try to
with the open file chooser case the
208

208

00:09:33.880  -->  00:09:35.560
open an unsupported
worst that can happen is the user will try to
209

209

00:09:35.560  -->  00:09:37.570
file in a real-world application we
open an unsupported
210

210

00:09:37.570  -->  00:09:39.520
could gracefully handle that case so
file in a real-world application we
211

211

00:09:39.520  -->  00:09:40.870
here's what i mean by that lets actually
could gracefully handle that case so
212

212

00:09:40.870  -->  00:09:43.480
look at the code for that controller so
here's what i mean by that lets actually
213

213

00:09:43.480  -->  00:09:45.340
that scenario with that third file type
look at the code for that controller so
214

214

00:09:45.340  -->  00:09:47.980
we add a new extension filter
that scenario with that third file type
215

215

00:09:47.980  -->  00:09:52.750
...
we add a new extension filter
216

216

00:09:52.750  -->  00:09:57.520
...
...
217

217

00:09:57.520  -->  00:10:05.860
and if we run that click on open again
...
218

218

00:10:05.860  -->  00:10:09.700
we've not got all files you can see
and if we run that click on open again
219

219

00:10:09.700  -->  00:10:11.410
in the case of the mac I actually got
we've not got all files you can see
220

220

00:10:11.410  -->  00:10:12.970
all three files available now i can
in the case of the mac I actually got
221

221

00:10:12.970  -->  00:10:14.470
click on that folder that I couldn't access
all three files available now i can
222

222

00:10:14.470  -->  00:10:17.920
previously and open the mp4 so
click on that folder that I couldn't access
223

223

00:10:17.920  -->  00:10:19.780
that's the catch all filter that just
previously and open the mp4 so
224

224

00:10:19.780  -->  00:10:23.350
added to our file chooser the other thing
that's the catch all filter that just
225

225

00:10:23.350  -->  00:10:25.450
to note here with the chooser is that
added to our file chooser the other thing
226

226

00:10:25.450  -->  00:10:27.850
we're not actually limited to one
to note here with the chooser is that
227

227

00:10:27.850  -->  00:10:29.890
extension so what I mean by that is lets just
we're not actually limited to one
228

228

00:10:29.890  -->  00:10:32.380
say we decide to add 1.....
extension so what I mean by that is lets just
229

229

00:10:32.380  -->  00:10:35.470
...
say we decide to add 1.....
230

230

00:10:35.470  -->  00:10:38.590
...so we can do something like
...
231

231

00:10:38.590  -->  00:10:45.160
...
...so we can do something like
232

232

00:10:45.160  -->  00:10:50.920
...
...
233

233

00:10:50.920  -->  00:10:55.090
...and now if we run that
...
234

234

00:10:55.090  -->  00:11:02.410
we opened again we can choose all image
...and now if we run that
235

235

00:11:02.410  -->  00:11:03.910
files if their were image files their of which
we opened again we can choose all image
236

236

00:11:03.910  -->  00:11:05.590
their none they would be selected
files if their were image files their of which
237

237

00:11:05.590  -->  00:11:08.560
whether it's a jpeg jpg PNG or gif file
their none they would be selected
238

238

00:11:08.560  -->  00:11:13.600
so one last thing about file
whether it's a jpeg jpg PNG or gif file
239

239

00:11:13.600  -->  00:11:16.420
choosers and when we want the user to be
so one last thing about file
240

240

00:11:16.420  -->  00:11:18.610
able to select more than one file we
choosers and when we want the user to be
241

241

00:11:18.610  -->  00:11:20.860
open the file chooser using the show open
able to select more than one file we
242

242

00:11:20.860  -->  00:11:22.570
multiple dialogue method because it
open the file chooser using the show open
243

243

00:11:22.570  -->  00:11:25.390
actually returns a list of files so i go
multiple dialogue method because it
244

244

00:11:25.390  -->  00:11:30.970
back and just run this again open going
actually returns a list of files so i go
245

245

00:11:30.970  -->  00:11:35.410
to select all files and i can select a
back and just run this again open going
246

246

00:11:35.410  -->  00:11:37.360
mac i can hold down command to selected
to select all files and i can select a
247

247

00:11:37.360  -->  00:11:38.860
an additional file or its
mac i can hold down command to selected
248

248

00:11:38.860  -->  00:11:41.410
control on a windows machine or linux
an additional file or its
249

249

00:11:41.410  -->  00:11:43.390
machine is not allowing me
control on a windows machine or linux
250

250

00:11:43.390  -->  00:11:47.260
to do that so if I close this down and instead
machine is not allowing me
251

251

00:11:47.260  -->  00:11:49.600
of going back to controller instead of
to do that so if I close this down and instead
252

252

00:11:49.600  -->  00:11:52.480
the show open dialogue its show open
of going back to controller instead of
253

253

00:11:52.480  -->  00:11:58.780
multiple dialogue and notice how its the
the show open dialogue its show open
254

254

00:11:58.780  -->  00:12:02.380
returning a list of file so i can
multiple dialogue and notice how its the
255

255

00:12:02.380  -->  00:12:05.560
change the definition there to list...
returning a list of file so i can
256

256

00:12:05.560  -->  00:12:09.730
...
change the definition there to list...
257

257

00:12:09.730  -->  00:12:22.960
...
...
258

258

00:12:22.960  -->  00:12:29.080
...try running this
...
259

259

00:12:29.080  -->  00:12:34.610
now
...try running this
260

260

00:12:34.610  -->  00:12:37.550
open this time i'm going to select all
now
261

261

00:12:37.550  -->  00:12:40.670
files and i can select all three files
open this time i'm going to select all
262

262

00:12:40.670  -->  00:12:43.490
just to see what it returns and you can
files and i can select all three files
263

263

00:12:43.490  -->  00:12:44.930
see we've got the path to the three
just to see what it returns and you can
264

264

00:12:44.930  -->  00:12:46.760
files that have been selected return to
see we've got the path to the three
265

265

00:12:46.760  -->  00:12:49.150
us so that we can work with multiple files
files that have been selected return to
266

266

00:12:49.150  -->  00:12:50.690
if that's something that's appropriate
us so that we can work with multiple files
267

267

00:12:50.690  -->  00:12:52.090
for your application
if that's something that's appropriate
268

268

00:12:52.090  -->  00:12:54.380
alright the last thing I want to cover
for your application

269

00:12:54.380  -->  00:12:56.320
now in this whirlwind tour this section is
alright the last thing I want to cover
270

270

00:12:56.320  -->  00:12:59.510
the internet or more specifically how to
now in this whirlwind tour this section is
271

271

00:12:59.510  -->  00:13:01.820
view web pages from within the javafx
the internet or more specifically how to
272

272

00:13:01.820  -->  00:13:04.390
application now client applications
view web pages from within the javafx
273

273

00:13:04.390  -->  00:13:06.400
often access the web for example
application now client applications
274

274

00:13:06.400  -->  00:13:08.690
sometimes clicking a help item will open
often access the web for example
275

275

00:13:08.690  -->  00:13:10.610
the system's default browser and
sometimes clicking a help item will open
276

276

00:13:10.610  -->  00:13:12.740
navigate to online help i'm going to
the system's default browser and
277

277

00:13:12.740  -->  00:13:14.990
take a look here at two controls to
navigate to online help i'm going to
278

278

00:13:14.990  -->  00:13:17.470
javafx controls the hyperlink and the
take a look here at two controls to
279

279

00:13:17.470  -->  00:13:19.960
webview so lets actually start with the
javafx controls the hyperlink and the
280

280

00:13:19.960  -->  00:13:22.210
hyperlink control and I'm guessing you
webview so lets actually start with the
281

281

00:13:22.210  -->  00:13:23.530
can probably figure out what that does
hyperlink control and I'm guessing you
282

282

00:13:23.530  -->  00:13:25.630
by its name so it descends from the
can probably figure out what that does
283

283

00:13:25.630  -->  00:13:28.670
labeled class so displays text but we
by its name so it descends from the
284

284

00:13:28.670  -->  00:13:30.130
use it when we want to display a link
labeled class so displays text but we
285

285

00:13:30.130  -->  00:13:32.360
going to add one to our grid pane so
use it when we want to display a link
286

286

00:13:32.360  -->  00:13:34.820
let's go back to sample .fxml
going to add one to our grid pane so
287

287

00:13:34.820  -->  00:13:36.820
will actually add one of these
let's go back to sample .fxml
288

288

00:13:36.820  -->  00:13:39.580
hyperlinks and just add it below the label
will actually add one of these
289

289

00:13:39.580  -->  00:13:44.750
that's going to be...
hyperlinks and just add it below the label
290

290

00:13:44.750  -->  00:13:47.180
...
that's going to be...
291

291

00:13:47.180  -->  00:14:00.970
...
...
292

292

00:14:00.970  -->  00:14:06.640
just run that to see that it works so I
...
293

293

00:14:06.640  -->  00:14:08.890
can see here we've got the javafx.com and
just run that to see that it works so I
294

294

00:14:08.890  -->  00:14:11.260
notice when my mouse goes over it it
can see here we've got the javafx.com and
295

295

00:14:11.260  -->  00:14:14.080
did actually changes to a link and
notice when my mouse goes over it it
296

296

00:14:14.080  -->  00:14:15.740
notice also the styling will change as
did actually changes to a link and
297

297

00:14:15.740  -->  00:14:16.370
well
notice also the styling will change as
298

298

00:14:16.370  -->  00:14:18.080
the texts is underlined as links often are or
well
299

299

00:14:18.080  -->  00:14:20.260
usually are in a browser but
the texts is underlined as links often are or
300

300

00:14:20.260  -->  00:14:22.670
the moment we click the link though you
usually are in a browser but
301

301

00:14:22.670  -->  00:14:24.380
can see that there's a notification that
the moment we click the link though you
302

302

00:14:24.380  -->  00:14:26.380
we have clicked it but nothing is
can see that there's a notification that
303

303

00:14:26.380  -->  00:14:28.370
actually happening we don't actually go to the
we have clicked it but nothing is
304

304

00:14:28.370  -->  00:14:30.860
webpage but you can see there that the
actually happening we don't actually go to the
305

305

00:14:30.860  -->  00:14:32.590
hyperlinks appearance has changed though
webpage but you can see there that the
306

306

00:14:32.590  -->  00:14:34.330
and that's because the hyperlink
hyperlinks appearance has changed though
307

307

00:14:34.330  -->  00:14:36.970
controls got three states unvisited
and that's because the hyperlink
308

308

00:14:36.970  -->  00:14:39.920
clicked and visited and the appearance
controls got three states unvisited
309

309

00:14:39.920  -->  00:14:42.010
of each state is different now if we
clicked and visited and the appearance
310

310

00:14:42.010  -->  00:14:43.430
want the appearance of a visited
of each state is different now if we
311

311

00:14:43.430  -->  00:14:45.580
hyperlink to revert back to that to a
want the appearance of a visited
312

312

00:14:45.580  -->  00:14:47.650
unvisited hyperlink we can call the set
hyperlink to revert back to that to a
313

313

00:14:47.650  -->  00:14:47.960
visited
unvisited hyperlink we can call the set
314

314

00:14:47.960  -->  00:14:49.760
method and pass in the value of
visited
315

315

00:14:49.760  -->  00:14:52.370
false now to have something happen when we
method and pass in the value of
316

316

00:14:52.370  -->  00:14:54.140
click the link we still would have to
false now to have something happen when we
317

317

00:14:54.140  -->  00:14:56.510
write an event handler and what that
click the link we still would have to
318

318

00:14:56.510  -->  00:14:57.770
should tell you is that we don't have to
write an event handler and what that
319

319

00:14:57.770  -->  00:14:59.720
go to a web page when a hyperlink
should tell you is that we don't have to
320

320

00:14:59.720  -->  00:15:01.790
controller is clicked we could instead open
go to a web page when a hyperlink
321

321

00:15:01.790  -->  00:15:03.440
a dialogue or change something on the
controller is clicked we could instead open
322

322

00:15:03.440  -->  00:15:05.420
user interface or perhaps display
a dialogue or change something on the
323

323

00:15:05.420  -->  00:15:06.830
contextual help within the application
user interface or perhaps display
324

324

00:15:06.830  -->  00:15:09.560
basically we can do whatever we want in
contextual help within the application
325

325

00:15:09.560  -->  00:15:11.870
that event handler to see how to do
basically we can do whatever we want in
326

326

00:15:11.870  -->  00:15:13.160
something like that let's close it down
that event handler to see how to do
327

327

00:15:13.160  -->  00:15:15.410
and let's go back to our controller
something like that let's close it down
328

328

00:15:15.410  -->  00:15:18.320
will go back to the fxml first will
and let's go back to our controller
329

329

00:15:18.320  -->  00:15:20.990
actually add an on-action so that
will go back to the fxml first will
330

330

00:15:20.990  -->  00:15:22.940
we can actually see that operation so
actually add an on-action so that
331

331

00:15:22.940  -->  00:15:26.870
put....
we can actually see that operation so
332

332

00:15:26.870  -->  00:15:32.600
...
put....
333

333

00:15:32.600  -->  00:15:41.990
...
...
334

334

00:15:41.990  -->  00:15:46.160
ok back here we're going to...
...
335

335

00:15:46.160  -->  00:15:51.710
...
ok back here we're going to...
336

336

00:15:51.710  -->  00:15:57.950
...
...
337

337

00:15:57.950  -->  00:15:58.790
....
...
338

338

00:15:58.790  -->  00:15:59.870
...
....
339

339

00:15:59.870  -->  00:16:02.240
...just try
...
340

340

00:16:02.240  -->  00:16:08.300
running that click on the link this time
...just try
341

341

00:16:08.300  -->  00:16:11.390
and you can see that our event handlers
running that click on the link this time
342

342

00:16:11.390  -->  00:16:13.970
showing...so what
and you can see that our event handlers
343

343

00:16:13.970  -->  00:16:16.160
do we actually want to do here well we want to
showing...so what
344

344

00:16:16.160  -->  00:16:19.700
show the web page located at www javafx
do we actually want to do here well we want to
345

345

00:16:19.700  -->  00:16:23.000
.com we can do this in two ways we can
show the web page located at www javafx
346

346

00:16:23.000  -->  00:16:25.580
open the system default browser or
.com we can do this in two ways we can
347

347

00:16:25.580  -->  00:16:27.230
alternatively we can actually add a web
open the system default browser or
348

348

00:16:27.230  -->  00:16:29.390
view controller to our user interface
alternatively we can actually add a web
349

349

00:16:29.390  -->  00:16:31.610
and display the contents of the web page
view controller to our user interface
350

350

00:16:31.610  -->  00:16:34.790
within the webview lets actually first
and display the contents of the web page
351

351

00:16:34.790  -->  00:16:36.920
view the webpage by opening the system's
within the webview lets actually first
352

352

00:16:36.920  -->  00:16:38.060
default browser
view the webpage by opening the system's
353

353

00:16:38.060  -->  00:16:45.770
so go back and change the code for that so
default browser
354

354

00:16:45.770  -->  00:16:49.060
what we'll do is we'll put a try in their
so go back and change the code for that so
355

355

00:16:49.060  -->  00:16:53.650
and do...
what we'll do is we'll put a try in their
356

356

00:16:53.650  -->  00:17:00.490
...
and do...
357

357

00:17:00.490  -->  00:17:37.360
...
...
358

358

00:17:37.360  -->  00:17:43.720
so now if we go back and run this click
...
359

359

00:17:43.720  -->  00:17:47.650
on the link and off-screen that link
so now if we go back and run this click
360

360

00:17:47.650  -->  00:17:50.320
actually opened and this is the page was
on the link and off-screen that link
361

361

00:17:50.320  -->  00:17:52.450
actually opened and actually forwarded
actually opened and this is the page was
362

362

00:17:52.450  -->  00:17:55.740
it to oracle.com and because if we go to www
actually opened and actually forwarded
363

363

00:17:55.740  -->  00:17:58.780
....it forwards to that
it to oracle.com and because if we go to www
364

364

00:17:58.780  -->  00:17:59.370
page
....it forwards to that
365

365

00:17:59.370  -->  00:18:04.030
clearly the link work fine alright so
page
366

366

00:18:04.030  -->  00:18:05.530
now we know how to visit a web page
clearly the link work fine alright so
367

367

00:18:05.530  -->  00:18:08.250
using the system's default browser let's
now we know how to visit a web page
368

368

00:18:08.250  -->  00:18:09.430
actually look at how to display the
using the system's default browser let's
369

369

00:18:09.430  -->  00:18:11.440
contents of a web page within the
actually look at how to display the
370

370

00:18:11.440  -->  00:18:15.070
application using the webview control so
contents of a web page within the
371

371

00:18:15.070  -->  00:18:16.740
let's actually go back to our code to our
application using the webview control so
372

372

00:18:16.740  -->  00:18:21.430
fxml file lets actually start by
let's actually go back to our code to our
373

373

00:18:21.430  -->  00:18:22.840
adding a webview control to the grid
fxml file lets actually start by
374

374

00:18:22.840  -->  00:18:26.490
pane we will add it in the fifth row and we're
adding a webview control to the grid
375

375

00:18:26.490  -->  00:18:31.930
going to do....
pane we will add it in the fifth row and we're
376

376

00:18:31.930  -->  00:18:36.240
...
going to do....
377

377

00:18:36.240  -->  00:18:56.650
...
...
378

378

00:18:56.650  -->  00:18:58.540
you can see there's some evidence that
...
379

379

00:18:58.540  -->  00:18:59.890
something there but i we can't really
you can see there's some evidence that
380

380

00:18:59.890  -->  00:19:01.780
see much at the moment certainly there's
something there but i we can't really
381

381

00:19:01.780  -->  00:19:03.160
no output but we haven't told it to do
see much at the moment certainly there's
382

382

00:19:03.160  -->  00:19:05.490
anything now depending on your operating
no output but we haven't told it to do
383

383

00:19:05.490  -->  00:19:07.540
system if you're running Windows or
anything now depending on your operating
384

384

00:19:07.540  -->  00:19:09.040
Linux you may not actually see anything
system if you're running Windows or
385

385

00:19:09.040  -->  00:19:11.050
because of the colors because that's
Linux you may not actually see anything
386

386

00:19:11.050  -->  00:19:12.670
because the default background color
because of the colors because that's
387

387

00:19:12.670  -->  00:19:14.580
of a webview is white and it doesn't
because the default background color
388

388

00:19:14.580  -->  00:19:16.570
have a border but on a Mac because of
of a webview is white and it doesn't
389

389

00:19:16.570  -->  00:19:17.920
the way they do the coloring you can
have a border but on a Mac because of
390

390

00:19:17.920  -->  00:19:19.740
actually see that but you probably find
the way they do the coloring you can
391

391

00:19:19.740  -->  00:19:22.230
that you won't see anything and your
actually see that but you probably find
392

392

00:19:22.230  -->  00:19:23.890
running those operating systems but we can
that you won't see anything and your
393

393

00:19:23.890  -->  00:19:26.710
then do is go back and add a reference
running those operating systems but we can
394

394

00:19:26.710  -->  00:19:28.780
for our web view to our controllers so
then do is go back and add a reference
395

395

00:19:28.780  -->  00:19:31.620
going to write the code first...
for our web view to our controllers so
396

396

00:19:31.620  -->  00:19:34.620
...
going to write the code first...
397

397

00:19:34.620  -->  00:20:38.730
...
...
398

398

00:20:38.730  -->  00:20:48.640
...so now we run that
...
399

399

00:20:48.640  -->  00:20:52.150
click on the link you can see it's
...so now we run that
400

400

00:20:52.150  -->  00:20:54.400
trying to load and obviously we can
click on the link you can see it's
401

401

00:20:54.400  -->  00:20:55.930
expand a little bit further but we actually
trying to load and obviously we can
402

402

00:20:55.930  -->  00:20:58.690
got now a workable link we can actually
expand a little bit further but we actually
403

403

00:20:58.690  -->  00:21:00.490
navigate as we would normally do a
got now a workable link we can actually
404

404

00:21:00.490  -->  00:21:03.640
regular browser which is pretty cool alright I will
navigate as we would normally do a
405

405

00:21:03.640  -->  00:21:07.180
just close it down so that web
regular browser which is pretty cool alright I will
406

406

00:21:07.180  -->  00:21:09.250
engine is the powerhouse that does that
just close it down so that web
407

407

00:21:09.250  -->  00:21:11.170
drives the display of the webpage and we
engine is the powerhouse that does that
408

408

00:21:11.170  -->  00:21:12.970
can actually do a lot with it gives us
drives the display of the webpage and we
409

409

00:21:12.970  -->  00:21:14.800
access to the web pages document
can actually do a lot with it gives us
410

410

00:21:14.800  -->  00:21:16.540
model and we can even use that to
access to the web pages document
411

411

00:21:16.540  -->  00:21:18.820
execute JavaScript and what I suggest
model and we can even use that to
412

412

00:21:18.820  -->  00:21:20.290
you do if you're interested in that is
execute JavaScript and what I suggest
413

413

00:21:20.290  -->  00:21:22.570
referred to the documentation for web
you do if you're interested in that is
414

414

00:21:22.570  -->  00:21:24.370
engine and i'll just bring that up on
referred to the documentation for web
415

415

00:21:24.370  -->  00:21:28.810
the screen very useful to check that out
engine and i'll just bring that up on
416

416

00:21:28.810  -->  00:21:30.340
and find out more about that
the screen very useful to check that out
417

417

00:21:30.340  -->  00:21:33.280
alright so that actually concludes our
and find out more about that
418

418

00:21:33.280  -->  00:21:36.820
tour of a few more javafx features and
alright so that actually concludes our
419

419

00:21:36.820  -->  00:21:37.990
obviously i still haven't covered
tour of a few more javafx features and
420

420

00:21:37.990  -->  00:21:40.390
everything possible with that java fx
obviously i still haven't covered
421

421

00:21:40.390  -->  00:21:41.410
has to offer because it's so
everything possible with that java fx
422

422

00:21:41.410  -->  00:21:43.450
comprehensive but I think you'll agree
has to offer because it's so
423

423

00:21:43.450  -->  00:21:45.070
we've covered a lot of the basics and
comprehensive but I think you'll agree
424

424

00:21:45.070  -->  00:21:45.880
then some
we've covered a lot of the basics and
425

425

00:21:45.880  -->  00:21:49.480
so moving on in the next video we're
then some
426

426

00:21:49.480  -->  00:21:52.150
gonna make a start on checking out scene
so moving on in the next video we're
427

427

00:21:52.150  -->  00:21:55.090
builder now to date what we've done is
gonna make a start on checking out scene
428

428

00:21:55.090  -->  00:21:58.150
we've focused on using FXML and creating
builder now to date what we've done is
429

429

00:21:58.150  -->  00:22:00.580
that manually but scene builder does it
we've focused on using FXML and creating
430

430

00:22:00.580  -->  00:22:01.930
allows you to use sort of a
that manually but scene builder does it
431

431

00:22:01.930  -->  00:22:04.270
drag-and-drop principle to create screen
allows you to use sort of a
432

432

00:22:04.270  -->  00:22:05.920
design which is obviously going to be a
drag-and-drop principle to create screen
433

433

00:22:05.920  -->  00:22:08.290
lot easier than knowing
design which is obviously going to be a
434

434

00:22:08.290  -->  00:22:10.300
fxml so let's start looking at that in
lot easier than knowing
435

435

00:22:10.300  -->  00:22:15.840
the next video
fxml so let's start looking at that in
