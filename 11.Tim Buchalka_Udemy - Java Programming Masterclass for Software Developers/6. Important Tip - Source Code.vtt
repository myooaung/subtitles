00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.140
<v ->I wanna talk briefly about source code.</v>
1

2
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.060
Now before we get into what source code is
2

3
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.470
I want to say that it's incredibly important
3

4
00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:13.010
for you to be typing in the code
4

5
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.320
as you see me type it in this course
5

6
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.680
because you can watch videos
6

7
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.560
and you'll learn a certain amount of programming
7

8
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.460
but to really master programming
8

9
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.750
and really understand it,
9

10
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.606
typing in the code, running the programmes,
10

11
00:00:23.606 --> 00:00:25.700
finding errors and fixing them,
11

12
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.533
that's your success,
12

13
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:28.750
your path to becoming a programmer.
13

14
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.920
So it's highly recommended that you do that.
14

15
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:31.920
So what you can do,
15

16
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.250
what a lot of our students do
16

17
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.120
is they'll watch a video once
17

18
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.150
to get the general feel for what's in the video
18

19
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.870
then they'll go back and watch it again,
19

20
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.560
then the second time they're watching it
20

21
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.420
they'll be typing along.
21

22
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.520
So as they see me type something on the screen
22

23
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.250
they'll actually type the same thing into their computer
23

24
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.710
IntelliJ idea or whichever one you're using
24

25
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.560
whichever editor you're using
25

26
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.590
and that's really the process
26

27
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.160
where you'll really get the most out of the course.
27

28
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.570
So either do that watch the video first
28

29
00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.590
and then follow along the second time through
29

30
00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:58.860
by typing in the code
30

31
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.280
or if you're feeling comfort enough
31

32
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.050
just as you're watching the video for the first time
32

33
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.850
be typing along and be prepared
33

34
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.130
to pause the video if needed and rewind and do whatever
34

35
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.080
really make sure you understand a concept completely
35

36
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.140
before moving on to the next video.
36

37
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.650
And this briefly now before we finish
37

38
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.130
I wanted to put also point out
38

39
00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.380
that in terms of the codes that I'm typing
39

40
00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.280
it's available for you to download.
40

41
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.430
Each lecture has got this resources section you can see here
41

42
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.970
so you can click over to that in the Udemy
42

43
00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.400
and you can download the source code.
43

44
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.100
So you can grab that, you can unzip it
44

45
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.640
and then you can open that code up after you've unzipped it
45

46
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.020
directly in your editor
46

47
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.530
and you'll be able to actually follow along
47

48
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:34.776
and compare your code to my code.
48

49
00:01:34.776 --> 00:01:36.890
It could be a good idea to do that
49

50
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.750
or if you wanna just put my code into your project
50

51
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.420
and sort of paste it in and use it that way.
51

52
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.150
So it's available there lecture by lecture
52

53
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.980
but also down the bottom of the course
53

54
00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.660
you can see that I've got a lecture here
54

55
00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:47.930
and that's got all the source code
55

56
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.530
you can just sort of scroll down,
56

57
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.060
click on the relevant to volve,
57

58
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.980
which will then be downloaded to your computer
58

59
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.430
and you can do the same thing you can unzip it.
59

60
00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.710
So again I just wanna make it clear
60

61
00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.540
that's really important for you
61

62
00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.670
to really get the most out of this course
62

63
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.510
to be typing the code as you see it
63

64
00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:02.720
and that's gonna really help you
64

65
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.580
become a productive Java programmer.
65

66
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.520
All right let's move on now to the next video
66

67
00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.870
and start some programming.
