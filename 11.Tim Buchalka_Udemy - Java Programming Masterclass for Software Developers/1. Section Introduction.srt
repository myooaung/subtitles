00:00:04,980  -->  00:00:07,200
so in this section of the course we're
2

2

00:00:07,200  -->  00:00:10,290
going to take a look at databases and
3

3

00:00:10,290  -->  00:00:11,820
we're going to start with an overview of
4

4

00:00:11,820  -->  00:00:14,030
what databases are go ahead
5

5

00:00:14,030  -->  00:00:16,500
and install sqlite which is a free
6

6

00:00:16,500  -->  00:00:18,530
and open source database tool and then
7

7

00:00:18,530  -->  00:00:20,880
we'll go through an overview SQL or
8

8

00:00:20,880  -->  00:00:22,830
also pronounced as sql which is a
9

9

00:00:22,830  -->  00:00:25,010
database language used to communicate
10

10

00:00:25,010  -->  00:00:26,970
with databases now we're going to be
11

11

00:00:26,970  -->  00:00:28,850
using the command line initially as we
12

12

00:00:28,850  -->  00:00:31,430
start to using sql and sqlite
13

13

00:00:31,430  -->  00:00:33,060
but than later videos in this
14

14

00:00:33,060  -->  00:00:35,030
section we're going to progress and move
15

15

00:00:35,030  -->  00:00:37,590
over to java and start on how to use
16

16

00:00:37,590  -->  00:00:40,320
databases from java and writing
17

17

00:00:40,320  -->  00:00:43,320
programs to manipulate databases but
18

18

00:00:43,320  -->  00:00:44,390
we really need to have this basic
19

19

00:00:44,390  -->  00:00:46,530
understanding of databases and sql
20

20

00:00:46,530  -->  00:00:48,350
before getting to the state of writing
21

21

00:00:48,350  -->  00:00:51,460
code in Java
22

22

00:00:51,460  -->  00:00:53,320
if you've got some history with
23

23

00:00:53,320  -->  00:00:56,350
databases you might be wondering why why
24

24

00:00:56,350  -->  00:00:57,960
am I using sqlite and not my
25

25

00:00:57,960  -->  00:01:00,070
sql or some other database
26

26

00:01:00,070  -->  00:01:01,840
the reason is generally speaking the
27

27

00:01:01,840  -->  00:01:03,550
skills that you learn with sqlite
28

28

00:01:03,550  -->  00:01:05,920
apply to any database including my
29

29

00:01:05,920  -->  00:01:08,800
sql so the sql code that you'll learn
30

30

00:01:08,800  -->  00:01:11,170
as well as the java code that to you
31

31

00:01:11,170  -->  00:01:13,240
will create in this section requires a
32

32

00:01:13,240  -->  00:01:14,970
very little change to work on literally
33

33

00:01:14,970  -->  00:01:17,680
any database now sqlite is ideal
34

34

00:01:17,680  -->  00:01:20,020
to get started with it's a very small
35

35

00:01:20,020  -->  00:01:21,900
download is a very simple package and
36

36

00:01:21,900  -->  00:01:24,310
its really really highly used in fact
37

37

00:01:24,310  -->  00:01:26,200
it's almost one of the most highly used
38

38

00:01:26,200  -->  00:01:28,570
programs in the world believe or not and
39

39

00:01:28,570  -->  00:01:30,250
I've actually put together videos in
40

40

00:01:30,250  -->  00:01:32,110
this section showing how to get it
41

41

00:01:32,110  -->  00:01:34,330
working or Windows Mac and Linux as well
42

42

00:01:34,330  -->  00:01:38,320
but just to make sure that the course is
43

43

00:01:38,320  -->  00:01:39,940
really a complete in this section
44

44

00:01:39,940  -->  00:01:42,250
towards the end of the section we're
45

45

00:01:42,250  -->  00:01:43,650
also going to get mysql up and
46

46

00:01:43,650  -->  00:01:45,970
running as an exercise so you can see
47

47

00:01:45,970  -->  00:01:48,100
just how easy it is to switch to another
48

48

00:01:48,100  -->  00:01:50,950
database and what changes if any are
49

49

00:01:50,950  -->  00:01:53,140
needed to get that to happen so anyway
50

50

00:01:53,140  -->  00:01:58,950
let's get started
