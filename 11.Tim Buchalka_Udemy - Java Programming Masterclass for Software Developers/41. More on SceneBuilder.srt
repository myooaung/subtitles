00:00:05,700  -->  00:00:07,740
alright so let's go have a look at this
2

2

00:00:07,740  -->  00:00:10,220
code section on the right hand side of
alright so let's go have a look at this
3

3

00:00:10,220  -->  00:00:12,800
the scene builder now we got nothing
code section on the right hand side of
4

4

00:00:12,800  -->  00:00:15,050
selected so there's nothing to or no
the scene builder now we got nothing
5

5

00:00:15,050  -->  00:00:17,370
properties to show but being able to
selected so there's nothing to or no
6

6

00:00:17,370  -->  00:00:19,620
build a UI using scene builder wouldn't be that
properties to show but being able to
7

7

00:00:19,620  -->  00:00:21,630
useful if you still to connect controls
build a UI using scene builder wouldn't be that
8

8

00:00:21,630  -->  00:00:24,270
to event handlers by editing the fxml
useful if you still to connect controls
9

9

00:00:24,270  -->  00:00:26,430
file so lets actually add an action
to event handlers by editing the fxml
10

10

00:00:26,430  -->  00:00:29,570
handler to the controller dot java file
file so lets actually add an action
11

11

00:00:29,570  -->  00:00:31,790
and what we're going to do is make a
handler to the controller dot java file
12

12

00:00:31,790  -->  00:00:33,740
very simple event here handler here
and what we're going to do is make a
13

13

00:00:33,740  -->  00:00:35,010
when the ok buttons
very simple event here handler here
14

14

00:00:35,010  -->  00:00:36,450
pressed I'm going to change the text of
when the ok buttons
15

15

00:00:36,450  -->  00:00:39,030
the label to ok button pressed now
pressed I'm going to change the text of
16

16

00:00:39,030  -->  00:00:40,440
since we'll be setting one of the labels
the label to ok button pressed now
17

17

00:00:40,440  -->  00:00:42,450
properties we have to declare a member
since we'll be setting one of the labels
18

18

00:00:42,450  -->  00:00:44,370
variable for it and we'll need to
properties we have to declare a member
19

19

00:00:44,370  -->  00:00:46,260
associate that variable with the label
variable for it and we'll need to
20

20

00:00:46,260  -->  00:00:48,750
and as you recall we're going to be doing
associate that variable with the label
21

21

00:00:48,750  -->  00:00:50,850
that using these fx ID as the
and as you recall we're going to be doing
22

22

00:00:50,850  -->  00:00:53,220
variable name as we've always done now
that using these fx ID as the
23

23

00:00:53,220  -->  00:00:55,020
let's go back to our controller
variable name as we've always done now
24

24

00:00:55,020  -->  00:00:57,780
initially and set that up so we're going
let's go back to our controller
25

25

00:00:57,780  -->  00:01:03,750
to just type it in here the...
initially and set that up so we're going
26

26

00:01:03,750  -->  00:01:08,850
...
to just type it in here the...
27

27

00:01:08,850  -->  00:01:23,450
...
...
28

28

00:01:23,450  -->  00:01:30,110
....ok so that's the code
...
29

29

00:01:30,110  -->  00:01:31,020
that we're going to be working with
....ok so that's the code
30

30

00:01:31,020  -->  00:01:33,630
going back to out going back to scene builder
that we're going to be working with
31

31

00:01:33,630  -->  00:01:35,670
now we need to make the
going back to out going back to scene builder
32

32

00:01:35,670  -->  00:01:37,740
connections so first i'm going to select
now we need to make the
33

33

00:01:37,740  -->  00:01:41,310
the label field clicking on that their and
connections so first i'm going to select
34

34

00:01:41,310  -->  00:01:42,500
again I could have selected over here if
the label field clicking on that their and
35

35

00:01:42,500  -->  00:01:45,810
I wanted to and expand
again I could have selected over here if
36

36

00:01:45,810  -->  00:01:47,100
a little bit more so we can see
I wanted to and expand
37

37

00:01:47,100  -->  00:01:49,640
what's going on there now under code
a little bit more so we can see
38

38

00:01:49,640  -->  00:01:54,840
section FX ID now sometimes it works and
what's going on there now under code
39

39

00:01:54,840  -->  00:01:56,180
sometimes it doesn't
section FX ID now sometimes it works and
40

40

00:01:56,180  -->  00:01:57,860
the label will actually appear in the FX
sometimes it doesn't
41

41

00:01:57,860  -->  00:01:59,420
ID well obviously this case it hasn't
the label will actually appear in the FX
42

42

00:01:59,420  -->  00:02:02,340
appeared but what I found you can do is
ID well obviously this case it hasn't
43

43

00:02:02,340  -->  00:02:07,670
you click on OK look and back and click on
appeared but what I found you can do is
44

44

00:02:07,670  -->  00:02:11,210
text in scene builder and see if
you click on OK look and back and click on
45

45

00:02:11,210  -->  00:02:13,860
it's going to actually work for me code
text in scene builder and see if
46

46

00:02:13,860  -->  00:02:16,560
now it's not gonna work sometimes you do
it's going to actually work for me code
47

47

00:02:16,560  -->  00:02:18,030
actually have to type it but i want to
now it's not gonna work sometimes you do
48

48

00:02:18,030  -->  00:02:19,270
show you guys is I'll type their
actually have to type it but i want to
49

49

00:02:19,270  -->  00:02:24,860
anyway if i go back to the ok will try
show you guys is I'll type their
50

50

00:02:24,860  -->  00:02:35,560
again scene builder ok code so i got
anyway if i go back to the ok will try
51

51

00:02:35,560  -->  00:02:37,090
label the id working successfully
again scene builder ok code so i got
52

52

00:02:37,090  -->  00:02:39,190
there what it should be doing is
label the id working successfully
53

53

00:02:39,190  -->  00:02:42,140
actually showing the drop downs and it
there what it should be doing is
54

54

00:02:42,140  -->  00:02:44,020
seems a little bit inconsistent that it
actually showing the drop downs and it
55

55

00:02:44,020  -->  00:02:46,870
doesn't always show this let's make sure
seems a little bit inconsistent that it
56

56

00:02:46,870  -->  00:02:48,580
the control is still correct we still got
doesn't always show this let's make sure
57

57

00:02:48,580  -->  00:02:49,810
code and obviously that hasn't
the control is still correct we still got
58

58

00:02:49,810  -->  00:02:52,870
been used yet but the association's
code and obviously that hasn't
59

59

00:02:52,870  -->  00:02:54,370
there is now there you can see that the
been used yet but the association's
60

60

00:02:54,370  -->  00:02:56,720
code is now bold so that part's
there is now there you can see that the
61

61

00:02:56,720  -->  00:03:03,250
working what we should have to do is
code is now bold so that part's
62

62

00:03:03,250  -->  00:03:04,390
select from the drop-down I'm going to
working what we should have to do is
63

63

00:03:04,390  -->  00:03:09,470
type it....we go back
select from the drop-down I'm going to
64

64

00:03:09,470  -->  00:03:12,110
and check to see
type it....we go back
65

65

00:03:12,110  -->  00:03:14,240
the association's their associations
and check to see
66

66

00:03:14,240  -->  00:03:16,660
there but what I'm hoping to show you
the association's their associations
67

67

00:03:16,660  -->  00:03:20,140
but it's not playing ball with us is
there but what I'm hoping to show you
68

68

00:03:20,140  -->  00:03:21,310
that will actually give you a drop-down
but it's not playing ball with us is
69

69

00:03:21,310  -->  00:03:24,080
it should be doing is actually giving us
that will actually give you a drop-down
70

70

00:03:24,080  -->  00:03:25,780
a drop down here where we can actually
it should be doing is actually giving us
71

71

00:03:25,780  -->  00:03:28,390
select the various options but it's not
a drop down here where we can actually
72

72

00:03:28,390  -->  00:03:29,890
actually doing it for now
select the various options but it's not
73

73

00:03:29,890  -->  00:03:32,270
what you should get and what I find does
actually doing it for now
74

74

00:03:32,270  -->  00:03:34,490
work i had it working before is
what you should get and what I find does
75

75

00:03:34,490  -->  00:03:35,830
that when you select a particular
work i had it working before is
76

76

00:03:35,830  -->  00:03:38,710
control you actually get the little
that when you select a particular
77

77

00:03:38,710  -->  00:03:40,640
its smart enough this drop-down list of
control you actually get the little
78

78

00:03:40,640  -->  00:03:43,360
all the action all the event handlers
its smart enough this drop-down list of
79

79

00:03:43,360  -->  00:03:44,470
that its find and you can actually just
all the action all the event handlers
80

80

00:03:44,470  -->  00:03:48,160
select the either the ID or the event
that its find and you can actually just
81

81

00:03:48,160  -->  00:03:50,410
handler you want to use by a drop-down and
select the either the ID or the event
82

82

00:03:50,410  -->  00:03:51,830
obviously for whatever reason that's not
handler you want to use by a drop-down and
83

83

00:03:51,830  -->  00:03:54,080
working maybe it's a mac bug or the
obviously for whatever reason that's not
84

84

00:03:54,080  -->  00:03:56,080
as I said I did get it working earlier so
working maybe it's a mac bug or the
85

85

00:03:56,080  -->  00:03:58,550
bottom line is if it's not coming up for
as I said I did get it working earlier so
86

86

00:03:58,550  -->  00:03:59,860
you automatically
bottom line is if it's not coming up for
87

87

00:03:59,860  -->  00:04:01,330
you may have to type in the label here
you automatically
88

88

00:04:01,330  -->  00:04:03,340
but in this case what I've done now
you may have to type in the label here
89

89

00:04:03,340  -->  00:04:06,740
with the ok button I have sets set the
but in this case what I've done now
90

90

00:04:06,740  -->  00:04:09,520
handle action method assign that to the
with the ok button I have sets set the
91

91

00:04:09,520  -->  00:04:11,080
on action event handler
handle action method assign that to the
92

92

00:04:11,080  -->  00:04:12,830
so what that means is we should be able
on action event handler
93

93

00:04:12,830  -->  00:04:19,740
to run this click on ok
so what that means is we should be able
94

94

00:04:19,740  -->  00:04:21,030
and obviously got the code working in
to run this click on ok
95

95

00:04:21,030  -->  00:04:23,160
that's actually fired up the
and obviously got the code working in
96

96

00:04:23,160  -->  00:04:26,820
event handler was going to stop that
that's actually fired up the
97

97

00:04:26,820  -->  00:04:32,280
there we go now this is what I wanted to
event handler was going to stop that
98

98

00:04:32,280  -->  00:04:34,830
show you perhaps it need a compilation this is what
there we go now this is what I wanted to
99

99

00:04:34,830  -->  00:04:36,240
really was trying to show you there's a
show you perhaps it need a compilation this is what
100

100

00:04:36,240  -->  00:04:38,090
drop down there and you've got multiple
really was trying to show you there's a
101

101

00:04:38,090  -->  00:04:39,720
event handlers it would actually find
drop down there and you've got multiple
102

102

00:04:39,720  -->  00:04:40,410
them for us
event handlers it would actually find
103

103

00:04:40,410  -->  00:04:43,440
likewise with the label what that should
them for us
104

104

00:04:43,440  -->  00:04:45,000
do that still not gonna play ball with
likewise with the label what that should
105

105

00:04:45,000  -->  00:04:47,490
us is a drop-down that will actually
do that still not gonna play ball with
106

106

00:04:47,490  -->  00:04:48,810
pop up here as well and we would have
us is a drop-down that will actually
107

107

00:04:48,810  -->  00:04:51,990
been able to select the ID via drop-down
pop up here as well and we would have
108

108

00:04:51,990  -->  00:04:54,540
list just try deleting out of interest
been able to select the ID via drop-down
109

109

00:04:54,540  -->  00:04:56,670
updating that seems that work for us
list just try deleting out of interest
110

110

00:04:56,670  -->  00:05:00,270
no that is not the right dropdown just
updating that seems that work for us
111

111

00:05:00,270  -->  00:05:01,050
put it back in again
no that is not the right dropdown just
112

112

00:05:01,050  -->  00:05:03,750
alright long-winded way of showing you
put it back in again
113

113

00:05:03,750  -->  00:05:05,100
how that works but the bottom line is
alright long-winded way of showing you
114

114

00:05:05,100  -->  00:05:08,190
that we can use that code part of the
how that works but the bottom line is
115

115

00:05:08,190  -->  00:05:11,040
settings area to associate event
that we can use that code part of the
116

116

00:05:11,040  -->  00:05:13,260
handlers and set to ids etc as we
settings area to associate event
117

117

00:05:13,260  -->  00:05:14,520
would normally have done manually in the
handlers and set to ids etc as we
118

118

00:05:14,520  -->  00:05:15,330
code
would normally have done manually in the
119

119

00:05:15,330  -->  00:05:16,950
alright so that's how we wire the
code
120

120

00:05:16,950  -->  00:05:18,990
controllers to action handlers and fields
alright so that's how we wire the
121

121

00:05:18,990  -->  00:05:21,620
using the scene builder and just to
controllers to action handlers and fields
122

122

00:05:21,620  -->  00:05:24,120
confirm we saw that before both the
using the scene builder and just to
123

123

00:05:24,120  -->  00:05:26,340
label and the method obviously
confirm we saw that before both the
124

124

00:05:26,340  -->  00:05:29,340
are now enabled linked just the other
label and the method obviously
125

125

00:05:29,340  -->  00:05:30,510
thing which you probably picked up
are now enabled linked just the other
126

126

00:05:30,510  -->  00:05:33,750
anyway but just to confirm when we
thing which you probably picked up
127

127

00:05:33,750  -->  00:05:36,180
select the control and we've got the
anyway but just to confirm when we
128

128

00:05:36,180  -->  00:05:39,240
code part of the settings area open when
select the control and we've got the
129

129

00:05:39,240  -->  00:05:40,470
we select a different one
code part of the settings area open when
130

130

00:05:40,470  -->  00:05:43,110
it actually changes to give you only the
we select a different one
131

131

00:05:43,110  -->  00:05:44,990
options that are appropriate for that
it actually changes to give you only the
132

132

00:05:44,990  -->  00:05:47,340
particular control only sort of action
options that are appropriate for that
133

133

00:05:47,340  -->  00:05:48,660
handlers that are appropriate which is
particular control only sort of action
134

134

00:05:48,660  -->  00:05:52,080
pretty cool let's move on now and
handlers that are appropriate which is
135

135

00:05:52,080  -->  00:05:55,350
talk about style controls with CSS when
pretty cool let's move on now and
136

136

00:05:55,350  -->  00:05:57,300
using the scene builder now there's a
talk about style controls with CSS when
137

137

00:05:57,300  -->  00:05:59,040
couple ways of doing this the first ways
using the scene builder now there's a
138

138

00:05:59,040  -->  00:06:01,260
to create a style sheet and associate
couple ways of doing this the first ways
139

139

00:06:01,260  -->  00:06:04,050
that with a container or control
to create a style sheet and associate
140

140

00:06:04,050  -->  00:06:05,760
let's start by doing that in intellij
that with a container or control
141

141

00:06:05,760  -->  00:06:07,490
and you see how to do that previously
let's start by doing that in intellij
142

142

00:06:07,490  -->  00:06:09,150
I'm going to right-click the package
and you see how to do that previously
143

143

00:06:09,150  -->  00:06:12,270
click on new select file and we'll call
I'm going to right-click the package
144

144

00:06:12,270  -->  00:06:16,800
this on .....and lets
click on new select file and we'll call
145

145

00:06:16,800  -->  00:06:18,510
create a simple style here....
this on .....and lets
146

146

00:06:18,510  -->  00:06:22,490
...
create a simple style here....
147

147

00:06:22,490  -->  00:06:39,580
...
...
148

148

00:06:39,580  -->  00:06:42,220
...and go back to our layout
...
149

149

00:06:42,220  -->  00:06:44,800
to scene builder and obviously
...and go back to our layout
150

150

00:06:44,800  -->  00:06:47,230
nothing's changed yet and we need to
to scene builder and obviously
151

151

00:06:47,230  -->  00:06:49,300
associate what we've just created the
nothing's changed yet and we need to
152

152

00:06:49,300  -->  00:06:52,300
style sheet to our layout i'm going to select
associate what we've just created the
153

153

00:06:52,300  -->  00:06:55,090
the grid pane and in the properties
style sheet to our layout i'm going to select
154

154

00:06:55,090  -->  00:06:57,760
section expand this a little bit so you
the grid pane and in the properties
155

155

00:06:57,760  -->  00:07:00,040
can see it we have this option here for
section expand this a little bit so you
156

156

00:07:00,040  -->  00:07:02,920
style sheets so this plus button which
can see it we have this option here for
157

157

00:07:02,920  -->  00:07:04,390
I'm going to press but fortunately the
style sheets so this plus button which
158

158

00:07:04,390  -->  00:07:06,820
integration with the ide is poor here
I'm going to press but fortunately the
159

159

00:07:06,820  -->  00:07:07,870
at least in the version that I'm
integration with the ide is poor here
160

160

00:07:07,870  -->  00:07:11,020
checking so when I click on that we
at least in the version that I'm
161

161

00:07:11,020  -->  00:07:14,380
don't get a list of style sheets with this
checking so when I click on that we
162

162

00:07:14,380  -->  00:07:15,940
project in fact we're going to navigate
don't get a list of style sheets with this
163

163

00:07:15,940  -->  00:07:18,250
to that project to actually be able to
project in fact we're going to navigate
164

164

00:07:18,250  -->  00:07:20,050
select that style sheets so i'm going to go
to that project to actually be able to
165

165

00:07:20,050  -->  00:07:27,310
into that folder right here in the folder
select that style sheets so i'm going to go
166

166

00:07:27,310  -->  00:07:29,770
going to go to the source folder sample
into that folder right here in the folder
167

167

00:07:29,770  -->  00:07:31,510
and got to manually select the
going to go to the source folder sample
168

168

00:07:31,510  -->  00:07:34,090
styles . css once I do that
and got to manually select the
169

169

00:07:34,090  -->  00:07:35,920
you can see straight away that the
styles . css once I do that
170

170

00:07:35,920  -->  00:07:38,800
style has taken effect and over here on
you can see straight away that the
171

171

00:07:38,800  -->  00:07:40,750
the right-hand side will be using the
style has taken effect and over here on
172

172

00:07:40,750  -->  00:07:44,650
stylesheet styles.css what you can also
the right-hand side will be using the
173

173

00:07:44,650  -->  00:07:47,080
do their now you can remove that if you
stylesheet styles.css what you can also
174

174

00:07:47,080  -->  00:07:48,760
wanted to the other thing can also do is
do their now you can remove that if you
175

175

00:07:48,760  -->  00:07:50,140
you can actually have multiple style sheets
wanted to the other thing can also do is
176

176

00:07:50,140  -->  00:07:54,070
you can add a second if you want to we
you can actually have multiple style sheets
177

177

00:07:54,070  -->  00:07:56,200
can open the stylesheet but that
you can add a second if you want to we
178

178

00:07:56,200  -->  00:07:58,480
actually opens it outside IntelliJ in
can open the stylesheet but that
179

179

00:07:58,480  -->  00:08:01,240
whatever editor is associated with CCS
actually opens it outside IntelliJ in
180

180

00:08:01,240  -->  00:08:02,980
files in the system so won't flick to the file
whatever editor is associated with CCS
181

181

00:08:02,980  -->  00:08:04,900
within IntelliJ again poor
files in the system so won't flick to the file
182

182

00:08:04,900  -->  00:08:06,820
integration in this particular area
within IntelliJ again poor
183

183

00:08:06,820  -->  00:08:09,400
alright let's go back to the CSS file
integration in this particular area
184

184

00:08:09,400  -->  00:08:13,060
IntelliJ and changed the green to blue
alright let's go back to the CSS file
185

185

00:08:13,060  -->  00:08:20,110
...and going back to scene builder
IntelliJ and changed the green to blue
186

186

00:08:20,110  -->  00:08:22,390
notice how it's still green nothing's
...and going back to scene builder
187

187

00:08:22,390  -->  00:08:23,320
changed
notice how it's still green nothing's
188

188

00:08:23,320  -->  00:08:24,910
so we still seeing green buttons
changed
189

189

00:08:24,910  -->  00:08:26,770
in the integration but we actually run
so we still seeing green buttons
190

190

00:08:26,770  -->  00:08:31,210
the app we do actually get the blue
in the integration but we actually run
191

191

00:08:31,210  -->  00:08:32,680
buttons abeint ones that are very
the app we do actually get the blue
192

192

00:08:32,680  -->  00:08:35,080
hard to read so clearly when we run the
buttons abeint ones that are very
193

193

00:08:35,080  -->  00:08:37,510
app it's actually looking at the updated
hard to read so clearly when we run the
194

194

00:08:37,510  -->  00:08:39,670
style sheet and making those appropriate
app it's actually looking at the updated
195

195

00:08:39,670  -->  00:08:40,540
changes
style sheet and making those appropriate
196

196

00:08:40,540  -->  00:08:43,110
unfortunately in terms of scene builder
changes
197

197

00:08:43,110  -->  00:08:45,060
it's not actually sort of rereading that
unfortunately in terms of scene builder
198

198

00:08:45,060  -->  00:08:48,510
file again again poor integration and if
it's not actually sort of rereading that
199

199

00:08:48,510  -->  00:08:50,370
you're finding that when you
file again again poor integration and if
200

200

00:08:50,370  -->  00:08:52,740
changes if you're following along and
you're finding that when you
201

201

00:08:52,740  -->  00:08:54,630
you found that these buttons start
changes if you're following along and
202

202

00:08:54,630  -->  00:08:56,730
started you know you can't still read all
you found that these buttons start
203

203

00:08:56,730  -->  00:08:58,230
the texts on you can actually resize
started you know you can't still read all
204

204

00:08:58,230  -->  00:09:00,570
these things literally can just move
the texts on you can actually resize
205

205

00:09:00,570  -->  00:09:02,130
over your mouse over there and that's
these things literally can just move
206

206

00:09:02,130  -->  00:09:04,950
notice when I do that i can make the buttons
over your mouse over there and that's
207

207

00:09:04,950  -->  00:09:07,740
bigger or smaller come over here if I wanted
notice when I do that i can make the buttons
208

208

00:09:07,740  -->  00:09:11,160
to expand it will make it smaller as
bigger or smaller come over here if I wanted
209

209

00:09:11,160  -->  00:09:13,230
appropriate to resize that's how you do
to expand it will make it smaller as
210

210

00:09:13,230  -->  00:09:15,270
your resizing you can resize there or
appropriate to resize that's how you do
211

211

00:09:15,270  -->  00:09:17,220
you can click on grid pane and do it
your resizing you can resize there or
212

212

00:09:17,220  -->  00:09:18,990
that way by grabbing the sides of each
you can click on grid pane and do it
213

213

00:09:18,990  -->  00:09:21,900
button and the resizing as appropriate
that way by grabbing the sides of each
214

214

00:09:21,900  -->  00:09:24,180
alright so anyway the bottom line here
button and the resizing as appropriate
215

215

00:09:24,180  -->  00:09:27,900
is in terms of CSS the integration isn't
alright so anyway the bottom line here
216

216

00:09:27,900  -->  00:09:28,770
great with
is in terms of CSS the integration isn't
217

217

00:09:28,770  -->  00:09:31,110
intellij ok it's pretty well non
great with
218

218

00:09:31,110  -->  00:09:33,540
existent if we want you use css to
intellij ok it's pretty well non
219

219

00:09:33,540  -->  00:09:35,970
style our controls my suggestion is to
existent if we want you use css to
220

220

00:09:35,970  -->  00:09:38,400
use scene builder in standalone mode
style our controls my suggestion is to
221

221

00:09:38,400  -->  00:09:40,710
which would be more convenient and
use scene builder in standalone mode
222

222

00:09:40,710  -->  00:09:41,850
i'm going to show you how to do the
which would be more convenient and
223

223

00:09:41,850  -->  00:09:44,250
little bit later for now though
i'm going to show you how to do the
224

224

00:09:44,250  -->  00:09:46,470
in addition to associated a style sheet
little bit later for now though
225

225

00:09:46,470  -->  00:09:49,200
with a container or controls we can
in addition to associated a style sheet
226

226

00:09:49,200  -->  00:09:51,210
actually also set styles by typing
with a container or controls we can
227

227

00:09:51,210  -->  00:09:53,730
into the style area i'll show you what I mean
actually also set styles by typing
228

228

00:09:53,730  -->  00:09:55,200
we click on ok we're going to
into the style area i'll show you what I mean
229

229

00:09:55,200  -->  00:09:57,150
just put a style on that individual ok
we click on ok we're going to
230

230

00:09:57,150  -->  00:10:01,680
a button down here we've got these two
just put a style on that individual ok
231

231

00:10:01,680  -->  00:10:04,830
style input boxes in there what i
a button down here we've got these two
232

232

00:10:04,830  -->  00:10:07,290
can do is i can type in...
style input boxes in there what i
233

233

00:10:07,290  -->  00:10:11,550
...
can do is i can type in...
234

234

00:10:11,550  -->  00:10:14,160
...and see how
...
235

235

00:10:14,160  -->  00:10:17,340
we put an individual style for the ok
...and see how
236

236

00:10:17,340  -->  00:10:20,610
button and you can also press + button
we put an individual style for the ok
237

237

00:10:20,610  -->  00:10:22,110
if you had more than one style that you
button and you can also press + button
238

238

00:10:22,110  -->  00:10:25,170
want to associate to one control the other
if you had more than one style that you
239

239

00:10:25,170  -->  00:10:26,310
thing is if you look at the top of the
want to associate to one control the other
240

240

00:10:26,310  -->  00:10:29,700
screen you'll notice got CSS I know it
thing is if you look at the top of the
241

241

00:10:29,700  -->  00:10:31,710
is a very small font pretty hard to read
screen you'll notice got CSS I know it
242

242

00:10:31,710  -->  00:10:34,680
but it's got font text was got CSS which
is a very small font pretty hard to read
243

243

00:10:34,680  -->  00:10:39,030
is telling us that the CSS is taking
but it's got font text was got CSS which
244

244

00:10:39,030  -->  00:10:41,370
control of those properties and that
is telling us that the CSS is taking
245

245

00:10:41,370  -->  00:10:43,140
prevents us from accidentally overriding
control of those properties and that
246

246

00:10:43,140  -->  00:10:45,150
a value that's been set using CSS it's
prevents us from accidentally overriding
247

247

00:10:45,150  -->  00:10:46,350
pretty cool that it's telling us that
a value that's been set using CSS it's
248

248

00:10:46,350  -->  00:10:48,780
alright so we now know how to style
pretty cool that it's telling us that
249

249

00:10:48,780  -->  00:10:51,450
properties in scene builder using CSS but
alright so we now know how to style
250

250

00:10:51,450  -->  00:10:53,130
really it's not that convenient
properties in scene builder using CSS but
251

251

00:10:53,130  -->  00:10:55,020
so let's actually try running scene
really it's not that convenient
252

252

00:10:55,020  -->  00:10:56,500
builder as a standalone
so let's actually try running scene
253

253

00:10:56,500  -->  00:10:58,630
application and take a look at the css
builder as a standalone
254

254

00:10:58,630  -->  00:11:01,720
integration there to do so here's how to
application and take a look at the css
255

255

00:11:01,720  -->  00:11:04,360
actually start scene builder stand-alone on a
integration there to do so here's how to

00:11:04,360  -->  00:11:08,530
Windows machine so windows to start scene builder

larger size now now notice that scene builder
277

277

00:11:55,240  -->  00:11:57,280
of the screen here and then enables us
got this menu bar at the top
278

278

00:11:57,280  -->  00:11:58,870
to get access to quite a few extra
of the screen here and then enables us
279

279

00:11:58,870  -->  00:12:01,690
features so we can actually open up our
to get access to quite a few extra
280

280

00:12:01,690  -->  00:12:03,220
file that we want to work on let's go ahead
features so we can actually open up our
281

281

00:12:03,220  -->  00:12:06,160
and do that file open going to navigate
file that we want to work on let's go ahead
282

282

00:12:06,160  -->  00:12:12,760
to the folder where my project is so
and do that file open going to navigate
283

283

00:12:12,760  -->  00:12:14,350
here I am in scene builder folder
to the folder where my project is so
284

284

00:12:14,350  -->  00:12:16,090
this intelliJ project
here I am in scene builder folder
285

285

00:12:16,090  -->  00:12:19,780
now we are getting down i'm going to open the
this intelliJ project
286

286

00:12:19,780  -->  00:12:23,440
sample .fxml that's pretty well
now we are getting down i'm going to open the
287

287

00:12:23,440  -->  00:12:25,090
that mirror image of what's currently in
sample .fxml that's pretty well
288

288

00:12:25,090  -->  00:12:27,670
IntelliJ let's actually go back to
that mirror image of what's currently in
289

289

00:12:27,670  -->  00:12:31,270
IntelliJ and change the style sheet and
IntelliJ let's actually go back to
290

290

00:12:31,270  -->  00:12:32,950
change from blue to purple
IntelliJ and change the style sheet and
291

291

00:12:32,950  -->  00:12:39,640
okay if I go back to scene builder notice
change from blue to purple
292

292

00:12:39,640  -->  00:12:41,230
the change was reflected automatically
okay if I go back to scene builder notice
293

293

00:12:41,230  -->  00:12:43,570
got this file styles.css was modified
the change was reflected automatically
294

294

00:12:43,570  -->  00:12:46,120
pop-up and the change was instantly
got this file styles.css was modified
295

295

00:12:46,120  -->  00:12:49,300
reflected in the UI much better than
pop-up and the change was instantly
296

296

00:12:49,300  -->  00:12:51,340
working with CSS inside intellij
reflected in the UI much better than
297

297

00:12:51,340  -->  00:12:53,710
so if you'll be working on an
working with CSS inside intellij
298

298

00:12:53,710  -->  00:12:55,480
application that uses CSS and want to use
so if you'll be working on an
299

299

00:12:55,480  -->  00:12:56,380
scene builder
application that uses CSS and want to use
300

300

00:12:56,380  -->  00:12:57,940
this is the way to go using it
scene builder
301

301

00:12:57,940  -->  00:13:00,070
standalone you can see any changes
this is the way to go using it
302

302

00:13:00,070  -->  00:13:01,180
without having to run the application
standalone you can see any changes
303

303

00:13:01,180  -->  00:13:04,450
so let's now pretend that we want
without having to run the application
304

304

00:13:04,450  -->  00:13:08,050
to add a table to our grid pane rather
so let's now pretend that we want
305

305

00:13:08,050  -->  00:13:09,220
than scrolling through the long list of
to add a table to our grid pane rather
306

306

00:13:09,220  -->  00:13:10,190
controls over here
than scrolling through the long list of
307

307

00:13:10,190  -->  00:13:12,920
left we also got a search capability if you
controls over here
308

308

00:13:12,920  -->  00:13:15,890
type table and notice how as i'm
left we also got a search capability if you
309

309

00:13:15,890  -->  00:13:19,280
typing the library field the area
type table and notice how as i'm
310

310

00:13:19,280  -->  00:13:21,590
was updated to show just those controls
typing the library field the area
311

311

00:13:21,590  -->  00:13:24,230
that fulfill that criteria so basically the columns
was updated to show just those controls
312

312

00:13:24,230  -->  00:13:26,180
are dynamically matching are updated to
that fulfill that criteria so basically the columns
313

313

00:13:26,180  -->  00:13:28,250
match what we've been looking for and I
are dynamically matching are updated to
314

314

00:13:28,250  -->  00:13:31,310
can click on table view and actually
match what we've been looking for and I
315

315

00:13:31,310  -->  00:13:33,560
click on control if I want to quickly
can click on table view and actually
316

316

00:13:33,560  -->  00:13:37,010
find out to look for a particular
click on control if I want to quickly
317

317

00:13:37,010  -->  00:13:39,500
property i can also do that for example
find out to look for a particular
318

318

00:13:39,500  -->  00:13:42,710
type effect and get quickly to the field
property i can also do that for example
319

319

00:13:42,710  -->  00:13:44,360
that I want to work with or I could do
type effect and get quickly to the field
320

320

00:13:44,360  -->  00:13:45,980
something like the v gap if that's what i was
that I want to work with or I could do
321

321

00:13:45,980  -->  00:13:48,560
looking to do with grid pane selected
something like the v gap if that's what i was
322

322

00:13:48,560  -->  00:13:50,720
perhaps v gap and it would actually
looking to do with grid pane selected
323

323

00:13:50,720  -->  00:13:54,680
show just those properties that basically
perhaps v gap and it would actually
324

324

00:13:54,680  -->  00:13:57,110
match what I'm typing a very quick way to
show just those properties that basically
325

325

00:13:57,110  -->  00:13:58,850
actually get to the area you want to get
match what I'm typing a very quick way to
326

326

00:13:58,850  -->  00:14:02,510
when you're editing your fxml files
actually get to the area you want to get
327

327

00:14:02,510  -->  00:14:05,150
now in the standard scene builder there's
when you're editing your fxml files
328

328

00:14:05,150  -->  00:14:08,900
also a controller section over here this
now in the standard scene builder there's
329

329

00:14:08,900  -->  00:14:10,430
is where we specify the controller
also a controller section over here this
330

330

00:14:10,430  -->  00:14:12,680
that's associated with the FXML we are
is where we specify the controller
331

331

00:14:12,680  -->  00:14:14,600
editing that's already set because it
that's associated with the FXML we are
332

332

00:14:14,600  -->  00:14:16,610
was set in the fxml file that we opened
editing that's already set because it
333

333

00:14:16,610  -->  00:14:18,470
but it wasn't this is where would set it
was set in the fxml file that we opened
334

334

00:14:18,470  -->  00:14:20,420
as you can see there's also a handy
but it wasn't this is where would set it
335

335

00:14:20,420  -->  00:14:22,760
table here that actually lists all the
as you can see there's also a handy
336

336

00:14:22,760  -->  00:14:26,390
FX ids defined in the fxml file now
table here that actually lists all the
337

337

00:14:26,390  -->  00:14:27,890
the hierarchy section above the
FX ids defined in the fxml file now
338

338

00:14:27,890  -->  00:14:31,010
controller open that out is the same as
the hierarchy section above the
339

339

00:14:31,010  -->  00:14:32,240
what we were calling the scene graph
controller open that out is the same as
340

340

00:14:32,240  -->  00:14:34,040
area it's not labeled with the scene builder
what we were calling the scene graph
341

341

00:14:34,040  -->  00:14:36,770
was integrated into IntelliJ now
area it's not labeled with the scene builder
342

342

00:14:36,770  -->  00:14:38,450
we can't run an application from the
was integrated into IntelliJ now
343

343

00:14:38,450  -->  00:14:41,000
standard scene builder it is
we can't run an application from the
344

344

00:14:41,000  -->  00:14:43,550
strictly a UI builder to run our
standard scene builder it is
345

345

00:14:43,550  -->  00:14:45,770
application will open whatever ide
strictly a UI builder to run our
346

346

00:14:45,770  -->  00:14:47,030
we're working with and obviously
application will open whatever ide
347

347

00:14:47,030  -->  00:14:48,920
intelliJ for this course and run it
we're working with and obviously
348

348

00:14:48,920  -->  00:14:51,320
from there so the workflow would be to
intelliJ for this course and run it
349

349

00:14:51,320  -->  00:14:53,810
create the project for the javafx
from there so the workflow would be to
350

350

00:14:53,810  -->  00:14:56,750
application within IntelliJ and
create the project for the javafx
351

351

00:14:56,750  -->  00:14:58,970
to create the xml file within their once
application within IntelliJ and
352

352

00:14:58,970  -->  00:15:01,340
all automatically generated and then to
to create the xml file within their once
353

353

00:15:01,340  -->  00:15:02,960
open the fxml with the ID
all automatically generated and then to
354

354

00:15:02,960  -->  00:15:05,480
knows about in scene builder and if you're
open the fxml with the ID
355

355

00:15:05,480  -->  00:15:07,430
using CSS we can also edit the
knows about in scene builder and if you're
356

356

00:15:07,430  -->  00:15:09,080
css files in the ide as we've seen
using CSS we can also edit the
357

357

00:15:09,080  -->  00:15:11,570
and the stand alone scene builder
css files in the ide as we've seen
358

358

00:15:11,570  -->  00:15:13,190
will notice any changes
and the stand alone scene builder
359

359

00:15:13,190  -->  00:15:14,840
alright so that's it for our look at
will notice any changes
360

360

00:15:14,840  -->  00:15:17,270
scene builder we can use scene builder to
alright so that's it for our look at
361

361

00:15:17,270  -->  00:15:20,030
build a UI for our applications can also
scene builder we can use scene builder to
362

362

00:15:20,030  -->  00:15:22,010
be used to quickly prototype our user
build a UI for our applications can also
363

363

00:15:22,010  -->  00:15:23,330
interface
be used to quickly prototype our user
364

364

00:15:23,330  -->  00:15:25,880
and if we're writing the FXml by hand
interface
365

365

00:15:25,880  -->  00:15:27,200
and we're not sure how to change the
and if we're writing the FXml by hand
366

366

00:15:27,200  -->  00:15:29,300
property or how to position of control
and we're not sure how to change the
367

367

00:15:29,300  -->  00:15:31,620
where we want it i suggest you use scene builder
property or how to position of control
368

368

00:15:31,620  -->  00:15:33,200
for that and then look at the
where we want it i suggest you use scene builder
369

369

00:15:33,200  -->  00:15:36,440
fxml that it generates however i think it's
for that and then look at the
370

370

00:15:36,440  -->  00:15:38,090
important not to become too dependent on
fxml that it generates however i think it's
371

371

00:15:38,090  -->  00:15:40,580
the scene builder for creating user
important not to become too dependent on
372

372

00:15:40,580  -->  00:15:41,540
interfaces
the scene builder for creating user
373

373

00:15:41,540  -->  00:15:43,130
that's because these tools can go away
interfaces
374

374

00:15:43,130  -->  00:15:44,840
and it's always a good thing to know how
that's because these tools can go away
375

375

00:15:44,840  -->  00:15:46,940
to write code before we used tools that
and it's always a good thing to know how
376

376

00:15:46,940  -->  00:15:49,100
actually generates for us so we're
to write code before we used tools that
377

377

00:15:49,100  -->  00:15:50,270
basically here with a tool that's
actually generates for us so we're
378

378

00:15:50,270  -->  00:15:52,400
currently working combining the best of
basically here with a tool that's
379

379

00:15:52,400  -->  00:15:54,590
both worlds we still got the capability
currently working combining the best of
380

380

00:15:54,590  -->  00:15:57,770
of editing the fxml if we want but we
both worlds we still got the capability
381

381

00:15:57,770  -->  00:15:59,180
can use the scene builder
of editing the fxml if we want but we
382

382

00:15:59,180  -->  00:16:01,550
just short cut our create user
can use the scene builder
383

383

00:16:01,550  -->  00:16:04,040
interface creations so while the
just short cut our create user
384

384

00:16:04,040  -->  00:16:05,630
integration with intellij can be
interface creations so while the
385

385

00:16:05,630  -->  00:16:08,150
convenient if you plan to you scene builder
integration with intellij can be
386

386

00:16:08,150  -->  00:16:10,490
a lot actually say use the
convenient if you plan to you scene builder
387

387

00:16:10,490  -->  00:16:12,470
stand alone version and because it's got
a lot actually say use the
388

388

00:16:12,470  -->  00:16:14,390
more features and it's especially true
stand alone version and because it's got
389

389

00:16:14,390  -->  00:16:17,780
as you saw for using CSS also keep in mind
more features and it's especially true
390

390

00:16:17,780  -->  00:16:19,700
that there are other ides for example
as you saw for using CSS also keep in mind
391

391

00:16:19,700  -->  00:16:21,410
netbeans also integrates the scene builder
that there are other ides for example
392

392

00:16:21,410  -->  00:16:23,000
so you might want to check that
netbeans also integrates the scene builder
393

393

00:16:23,000  -->  00:16:24,290
out to see if the integrations any
so you might want to check that
394

394

00:16:24,290  -->  00:16:26,810
better and it's actually free and that
out to see if the integrations any
395

395

00:16:26,810  -->  00:16:29,450
is actually a stack overflow
better and it's actually free and that
396

396

00:16:29,450  -->  00:16:31,580
answer here that explains how to do it
is actually a stack overflow
397

397

00:16:31,580  -->  00:16:38,430
so quickly bring up on the screen so
answer here that explains how to do it
398

398

00:16:38,430  -->  00:16:39,440
you could perhaps have a look at doing
so quickly bring up on the screen so
399

399

00:16:39,440  -->  00:16:41,990
that in net beans if you wanted to show
you could perhaps have a look at doing
400

400

00:16:41,990  -->  00:16:43,340
you how to go about doing that
that in net beans if you wanted to show
401

401

00:16:43,340  -->  00:16:45,810
keep in mind working with net beans the
you how to go about doing that
402

402

00:16:45,810  -->  00:16:48,200
scene builder integration is looser so
keep in mind working with net beans the
403

403

00:16:48,200  -->  00:16:49,680
it doesn't integrate scene builder into
scene builder integration is looser so
404

404

00:16:49,680  -->  00:16:52,560
IDE user interface but runs the
it doesn't integrate scene builder into
405

405

00:16:52,560  -->  00:16:54,560
standalone version which gives us access
IDE user interface but runs the
406

406

00:16:54,560  -->  00:16:57,290
to the search field and the menu bar so
standalone version which gives us access
407

407

00:16:57,290  -->  00:16:59,330
which ide to use is a matter of personal
to the search field and the menu bar so
408

408

00:16:59,330  -->  00:17:00,320
preference
which ide to use is a matter of personal
409

409

00:17:00,320  -->  00:17:02,780
net beans has got a fantastic swing UI
preference
410

410

00:17:02,780  -->  00:17:04,940
builder and many java ui developers
net beans has got a fantastic swing UI
411

411

00:17:04,940  -->  00:17:06,980
are in the habit of using it but I think
builder and many java ui developers
412

412

00:17:06,980  -->  00:17:08,660
it's a good combination still to stick
are in the habit of using it but I think
413

413

00:17:08,660  -->  00:17:10,850
with IntelliJ and just use the standalone
it's a good combination still to stick
414

414

00:17:10,850  -->  00:17:12,930
scene builder if you're looking to build CSS
with IntelliJ and just use the standalone
415

415

00:17:12,930  -->  00:17:16,970
or use CSS within your user interface
scene builder if you're looking to build CSS
416

416

00:17:16,970  -->  00:17:18,740
alright so that's it that's the end of
or use CSS within your user interface
417

417

00:17:18,740  -->  00:17:20,900
our work through with the scene builder I
alright so that's it that's the end of
418

418

00:17:20,900  -->  00:17:22,880
hope you got a lot out of it and in the next
our work through with the scene builder I
419

419

00:17:22,880  -->  00:17:24,350
video we're going to start a challenge
hope you got a lot out of it and in the next
420

420

00:17:24,350  -->  00:17:25,950
for this section of the course see you
video we're going to start a challenge
421

421

00:17:25,950  -->  00:17:31,600
in the next video
for this section of the course see you
