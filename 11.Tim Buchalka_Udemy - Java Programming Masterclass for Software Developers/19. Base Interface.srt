1

00:00:05,430  -->  00:00:11,170
so continuing on we now want to populate
our ListView so let's go back to the
2

2

00:00:11,170  -->  00:00:16,340
fxml file we created in
the previous video so we need to go back to
3

3

00:00:16,340  -->  00:00:19,900
our list view set up on line 11 and we
need to add an ID firstly so....
4

4

00:00:19,900  -->  00:00:29,010
....so that we can access it from the Java
5

5

00:00:29,010  -->  00:00:35,220
code that so lets go back to the code controller
so what we need to do is create the
6

6

00:00:35,220  -->  00:00:40,090
ListView so that we can access the XML
that we just modified then we just added
7

7

00:00:40,090  -->  00:00:48,000
the ID to so we are going to add that variable....
8

8

00:00:48,000  -->  00:01:00,950
....
9

9

00:01:00,950  -->  00:01:07,870
...and because that's part of our fxml we are going to annotate it with....
10

10

00:01:07,870  -->  00:01:16,860
...so now we've done that we can now populate the list
view from code and we can do that down here after
11

11

00:01:16,860  -->  00:01:21,690
we've created the ArrayList and added the 5 items to it by typing...
12

12

00:01:21,690  -->  00:01:29,720
...
13

13

00:01:30,360  -->  00:01:35,870
of course is the list of items we created
in the lines above this one then the
14

14

00:01:35,870  -->  00:01:39,620
other thing we need to do is set the list
view selection mode to single selection
15

15

00:01:39,620  -->  00:01:42,540
and if you think about it doesn't make much
sense to have more than one item
16

16

00:01:42,540  -->  00:01:46,560
selected because we are only showing the
details for a single one on the screen
17

17

00:01:46,560  -->  00:01:52,040
in the right hand side to the right of
the list view and the list view can be set to multi-select
18

18

00:01:52,040  -->  00:01:55,420
and that would mean that the user could
select more than one item at a time but
19

19

00:01:55,420  -->  00:01:59,810
it wouldn't make sense in the application so we are
going to set that to single and we do that by
20

20

00:01:59,810  -->  00:02:08,610
typing...
21

21

00:02:08,610  -->  00:02:15,130
...and you can see we got
22

22

00:02:15,130  -->  00:02:20,170
multiple and single singles is the one we
want I'm going to select that one so that ensure that
23

23

00:02:20,170  -->  00:02:25,130
we can only select one item at a time so
lets just run that and see what happens
24

24

00:02:26,610  -->  00:02:33,500
..and you can see we got some items appearing on the left hand
side in our ListView but its displaying the
25

25

00:02:33,500  -->  00:02:38,170
object reference for each of the
to do items which isn't what we
26

26

00:02:38,170  -->  00:02:42,730
want obviously we really want to display each item
short description in this window on the
27

27

00:02:42,730  -->  00:02:48,310
right hand side the extended description
as well by default the list view will display the result
28

28

00:02:48,310  -->  00:02:52,650
of each items to toString method so what we
really need to do to see that data in
29

29

00:02:52,650  -->  00:02:57,020
the list view is override the to do string method int the to-do item class so that it
30

30

00:02:57,020  -->  00:03:02,200
returns in this case the short
description so lets just go ahead and do that so
31

31

00:03:02,200  -->  00:03:09,350
get back to our to-do item and we are just going to
override toString
32

32

00:03:12,290  -->  00:03:16,080
and we only want to include in this case the short
description because that's what we want
33

33

00:03:16,080  -->  00:03:21,540
to see in the left hand side so I'm
selecting just that and I'll changed all of this so
34

34

00:03:21,540  -->  00:03:27,670
it hasn't got any headings so it's just
going to return just short description which
35

35

00:03:27,670  -->  00:03:33,670
makes sense here because its going straight to the ListView ok so
now lets run that again and we should
36

36

00:03:33,670  -->  00:03:38,700
see the short description now appearing
we can now see our descriptions and
37

37

00:03:38,700  -->  00:03:42,980
holding down shift and I can't select multiple ones I can only select a single one so that is
38

38

00:03:42,980  -->  00:03:47,860
also working as well as which is good so lets go
back to looking at the border pane
39

39

00:03:47,860  -->  00:03:51,500
center position now when the user
clicks on item on the list as you can
40

40

00:03:51,500  -->  00:03:56,760
see here what we want to do is to display the selected items details and deadlines on
41

41

00:03:56,760  -->  00:04:00,950
the right hand side of the window here
so to do that we're going to use a text
42

42

00:04:00,950  -->  00:04:05,790
area control to display the to-do item
details now first one will add the control
43

43

00:04:05,790  -->  00:04:09,660
to the border pane center position by
adding a text area element in their so
44

44

00:04:09,660  -->  00:04:12,660
lets go and do that
45

45

00:04:15,980  -->  00:04:22,440
so under the left we are gonna add...
46

46

00:04:22,440  -->  00:04:33,630
....
47

47

00:04:33,630  -->  00:04:42,880
....and if run that you don't see much
48

48

00:04:42,880  -->  00:04:45,910
difference here on a Mac but if your
running on Windows you should see that
49

49

00:04:45,910  -->  00:04:49,730
was white where it wasn't before and the reason
for that is that it now contains an
50

50

00:04:49,730  -->  00:04:54,400
empty text control area so lets populated
the areas so we can just see for sure that it
51

51

00:04:54,400  -->  00:05:00,780
is doing something and in
terms of this we added to the center
52

52

00:05:00,780  -->  00:05:04,480
position rather than to the right
position because we want the details area
53

53

00:05:04,480  -->  00:05:08,730
to use all the remaining available space
in the window and if you recall from the
54

54

00:05:08,730  -->  00:05:13,850
layouts videos the center position of
the border pane is given all the
55

55

00:05:13,850  -->  00:05:19,050
leftover space again sometimes that text area import you saw that their were some difficulties
56

56

00:05:19,050  -->  00:05:23,100
for that automatically finding and import if you
are finding the text area import is not coming
57

57

00:05:23,100  -->  00:05:28,560
up you may have to type this line manually yourself so in terms of functionality
58

58

00:05:28,560  -->  00:05:33,380
when the user selects an item to do item in
the list we want to show its details in
59

59

00:05:33,380  -->  00:05:37,500
that text area that we just added to our interface so we went ahead with the mouse click
60

60

00:05:37,500  -->  00:05:41,370
event so we gonna do is add our handle
click list view event handler to the
61

61

00:05:41,370  -->  00:05:44,800
controller then we could have more than
one control in a window that wants to
62

62

00:05:44,800  -->  00:05:48,130
handle mouse clicks so we are going include
something in the method name that
63

63

00:05:48,130  -->  00:05:58,540
identifies which control this event
handlers is for so lets go to the controller so
64

64

00:05:58,540  -->  00:06:02,470
what I"m going to do is I'm going to call it....
65

65

00:06:03,650  -->  00:06:09,650
...which makes it clear that
we are working on the list view....
66

66

00:06:09,650  -->  00:06:18,500
....so how do we get
67

67

00:06:18,500  -->  00:06:24,000
the selected item well JavaFX control
displays many items are backed
68

68

00:06:24,000  -->  00:06:29,870
by a selection model and that's a class that
tracks which item is selected in the controller
69

69

00:06:29,870  -->  00:06:34,370
you can see on line 40 I used get
selection model when we dictated that the
70

70

00:06:34,370  -->  00:06:39,060
list view will only be able to be
clicked and its single item at a time so this
71

71

00:06:39,060  -->  00:06:43,180
is a classic tracks which are item is selected
in the control this is the selection
72

72

00:06:43,180  -->  00:06:47,130
model that I am talking about so we have to
get the selected item for the selection
73

73

00:06:47,130  -->  00:06:51,150
model so to do that we call get
selection mode which we started using
74

74

00:06:51,150  -->  00:06:57,750
on line 40 but then we call get
selected item to retrieve the current item or
75

75

00:06:57,750  -->  00:07:01,130
the selected item from the model so we will start up by just
doing just that so...
76

76

00:07:02,250  -->  00:07:13,940
...
77

77

00:07:13,940  -->  00:07:20,600
...and notice how their is an items at items so if we had multiple
78

78

00:07:20,600  -->  00:07:25,520
selections enabled you could use that to
get all the items that were selected but in
79

79

00:07:25,520  -->  00:07:31,080
our case because we've selected to use a
single selection mode only we just need
80

80

00:07:31,080  -->  00:07:36,280
to get to get selected item and that is going to return
in our case the to-do item object that
81

81

00:07:36,280  -->  00:07:42,080
is at that position in the list view and
just to confirm its working lets start
82

82

00:07:42,080  -->  00:07:48,470
by just writing out to the console so we will put....
83

83

00:07:48,470  -->  00:07:56,900
...lets run that to make sure that it is
selecting the right item so click on it now
84

84

00:07:56,900  -->  00:08:01,370
we should see that in the console and of
course we're not seeing that in the
85

85

00:08:01,370  -->  00:08:08,660
console reason is I haven't widen up the event handler what I done is I've created the event handler set up
86

86

00:08:08,660  -->  00:08:13,160
to code on line 44 but what I haven't done is
gone back to the FXML
87

87

00:08:15,240  -->  00:08:19,340
and told the list view to used the
handler of the on mouse lick that I created so lets go and do that
88

88

00:08:19,340  -->  00:08:23,770
so in the list view put...
89

89

00:08:28,250  -->  00:08:33,710
....now
90

90

00:08:33,710  -->  00:08:36,710
when I run that we should find that it
works
91

91

00:08:38,150  -->  00:08:41,420
click on an item you can see down the bottom
left the selected item is my birthday
92

92

00:08:41,420  -->  00:08:46,290
card pick up doug selected item is
finished
93

93

00:08:47,670  -->  00:08:53,940
doctors that is all working as you can see so
that's good so now that we have done that we want to
94

94

00:08:53,940  -->  00:08:58,570
change the mouse click handling so that
instead of writing to the console we are gonna
95

95

00:08:58,570  -->  00:09:04,970
add the details and the deadline to the text
area and in the handle click live view method which I'll
96

96

00:09:04,970  -->  00:09:13,900
just open up on the screen you can see we are outputting it currently at the moment now I'm just gonna disable that comment
97

97

00:09:13,900  -->  00:09:18,920
that out so we need access to the text area
on the screen to do that so before we
98

98

00:09:18,920  -->  00:09:22,610
start writing from code in here will
come up and assign that variable
99

99

00:09:22,610  -->  00:09:35,570
its gonna be....and we need to go back to our FXML and assign
100

100

00:09:35,570  -->  00:09:40,920
that ID so I'm just going to take a copy
that to make sure that the I've defined the right name
101

101

00:09:40,920  -->  00:09:47,100
looking at a text area we need to
add the ID for that so...
102

102

00:09:47,100  -->  00:09:55,240
...and I've got an error and that's
because it should either be public or
103

103

00:09:55,240  -->  00:09:59,070
annotated with an ampersand FXML and of course I didn't do that so I'm going back
104

104

00:09:59,070  -->  00:10:07,290
there now and add the annotation keep it
happy....and that should be happy when we go back
105

105

00:10:07,850  -->  00:10:13,840
the errors disappeared so that's good so go back to the
controller code now we are back to handle click
106

106

00:10:13,840  -->  00:10:18,320
list view so what we need to do after we got the selected item which we got on
107

107

00:10:18,320  -->  00:10:26,240
line 49 looking at this notice I had to
cast this here so if I delete the cast here on line 49 we get an
108

108

00:10:26,240  -->  00:10:26,840
error
109

109

00:10:26,840  -->  00:10:31,520
and the error that is looking for a java.lang.object
110

110

00:10:31,520  -->  00:10:37,140
but we wanted to be a to-do item so the
reason that's coming up is because
111

111

00:10:37,140  -->  00:10:41,450
we didn't specify a type when we declared our
list view so what we need to do or should do
112

112

00:10:41,450  -->  00:10:44,150
is go back to a ListView and mention which
113

113

00:10:44,150  -->  00:10:53,280
type that we are using and we just used that.... and that
then happily fixes that error on line 49 because
114

114

00:10:53,280  -->  00:10:57,740
of course that's what we're using the
to-do item so now we've done that we can come back here
115

115

00:10:57,740  -->  00:11:07,700
and just type in....we should be able to
116

116

00:11:07,700  -->  00:11:15,870
just do.....
117

117

00:11:15,870  -->  00:11:21,870
...so now if we run that we hopefully find that we
see the description as well as the short
118

118

00:11:21,870  -->  00:11:28,420
sort of details so click on that you can see we are now getting the extended description on the to-do list so
119

119

00:11:28,420  -->  00:11:33,210
that's great that's working nicely but
we've still got some work to do we are only half
120

120

00:11:33,210  -->  00:11:38,600
way their really because what we want to do we want to display the details as well as the deadline so what we'll do
121

121

00:11:38,600  -->  00:11:42,830
is we'll add the details to a StringBuilder
append 4 new lines to give some
122

122

00:11:42,830  -->  00:11:46,870
space between it and the deadline and then
append the string due to show sort of
123

123

00:11:46,870  -->  00:11:57,820
date due and of course the deadline so lets do that
now so.....
124

124

00:11:57,820  -->  00:12:07,420
....change it to just use the item
125

125

00:12:07,420  -->  00:12:12,390
get details so that is our first part of the string builder....
126

126

00:12:12,910  -->  00:12:29,210
....
127

127

00:12:31,450  -->  00:12:42,400
....
128

128

00:12:42,400  -->  00:12:46,590
...
129

129

00:12:47,520  -->  00:12:58,840
...so let's have a look at that and see if that
works and you can see its working quite nicely so we got the
130

130

00:12:58,840  -->  00:13:04,520
description the detailed description got
some new lines the word due and the
131

131

00:13:04,520  -->  00:13:08,100
date that was specified you can see that
all working and changing as appropriate
132

132

00:13:08,100  -->  00:13:12,980
that's great I'm going to end the
video here in the next video we're going to
133

133

00:13:12,980  -->  00:13:17,080
continue on and what we're going to do is
sort of a look at enhancing this
134

134

00:13:17,080  -->  00:13:22,300
output a little bit we are going to make the text
bold for the due label etc and to do that we
135

135

00:13:22,300  -->  00:13:26,780
need to start adding a v box and sort of
positioning things correctly so lets do
136

136

00:13:26,780  -->  00:13:27,630
that in the next video
