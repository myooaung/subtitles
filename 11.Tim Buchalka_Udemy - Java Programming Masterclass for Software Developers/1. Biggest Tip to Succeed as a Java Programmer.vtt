00:00:04.630  -->  00:00:06.920
<v ->One of the biggest tips that I can give you</v>
2

2

00:00:06.920  -->  00:00:08.880
is to be persistent.
3

3

00:00:08.880  -->  00:00:11.200
You're finding your journey to becoming a programmer.
4

4

00:00:11.200  -->  00:00:13.300
That's how you get frustrated at times.
5

5

00:00:13.300  -->  00:00:15.120
You'll even wanna give up at times,
6

6

00:00:15.120  -->  00:00:18.244
but the people who succeed as a programmer work through that
7

7

00:00:18.244  -->  00:00:20.500
and come out the other side as programmers,
8

8

00:00:20.500  -->  00:00:21.950
so I think it's really important,
9

9

00:00:21.950  -->  00:00:22.910
and that's why I'm telling you
10

10

00:00:22.910  -->  00:00:25.280
right here at this early stage of the course
11

11

00:00:25.280  -->  00:00:27.040
that you are going to be frustrated
12

12

00:00:27.040  -->  00:00:28.730
at times with programming.
13

13

00:00:28.730  -->  00:00:30.020
That's just the nature,
14

14

00:00:30.020  -->  00:00:32.220
and it's really something that's applicable
15

15

00:00:32.220  -->  00:00:34.420
anytime you're learning a new skill.
16

16

00:00:34.420  -->  00:00:35.520
You get frustrated
17

17

00:00:35.520  -->  00:00:37.460
because things aren't coming to you naturally,
18

18

00:00:37.460  -->  00:00:40.910
but over time, you get better and better at programming,
19

19

00:00:40.910  -->  00:00:43.000
and things will make a lot more sense.
20

20

00:00:43.000  -->  00:00:45.170
So, I've actually got a link in the next video,
21

21

00:00:45.170  -->  00:00:47.250
it's a text link, a text lecture rather,
22

22

00:00:47.250  -->  00:00:48.650
and you can click on that and go to YouTube
23

23

00:00:48.650  -->  00:00:50.500
and watch a video on persistence.
24

24

00:00:50.500  -->  00:00:51.510
Really important there,
25

25

00:00:51.510  -->  00:00:53.330
but there's also another important video,
26

26

00:00:53.330  -->  00:00:54.869
also in that same lecture,
27

27

00:00:54.869  -->  00:00:58.280
on the four stages of becoming a programmer.
28

28

00:00:58.280  -->  00:01:01.521
I think it's mandatory viewing to watch both those videos
29

29

00:01:01.521  -->  00:01:04.460
before we get into the programming side of the course
30

30

00:01:04.460  -->  00:01:06.250
because that'll put you in the right mindset,
31

31

00:01:06.250  -->  00:01:08.450
and you'll go in with the right expectations.
32

32

00:01:08.450  -->  00:01:09.283
Now, I've got no doubt
33

33

00:01:09.283  -->  00:01:11.410
that you can succeed as a programmer,
34

34

00:01:11.410  -->  00:01:13.330
but going in with that mindset is one way
35

35

00:01:13.330  -->  00:01:15.630
to really make sure that it's going to happen.
