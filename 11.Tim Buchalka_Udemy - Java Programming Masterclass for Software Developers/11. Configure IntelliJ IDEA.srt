00:00:05,230  -->  00:00:07,350
<v Tim>So in this video, now that we've actually installed</v>
2

2

00:00:07,350  -->  00:00:10,150
IntelliJ IDEA and the Java Development Kit,
3

3

00:00:10,150  -->  00:00:12,570
we need to associate the Java Development Kit
4

4

00:00:12,570  -->  00:00:15,260
with IntelliJ IDEA so that we can use it,
5

5

00:00:15,260  -->  00:00:17,380
and we also need to change a few settings
6

6

00:00:17,380  -->  00:00:19,630
within IntelliJ IDEA as well.
7

7

00:00:19,630  -->  00:00:21,480
Now just to note that this video is applicable
8

8

00:00:21,480  -->  00:00:24,930
for the Windows, Mac and Linux installations,
9

9

00:00:24,930  -->  00:00:27,260
so irrespective, we'll be going through
10

10

00:00:27,260  -->  00:00:29,180
what you need to do in this video.
11

11

00:00:29,180  -->  00:00:31,850
So first, I'm gonna come over to Configure.
12

12

00:00:31,850  -->  00:00:34,280
I'm gonna click on Structure For New Projects.
13

13

00:00:34,280  -->  00:00:36,200
We're gonna associate the JDK.
14

14

00:00:36,200  -->  00:00:37,690
Now you can see on the screen there
15

15

00:00:37,690  -->  00:00:39,470
that Project's not selected.
16

16

00:00:39,470  -->  00:00:40,680
So come up to Project,
17

17

00:00:40,680  -->  00:00:43,600
and we come over here and click on the dropdown there.
18

18

00:00:43,600  -->  00:00:44,790
Now, you may or may not have
19

19

00:00:44,790  -->  00:00:47,100
a Java installation showing there.
20

20

00:00:47,100  -->  00:00:49,200
For me, you saw that it said No SDK,
21

21

00:00:49,200  -->  00:00:51,410
and that I've got Python option there
22

22

00:00:51,410  -->  00:00:53,100
and that's to do with my Python course,
23

23

00:00:53,100  -->  00:00:54,840
so nothing there for Java.
24

24

00:00:54,840  -->  00:00:56,900
So if you don't see a Java option,
25

25

00:00:56,900  -->  00:00:57,800
just click on New,
26

26

00:00:58,640  -->  00:01:00,173
select JDK.
27

27

00:01:01,420  -->  00:01:02,310
Now what we need to do
28

28

00:01:02,310  -->  00:01:04,550
is if it doesn't automatically show
29

29

00:01:04,550  -->  00:01:07,710
the option for Amazon Corretto, which is not here,
30

30

00:01:07,710  -->  00:01:09,440
we just need to expand the folder.
31

31

00:01:09,440  -->  00:01:10,380
I'm on a Windows machine.
32

32

00:01:10,380  -->  00:01:14,030
I'm gonna go to Programme Files, Amazon Corretto,
33

33

00:01:14,030  -->  00:01:15,450
and select the JDK.
34

34

00:01:15,450  -->  00:01:18,932
You can see it's 11.0.4_10,
35

35

00:01:18,932  -->  00:01:19,765
but you may have a different number.
36

36

00:01:19,765  -->  00:01:23,100
Yours might be 11.0.5 or even something else.
37

37

00:01:23,100  -->  00:01:24,060
That's fine.
38

38

00:01:24,060  -->  00:01:27,180
Just click on that and click OK.
39

39

00:01:27,180  -->  00:01:28,940
Noting what's happening on the screen there.
40

40

00:01:28,940  -->  00:01:30,530
Now if you're running on a Mac,
41

41

00:01:30,530  -->  00:01:34,510
you saw in the JDK installation video where the path was,
42

42

00:01:34,510  -->  00:01:36,910
so just select that path to get that working,
43

43

00:01:36,910  -->  00:01:38,340
noting that you might need to go down
44

44

00:01:38,340  -->  00:01:40,070
to a sub-folder called Home.
45

45

00:01:40,070  -->  00:01:41,810
And on the Linux installation video,
46

46

00:01:41,810  -->  00:01:44,630
I showed you also where it was installed for Linux platform,
47

47

00:01:44,630  -->  00:01:47,020
so you may need to navigate to that folder,
48

48

00:01:47,020  -->  00:01:48,870
if you don't automatically see it coming up here.
49

49

00:01:48,870  -->  00:01:50,620
But you can see now that we've done that.
50

50

00:01:50,620  -->  00:01:51,630
It's showing.
51

51

00:01:51,630  -->  00:01:53,010
Now, what it can be a good idea to do
52

52

00:01:53,010  -->  00:01:54,620
is come back to click on Edit,
53

53

00:01:54,620  -->  00:01:57,070
and instead of letting on it as 11,
54

54

00:01:57,070  -->  00:01:58,830
you can change that perhaps and put something
55

55

00:01:58,830  -->  00:02:02,160
like Corretto-11,
56

56

00:02:02,160  -->  00:02:04,000
to remind yourself that this
57

57

00:02:04,000  -->  00:02:05,760
is the Amazon Corretto version.
58

58

00:02:05,760  -->  00:02:07,260
This is particularly relevant
59

59

00:02:07,260  -->  00:02:09,260
if you're using multiple JDK's.
60

60

00:02:09,260  -->  00:02:11,180
But again you can see the JDK Home Path
61

61

00:02:11,180  -->  00:02:13,550
should point to the Amazon Corretto Installation.
62

62

00:02:13,550  -->  00:02:14,420
So we've set that up now,
63

63

00:02:14,420  -->  00:02:16,360
we've got our JDK configured.
64

64

00:02:16,360  -->  00:02:17,460
That's good.
65

65

00:02:17,460  -->  00:02:19,900
Next thing we need to do, is just make some changes.
66

66

00:02:19,900  -->  00:02:22,290
So come back to Configure again,
67

67

00:02:22,290  -->  00:02:23,790
select Settings, on a Mac
68

68

00:02:23,790  -->  00:02:25,480
that will probably show as Preferences.
69

69

00:02:25,480  -->  00:02:26,313
Click on that.
70

70

00:02:27,210  -->  00:02:30,280
Come down here and click on to the left of Editor.
71

71

00:02:30,280  -->  00:02:31,630
And to the left of General.
72

72

00:02:32,540  -->  00:02:34,400
Click on Auto Import.
73

73

00:02:34,400  -->  00:02:35,880
You wanna check both those boxes,
74

74

00:02:35,880  -->  00:02:38,250
Add unambiguous imports on the fly,
75

75

00:02:38,250  -->  00:02:41,220
and Optimise imports on the fly (for current project).
76

76

00:02:41,220  -->  00:02:43,940
We'll talk more about what that does in a later video.
77

77

00:02:43,940  -->  00:02:46,170
Next come on down to Appearance,
78

78

00:02:46,170  -->  00:02:48,180
make sure that Show line numbers is checked,
79

79

00:02:48,180  -->  00:02:50,070
which you can see it is in my case.
80

80

00:02:50,070  -->  00:02:51,983
And lastly, come down to Code Folding.
81

81

00:02:53,020  -->  00:02:55,060
We want to deselect a few options here,
82

82

00:02:55,060  -->  00:02:57,540
so we're uncheck Imports,
83

83

00:02:57,540  -->  00:02:59,440
uncheck One line methods,
84

84

00:02:59,440  -->  00:03:00,721
uncheck "Closures"
85

85

00:03:00,721  -->  00:03:03,520
(anonymous classes implementing one method, before Java 8)
86

86

00:03:03,520  -->  00:03:04,353
and finally,
87

87

00:03:04,353  -->  00:03:07,223
uncheck Generic constructor and method parameters.
88

88

00:03:08,240  -->  00:03:09,193
Now click on OK.
89

89

00:03:10,070  -->  00:03:10,903
And we're actually done.
90

90

00:03:10,903  -->  00:03:12,320
So what we've done is we've just configured
91

91

00:03:12,320  -->  00:03:14,480
IntelliJ for a couple of options
92

92

00:03:14,480  -->  00:03:16,530
that make things easier to use.
93

93

00:03:16,530  -->  00:03:18,440
For now though, that's all the configuration.
94

94

00:03:18,440  -->  00:03:20,940
We've now associated the Java Development Kit,
95

95

00:03:20,940  -->  00:03:22,230
Amazon Corretto in this case,
96

96

00:03:22,230  -->  00:03:26,000
with IntelliJ IDEA and we can now move on to the next stage.
97

97

00:03:26,000  -->  00:03:29,510
Which is starting to work with creating a Java Programme.
98

98

00:03:29,510  -->  00:03:31,260
So, I'll see you in the next video.
