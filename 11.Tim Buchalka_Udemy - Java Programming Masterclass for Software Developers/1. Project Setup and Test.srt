00:00:05,600  -->  00:00:11,200
So the main idea of this section is to show you some useful information that will help you migrating
2

2

00:00:11,200  -->  00:00:17,270
projects to java 9 or some of your earlier versions projects created in early versions of the JDK
3

3

00:00:17,270  -->  00:00:22,300
and along the way we should say some common errors that you might come across while migrating projects.
4

4

00:00:22,300  -->  00:00:26,720
And also if you're actually creating new projects with Java 9.
5

5

00:00:26,720  -->  00:00:33,280
So what we need to do is have a project file and download zip file from a project the music
6

6

00:00:33,280  -->  00:00:39,100
project that we used earlier in this course and you can grab that from the resources section of this video.
7

7

00:00:39,100  -->  00:00:45,720
What's the first thing I'm going to go to the folder where I've got my downloaded music file. Alright, so
8

8

00:00:45,720  -->  00:00:47,880
we can see here we've got this music start.
9

9

00:00:47,880  -->  00:00:51,840
And basically what I've done is I've just unzipped the file,
10

10

00:00:51,840  -->  00:00:56,690
so you just unzip it, go into the folder structure you want to make sure you can see zip
11

11

00:00:56,690  -->  00:00:59,660
And as I say that tells me that it's in the right area.
12

12

00:00:59,660  -->  00:01:04,380
Alright, so let's now go to different import, IntelliJ
13

13

00:01:04,380  -->  00:01:08,610
Whenever never get to that folder and is kind of you can see I had to folder where the zip file was
14

14

00:01:08,610  -->  00:01:10,490
and I unzipped it into that folder.
15

15

00:01:10,490  -->  00:01:16,710
So I'm going into that folder that has actually got the libs and SSA folders so you can see those
16

16

00:01:16,710  -->  00:01:21,230
you've selected the right folder and open we get this option on the screen.
17

17

00:01:21,230  -->  00:01:24,870
You want to click on Create project from existing sources.
18

18

00:01:24,870  -->  00:01:28,060
The next project name you can leave that all as default.
19

19

00:01:28,060  -->  00:01:30,330
The project name and location and format.
20

20

00:01:30,330  -->  00:01:37,000
Next, the source files it'll give you the location to the path with basically the files from src folder.
21

21

00:01:37,000  -->  00:01:38,880
We'll leave that is that folder site.
22

22

00:01:38,880  -->  00:01:44,970
Next you can say that it's found the sequel like jdbc driver that we used in that earlier section.
23

23

00:01:44,970  -->  00:01:49,100
This course leads us to default because we want to keep that next.
24

24

00:01:49,100  -->  00:01:51,990
The suggested module structure for the project.
25

25

00:01:51,990  -->  00:01:57,430
Nothing to change there, click on next. Now on the next screen, before you see no framework's detected.
26

26

00:01:57,430  -->  00:02:02,400
You may or may not see an option on the screen to select the JDK.
27

27

00:02:02,400  -->  00:02:05,520
You can see in my case I didn't get that option.
28

28

00:02:05,520  -->  00:02:10,500
But if you have, select one point if you've got it installed on your system or JDK not if you haven't
29

29

00:02:10,500  -->  00:02:15,140
and you've got JDK 9 then you can then just select that.
30

30

00:02:15,140  -->  00:02:21,490
So Mike I didn't get asked that question so I can just click on finish and we've got a project that's
31

31

00:02:21,490  -->  00:02:26,300
being created for us. Now before we run the project,
32

32

00:02:26,300  -->  00:02:27,950
two things we need to do:
33

33

00:02:27,950  -->  00:02:29,510
we're going to expand this,
34

34

00:02:29,510  -->  00:02:35,820
we're going to do is right click on the project and I'm going to down and select open module settings,
35

35

00:02:35,820  -->  00:02:39,480
I'm going to check which is the sdk by clicking down here.
36

36

00:02:39,480  -->  00:02:42,330
You can see I've got JDK 8 and 9.0
37

37

00:02:42,330  -->  00:02:44,370
Ok, I've got JDK 8
38

38

00:02:44,370  -->  00:02:50,390
You could see by here the name it's pretty clear is that which is which, in JDK 9 in my system.
39

39

00:02:50,390  -->  00:02:54,240
So I'm going to leave JDK, in other words 1.8 here.
40

40

00:02:54,240  -->  00:02:56,560
We're going to try running it with that first.
41

41

00:02:56,560  -->  00:02:59,890
So I don't need to actually make any changes because at one point it was selected.
42

42

00:02:59,890  -->  00:03:05,950
What I'm going to do is come back here to project and make sure that this is set correctly.
43

43

00:03:05,950  -->  00:03:10,390
So if you haven't got to allocate you want to select triadic I know in my case I would actually run
44

44

00:03:10,390  -->  00:03:15,410
this with JDK 8 first and select to make sure that that version is selected.
45

45

00:03:15,410  -->  00:03:20,320
So the reason we're doing that is to make sure we treat the right the right high level because if we
46

46

00:03:20,320  -->  00:03:25,540
choose an earlier version and if we're using features that were introduced in a later version of the
47

47

00:03:25,540  -->  00:03:29,800
Java compiler will actually come up with an error for those particular Come on.
48

48

00:03:29,800  -->  00:03:32,420
Leave it on JDK 8 in this case.
49

49

00:03:32,420  -->  00:03:33,610
So I'm going to run than try.
50

50

00:03:33,610  -->  00:03:36,720
First I'm going to click on OK.
51

51

00:03:36,720  -->  00:03:41,690
I'm going to get back in there for a reason just to show you that there is a program click on for much
52

52

00:03:41,690  -->  00:03:47,150
of settings again and you can see here we've got some problems going to click on that.
53

53

00:03:47,150  -->  00:03:49,590
And you could say that we've got a few different errors here.
54

54

00:03:49,590  -->  00:03:53,900
But they sqlite errors that we can't ignore that is because we're not using sqlite in this course
55

55

00:03:53,900  -->  00:03:55,190
or this project.
56

56

00:03:55,190  -->  00:04:01,640
But what we do want to look at here is the library sqlite jdbc is not used.
57

57

00:04:01,640  -->  00:04:09,160
So we actually can fix it and he might want to do is click on add to dependencies.
58

58

00:04:09,160  -->  00:04:11,510
And what we could have done instead has another way of fixing it.
59

59

00:04:11,510  -->  00:04:18,560
I have two modules, we could from there add the java file manually.
60

60

00:04:18,560  -->  00:04:24,620
I think this is probably an easy way of doing that, so we can fix it again at the dependencies.
61

61

00:04:24,620  -->  00:04:28,180
And you could say that it's telling us where it much going to be added to.
62

62

00:04:28,180  -->  00:04:32,210
It's going to click on ok and you can see the error has now disappeared.
63

63

00:04:32,210  -->  00:04:33,850
The problem's been resolved.
64

64

00:04:33,850  -->  00:04:38,160
Once you've got these two on a sqlite that errors as I mentioned we're not using that in this course
65

65

00:04:38,160  -->  00:04:44,930
and you probably won't see that come up on your computer so this probably can just click on ok.
66

66

00:04:44,930  -->  00:04:48,970
That's another time that I'm going to put up the source card let's just give this a bit of a run.
67

67

00:04:48,970  -->  00:04:57,890
So I just select mine right click and select Run mind of mine and he
68

68

00:04:57,890  -->  00:05:04,310
and can say that we've got an application here took a while to live but now we've got our music database
69

69

00:05:04,310  -->  00:05:10,670
and you've seen this and in any section and the course
70

70

00:05:10,670  -->  00:05:11,580
you can see the various artist.
71

71

00:05:11,580  -->  00:05:13,530
So that's working nicely.
72

72

00:05:13,530  -->  00:05:15,270
So that's running in the JDK 8.
73

73

00:05:15,270  -->  00:05:18,690
And no problems no surprises that it worked fine.
74

74

00:05:18,690  -->  00:05:21,550
Let's close it down.
75

75

00:05:21,550  -->  00:05:22,990
And closing them on.
76

76

00:05:22,990  -->  00:05:29,020
And this time let's now go back and get this running on JDK 9, go there and I can click
77

77

00:05:29,020  -->  00:05:33,220
on file and click on file and select structure if I want to, project structure.
78

78

00:05:33,220  -->  00:05:36,470
That's probably that's one way of doing it with a right click like I did before but I'm going to click
79

79

00:05:36,470  -->  00:05:43,540
file project structure, so that project is not already selected which it wasn't for me.
80

80

00:05:43,540  -->  00:05:47,550
And obviously here now we need to specify JDK 9.
81

81

00:05:47,550  -->  00:05:56,440
Come down here and choose JDK 9 here and most I can choose under Project language level 9, modules
82

82

00:05:56,440  -->  00:05:59,050
private methods and interfaces devices etc..
83

83

00:05:59,050  -->  00:06:04,990
So basically we're telling intelligence to use JDK 9 and we're also changing the language level
84

84

00:06:04,990  -->  00:06:10,460
to as well so that we can actually run it, click on ok.
85

85

00:06:10,460  -->  00:06:15,560
You can say that some compilation going on now or actually getting it compiled under a JDK and on there
86

86

00:06:15,560  -->  00:06:20,330
the first time you run the JDK 9, it may take some time to stop but once it's run
87

87

00:06:20,330  -->  00:06:25,350
once you find that it'll be significantly faster.
88

88

00:06:25,350  -->  00:06:26,550
So I don't know if that's compiled.
89

89

00:06:26,550  -->  00:06:35,180
We can just go ahead right click it and select run again or select main.main
90

90

00:06:35,180  -->  00:06:40,270
You see that it's loading, everything working nicely there, show albums for the
91

91

00:06:40,270  -->  00:06:43,030
artist and that's when it can also list down.
92

92

00:06:43,030  -->  00:06:48,310
The other thing tonight was was going to close that down and he can say clearly that we're running JDK 9
93

93

00:06:48,310  -->  00:06:53,410
over here and earlier in the video you saw that there's actually error, was a whole lot of error
94

94

00:06:53,410  -->  00:06:58,870
which is a documented file java 1.8 and some computers and that was also showing it
95

95

00:06:58,870  -->  00:07:03,560
was actually not causing the program to stop working or anything like that.
96

96

00:07:03,560  -->  00:07:06,430
But the point here is you can say that clearly we're running this in JDK 9.
97

97

00:07:06,430  -->  00:07:14,510
As you can see, a project written in the JDK 8 version works without any problems when using JDK 9.
98

98

00:07:14,510  -->  00:07:17,410
So that's only the start  though, in the next video
99

99

00:07:17,410  -->  00:07:23,320
let's start discussing how to split the project into multiple modules, so see you in the next video.
