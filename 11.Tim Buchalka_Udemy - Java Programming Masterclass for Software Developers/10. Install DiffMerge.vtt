00:00:04.690  -->  00:00:06.790
Alright, so let's see how to go ahead
2

2

00:00:06.790  -->  00:00:10.420
and install the dis merge tool. So here I
3

3

00:00:10.420  -->  00:00:12.330
am in a browser and I'm going to go to
4

4

00:00:12.330  -->  00:00:21.269
the website sourcegear.com slash diffmerge
5

5

00:00:21.269  -->  00:00:23.500
there's a link to this to the resources
6

6

00:00:23.500  -->  00:00:26.320
section of this video. We need to then go
7

7

00:00:26.320  -->  00:00:30.970
to downloads selective merge you'll
8

8

00:00:30.970  -->  00:00:32.290
notice that there's various versions
9

9

00:00:32.290  -->  00:00:33.730
here and I'm not going to create a
10

10

00:00:33.730  -->  00:00:36.250
separate video for each version because
11

11

00:00:36.250  -->  00:00:38.110
it's a very similar and straightforward
12

12

00:00:38.110  -->  00:00:39.969
process what I will do is I'm going to
13

13

00:00:39.969  -->  00:00:42.640
install the Mac version with this in
14

14

00:00:42.640  -->  00:00:44.590
this video but depending on your
15

15

00:00:44.590  -->  00:00:46.600
operating systems select the irrelevant
16

16

00:00:46.600  -->  00:00:48.910
version 64-bit version of Windows you'd
17

17

00:00:48.910  -->  00:00:50.829
select this first option the 32-bit
18

18

00:00:50.829  -->  00:00:52.960
version who knows that option that's the
19

19

00:00:52.960  -->  00:00:54.969
installer what you want instead to where
20

20

00:00:54.969  -->  00:00:57.489
download the zip file and same for a bun
21

21

00:00:57.489  -->  00:00:59.320
to Linux or Fedora you can choose the
22

22

00:00:59.320  -->  00:01:01.149
relevant version there but I'm going to
23

23

00:01:01.149  -->  00:01:04.539
choose the dmg file OSX I click on
24

24

00:01:04.539  -->  00:01:06.700
download now, if you do get this option
25

25

00:01:06.700  -->  00:01:08.979
here to take off the check box there so
26

26

00:01:08.979  -->  00:01:10.300
you don't have to leave your email
27

27

00:01:10.300  -->  00:01:12.190
address give it a moment and it should
28

28

00:01:12.190  -->  00:01:18.580
start I'm gonna save it to my downloads folder
29

29

00:01:18.580  -->  00:01:22.330
I'm going to open it and obviously you
30

30

00:01:22.330  -->  00:01:23.710
do the same on your operating system to
31

31

00:01:23.710  -->  00:01:25.930
open the downloaded file and go ahead
32

32

00:01:25.930  -->  00:01:27.970
and install it in this case it's a
33

33

00:01:27.970  -->  00:01:29.710
pretty simple favorite process on a Mac
34

34

00:01:29.710  -->  00:01:31.810
you just select the diffmerge and you
35

35

00:01:31.810  -->  00:01:32.590
just drag it into the Applications
36

36

00:01:32.590  -->  00:01:36.070
folder I can close that down and it's
37

37

00:01:36.070  -->  00:01:37.660
actually being installed but the process
38

38

00:01:37.660  -->  00:01:39.520
will be slightly different depending on
39

39

00:01:39.520  -->  00:01:41.290
your operating system but just go ahead
40

40

00:01:41.290  -->  00:01:43.270
and install that and then in the next
41

41

00:01:43.270  -->  00:01:45.160
video we're going to show you how to use
42

42

00:01:45.160  -->  00:01:47.320
this diffmerge tool specifically how to
43

43

00:01:47.320  -->  00:01:50.350
compare code from a given lesson that
44

44

00:01:50.350  -->  00:01:52.420
I've created and uploaded to the course
45

45

00:01:52.420  -->  00:01:53.830
for you I'm going to show you how to
46

46

00:01:53.830  -->  00:01:56.110
download and compare that to code that
47

47

00:01:56.110  -->  00:01:58.000
perhaps you've typed in and how to get
48

48

00:01:58.000  -->  00:01:59.950
the most out of the diffmerge tool.
49

49

00:01:59.950  -->  00:02:02.970
So I'll see you in the next video.
