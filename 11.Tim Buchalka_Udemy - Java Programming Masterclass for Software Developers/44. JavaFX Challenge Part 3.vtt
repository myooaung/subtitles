00:00:05.700  -->  00:00:08.000
ok so now we can write the code for the
2

2

00:00:08.000  -->  00:00:11.000
action handler for our contact dialogue
ok so now we can write the code for the
3

3

00:00:11.000  -->  00:00:13.450
fxml now if you recall we did
action handler for our contact dialogue
4

4

00:00:13.450  -->  00:00:15.140
something similar in the to do list
fxml now if you recall we did
5

5

00:00:15.140  -->  00:00:17.390
application so the code i'm about to
something similar in the to do list
6

6

00:00:17.390  -->  00:00:19.880
show you should be familiar now we want
application so the code i'm about to
7

7

00:00:19.880  -->  00:00:22.160
the dialogue to be modal and tied to the
show you should be familiar now we want
8

8

00:00:22.160  -->  00:00:24.640
main window of the application so we
the dialogue to be modal and tied to the
9

9

00:00:24.640  -->  00:00:26.800
need to assign a fx id to the border
main window of the application so we
10

10

00:00:26.800  -->  00:00:28.160
pane to achieve that
need to assign a fx id to the border
11

11

00:00:28.160  -->  00:00:33.220
let's get back to our main dot FXML and
pane to achieve that
12

12

00:00:33.220  -->  00:00:35.900
for the border pane we need to add an ID...
let's get back to our main dot FXML and
13

13

00:00:35.900  -->  00:00:38.510
...
for the border pane we need to add an ID...
14

14

00:00:38.510  -->  00:00:44.300
....and then go back to our
...
15

15

00:00:44.300  -->  00:00:47.180
controller class again this is the
....and then go back to our
16

16

00:00:47.180  -->  00:00:49.850
controller for the main dot FXML we first
controller class again this is the
17

17

00:00:49.850  -->  00:00:53.990
need to add a field...
controller for the main dot FXML we first
18

18

00:00:53.990  -->  00:00:59.930
....
need to add a field...
19

19

00:00:59.930  -->  00:01:01.610
...
....
20

00:01:01.610  -->  00:01:03.380
...
...
21

21

00:01:03.380  -->  00:01:06.770
alright so now that we've done that we
...
22

22

00:01:06.770  -->  00:01:09.200
can add the code for the action handler
alright so now that we've done that we
23

23

00:01:09.200  -->  00:01:12.020
let's go ahead and do that in here
can add the code for the action handler
24

24

00:01:12.020  -->  00:01:15.050
in the show add contact dialogue going
let's go ahead and do that in here

error here a little bit of a tricky one
...we're getting this
30

30

00:02:57.980  -->  00:02:59.390
it's actually got to do with the
error here a little bit of a tricky one
31

31

00:02:59.390  -->  00:03:01.990
language level so i go into my module
it's actually got to do with the
32

32

00:03:01.990  -->  00:03:05.630
settings going to project this should
language level so i go into my module
33

33

00:03:05.630  -->  00:03:07.430
actually be set to
settings going to project this should
34

34

00:03:07.430  -->  00:03:13.340
jdk 8 if I do that the errors disappears
actually be set to
35

35

00:03:13.340  -->  00:03:15.920
so we've got so far lets actually now
jdk 8 if I do that the errors disappears
36

36

00:03:15.920  -->  00:03:19.150
add the buttons for our dialogue so it's
so we've got so far lets actually now
37

37

00:03:19.150  -->  00:03:22.270
going to be dialogue dot get dialogue
add the buttons for our dialogue so it's
38

38

00:03:22.270  -->  00:03:27.980
...
going to be dialogue dot get dialogue
39

39

00:03:27.980  -->  00:04:20.580
...
...
40

40

00:04:20.580  -->  00:04:23.990
...so let's go
...
41

41

00:04:23.990  -->  00:04:26.190
through what we just added here so i
...so let's go
42

42

00:04:26.190  -->  00:04:28.350
started by creating a dialogue instance
through what we just added here so i
43

43

00:04:28.350  -->  00:04:30.450
and assigning the main window as its
started by creating a dialogue instance
44

44

00:04:30.450  -->  00:04:32.940
parent and I assigned the parent on line
and assigning the main window as its
45

45

00:04:32.940  -->  00:04:35.010
twenty and we're getting that parent
parent and I assigned the parent on line
46

46

00:04:35.010  -->  00:04:37.230
from the border pane and then set the
twenty and we're getting that parent
47

47

00:04:37.230  -->  00:04:39.720
dialogue title and I've then loaded the
from the border pane and then set the
48

48

00:04:39.720  -->  00:04:42.960
fxml and set the dialogues content to
dialogue title and I've then loaded the
49

49

00:04:42.960  -->  00:04:45.060
what we've defined in the fxml file the
fxml and set the dialogues content to
50

50

00:04:45.060  -->  00:04:48.830
contact contact dialogue .fxml and
what we've defined in the fxml file the
51

51

00:04:48.830  -->  00:04:50.670
then i added the ok and can cancel buttons
contact contact dialogue .fxml and
52

52

00:04:50.670  -->  00:04:53.010
and then we actually open the dialog
then i added the ok and can cancel buttons
53

53

00:04:53.010  -->  00:04:57.420
on line 36 and added the if statement
and then we actually open the dialog
54

54

00:04:57.420  -->  00:04:58.950
will check when the user presses ok or
on line 36 and added the if statement
55

55

00:04:58.950  -->  00:05:01.890
cancel if they pressed ok then we want
will check when the user presses ok or
56

56

00:05:01.890  -->  00:05:03.150
to process the information they're
cancel if they pressed ok then we want
57

57

00:05:03.150  -->  00:05:06.210
provided and add the new contact to our
to process the information they're
58

58

00:05:06.210  -->  00:05:09.330
contacts list before we do that let's
provided and add the new contact to our
59

59

00:05:09.330  -->  00:05:10.830
actually just run the application just
contacts list before we do that let's
60

60

00:05:10.830  -->  00:05:13.260
to make sure that this part of the code
actually just run the application just
61

61

00:05:13.260  -->  00:05:13.950
work
to make sure that this part of the code
62

62

00:05:13.950  -->  00:05:22.230
ok we got our menu up here and click
work
63

63

00:05:22.230  -->  00:05:26.580
on the menu click on ADD and there's our
ok we got our menu up here and click
64

64

00:05:26.580  -->  00:05:28.200
little while dialogue pane that's popped
on the menu click on ADD and there's our
65

65

00:05:28.200  -->  00:05:28.890
up
little while dialogue pane that's popped
66

66

00:05:28.890  -->  00:05:30.660
so obviously that's working we can see
up
67

67

00:05:30.660  -->  00:05:32.820
the fields that are in the dialog and
so obviously that's working we can see
68

68

00:05:32.820  -->  00:05:34.950
click on cancel to close it down so
the fields that are in the dialog and
69

69

00:05:34.950  -->  00:05:36.450
that's good we can continue on
click on cancel to close it down so
70

70

00:05:36.450  -->  00:05:39.270
alright so what what do we actually want
that's good we can continue on
71

71

00:05:39.270  -->  00:05:41.540
to do with the information that the user
alright so what what do we actually want
72

72

00:05:41.540  -->  00:05:44.160
provides in that dialogue box we want
to do with the information that the user
73

73

00:05:44.160  -->  00:05:45.780
actually create an instance of the
provides in that dialogue box we want
74

74

00:05:45.780  -->  00:05:48.270
contact class and add that to the
actually create an instance of the
75

75

00:05:48.270  -->  00:05:51.210
contacts list now because we set things
contact class and add that to the
76

76

00:05:51.210  -->  00:05:53.670
up to use data binding that's all we
contacts list now because we set things
77

77

00:05:53.670  -->  00:05:55.640
should have to do in other words we
up to use data binding that's all we
78

78

00:05:55.640  -->  00:05:57.630
don't have to explicitly change the UI
should have to do in other words we
79

79

00:05:57.630  -->  00:06:01.670
at all but this raises the question
don't have to explicitly change the UI
80

80

00:06:01.670  -->  00:06:04.230
of when we want to create an instance of
at all but this raises the question
81

81

00:06:04.230  -->  00:06:05.800
contact data class
of when we want to create an instance of
82

82

00:06:05.800  -->  00:06:07.660
now we haven't actually created that
contact data class
83

83

00:06:07.660  -->  00:06:10.360
instance yet now we could do it in main
now we haven't actually created that
84

84

00:06:10.360  -->  00:06:12.670
dot java as part of the javafx
instance yet now we could do it in main
85

85

00:06:12.670  -->  00:06:15.340
application lifecycle but since this is
dot java as part of the javafx
86

86

00:06:15.340  -->  00:06:17.440
a small application and everything the
application lifecycle but since this is
87

87

00:06:17.440  -->  00:06:19.540
user will want to do can be accessed
a small application and everything the
88

88

00:06:19.540  -->  00:06:21.640
from the main window i think it makes
user will want to do can be accessed
89

89

00:06:21.640  -->  00:06:24.550
sense for the controller to create the
from the main window i think it makes
90

90

00:06:24.550  -->  00:06:27.400
contact data instance let's do that in
sense for the controller to create the
91

91

00:06:27.400  -->  00:06:29.860
the initialize method that the javafx
contact data instance let's do that in
92

92

00:06:29.860  -->  00:06:31.960
runtime calls when it creates the
the initialize method that the javafx
93

93

00:06:31.960  -->  00:06:34.150
controller so we go back to our
runtime calls when it creates the
94

94

00:06:34.150  -->  00:06:36.670
controller class and let's add the
controller so we go back to our
95

95

00:06:36.670  -->  00:06:39.100
initialize at the top and what we want
controller class and let's add the
96

96

00:06:39.100  -->  00:06:42.070
to do first is also add an instance of our
initialize at the top and what we want
97

97

00:06:42.070  -->  00:06:44.290
contact data class so...
to do first is also add an instance of our
98

98

00:06:44.290  -->  00:06:48.760
...and then we want to
contact data class so...
99

99

00:06:48.760  -->  00:06:52.780
add out initialize method...
...and then we want to
100

100

00:06:52.780  -->  00:07:00.310
...
add out initialize method...
101

101

00:07:00.310  -->  00:07:03.850
...
...
102

102

00:07:03.850  -->  00:07:05.830
alright so we've got a contact data
...
103

103

00:07:05.830  -->  00:07:08.380
instance at this point but we haven't
alright so we've got a contact data
104

104

00:07:08.380  -->  00:07:11.590
read in any save contacts but we'll do
instance at this point but we haven't
105

105

00:07:11.590  -->  00:07:14.800
that after we've created the instance so...
read in any save contacts but we'll do
106

106

00:07:14.800  -->  00:07:20.350
...right now
that after we've created the instance so...
107

107

00:07:20.350  -->  00:07:22.000
they're aren't any but that's ok we'll add
...right now
108

108

00:07:22.000  -->  00:07:23.830
a few new entry shortly
they're aren't any but that's ok we'll add
109

109

00:07:23.830  -->  00:07:25.630
the last thing we want to do in the
a few new entry shortly
110

110

00:07:25.630  -->  00:07:27.790
initialize method is to initialize the
the last thing we want to do in the
111

111

00:07:27.790  -->  00:07:31.660
tables data if you recall we added an fx
initialize method is to initialize the
112

112

00:07:31.660  -->  00:07:34.270
ID to the table view already and
tables data if you recall we added an fx
113

113

00:07:34.270  -->  00:07:35.650
we just needed to declare the field in
ID to the table view already and
114

114

00:07:35.650  -->  00:07:37.660
this controller so go ahead and do that
we just needed to declare the field in
115

115

00:07:37.660  -->  00:07:47.320
...
this controller so go ahead and do that
116

116

00:07:47.320  -->  00:07:53.560
...
...
117

117

00:07:53.560  -->  00:07:55.390
now that we've done that we can
...
118

118

00:07:55.390  -->  00:07:57.220
initialize the table view in the
now that we've done that we can
119

119

00:07:57.220  -->  00:07:59.770
initialize method we do that below the
initialize the table view in the
120

120

00:07:59.770  -->  00:08:03.820
load contacts and we do that with contact
initialize method we do that below the
121

121

00:08:03.820  -->  00:08:07.360
table....
load contacts and we do that with contact
122

122

00:08:07.360  -->  00:08:12.250
....
table....
123

123

00:08:12.250  -->  00:08:14.380
alright so this is a good point in our
....
124

124

00:08:14.380  -->  00:08:16.170
program to run again to make sure things
alright so this is a good point in our
125

125

00:08:16.170  -->  00:08:24.910
are still working...are still working
program to run again to make sure things
126

126

00:08:24.910  -->  00:08:26.290
also the dialog box still work we are not
are still working...are still working
127

127

00:08:26.290  -->  00:08:28.510
getting any errors or exceptions and
also the dialog box still work we are not
128

128

00:08:28.510  -->  00:08:30.640
obviously there's no saved records so
getting any errors or exceptions and
129

129

00:08:30.640  -->  00:08:31.980
we are seeing exactly as we saw the last
obviously there's no saved records so
130

130

00:08:31.980  -->  00:08:33.450
time we ran it i'm going to close that
we are seeing exactly as we saw the last
131

131

00:08:33.450  -->  00:08:34.060
down
time we ran it i'm going to close that
132

132

00:08:34.060  -->  00:08:39.520
alright so now we can work on handling a
down
133

133

00:08:39.520  -->  00:08:42.190
new contact now we need the information
alright so now we can work on handling a
134

134

00:08:42.190  -->  00:08:45.130
that's been entered by the user but at
new contact now we need the information
135

135

00:08:45.130  -->  00:08:47.260
the moment that isn't accessible from
that's been entered by the user but at
136

136

00:08:47.260  -->  00:08:49.300
the main controller now we have to get
the moment that isn't accessible from
137

137

00:08:49.300  -->  00:08:50.770
the information using a content
the main controller now we have to get

138

00:08:50.770  -->  00:08:53.170
controller and provide a way for the
the information using a content
139

139

00:08:53.170  -->  00:08:55.530
main controller to get the new contact
controller and provide a way for the
140

140

00:08:55.530  -->  00:08:58.570
so let's add a get new contact method to
main controller to get the new contact
141

141

00:08:58.570  -->  00:09:00.940
the contact controller and it's going to
so let's add a get new contact method to
142

142

00:09:00.940  -->  00:09:02.590
gather the information provided the
the contact controller and it's going to
143

143

00:09:02.590  -->  00:09:04.690
user create a new contact
gather the information provided the
144

144

00:09:04.690  -->  00:09:07.240
instance and then return the instance to
user create a new contact
145

145

00:09:07.240  -->  00:09:09.720
the caller will go to our contract
instance and then return the instance to
146

146

00:09:09.720  -->  00:09:13.530
controller class we need to enter fields
the caller will go to our contract
147

147

00:09:13.530  -->  00:09:17.590
first...
controller class we need to enter fields
148

00:09:49.720  -->  00:09:54.400
...and now on to the

151

151

00:09:54.400  -->  00:09:56.680
public method and that will be public
...and now on to the
152

152

00:09:56.680  -->  00:10:01.240
...
public method and that will be public
153

153

155

155

00:10:53.860  -->  00:10:57.970
...so that code fairly
....
156

156

00:10:57.970  -->  00:11:00.070
straightforward i had to declare all the
...so that code fairly
157

157

00:11:00.070  -->  00:11:02.110
text fields then inside the get new
straightforward i had to declare all the
158

158

00:11:02.110  -->  00:11:04.270
contact method we retrieve all the
text fields then inside the get new
159

159

00:11:04.270  -->  00:11:06.340
information from the dialog box we
contact method we retrieve all the
160

160

00:11:06.340  -->  00:11:08.500
create a new contact return that to the
information from the dialog box we
161

161

00:11:08.500  -->  00:11:10.810
calling method now in a real-world
create a new contact return that to the
162

162

00:11:10.810  -->  00:11:12.730
application you want to verify the input
calling method now in a real-world
163

163

00:11:12.730  -->  00:11:14.650
at the very least you want to check that
application you want to verify the input
164

164

00:11:14.650  -->  00:11:17.740
the required fields weren't empty and would
at the very least you want to check that
165

165

00:11:17.740  -->  00:11:19.750
probably require first name last name
the required fields weren't empty and would
166

166

00:11:19.750  -->  00:11:22.090
and phone number and maybe have notes to
probably require first name last name
167

167

00:11:22.090  -->  00:11:24.370
be optional and if we wanted to be
and phone number and maybe have notes to
168

168

00:11:24.370  -->  00:11:26.500
really user friendly we only enable
be optional and if we wanted to be
169

169

00:11:26.500  -->  00:11:28.570
the ok button in the dialog when
really user friendly we only enable
170

170

00:11:28.570  -->  00:11:31.120
the three required fields weren't empty but
the ok button in the dialog when
171

171

00:11:31.120  -->  00:11:33.030
we can also just check the contents here
the three required fields weren't empty but
172

172

00:11:33.030  -->  00:11:36.010
but i won't actually add that now I will leave that as
we can also just check the contents here
173

173

00:11:36.010  -->  00:11:37.960
an exercise for you to add validation
but i won't actually add that now I will leave that as
174

174

00:11:37.960  -->  00:11:39.780
alright so let's go back to the main
an exercise for you to add validation
175

175

00:11:39.780  -->  00:11:43.570
control so when the users pressed ok will
alright so let's go back to the main
176

176

00:11:43.570  -->  00:11:45.030
get a reference to the contact
control so when the users pressed ok will
177

177

00:11:45.030  -->  00:11:48.030
controller and call it get new contact
get a reference to the contact
178

178

00:11:48.030  -->  00:11:50.470
method and will then add the new contact
controller and call it get new contact
179

179

00:11:50.470  -->  00:11:53.020
to the contacts list and the UI should
method and will then add the new contact
180

180

00:11:53.020  -->  00:11:55.930
hopefully automatically update so
to the contacts list and the UI should
181

181

00:11:55.930  -->  00:11:59.110
let's go back to our controller
hopefully automatically update so
182

182

00:11:59.110  -->  00:12:02.650
and we come down here to this process of
let's go back to our controller
183

183

00:12:02.650  -->  00:12:06.070
show the dialog box also got this code
and we come down here to this process of
184

184

00:12:06.070  -->  00:12:08.860
here if result is present and result.
show the dialog box also got this code
185

185

00:12:08.860  -->  00:12:11.020
get equals button okay that means
here if result is present and result.
186

186

00:12:11.020  -->  00:12:13.720
hopefully enter the data and click OK
get equals button okay that means
187

187

00:12:13.720  -->  00:12:16.090
meaning they want to save the field
hopefully enter the data and click OK
188

188

00:12:16.090  -->  00:12:17.370
save the
meaning they want to save the field
189

189

00:12:17.370  -->  00:12:19.460
information so what we want to do there
save the
190

190

00:12:19.460  -->  00:12:24.650
is we do...
information so what we want to do there
191

191

00:12:24.650  -->  00:12:28.110
...
is we do...
192

192

00:12:28.110  -->  00:12:30.150
...
...
193

193

00:12:30.150  -->  00:12:33.360
ok we are using the reference to fxml
...
194

194

00:12:33.360  -->  00:12:34.890
loader that we defined here on line
ok we are using the reference to fxml
195

195

00:12:34.890  -->  00:12:37.920
36 and we know that we are getting the
loader that we defined here on line
196

196

00:12:37.920  -->  00:12:40.520
getting access to the controller that's
36 and we know that we are getting the
197

197

00:12:40.520  -->  00:12:43.830
associated with that fxml file and then
getting access to the controller that's
198

198

00:12:43.830  -->  00:12:47.270
we're going to do contact...
associated with that fxml file and then
199

199

00:12:47.270  -->  00:12:50.520
...
we're going to do contact...
200

200

00:12:50.520  -->  00:13:06.710
...
...
201

201

00:13:06.710  -->  00:13:09.960
...fairly
...
202

202

00:13:09.960  -->  00:13:12.590
straightforward we've got access to our
...fairly
203

203

00:13:12.590  -->  00:13:15.140
contact controller so that we can access
straightforward we've got access to our
204

204

00:13:15.140  -->  00:13:17.720
this get new contact method to retrieve
contact controller so that we can access
205

205

00:13:17.720  -->  00:13:20.070
the contents from the dialogue field create a
this get new contact method to retrieve
206

206

00:13:20.070  -->  00:13:22.200
new contact record and ultimately
the contents from the dialogue field create a
207

207

00:13:22.200  -->  00:13:26.150
save that to our via contact data class
new contact record and ultimately
208

208

00:13:26.150  -->  00:13:28.680
we're going to do one more step here
save that to our via contact data class
209

209

00:13:28.680  -->  00:13:31.020
we're going to save the new contact to
we're going to do one more step here
210

210

00:13:31.020  -->  00:13:34.080
the xml file by saving all the contacts
we're going to save the new contact to
211

211

00:13:34.080  -->  00:13:36.890
now this isn't the most efficient way to
the xml file by saving all the contacts
212

212

00:13:36.890  -->  00:13:39.630
do it so we could write the file when a
now this isn't the most efficient way to
213

213

00:13:39.630  -->  00:13:41.940
user closes the application or perhaps
do it so we could write the file when a
214

214

00:13:41.940  -->  00:13:44.610
set at periodic intervals but since
user closes the application or perhaps
215

215

00:13:44.610  -->  00:13:45.690
we're going to be dealing with a small
set at periodic intervals but since
216

216

00:13:45.690  -->  00:13:47.840
number of contacts will do this whenever
we're going to be dealing with a small
217

217

00:13:47.840  -->  00:13:50.370
the user adds edits or delete a contact
number of contacts will do this whenever
218

218

00:13:50.370  -->  00:13:52.460
that way they'll never lose any of their
the user adds edits or delete a contact
219

219

00:13:52.460  -->  00:13:54.750
work so we'll do this on the line below
that way they'll never lose any of their
220

220

00:13:54.750  -->  00:14:00.360
that...
work so we'll do this on the line below
221

221

00:14:00.360  -->  00:14:02.070
we are calling save contacts method after
that...
222

222

00:14:02.070  -->  00:14:03.750
they've added the new contact to the
we are calling save contacts method after
223

223

00:14:03.750  -->  00:14:04.440
list
they've added the new contact to the
224

224

00:14:04.440  -->  00:14:08.580
alright so let's run this and see what
list
225

225

00:14:08.580  -->  00:14:09.260
happens
alright so let's run this and see what
226

226

00:14:09.260  -->  00:14:14.460
alright so let's create a new entry
happens
227

227

00:14:14.460  -->  00:14:17.960
contacts...
alright so let's create a new entry
228

228

00:14:17.960  -->  00:14:19.140
....
contacts...
229

229

00:14:19.140  -->  00:14:24.540
...
....
230

230

00:14:24.540  -->  00:14:29.820
click on OK and we can see the contact
...
231

231

00:14:29.820  -->  00:14:32.430
appear in the table and just to confirm
click on OK and we can see the contact
232

232

00:14:32.430  -->  00:14:34.200
this let's close the application and run
appear in the table and just to confirm
233

233

00:14:34.200  -->  00:14:36.390
it again to see whether our contact is
this let's close the application and run
234

234

00:14:36.390  -->  00:14:44.640
loaded run again and success you can see
it again to see whether our contact is
235

235

00:14:44.640  -->  00:14:45.660
we now got our contact
loaded run again and success you can see
236

236

00:14:45.660  -->  00:14:48.120
successfully loaded from the xml file
we now got our contact
237

237

00:14:48.120  -->  00:14:51.360
when the application and restarts
successfully loaded from the xml file
238

238

00:14:51.360  -->  00:14:53.040
so let's add three more contacts just
when the application and restarts
239

239

00:14:53.040  -->  00:14:54.510
so theirs a few more there to work with
so let's add three more contacts just
240

240

00:14:54.510  -->  00:15:16.410
so...
so theirs a few more there to work with
241

241

00:15:16.410  -->  00:15:25.070
....
so...
242

242

00:15:25.070  -->  00:15:33.830
...if you did make a
....
243

243

00:15:33.830  -->  00:15:35.360
mistake and you wanted to change things
...if you did make a
244

244

00:15:35.360  -->  00:15:37.700
you could actually make a change to the
mistake and you wanted to change things
245

245

00:15:37.700  -->  00:15:40.400
contacts . xml file because at the
you could actually make a change to the
246

246

00:15:40.400  -->  00:15:42.220
moment we haven't got away  in the
contacts . xml file because at the
247

247

00:15:42.220  -->  00:15:44.390
application to editing these so if I close
moment we haven't got away  in the
248

248

00:15:44.390  -->  00:15:47.360
down we can double-click this contacts to
application to editing these so if I close
249

249

00:15:47.360  -->  00:15:48.770
XML which should be appearing in the
down we can double-click this contacts to
250

250

00:15:48.770  -->  00:15:51.280
project pane and there's the entries
XML which should be appearing in the
251

251

00:15:51.280  -->  00:15:53.150
that are being added automatically by
project pane and there's the entries
252

252

00:15:53.150  -->  00:15:55.220
the code in the contact data class
that are being added automatically by
253

253

00:15:55.220  -->  00:15:57.200
alright so I'm going to finish the video
the code in the contact data class
254

254

00:15:57.200  -->  00:15:59.600
here in the next video what we're going to do
alright so I'm going to finish the video
255

255

00:15:59.600  -->  00:16:03.380
is start looking at the code to edit
here in the next video what we're going to do
256

256

00:16:03.380  -->  00:16:10.930
our contacts so see you in the next video
is start looking at the code to edit
