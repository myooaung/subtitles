1

00:00:04,830  -->  00:00:06,110
In this video, we're going to download
2

2

00:00:06,110  -->  00:00:10,090
and instal IntelliJ IDEA, which is the IDE,
3

3

00:00:10,090  -->  00:00:12,640
integrated development environment, or editor programme,
4

4

00:00:12,640  -->  00:00:14,130
if you will, that we're gonna be using
5

5

00:00:14,130  -->  00:00:17,100
to run our programmes in this course, to actually create
6

6

00:00:17,100  -->  00:00:18,730
and run our programmes, for that matter.
7

7

00:00:18,730  -->  00:00:20,670
So to download that, we're gonna go
8

8

00:00:20,670  -->  00:00:24,033
to jetbrains.com, www.jetbrains.com.
9

9

00:00:26,540  -->  00:00:27,790
Once we get there, we're gonna come up
10

10

00:00:27,790  -->  00:00:31,260
to the Tools menu at the top, select IntelliJ IDEA,
11

11

00:00:31,260  -->  00:00:33,403
you can see here, click on that.
12

12

00:00:34,960  -->  00:00:36,053
Click on download.
13

13

00:00:38,136  -->  00:00:39,100
And click on this little "I Agree"
14

14

00:00:39,100  -->  00:00:40,960
just to get rid of that on the screen.
15

15

00:00:40,960  -->  00:00:42,256
You've got two options here, when you
16

16

00:00:42,256  -->  00:00:44,890
go to download IntelliJ IDEA.
17

17

00:00:44,890  -->  00:00:46,380
You can grab the Community Edition,
18

18

00:00:46,380  -->  00:00:49,030
which we'll be doing, which is free, opensource.
19

19

00:00:49,030  -->  00:00:50,510
You'll never need to pay for it.
20

20

00:00:50,510  -->  00:00:53,496
Alternatively, you can choose the Ultimate Edition,
21

21

00:00:53,496  -->  00:00:55,730
which gives you a few extra options,
22

22

00:00:55,730  -->  00:00:58,900
and basically is for commercial developers.
23

23

00:00:58,900  -->  00:01:00,030
You can see if I scroll down, there's some
24

24

00:01:00,030  -->  00:01:03,060
extra features there, JavaScript, TypeScript,
25

25

00:01:03,060  -->  00:01:05,150
Java Enterprise Edition, Spring, et cetera.
26

26

00:01:05,150  -->  00:01:07,470
So basically, it gives you more functionality,
27

27

00:01:07,470  -->  00:01:09,380
which is how the company makes their money.
28

28

00:01:09,380  -->  00:01:10,718
Now the fact that they offer a free version,
29

29

00:01:10,718  -->  00:01:13,330
which is fully-featured and certainly enough
30

30

00:01:13,330  -->  00:01:16,120
for you to use in this course, is fantastic.
31

31

00:01:16,120  -->  00:01:17,998
So we're gonna click on download, here,
32

32

00:01:17,998  -->  00:01:20,183
to download the Community Edition.
33

33

00:01:22,700  -->  00:01:26,080
All right, so I'm gonna give that a moment now to complete.
34

34

00:01:26,080  -->  00:01:28,760
All right, you can see that IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition,
35

35

00:01:28,760  -->  00:01:33,320
that's the C in idea there, has finished downloading.
36

36

00:01:33,320  -->  00:01:38,160
Click on the little magnifying glass there to open Finder.
37

37

00:01:38,160  -->  00:01:39,667
We're gonna double-click the .dmg file
38

38

00:01:39,667  -->  00:01:41,220
to start installing it.
39

39

00:01:41,220  -->  00:01:42,930
I'm gonna close down Safari,
40

40

00:01:42,930  -->  00:01:44,580
cause we don't need that anymore.
41

41

00:01:47,290  -->  00:01:48,780
And I'll close down the Finder window for now,
42

42

00:01:48,780  -->  00:01:50,813
as well, cause we really don't need that either.
43

43

00:01:52,200  -->  00:01:53,830
Dragging it to applications, there's no doubt
44

44

00:01:53,830  -->  00:01:56,560
you've done it before with applications on the Mac.
45

45

00:01:56,560  -->  00:01:58,060
Give that a moment to instal.
46

46

00:01:59,220  -->  00:02:00,980
So I mentioned we're gonna do some configuration
47

47

00:02:00,980  -->  00:02:03,300
of IntelliJ IDEA in another video.
48

48

00:02:03,300  -->  00:02:05,558
But we'll do the first parts of it in this video.
49

49

00:02:05,558  -->  00:02:06,810
So I'm gonna go down, now, and double-click
50

50

00:02:06,810  -->  00:02:10,780
on the IntelliJ icon, IntelliJ IDEA CE.
51

51

00:02:10,780  -->  00:02:13,390
CE stands for Community Edition, that's the free version
52

52

00:02:13,390  -->  00:02:15,400
that we've downloaded and now installed.
53

53

00:02:15,400  -->  00:02:17,630
Double-click that to start off the process.
54

54

00:02:17,630  -->  00:02:20,820
We're gonna close down Finder now, and close down
55

55

00:02:20,820  -->  00:02:23,000
the instal window there, the installation.
56

56

00:02:23,000  -->  00:02:25,630
And I'll actually eject IntelliJ IDEA CE,
57

57

00:02:25,630  -->  00:02:28,810
because we've now finished with the installation.
58

58

00:02:28,810  -->  00:02:29,720
All right, we've got an option here
59

59

00:02:29,720  -->  00:02:31,000
telling us that it's from the app.
60

60

00:02:31,000  -->  00:02:32,800
The app has been downloaded from the internet.
61

61

00:02:32,800  -->  00:02:33,780
Are you sure?
62

62

00:02:33,780  -->  00:02:35,190
That's from jetbrains.com, which is
63

63

00:02:35,190  -->  00:02:38,410
the official site for IntelliJ, so that's fine.
64

64

00:02:38,410  -->  00:02:40,310
We're gonna click on open, as you saw.
65

65

00:02:41,420  -->  00:02:43,050
We're prompted for this option.
66

66

00:02:43,050  -->  00:02:46,010
If you're installing IntelliJ IDEA for the first time,
67

67

00:02:46,010  -->  00:02:48,060
we haven't got any settings to import.
68

68

00:02:48,060  -->  00:02:49,370
But if you had a previous installation,
69

69

00:02:49,370  -->  00:02:50,510
you could click on the top option,
70

70

00:02:50,510  -->  00:02:53,180
config installation folder, and basically,
71

71

00:02:53,180  -->  00:02:55,440
that would give the option to drag those settings
72

72

00:02:55,440  -->  00:02:57,510
from the previous version into this current version,
73

73

00:02:57,510  -->  00:02:59,100
this new version we're installing.
74

74

00:02:59,100  -->  00:03:00,700
I'm gonna select Do not import settings,
75

75

00:03:00,700  -->  00:03:02,090
because it's a brand-new instal.
76

76

00:03:02,090  -->  00:03:03,710
Click okay.
77

77

00:03:03,710  -->  00:03:05,323
Privacy policy, there.
78

78

00:03:06,160  -->  00:03:07,710
Check the checkbox, click on Continue.
79

79

00:03:07,710  -->  00:03:09,970
You can read that if you like.
80

80

00:03:09,970  -->  00:03:12,010
We can send anonymous data about features
81

81

00:03:12,010  -->  00:03:13,440
or plugins, if you want.
82

82

00:03:13,440  -->  00:03:14,990
I generally click on Don't send,
83

83

00:03:14,990  -->  00:03:16,640
but you can choose either option.
84

84

00:03:17,920  -->  00:03:19,640
We're now presented with an option,
85

85

00:03:19,640  -->  00:03:21,930
which top of the screen colour you would like.
86

86

00:03:21,930  -->  00:03:24,040
I'm going to leave mine set to light.
87

87

00:03:24,040  -->  00:03:25,980
Light comes out better for videos.
88

88

00:03:25,980  -->  00:03:29,160
But if you prefer to use dark colour, then that's...
89

89

00:03:29,160  -->  00:03:31,010
My development machine is certainly using that,
90

90

00:03:31,010  -->  00:03:32,550
it's easier on the eyes, then select that.
91

91

00:03:32,550  -->  00:03:33,890
But choose whichever one you want,
92

92

00:03:33,890  -->  00:03:36,800
noting you can change these options later in Preferences.
93

93

00:03:36,800  -->  00:03:38,920
We're gonna click on Next.
94

94

00:03:38,920  -->  00:03:40,960
Okay, map scheme I'm gonna leave as defaults.
95

95

00:03:40,960  -->  00:03:43,480
If you've used IntelliJ IDEA before, you can change that
96

96

00:03:43,480  -->  00:03:45,370
by choosing the option on the right.
97

97

00:03:45,370  -->  00:03:47,340
I'm gonna click on Next.
98

98

00:03:47,340  -->  00:03:48,300
This gives you the option
99

99

00:03:48,300  -->  00:03:51,490
to invoke IntelliJ IDEA from the command line.
100

100

00:03:51,490  -->  00:03:52,540
If that's something you're doing,
101

101

00:03:52,540  -->  00:03:54,380
or have done in the past, or want to do
102

102

00:03:54,380  -->  00:03:56,620
from the command line, then check the box.
103

103

00:03:56,620  -->  00:03:58,060
There's no harm in doing it, in any event,
104

104

00:03:58,060  -->  00:03:59,260
so I'm going to do that.
105

105

00:04:00,290  -->  00:04:02,130
You've got various tools here.
106

106

00:04:02,130  -->  00:04:04,160
And keep in mind, if you've chosen
107

107

00:04:04,160  -->  00:04:07,200
to download and instal the Ultimate Edition,
108

108

00:04:07,200  -->  00:04:08,970
there'll be additional features here.
109

109

00:04:08,970  -->  00:04:10,173
Generally, I just leave everything as-is.
110

110

00:04:10,173  -->  00:04:12,610
I never change anything, because you can always
111

111

00:04:12,610  -->  00:04:14,270
change plugins and add new plugins
112

112

00:04:14,270  -->  00:04:15,870
at a later time, as well.
113

113

00:04:15,870  -->  00:04:17,130
Click on Next.
114

114

00:04:17,130  -->  00:04:19,490
Same deal there, I'm not gonna change any of those settings.
115

115

00:04:19,490  -->  00:04:20,440
You can come back to it.
116

116

00:04:20,440  -->  00:04:22,620
You can see down here, Preferences, Plugins,
117

117

00:04:22,620  -->  00:04:25,450
if you do wanna change that in the future.
118

118

00:04:25,450  -->  00:04:27,763
Click on Start using IntelliJ IDEA.
119

119

00:04:28,810  -->  00:04:29,813
Enter my password.
120

120

00:04:33,340  -->  00:04:36,123
IntelliJ IDEA should start up for us now.
121

121

00:04:38,040  -->  00:04:39,950
Okay, so at this point, we're now done.
122

122

00:04:39,950  -->  00:04:41,400
We're gonna end the video here.
123

123

00:04:41,400  -->  00:04:42,920
There is another video that we'll go through,
124

124

00:04:42,920  -->  00:04:44,270
and we'll go through and enter or do
125

125

00:04:44,270  -->  00:04:46,740
the configuration for IntelliJ IDEA.
126

126

00:04:46,740  -->  00:04:48,980
That's actually connecting the STKs
127

127

00:04:48,980  -->  00:04:50,810
and so on that we need for this course.
128

128

00:04:50,810  -->  00:04:52,760
But we'll do all that in a separate video.
129

129

00:04:52,760  -->  00:04:53,593
Thanks for watching.
130

130

00:04:53,593  -->  00:04:55,360
Let's move on, now, to the next video.
