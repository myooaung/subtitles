00:00:05.460  -->  00:00:08.870
In the last video,
we started on the inheritance challenge.
2

2

00:00:08.870  -->  00:00:10.370
In this video, we're gonna go ahead and
3

3

00:00:10.370  -->  00:00:13.460
we're going to complete my version
of the challenge solution.
4

4

00:00:13.460  -->  00:00:17.250
So moving on now from the Outlander
class that we've created.
5

5

00:00:17.250  -->  00:00:19.630
Now, what we're going to do is we're
going to change a few things here,
6

6

00:00:19.630  -->  00:00:23.870
because this moved to fa,
we've passed fault as the top of gear box,
7

7

00:00:23.870  -->  00:00:27.170
what means is that is we've decided
on our automatic transmission.
8

8

00:00:27.170  -->  00:00:30.780
We're gonna create a new method,
which we call accelerate.
9

9

00:00:30.780  -->  00:00:35.300
Which we pass a parameter of the speed,
and based on that, depending on
10

10

00:00:35.300  -->  00:00:38.820
the speed the car is traveling at, we're
automatically going to change the gear.
11

11

00:00:38.820  -->  00:00:41.090
Because, of course,
it is an automatic gearbox.
12

12

00:00:41.090  -->  00:00:44.380
And then we're obviously going to set
the velocity and the direction as well.
13

13

00:00:44.380  -->  00:00:46.740
So to do that,
you're going to create a new method.
14

14

00:00:46.740  -->  00:00:50.910
Call it public void accelerate.
15

15

00:00:50.910  -->  00:00:55.380
I'm going create, pass,
something called the rate.
16

16

00:00:55.380  -->  00:00:59.790
Now the rate is the difference
in speed from the current speed.
17

17

00:00:59.790  -->  00:01:01.210
So what we're going to determine then,
18

18

00:01:01.210  -->  00:01:06.200
is we're going to look at the new velocity
of the vehicle, or the car in this case.
19

19

00:01:06.200  -->  00:01:09.960
Which will be the new velocity equals,
20

20

00:01:09.960  -->  00:01:12.370
we're gonna get the current
velocity of the vehicle,
21

21

00:01:12.370  -->  00:01:16.960
which is the field essentially that
comes right back from the vehicle class.
22

22

00:01:16.960  -->  00:01:20.100
They we're gonna add to
that the current rate,
23

23

00:01:20.100  -->  00:01:23.360
bearing in mind that the rate can be
a positive number or a negative number.
24

24

00:01:23.360  -->  00:01:26.920
So a positive number would be,
you put your foot down on the accelerator,
25

25

00:01:26.920  -->  00:01:29.180
you've increased the speed.
26

26

00:01:29.180  -->  00:01:32.610
And a minus number would mean that you're
decelerating, for want of a better term,
27

27

00:01:32.610  -->  00:01:35.200
but we're handling all of
this in the one method.
28

28

00:01:35.200  -->  00:01:39.140
So the new velocity is going to be the new
velocity of the car, taking into account
29

29

00:01:40.150  -->  00:01:42.810
the change that has happened, or
is being passed to this method.
30

30

00:01:44.870  -->  00:01:47.500
So if new velocity is equal to zero.
31

31

00:01:47.500  -->  00:01:50.320
We're gonna call a stop method.
32

32

00:01:53.020  -->  00:02:00.150
Otherwise we're going to put else,
if new velocity is greater than zero,
33

33

00:02:00.150  -->  00:02:07.630
and new velocity less than equal to ten,
then we're going to change the gear,
34

34

00:02:07.630  -->  00:02:13.900
bearing in mind that this is
an automatic transmission.
35

35

00:02:13.900  -->  00:02:16.210
And we'll just do a few more,
we won't go through and do all six gears.
36

36

00:02:16.210  -->  00:02:20.360
But what if new velocity
is greater than ten and
37

37

00:02:21.360  -->  00:02:24.150
new velocity is, say,
less than or equal to 20?
38

38

00:02:24.150  -->  00:02:27.690
This could miles or kilometers per hour.
39

39

00:02:27.690  -->  00:02:28.310
Change gear two.
40

40

00:02:28.310  -->  00:02:31.990
So we're getting the car to automatically
change based on the velocity.
41

41

00:02:31.990  -->  00:02:40.460
After your velocity is less than or
equal to 30.
42

42

00:02:40.460  -->  00:02:44.430
You'll see what we're doing here,
change gear three.
43

43

00:02:44.430  -->  00:02:45.150
And for simplicity,
44

44

00:02:45.150  -->  00:02:48.140
even though I said there's a six speed,
I'm going to put else.
45

45

00:02:49.520  -->  00:02:50.100
Change gear four.
46

46

00:02:50.100  -->  00:02:52.760
So normally you would go through and
you'd actually do the other parameters for
47

47

00:02:52.760  -->  00:02:53.990
the speeds.
48

48

00:02:53.990  -->  00:02:57.780
So what we're doing here is we've
created a new method called accelerate.
49

49

00:02:57.780  -->  00:03:00.830
And depending on what the new speed
is going to be, we're automatically
50

50

00:03:00.830  -->  00:03:04.420
changing to the relevant gear, which of
course is what a car does automatically.
51

51

00:03:04.420  -->  00:03:07.990
It knows to change gear, based on
a certain amount of speed or REVS.
52

52

00:03:07.990  -->  00:03:10.640
And the last thing we need to do is
we need to just do a final test,
53

53

00:03:10.640  -->  00:03:15.440
if(newVelocity > 0 ),
we wanna change velocity.
54

54

00:03:15.440  -->  00:03:18.380
We wanna call the changeVelocity to
what the (newVelocity) is going to be.
55

55

00:03:18.380  -->  00:03:22.470
And we also wanna use
the getCurrentDirection.
56

56

00:03:22.470  -->  00:03:25.350
So we're still going to
go in the same direction,
57

57

00:03:25.350  -->  00:03:27.800
all we're doing is we're increasing or
decreasing the speed.
58

58

00:03:28.820  -->  00:03:32.670
So that's now a method, that you can see,
that's specific to the Outlander.
59

59

00:03:32.670  -->  00:03:34.790
But then it's changing gears.
60

60

00:03:36.210  -->  00:03:38.510
But, of course, the change in gear
61

61

00:03:38.510  -->  00:03:41.040
is based now on the method
that we've defined in the car.
62

62

00:03:42.260  -->  00:03:44.880
And of course some of the other
features we're using.
63

63

00:03:46.380  -->  00:03:48.050
Stop method at the moment.
64

64

00:03:48.050  -->  00:03:50.550
We haven't implemented
the stop method in here.
65

65

00:03:50.550  -->  00:03:53.900
We've only implemented
the stop method down here.
66

66

00:03:53.900  -->  00:03:57.160
So what we really should do is,
with the stop method, so
67

67

00:03:57.160  -->  00:04:01.160
we could create a stop method and
put it in here under the car.
68

68

00:04:01.160  -->  00:04:06.130
Set the gear o the first gear in
other words, if the car is stopped.
69

69

00:04:06.130  -->  00:04:08.000
But that wouldn't be appropriate,
70

70

00:04:08.000  -->  00:04:11.970
because we've decided that we have
a boolean here for isitManual.
71

71

00:04:11.970  -->  00:04:15.600
So if it's manual, that's a manual
operation to change the gear but
72

72

00:04:15.600  -->  00:04:17.270
in the case of the Outlander.
73

73

00:04:17.270  -->  00:04:20.380
We defined that as to be
using an automatic gear box.
74

74

00:04:20.380  -->  00:04:23.420
So therefore we need to add
the functionality to change the gear,
75

75

00:04:23.420  -->  00:04:26.990
if it's stopped here in the Outlander,
and not in the car class.
76

76

00:04:26.990  -->  00:04:28.790
So we're going to put change gear 1.
77

77

00:04:28.790  -->  00:04:33.080
So in other words, if the car is
stopped it's going to automatically
78

78

00:04:33.080  -->  00:04:35.090
change the gear for us to first gear.
79

79

00:04:35.090  -->  00:04:36.830
So that's a very basic solution.
80

80

00:04:36.830  -->  00:04:39.910
As you can see here that we've come
up with, we've now got three classes.
81

81

00:04:39.910  -->  00:04:44.430
We got the vehicle class, which is
the base class, the base vehicle class.
82

82

00:04:44.430  -->  00:04:47.290
We use the car class to extend from that.
83

83

00:04:47.290  -->  00:04:49.950
And we added these parameters
that are unique for a vehicle.
84

84

00:04:49.950  -->  00:04:54.990
Wheels, doors, gears, and as to whether
the gearbox was manual or automatic.
85

85

00:04:54.990  -->  00:04:56.530
And also the current gear,
86

86

00:04:56.530  -->  00:05:00.330
we're keeping track of what
the current gear is for the car.
87

87

00:05:00.330  -->  00:05:02.110
And for the Outlander,
of course, we're using that.
88

88

00:05:02.110  -->  00:05:03.770
We've extended from the car.
89

89

00:05:03.770  -->  00:05:06.440
The only real difference is
we've added one field here,
90

90

00:05:06.440  -->  00:05:08.950
which is the number of road service
months that come with a new car.
91

91

00:05:08.950  -->  00:05:12.140
Could have also added our
own accelerate method,
92

92

00:05:12.140  -->  00:05:15.600
which is unique to the Outlander
because it's an automatic car.
93

93

00:05:15.600  -->  00:05:18.960
Or because it has an automatic gearbox,
depending on the gear and
94

94

00:05:18.960  -->  00:05:20.940
the speed that we're going to be going.
95

95

00:05:20.940  -->  00:05:23.040
We change the gear box automatically.
96

96

00:05:23.040  -->  00:05:25.880
So let's try running this now and
see what it looks like.
97

97

00:05:25.880  -->  00:05:30.330
So I'm gonna create outlander.
98

98

00:05:30.330  -->  00:05:33.490
Outlander equals view outlander.
99

99

00:05:33.490  -->  00:05:37.570
And of course the parameters were just
the number of routes or service months, so
100

100

00:05:37.570  -->  00:05:39.250
we'll say 36 for three years.
101

101

00:05:41.090  -->  00:05:43.390
But now what we can do is we can
type outlander.accelerate, so
102

102

00:05:43.390  -->  00:05:48.330
let's accelerate, say,
to 30, and see what happens.
103

103

00:05:48.330  -->  00:05:49.100
So, let's run that.
104

104

00:05:51.820  -->  00:05:53.760
Let's make a bit of space here so
we can see what we're doing.
105

105

00:05:53.760  -->  00:05:54.420
I'll just run it again.
106

106

00:05:56.700  -->  00:06:00.570
So you can see what's happened is, we have
to find a new object for the Outlander
107

107

00:06:00.570  -->  00:06:04.410
class, from the Outlander class, and
we've started to accelerate to 30.
108

108

00:06:04.410  -->  00:06:07.540
So the first thing what happened was,
we set the current gear,
109

109

00:06:07.540  -->  00:06:11.790
the gear changed to 3, vehicle.move was
called to be moving at 30 in the direction
110

110

00:06:11.790  -->  00:06:16.110
and the direction is zero because
we haven't defined a direction.
111

111

00:06:16.110  -->  00:06:18.720
Car change velocity was also executed.
112

112

00:06:18.720  -->  00:06:20.920
This is where the outputs can
be a little bit confusing,
113

113

00:06:20.920  -->  00:06:22.780
because we have a look at
the code that was executed.
114

114

00:06:22.780  -->  00:06:24.380
We gotta look at that Outlander.
115

115

00:06:25.410  -->  00:06:26.960
It actually met this condition here,
116

116

00:06:26.960  -->  00:06:31.380
because the speed that we've selected is
greater than 20 and less than equal to 30.
117

117

00:06:31.380  -->  00:06:34.730
To change gear to three,
then we change velocity.
118

118

00:06:34.730  -->  00:06:37.840
Of course changeVelocity
is in our car class,
119

119

00:06:37.840  -->  00:06:40.300
we used a method called changeVelocity.
120

120

00:06:40.300  -->  00:06:42.380
I guess what we probably should
have done there to make it a little
121

121

00:06:42.380  -->  00:06:45.450
bit better to read, is we should have
outputed that line first, like so,
122

122

00:06:45.450  -->  00:06:48.370
and then it'd actually appear in
the right order so we'll do that.
123

123

00:06:50.480  -->  00:06:51.760
So now it's actually
set in the right order.
124

124

00:06:51.760  -->  00:06:54.100
So it shows the first thing that
happened was the gear change,
125

125

00:06:54.100  -->  00:06:55.990
was changed to third gear.
126

126

00:06:55.990  -->  00:06:57.760
The car changed velocity to 30.
127

127

00:06:57.760  -->  00:06:59.380
And then it called them,
128

128

00:06:59.380  -->  00:07:04.320
the actually move method was called
from the base class, base vehicle,
129

129

00:07:04.320  -->  00:07:10.350
based on this change velocity method which
called the base method from the vehicle.
130

130

00:07:10.350  -->  00:07:11.390
And we could change this a little bit.
131

131

00:07:11.390  -->  00:07:17.940
We could go back to our main class and
we could maybe, outLander.accelerate.
132

132

00:07:17.940  -->  00:07:20.420
Just to see that it's working,
we add another 20.
133

133

00:07:20.420  -->  00:07:23.500
So that should accumulate to be
a total of 50 that we going at.
134

134

00:07:23.500  -->  00:07:24.240
So if we run that.
135

135

00:07:26.860  -->  00:07:30.790
You can see, now, that what happened
the second time after the second call,
136

136

00:07:30.790  -->  00:07:32.080
changed to fourth gear.
137

137

00:07:32.080  -->  00:07:35.320
Cuz that was our, if you recall,
that was our else.
138

138

00:07:35.320  -->  00:07:37.920
We're only handling four
gears in this scenario.
139

139

00:07:37.920  -->  00:07:43.140
The velocity was actually changed to 50,
because we added 20 at the second call.
140

140

00:07:43.140  -->  00:07:47.030
Added another 20,
it's maintaining the current velocity, so
141

141

00:07:47.030  -->  00:07:49.330
it knows the current speed now is 50.
142

142

00:07:49.330  -->  00:07:52.330
So what we could have probably
done also is just to be.
143

143

00:07:52.330  -->  00:07:55.500
Make things a little bit clearer,
is we perhaps could have started here, and
144

144

00:07:55.500  -->  00:07:59.810
we could have put outlander.steer.
145

145

00:07:59.810  -->  00:08:03.130
We'll could say that we're going
to go at forty-five degrees.
146

146

00:08:03.130  -->  00:08:07.240
And remember that steer method is
coming all the way, not from here, but
147

147

00:08:07.240  -->  00:08:12.280
coming all the way from vehicle, because
we haven't overwritten this method.
148

148

00:08:12.280  -->  00:08:14.470
In the car class or the Outlander class.
149

149

00:08:14.470  -->  00:08:18.810
So if we run that now,
vehicle.steer you notice now that
150

150

00:08:18.810  -->  00:08:23.780
the vehicle.steer is now steering at 45
degrees, car changed to third gear and
151

151

00:08:23.780  -->  00:08:25.030
everything as it is was before.
152

152

00:08:25.030  -->  00:08:27.240
The only thing different
now is the direction.
153

153

00:08:27.240  -->  00:08:29.710
And the other thing,
as I mentioned with accelerate,
154

154

00:08:29.710  -->  00:08:33.780
I can also pass a negative number,
so we're currently doing 50,
155

155

00:08:33.780  -->  00:08:39.030
outlander.accelerate Let's put
minus 42 and see what happens.
156

156

00:08:39.030  -->  00:08:42.240
That should take us to eight,
which should probably be first gear.
157

157

00:08:42.240  -->  00:08:42.890
Let's try that.
158

158

00:08:46.700  -->  00:08:49.260
So again, you can see what happened was,
we changed down to first gear,
159

159

00:08:49.260  -->  00:08:53.520
because the speed is now eight, and
we're still moving in the same direction.
160

160

00:08:53.520  -->  00:08:56.430
So you can see how useful Inheritance is.
161

161

00:08:56.430  -->  00:09:00.420
And it really gives you lots of
flexibility to model real life objects
162

162

00:09:00.420  -->  00:09:01.640
in software.
163

163

00:09:01.640  -->  00:09:03.790
And as you can see it's
also very powerful.
164

164

00:09:03.790  -->  00:09:06.340
And actually saves you a lot of coding.
165

165

00:09:06.340  -->  00:09:10.260
You're not having to create the code,
so you can create the code for vehicle.
166

166

00:09:10.260  -->  00:09:14.630
In this case in car once, and
then for other types of cars.
167

167

00:09:14.630  -->  00:09:17.590
For example a Porsche, it's very simply
to create to create a new class and
168

168

00:09:17.590  -->  00:09:19.400
extend the car class.
169

169

00:09:19.400  -->  00:09:22.320
You've got all this base
functionality built in.
170

170

00:09:22.320  -->  00:09:26.010
Now what you could have done, because what
we've done with this accelerate here,
171

171

00:09:26.010  -->  00:09:29.680
we've effectively implemented a method
to change gears automatically,
172

172

00:09:29.680  -->  00:09:31.560
depending based on the speed.
173

173

00:09:31.560  -->  00:09:35.530
So we could even have created another
class, or added that elsewhere, so
174

174

00:09:35.530  -->  00:09:38.790
that functionality was available for
all cars that were automatic.
175

175

00:09:38.790  -->  00:09:41.910
So there's lots of flexibility
as you can see there.
176

176

00:09:41.910  -->  00:09:43.130
So I hope that's helped a lot.
177

177

00:09:44.160  -->  00:09:47.680
That's inheritance, and you'll understand
more of this the more you use it and
178

178

00:09:47.680  -->  00:09:49.450
it will become a lot more familiar.
179

179

00:09:49.450  -->  00:09:53.060
So in the next video we're going
to start with composition.
180

180

00:09:53.060  -->  00:09:57.590
Composition is something that can be
used in place or with inheritance,
181

181

00:09:57.590  -->  00:10:00.620
and you'll see that theres many
benefits to be using composition,
182

182

00:10:00.620  -->  00:10:02.650
but we'll start that in the next video.
