00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:08.620
<v ->All right, so moving on now, we saw in the last video</v>
1

2
00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.000
that we were able to output the text hello world,
2

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.560
and you can see that down the bottom left hand corner.
3

4
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.570
I've got a little bit of a challenge for you here,
4

5
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:16.410
and the challenge is
5

6
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.740
to see whether you can modify this programme,
6

7
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.180
so that instead of it printing hello world,
7

8
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.270
it prints hello Tim,
8

9
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.630
or hello whatever your first name is.
9

10
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.463
So in other words,
10

11
00:00:25.463 --> 00:00:27.780
you just change the output slightly.
11

12
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.860
So looking at the code on the screen,
12

13
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.000
how do you think you'd go about that?
13

14
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.650
Let's see if you can figure that out,
14

15
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.090
and get that to run.
15

16
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.129
So basically, make the change
16

17
00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:36.920
and we click on the green arrow,
17

18
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.740
the green run icon to start the programme and test it out
18

19
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.130
to see whether it works.
19

20
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.880
So click pause on the video now,
20

21
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.950
so you can actually go away and try that.
21

22
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.420
When you're ready to come back and check on the solution
22

23
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.740
come back and restart the video
23

24
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.420
or replay it from where you left off
24

25
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.880
and we'll go through it together.
25

26
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.143
So pause the video now.
26

27
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.380
All right, so welcome back.
27

28
00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.830
Hopefully you managed to make that first change.
28

29
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.671
So to make he change all we need to do,
29

30
00:01:00.671 --> 00:01:03.631
come back here, delete the word world,
30

31
00:01:03.631 --> 00:01:06.690
I'm going to press backspace there
31

32
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:07.920
and I'm going to put in the word,
32

33
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.100
or the text rather Tim,
33

34
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.760
so, Hello Tim.
34

35
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.570
And to be correct maybe,
35

36
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.100
correcting this might be hello comma, Tim.
36

37
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.850
Anything like that should be fine,
37

38
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.010
then of course to run it,
38

39
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.910
we just need to click on the run icon.
39

40
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.810
And there it is, there's the output "Hello, Tim".
40

41
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.040
All right so that's it,
41

42
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.140
our first programme is now complete,
42

43
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.040
congratulations if you managed to make that work.
43

44
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.270
And look even if you didn't,
44

45
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.520
if you got an error,
45

46
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.810
we'll start talking more about errors in videos coming up.
46

47
00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.970
But if you got something like this,
47

48
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.350
if you got rid of that semi colon that you saw there,
48

49
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.180
if we actually click on that to run,
49

50
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.860
so you might of saw something like that.
50

51
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.840
Handy thing with with IntelliJ is that if you see an arrow
51

52
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.948
like this, it'll actually tell you off.
52

53
00:01:46.948 --> 00:01:48.760
It will actually tell you something that makes sense,
53

54
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.700
it says that its expecting a semi colon.
54

55
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.130
You can double click that,
55

56
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.963
to go to the line,
56

57
00:01:52.963 --> 00:01:54.660
so if I was on line three,
57

58
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.520
I double click this arrow up here,
58

59
00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.810
that takes me to the right line.
59

60
00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.610
Then I can put in the semi colon again,
60

61
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:01.660
to get rid of the error.
61

62
00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.341
And if I run that again now,
62

63
00:02:03.341 --> 00:02:06.780
we should find the output now appears without an error.
63

64
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.360
The other thing is if you miss anything like
64

65
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.679
the right parenthesis there,
65

66
00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.400
noting that straight away IntelliJ
66

67
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.233
is telling me there is a problem.
67

68
00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:14.820
You can also hover over that
68

69
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.010
and its actually giving me the game away,
69

70
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.843
and telling you there
70

71
00:02:16.843 --> 00:02:19.080
that its looking for a right parenthesis.
71

72
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.530
So, its pretty good at picking up when there's errors,
72

73
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.798
lets delete a double quote there.
73

74
00:02:23.798 --> 00:02:25.350
Now its underlined the whole thing in red,
74

75
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.200
the illegal line end in string literal,
75

76
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.410
now that doesn't probably make a lot of sense to you
76

77
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.640
but this text in double quotes,
77

78
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.690
is called a literal string.
78

79
00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:35.523
So what it's saying,
79

80
00:02:35.523 --> 00:02:36.890
IntelliJ is saying there that,
80

81
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.840
illegal line end in string literal,
81

82
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.900
it's not saying that you've got to start here with
82

83
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:41.733
double quote,
83

84
00:02:41.733 --> 00:02:43.990
because that's how we defined the string literal.
84

85
00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.120
We didn't add a trailing one.
85

86
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.950
So I'm adding that there now.
86

87
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.800
So that's some of the common errors that you'll get.
87

88
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.848
Noting that you'll see the error right away,
88

89
00:02:50.848 --> 00:02:54.030
and if you don't happen to notice that and you go to run it
89

90
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.400
then IntelliJ will helpfully tell you,
90

91
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.850
there's an error down the bottom.
91

92
00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.390
Again if you're on a different line number,
92

93
00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.450
you can double click on an error like this
93

94
00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.410
and it takes you to the spot where its found the error.
94

95
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.590
In this case we need to go to the end of that
95

96
00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.280
and add a double quote again.
96

97
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.203
And away we go.
97

98
00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.983
Run it.
98

99
00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.980
And that's that error sorted.
99

100
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.750
All right so that's our first programme completed.
100

101
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:14.583
Well done,
101

102
00:03:14.583 --> 00:03:16.253
lets now move on, to the next video.
