00:00:04.580  -->  00:00:06.470
so continuing on from the last video
2

2

00:00:06.470  -->  00:00:08.810
let's now go ahead and add the constants
3

3

00:00:08.810  -->  00:00:10.810
for those insert prepared statements
4

4

00:00:10.810  -->  00:00:13.210
that I talked about going to do firstly is
5

5

00:00:13.210  -->  00:00:14.630
just like clean up this main . java
6

6

00:00:14.630  -->  00:00:18.040
file with those comments so
7

7

00:00:18.040  -->  00:00:20.630
we'll get back to data source java back
8

8

00:00:20.630  -->  00:00:22.820
up to the top of the file and will add
9

9

00:00:22.820  -->  00:00:26.990
those constants so we're
10

10

00:00:26.990  -->  00:00:29.150
going to start with....
11

11

00:00:29.150  -->  00:00:36.470
....
12

12

00:00:36.470  -->  00:01:51.800
....
13

13

00:01:51.800  -->  00:01:54.350
alright then the third one is for
14

14

00:01:54.350  -->  00:01:58.370
inserting song so...
15

15

00:01:58.370  -->  00:02:02.600
....
16

16

00:02:02.600  -->  00:02:44.540
....
17

17

00:02:44.540  -->  00:02:48.230
ok so now that we've got our constants
18

18

00:02:48.230  -->  00:02:50.480
going to add the code to the open method
19

19

00:02:50.480  -->  00:02:53.120
to create the prepared statement
20

20

00:02:53.120  -->  00:02:55.700
instances when we insert an artist or
21

21

00:02:55.700  -->  00:02:58.280
album we need to know what id the _id
22

22

00:02:58.280  -->  00:03:00.440
the database is assigned to the
23

23

00:03:00.440  -->  00:03:02.720
record and if you recall the underscore
24

24

00:03:02.720  -->  00:03:05.570
IDs the key and the database generates
25

25

00:03:05.570  -->  00:03:07.760
the value whenever it inserts a record
26

26

00:03:07.760  -->  00:03:10.460
into the table so we need to use the
27

27

00:03:10.460  -->  00:03:13.490
artist ID when we insert the album and
28

28

00:03:13.490  -->  00:03:16.250
the album ID when we insert the song so when we
29

29

00:03:16.250  -->  00:03:18.110
want to get the generated key after
30

30

00:03:18.110  -->  00:03:20.000
statement is completed we have to add
31

31

00:03:20.000  -->  00:03:21.620
another parameter to the prepared
32

32

00:03:21.620  -->  00:03:24.410
statement calls your about to see let's go
33

33

00:03:24.410  -->  00:03:25.700
ahead and actually add this now to the
34

34

00:03:25.700  -->  00:03:29.230
open method though i'm going to add it
35

35

00:03:29.230  -->  00:03:32.120
below our view that's defined here
36

36

00:03:32.120  -->  00:03:35.360
actually what we'll do is well defined a
37

37

00:03:35.360  -->  00:03:37.160
prepared statement up here first because we will
38

38

00:03:37.160  -->  00:03:40.070
need those as fields....
39

39

00:03:40.070  -->  00:03:46.670
...
40

40

00:03:46.670  -->  00:03:57.020
...
41

41

00:03:57.020  -->  00:04:03.440
....okay that's our
42

42

00:04:03.440  -->  00:04:05.510
three prepared statements for inserts
43

43

00:04:05.510  -->  00:04:07.520
let's get back to the open method again
44

44

00:04:07.520  -->  00:04:12.500
will do insert...
45

45

00:04:12.500  -->  00:04:16.280
...
46

46

00:04:16.280  -->  00:04:21.950
...
47

47

00:04:21.950  -->  00:04:25.370
but then we also have this second
48

48

00:04:25.370  -->  00:04:26.900
parameters so I mentioned that we need the
49

49

00:04:26.900  -->  00:04:28.070
second parameter
50

50

00:04:28.070  -->  00:04:29.600
and going to pass a constant
51

51

00:04:29.600  -->  00:04:35.360
here...
52

52

00:04:35.360  -->  00:04:38.480
....so once we do that will
53

53

00:04:38.480  -->  00:04:39.860
then be able to get the key from the
54

54

00:04:39.860  -->  00:04:43.250
prepared statement object then do
55

55

00:04:43.250  -->  00:04:45.950
the same for insert into albums and
56

56

00:04:45.950  -->  00:04:50.000
songs so.....
57

57

00:04:50.000  -->  00:04:51.230
....
58

58

00:04:51.230  -->  00:05:07.820
....
59

59

00:05:07.820  -->  00:05:11.390
now for this one we don't need the ids
60

60

00:05:11.390  -->  00:05:14.060
returned so for that reason I'm not
61

61

00:05:14.060  -->  00:05:15.620
going to actually pass the second
62

62

00:05:15.620  -->  00:05:17.150
parameter the returns_
63

63

00:05:17.150  -->  00:05:19.340
generated _keys because we don't
64

64

00:05:19.340  -->  00:05:20.720
need to pass those to anything else
65

65

00:05:20.720  -->  00:05:22.760
whereas the artists and the album's
66

66

00:05:22.760  -->  00:05:24.950
inserts we use the ids we get back
67

67

00:05:24.950  -->  00:05:27.140
from those to basically passed into
68

68

00:05:27.140  -->  00:05:29.750
another insert statement
69

69

00:05:29.750  -->  00:05:32.870
ok alright so now that we've opened
70

70

00:05:32.870  -->  00:05:34.550
those we need to close them as well in
71

71

00:05:34.550  -->  00:05:35.870
the close method so let's do that as
72

72

00:05:35.870  -->  00:05:42.560
well....
73

73

00:05:42.560  -->  00:05:47.210
....
74

74

00:05:47.210  -->  00:05:50.120
....
75

75

00:05:50.120  -->  00:05:52.610
...
76

76

00:05:52.610  -->  00:06:08.300
...
77

77

00:06:08.300  -->  00:06:11.630
ok so now that we've done we are going to
78

78

00:06:11.630  -->  00:06:14.060
create three methods one for each table
79

79

00:06:14.060  -->  00:06:16.970
now the methods that insert an album or
80

80

00:06:16.970  -->  00:06:19.370
artist will first check to see if the
81

81

00:06:19.370  -->  00:06:22.430
album or artist already exists and if it
82

82

00:06:22.430  -->  00:06:24.170
does already exists is going to return
83

83

00:06:24.170  -->  00:06:26.900
the underscore ID column for the album
84

84

00:06:26.900  -->  00:06:29.780
or artist but if it doesn't exist it will
85

85

00:06:29.780  -->  00:06:32.090
then add the album artist and then
86

86

00:06:32.090  -->  00:06:34.490
return the ID the new ID from that
87

87

00:06:34.490  -->  00:06:36.830
insert now these two methods will be
88

88

00:06:36.830  -->  00:06:38.810
private and that's because they should only
89

89

00:06:38.810  -->  00:06:40.280
ever really be called by the method that
90

90

00:06:40.280  -->  00:06:41.480
inserts song
91

91

00:06:41.480  -->  00:06:43.580
which will be responsible for creating
92

92

00:06:43.580  -->  00:06:45.470
the transaction and committing the
93

93

00:06:45.470  -->  00:06:48.560
changes now to achieve that the first
94

94

00:06:48.560  -->  00:06:50.120
thing we need to do is add the constants
95

95

00:06:50.120  -->  00:06:51.740
for the statements that were going to
96

96

00:06:51.740  -->  00:06:53.570
use to check whether an artist or an album
97

97

00:06:53.570  -->  00:06:56.600
already exists in a given table that
98

98

00:06:56.600  -->  00:06:57.740
will come up to our constants again
99

99

00:06:57.740  -->  00:07:02.240
...
100

100

00:07:02.240  -->  00:08:09.680
...
101

101

00:08:09.680  -->  00:08:11.660
...you can see what we're
102

102

00:08:11.660  -->  00:08:13.070
doing their the Select is going to return
103

103

00:08:13.070  -->  00:08:16.130
the ID but the where clause is doing a
104

104

00:08:16.130  -->  00:08:18.590
search by name so we get back the id
105

105

00:08:18.590  -->  00:08:20.570
that we can then use for the insertion
106

106

00:08:20.570  -->  00:08:23.480
if that already exists and again if it
107

107

00:08:23.480  -->  00:08:25.250
doesn't exist then the method we're going
108

108

00:08:25.250  -->  00:08:28.040
to return the new id after the insert so
109

109

00:08:28.040  -->  00:08:30.140
that way whether the records on file or
110

110

00:08:30.140  -->  00:08:33.530
not we're going to get the right ID and
111

111

00:08:33.530  -->  00:08:35.180
then also in the case of both of these
112

112

00:08:35.180  -->  00:08:37.520
we only need the ID returned from the
113

113

00:08:37.520  -->  00:08:39.260
Select so that's why we're only
114

114

00:08:39.260  -->  00:08:41.960
returning the relevant ID column
115

115

00:08:41.960  -->  00:08:44.690
alright so we now need a couple more of
116

116

00:08:44.690  -->  00:08:46.720
that prepared statements for these
117

117

00:08:46.720  -->  00:08:48.620
queries the query artists and the query
118

118

00:08:48.620  -->  00:08:52.190
album so lets add those....
119

119

00:08:52.190  -->  00:08:56.570
....
120

120

00:08:56.570  -->  00:09:06.110
....
121

121

00:09:06.110  -->  00:09:07.610
so we're going to create those down here in
122

122

00:09:07.610  -->  00:09:09.440
our open method so its going to be...
123

123

00:09:09.440  -->  00:09:14.870
...
124

124

00:09:14.870  -->  00:09:28.820
...
125

125

00:09:28.820  -->  00:09:35.840
...ok and scrolling down
126

126

00:09:35.840  -->  00:09:37.610
we need to also closed off both of those
127

127

00:09:37.610  -->  00:09:39.680
in the close method we're going to put
128

128

00:09:39.680  -->  00:09:43.940
...
129

129

00:09:43.940  -->  00:09:58.640
...
130

130

00:09:58.640  -->  00:10:02.060
alright so next we want to code the
131

131

00:10:02.060  -->  00:10:03.980
actual methods the insert artist method
132

132

00:10:03.980  -->  00:10:06.380
etc but let's start work on that in the
133

133

00:10:06.380  -->  00:10:11.890
next video
