00:00:04,920  -->  00:00:07,840
<v ->Now if you're having difficulty understanding me,</v>
2

2

00:00:07,840  -->  00:00:09,510
there could be two reasons for it.
3

3

00:00:09,510  -->  00:00:12,370
Firstly, I'm a geek and geeks tend to speak fast
4

4

00:00:12,370  -->  00:00:14,330
because they're excited with programming
5

5

00:00:14,330  -->  00:00:17,700
and technical things and I fall into that category.
6

6

00:00:17,700  -->  00:00:19,750
But secondly, I'm an Australian,
7

7

00:00:19,750  -->  00:00:22,400
so my accent may seem a little bit unfamiliar to you
8

8

00:00:22,400  -->  00:00:25,770
compared to the traditional US version of English,
9

9

00:00:25,770  -->  00:00:27,750
or UK, or whatever.
10

10

00:00:27,750  -->  00:00:29,650
So if you're having difficulty understanding me
11

11

00:00:29,650  -->  00:00:33,242
for whatever reason, I suggest you turn subtitles on.
12

12

00:00:33,242  -->  00:00:36,020
Now this is process you follow to turn on subtitles.
13

13

00:00:36,020  -->  00:00:37,540
You come down here on the screen.
14

14

00:00:37,540  -->  00:00:39,770
You've got a choice of languages
15

15

00:00:39,770  -->  00:00:41,310
and click on the relevant language.
16

16

00:00:41,310  -->  00:00:43,460
And from then on after you've done that,
17

17

00:00:43,460  -->  00:00:45,110
all the videos that are playing
18

18

00:00:45,110  -->  00:00:48,300
will show as a subtitle at the bottom of the screen.
19

19

00:00:48,300  -->  00:00:49,410
Now the thing to remember is
20

20

00:00:49,410  -->  00:00:51,640
that there's two types of subtitles.
21

21

00:00:51,640  -->  00:00:55,420
There's hand created or hand edited subtitles
22

22

00:00:55,420  -->  00:00:58,250
and there's machine-generated subtitles.
23

23

00:00:58,250  -->  00:01:03,120
Now this course has got hand-edited, English-only subtitles.
24

24

00:01:03,120  -->  00:01:05,770
So what that means is I've gone through each video,
25

25

00:01:05,770  -->  00:01:07,890
and that's 77 hours worth of videos
26

26

00:01:07,890  -->  00:01:10,610
and I've hand-edited all the subtitles
27

27

00:01:10,610  -->  00:01:13,380
to make them as accurate as possible.
28

28

00:01:13,380  -->  00:01:14,820
Because perhaps if you've looked at
29

29

00:01:14,820  -->  00:01:16,450
some other courses on Udemy,
30

30

00:01:16,450  -->  00:01:18,620
you've probably or possibly seen
31

31

00:01:18,620  -->  00:01:20,210
that the subtitles can be pretty bad.
32

32

00:01:20,210  -->  00:01:21,530
In other words, the computer
33

33

00:01:21,530  -->  00:01:23,200
because they're machine-generated,
34

34

00:01:23,200  -->  00:01:25,483
the computer's interpreted these,
35

35

00:01:26,370  -->  00:01:27,440
basically the subtitles,
36

36

00:01:27,440  -->  00:01:28,273
just listened to the audio
37

37

00:01:28,273  -->  00:01:30,620
and figured out what it thought was the best words,
38

38

00:01:30,620  -->  00:01:32,700
and often it gets it wrong.
39

39

00:01:32,700  -->  00:01:35,110
So for that reason, for the English subtitles,
40

40

00:01:35,110  -->  00:01:39,550
I hand-edited them to make them as accurate as possible.
41

41

00:01:39,550  -->  00:01:41,540
Now that's not say you won't find some problems.
42

42

00:01:41,540  -->  00:01:43,550
There probably are some areas there still.
43

43

00:01:43,550  -->  00:01:45,300
But anytime a student reports to me
44

44

00:01:45,300  -->  00:01:47,720
that there's something wrong with a subtitle,
45

45

00:01:47,720  -->  00:01:49,090
I usually get it fixed the same day.
46

46

00:01:49,090  -->  00:01:51,140
So if you find a problem with a subtitle,
47

47

00:01:51,140  -->  00:01:53,190
an English subtitle file,
48

48

00:01:53,190  -->  00:01:55,640
let me know the video and the time where it comes up
49

49

00:01:55,640  -->  00:01:57,270
and I'll get that fixed.
50

50

00:01:57,270  -->  00:01:58,740
Now unfortunately for the other
51

51

00:01:58,740  -->  00:02:00,890
languages other than English,
52

52

00:02:00,890  -->  00:02:02,290
they are machine-generated.
53

53

00:02:02,290  -->  00:02:03,660
So the quality won't be anywhere near
54

54

00:02:03,660  -->  00:02:05,590
as high as the English ones.
55

55

00:02:05,590  -->  00:02:07,360
And in case you're wondering,
56

56

00:02:07,360  -->  00:02:12,360
it's extremely expensive to get subtitles created by people,
57

57

00:02:12,560  -->  00:02:14,960
particularly in another programming,
58

58

00:02:14,960  -->  00:02:15,820
oh, sorry, programming,
59

59

00:02:15,820  -->  00:02:16,920
I meant in another language,
60

60

00:02:16,920  -->  00:02:18,910
another real, spoken language.
61

61

00:02:18,910  -->  00:02:21,520
So French for example, I would need to find someone
62

62

00:02:21,520  -->  00:02:24,100
who knows English well and French well
63

63

00:02:24,100  -->  00:02:27,200
and get them to go through each subtitle
64

64

00:02:27,200  -->  00:02:28,740
and it's very, very expensive.
65

65

00:02:28,740  -->  00:02:31,980
So I haven't able to do that for the other languages
66

66

00:02:31,980  -->  00:02:32,813
other than English.
67

67

00:02:32,813  -->  00:02:35,330
So you'll still have machine-generated languages
68

68

00:02:35,330  -->  00:02:37,830
in other languages which is better than nothing.
69

69

00:02:37,830  -->  00:02:39,100
But again, for the English ones,
70

70

00:02:39,100  -->  00:02:40,270
they're hand-edited.
71

71

00:02:40,270  -->  00:02:41,880
Turn those on is my best advice
72

72

00:02:41,880  -->  00:02:43,820
to make sure you get the optimal experience
73

73

00:02:43,820  -->  00:02:45,870
and you're understanding what I'm saying.
