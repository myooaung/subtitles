00:00:05.450  -->  00:00:10.030
so continuing on we saw previously
we can change the color of the text by
2

2

00:00:10.030  -->  00:00:13.340
setting the text field property I'm
talking about the label here starting on
3

3

00:00:13.340  -->  00:00:19.390
line 17 and we can also set the font
by setting this font property so you may want
4

4

00:00:19.390  -->  00:00:23.300
to change the color because we want to
display errors in red or you know we want
5

5

00:00:23.300  -->  00:00:27.050
all text to be certain color because
when using particular color scheme or
6

6

00:00:27.050  -->  00:00:31.620
theme for example for our application
now like sea colors or nature colors
7

7

00:00:31.620  -->  00:00:36.530
so what we gonna do is we are gonna set the
labels color to blue and the font to
8

8

00:00:36.530  -->  00:00:40.150
Times New Roman size twelve italic and
we will run the application and
9

9

00:00:40.150  -->  00:00:42.370
see the changes I wanna come up here
10

10

00:00:42.370  -->  00:00:49.120
on line 17 and I'm going to add the text field so....
11

11

00:00:49.120  -->  00:00:55.280
and we also want to assign a font as well to do that we can actually put
12

12

00:00:55.280  -->  00:01:08.260
that in here..... again cases is important here will just allow
13

13

00:01:08.260  -->  00:01:17.560
the import and we're gonna call it...
14

14

00:01:17.560  -->  00:01:29.030
...and we run it....so that's good
but sometimes when we're doing this we
15

15

00:01:29.030  -->  00:01:32.780
might want the text to wrap so there may
not be enough room for example for the
16

16

00:01:32.780  -->  00:01:37.340
text to display in one line because
of the user interface layout or perhaps
17

17

00:01:37.340  -->  00:01:40.710
it could be important that the full-text
remain visible when the user makes a
18

18

00:01:40.710  -->  00:01:46.960
window smaller now by default label text doesn't
wrap but if we want to wrap we set the wrap text
19

19

00:01:46.960  -->  00:01:51.730
property to true but before you try this out we are gonna make our label text longer and change
20

20

00:01:51.730  -->  00:01:56.500
font size to 40 just to confirm the
functionality normally happens so we
21

21

00:01:56.500  -->  00:01:59.500
are gonna make the label longer
22

22

00:02:00.410  -->  00:02:14.420
that should be enough and we change the font size
to what was 12 to 40 and run that clearly that's now
23

23

00:02:14.420  -->  00:02:19.860
not fitting its actually
cut off towards the end just towards the last
24

24

00:02:19.860  -->  00:02:28.110
word label there so now if we change this
to wrap the text come back up here text blue after
25

25

00:02:28.110  -->  00:02:38.140
the text is blue we're going to add......and if we run that we
26

26

00:02:38.140  -->  00:02:43.210
should see that the texts is now going to
wrap for us this is a label this is a lablel this is a
27

27

00:02:43.210  -->  00:02:48.310
label you can see now its wrap through rather
than being cut off and notice how that is changing
28

28

00:02:48.310  -->  00:02:53.290
automatically as we make the window larger
and smaller it will automatically resizes
29

29

00:02:53.290  -->  00:03:00.340
the label to fit now before we move on
let's remove the strenuous text and set
30

30

00:03:00.340  -->  00:03:03.420
our font size back to 12 so I'm going to do that
31

31

00:03:03.420  -->  00:03:10.120
so we got the single their and change the font to 12 again but
we can leave the wrapped text
32

32

00:03:10.120  -->  00:03:15.050
properly their for now so next we are gonna
look at the radio button control now a
33

33

00:03:15.050  -->  00:03:18.950
radio button can be selected or
deselected we normally don't use a
34

34

00:03:18.950  -->  00:03:23.010
single radio button control alone when
we want the user to choose only one of
35

35

00:03:23.010  -->  00:03:23.950
several options
36

36

00:03:23.950  -->  00:03:28.200
we group radio button controls together so that
when the user selects one radio button
37

37

00:03:28.200  -->  00:03:33.210
the others are automatically de selected
now this type of control is called a
38

38

00:03:33.210  -->  00:03:38.260
radio button because all radios used to have a
set of preset stations and we actually
39

39

00:03:38.260  -->  00:03:41.770
select the station by pressing the
button corresponding to that station
40

40

00:03:41.770  -->  00:03:46.340
now radio can only be tuned into one
station at a time so only one of the
41

41

00:03:46.340  -->  00:03:50.450
radio buttons could be in a pressed
position at the time so in a similar
42

42

00:03:50.450  -->  00:03:54.730
fashion only one radio button in a group can
be selected at a time so that's really
43

43

00:03:54.730  -->  00:03:58.730
the functionality behind the radio button so
let's go ahead and start work on that by
44

44

00:03:58.730  -->  00:04:05.400
adding a radio button to our grid pane so
come down to the end of the label and add
45

45

00:04:05.400  -->  00:04:08.340
a radio button so...
46

46

00:04:08.340  -->  00:04:16.650
.....
47

47

00:04:16.650  -->  00:04:27.090
...now again one radio buttons is not very
48

48

00:04:27.090  -->  00:04:30.930
interesting and we know we've
really used one alone so let's add two
49

49

00:04:30.930  -->  00:04:36.230
more the same row right after the red one
will actually set the radio button text to blue and
50

50

00:04:36.230  -->  00:04:36.720
set the
51

51

00:04:36.720  -->  00:04:47.080
text for the third button to green lets add those......so they are all gonna be on row index 0 but the column
52

52

00:04:47.080  -->  00:04:52.040
we're gonna put 3 and 4 for the second and
third radio buttons and the texts is going to be
53

53

00:04:52.040  -->  00:04:54.470
blue and green
54

54

00:04:54.470  -->  00:04:57.760
respectively
55

55

00:04:57.760  -->  00:05:05.410
so lets just run so theirs our three radio buttons and at the
moment we can click them and you can see
56

56

00:05:05.410  -->  00:05:09.800
that their all clickable the aren't being deselected based on a click from
57

57

00:05:09.800  -->  00:05:13.270
another button they can just be
selected on or selected off so in other
58

58

00:05:13.270  -->  00:05:16.740
words they're all operating
independently and not how we would normally
59

59

00:05:16.740  -->  00:05:21.050
want it to operate where you click one and the
others were automatically de-selected and
60

60

00:05:21.050  -->  00:05:25.220
that's because the purpose of a radio
button is usually to give the user a
61

61

00:05:25.220  -->  00:05:28.590
number of choices but to allow them to select one option that's really why we're
62

62

00:05:28.590  -->  00:05:33.010
using a radio button now to get the
behavior we want then what we need to do
63

63

00:05:33.010  -->  00:05:37.200
is we need to group the radio buttons
together will add them to what's called a toggle
64

64

00:05:37.200  -->  00:05:42.500
group now the radio button class descends
from the toggle button class the toggle
65

65

00:05:42.500  -->  00:05:46.340
buttons can be added to a toggle group
but right now radio button is the only
66

66

00:05:46.340  -->  00:05:49.590
control that extends from toggle button but
who knows there might be more in the
67

67

00:05:49.590  -->  00:05:53.840
future when oracle release them the
toggle group class doesn't descend
68

68

00:05:53.840  -->  00:05:58.300
from node and therefore can't br added to a
scene graph as such because of that we
69

69

00:05:58.300  -->  00:06:02.720
have to use the fx define element
in the fxml to use this toggle
70

70

00:06:02.720  -->  00:06:03.570
group
71

71

00:06:03.570  -->  00:06:07.670
and we use fx define when we need to add something in
the fxml that isn't part of
72

72

00:06:07.670  -->  00:06:11.970
the scene graph lets go ahead and actually
type some code in will assign and ID to it
73

73

00:06:11.970  -->  00:06:15.800
as well and then we'll see how this
works and see how we actually add the
74

74

00:06:15.800  -->  00:06:18.090
radio buttons to our toggle group
75

75

00:06:18.090  -->  00:06:31.070
close down the program and the run window
and above the radio buttons I'm gonna add....
76

76

00:06:31.070  -->  00:06:38.470
....
77

77

00:06:38.470  -->  00:06:50.500
....and the reason
78

78

00:06:50.500  -->  00:06:54.880
we are using an ID will become apparent shortly because
we're going to be assigning that to the radio
79

79

00:06:54.880  -->  00:07:02.600
button so lets go ahead and do that now.....so to use that toggle group and to basically linked
80

80

00:07:02.600  -->  00:07:05.150
the radio buttons together we type....
81

81

00:07:05.150  -->  00:07:12.740
...and notice when I typed that IntelliJ automatically finds
82

82

00:07:12.740  -->  00:07:17.840
the definition that we defined on
line 33 we'll do the same for the others
83

83

00:07:17.840  -->  00:07:28.680
....
84

84

00:07:28.680  -->  00:07:34.330
...and just to be clear when
we're actually referring to an fx ID
85

85

00:07:34.330  -->  00:07:38.660
value for something we've defined
here we put a dollar in front of it and
86

86

00:07:38.660  -->  00:07:45.830
that tells IntelliJ to look for an fx definition with the ID of whatever we typed after the
87

87

00:07:45.830  -->  00:07:51.320
dollar sign so just to be clear the fx define element we need to add that because
88

88

00:07:51.320  -->  00:07:55.990
the toggle group doesn't descend from
node and can't be added directly to the
89

89

00:07:55.990  -->  00:08:00.510
scene graph so this is the way of getting that
functionality to work so if we run
90

90

00:08:00.510  -->  00:08:05.850
this now you should find that now only
one button can be clicked and when we do
91

91

00:08:05.850  -->  00:08:10.190
that the others are automatically  deselected so
you click on Red notice how red got
92

92

00:08:10.190  -->  00:08:15.070
deselected and likewise for green because they are all part of the
group only one can be selected at a time
93

93

00:08:15.070  -->  00:08:18.230
and when we click on one the other 2 are automatically deselected
94

94

00:08:19.290  -->  00:08:24.340
that's cool that's working now typically
when we display a group of radio buttons
95

95

00:08:24.340  -->  00:08:28.730
we want one radio button to be
automatically selected in the defaults
96

96

00:08:28.730  -->  00:08:32.600
selection in other words so to make our
radio button for blue our default
97

97

00:08:32.600  -->  00:08:37.790
selection we need to select or need to
set the selected property to true so
98

98

00:08:37.790  -->  00:08:42.790
let's do that for blue and to do that to
make that the default one we put...
99

99

00:08:42.790  -->  00:08:48.520
selected that is the property equals true and
that make sure that's one gonna be selected by
100

100

00:08:48.520  -->  00:08:52.090
default so keep in mind when you use a
selected properly you don't need to set
101

101

00:08:52.090  -->  00:08:55.500
the other ones to false the toggle
groups smart enough to know that if one
102

102

00:08:55.500  -->  00:09:00.410
button is selected then the others aren't
selected and so consequently just select
103

103

00:09:00.410  -->  00:09:03.430
the one that you want true and that all went nicely so if you run that
104

104

00:09:06.760  -->  00:09:12.900
you can see now that blue was automatically selected when we first
started and the processing still works as
105

105

00:09:12.900  -->  00:09:18.310
it did before and that one is being deselected if we click on another one so
106

106

00:09:18.310  -->  00:09:22.980
that's good so all working nicely so let's go ahead
now and add a checkbox before we
107

107

00:09:22.980  -->  00:09:27.840
finished the video so using a check box when
there's only two choices or state for
108

108

00:09:27.840  -->  00:09:31.710
example sometimes when we buy something
online were asked if we'd also like to
109

109

00:09:31.710  -->  00:09:36.170
subscribe to newsletter we can subscribe
by clicking the box if we don't want to
110

110

00:09:36.170  -->  00:09:40.750
subscribe then we leave the box unchecked so let's
add a checkbox to our grid to see this in
111

111

00:09:40.750  -->  00:09:45.810
action so we are gonna add the check box to the fourth
column of our row so close the run window again
112

112

00:09:45.810  -->  00:09:55.940
come down here after the radio buttons
and do....
113

113

00:10:02.300  -->  00:10:05.970
.....
114

114

00:10:05.970  -->  00:10:20.120
...ok so if you run if you click that you can see
115

115

00:10:20.120  -->  00:10:22.760
that its selected and the tick box
comes on when tick it again it
116

116

00:10:22.760  -->  00:10:26.500
turns if off so its on off on off now the
JavaFX control
117

117

00:10:27.220  -->  00:10:31.200
actually allows for three states but you
have to turn on the third state because it's
118

118

00:10:31.200  -->  00:10:35.960
off by default now this third state is known as
the indeterminate state now when the
119

119

00:10:35.960  -->  00:10:39.620
indeterminate state has turned on the
check box will initially contained a
120

120

00:10:39.620  -->  00:10:43.470
dash and once the user click the
checkbox there isn't a way to get the dash
121

121

00:10:43.470  -->  00:10:47.630
back by clicking the control so let's
turn this state on by adding the
122

122

00:10:47.630  -->  00:10:56.650
indeterminate property into a check box
and setting it to true come down here and we'll
123

123

00:10:56.650  -->  00:11:00.760
put......
124

124

00:11:03.400  -->  00:11:14.060
and if we run this you can see we got the little dash now basically once you click it its on or off at that point so I can't
125

125

00:11:14.060  -->  00:11:17.300
actually think of our real practical use
for this and it's really not what users
126

126

00:11:17.300  -->  00:11:21.230
expect from a check box so I would you
normally suggest you leave this turned
127

127

00:11:21.230  -->  00:11:24.810
off but just wanted to show this to you to let you know that
128

128

00:11:24.810  -->  00:11:28.180
it does exist if for some reason or you
can think of a reason to actually use it
129

129

00:11:28.740  -->  00:11:33.980
ok so now sometimes we need a
single check box but other times we
130

130

00:11:33.980  -->  00:11:37.760
might want to use checkboxes instead of
radio buttons so a group of radio buttons
131

131

00:11:37.760  -->  00:11:42.640
allows a user to select one choice from
several options which we saw what now what if we
132

132

00:11:42.640  -->  00:11:45.900
wanted to use it to be able to select
more than one choice then there's
133

133

00:11:45.900  -->  00:11:49.880
usually there's a few ways to do this
but one common way is to use checkboxes
134

134

00:11:49.880  -->  00:11:54.370
instead of radio buttons now we can't
group check boxes together under a
135

135

00:11:54.370  -->  00:11:57.980
toggle group because checkbox doesn't
descend from the toggle button class
136

136

00:11:57.980  -->  00:12:02.260
but what we can do is group the check box together visually just as we did with
137

137

00:12:02.260  -->  00:12:06.900
the radio buttons so let's place a
checkbox into a vbox and add 2 more
138

138

00:12:06.900  -->  00:12:13.260
check boxes too it so we go up here and add a v box and add a bit of space so we can see what we are
139

139

00:12:13.260  -->  00:12:28.650
doing so add a v box.....actually what I didn't do either just out of interest I didn't assign the row index so just to show you what I
140

140

00:12:28.650  -->  00:12:34.940
probably should have done I should have defined that row index 0 and obviously I
141

141

00:12:34.940  -->  00:12:37.940
I didn't do that I only assign the pane that's pretty bad
coding on my part so if we run that again
142

142

00:12:42.280  -->  00:12:59.510
and we got an error their and of course I type row index twice so its meant to be column index ok that's what I was trying to do run it again
143

143

00:13:03.700  -->  00:13:06.190
clearly we put that in the wrong
elements that should have been in the next
144

144

00:13:06.190  -->  00:13:10.210
one along and that should all along be
in the next one so I'm going to add that
145

145

00:13:10.210  -->  00:13:25.300
....so that's what I've been trying to do it along and obviously I set it on the wrong one and I didn't set the row properties so consequently skipped it to the next line that's what I've been trying to do all along but
146

146

00:13:25.300  -->  00:13:28.680
obviously it still works like it did
before and indeterminate initially then
147

147

00:13:28.680  -->  00:13:30.250
check box either on or off
148

148

00:13:30.250  -->  00:13:36.020
ok so getting back to where I was doing
before I want to change this now and put the
149

149

00:13:36.020  -->  00:13:45.890
checkboxes in to a v box so type....
150

150

00:13:49.410  -->  00:14:20.410
....
151

151

00:14:20.410  -->  00:14:25.070
...and if we run this now
152

152

00:14:28.180  -->  00:14:32.370
we got three selections in their now because it's
a vertical a v box its going from
153

153

00:14:32.370  -->  00:14:37.530
top to bottom and click on and we can select more
than one option at the same time so quite
154

154

00:14:37.530  -->  00:14:43.110
happily so I mention that radio buttons decent from the toggle button class so
155

155

00:14:43.110  -->  00:14:47.580
toggle button is a JavaFX control in its
own right and toggle buttons looks like a
156

156

00:14:47.580  -->  00:14:51.820
regular button but when we pressed it stays down when we press it again it pops back up
157

157

00:14:52.720  -->  00:14:57.820
so lets add one to our grid quickly to see how that
works before ending the video so close this
158

158

00:14:57.820  -->  00:15:00.470
down
159

159

00:15:00.470  -->  00:15:04.450
...and the way we do that is we do.....
160

160

00:15:06.120  -->  00:15:18.090
....
161

161

00:15:18.090  -->  00:15:33.880
...and if we run that you notice when I
162

162

00:15:33.880  -->  00:15:39.000
tick it that's now down click it again and it
comes up so down and up again so its basically a
163

163

00:15:39.000  -->  00:15:44.460
toggle on or off in a sense of
being press and not pressed and to add more
164

164

00:15:44.460  -->  00:15:48.740
toggle buttons well we can do something
similar to the v box we can use h box for that so
165

165

00:15:48.740  -->  00:15:54.570
we could do...
166

166

00:15:55.170  -->  00:16:03.560
...and let's put it on the same rows as we currently had it so....
167

167

00:16:03.560  -->  00:16:16.860
.....
168

168

00:16:22.760  -->  00:16:38.880
...ok so if we run that now you can press all 3 toggle buttons as you can see their and they all remain selected and if we only one toggle button to be
169

169

00:16:38.880  -->  00:16:43.580
selected a time then would put them in a
toggle group like we did earlier up for
170

170

00:16:43.580  -->  00:16:46.620
the radio buttons and that would enable only one to be selected at a time
171

171

00:16:46.620  -->  00:16:50.470
so I'm gonna end this video here now and the
next video we are gonna move on and start
172

172

00:16:50.470  -->  00:16:55.680
looking at the text field control which
is a controlled to allow users to type
173

173

00:16:55.680  -->  00:17:00.800
information into from their
keyboard that we can  then process so see you
174

174

00:17:00.800  -->  00:17:01.240
in the next video
