0
1
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:05,380
All right.
1

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:10,970
So in the last video we created our first project and created our first Java class called Hello.
2

3
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:15,520
Let's now add a method to this new class to print out our hello world message.
3

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,150
Right so firstly what is a method.
4

5
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:21,900
Well it's a collection of statements one or more that perform an operation.
5

6
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:27,210
We'll be using here a special method called the main method that Java looks for when running a program.
6

7
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,870
It's the entry point for any Java code.
7

8
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:35,000
So in other words Java looks for that specific method and is able to start and run the program when
8

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,530
we use it.
9

10
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,150
You see how to do that.
10

11
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:39,990
Now you can create your own methods as you see later as well as this one.
11

12
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,150
But for now let's create this special main method.
12

13
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:48,060
So the way to do that was going to come up into our class on line two.
13

14
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,140
And I'm going to tab over and I'm just going to press Enter there. Notice that
14

15
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,570
Well you see when I start typing that IntelliJ is going to start giving us some hints there.
15

16
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:03,860
So I'm gonna start by typing public static and as I type "st" of the word static and IntelliJ suggesting
16

17
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:06,350
the word static it's going to press enter there.
17

18
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:11,100
So anytime you see something that you want IntelliJ to fill in for you just press enter right continue
18

19
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,260
gonna type
19

20
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:16,490
Now I typed "v" there because I need the word void and notice that IntelliJ is automatically
20

21
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:20,500
suggested that as well. I'm gonna press enter there. Next I'm going to type main.
21

22
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,680
I'm going to put a left to right parentheses in fact I typed the left parentheses and IntelliJ 
22

23
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:26,610
being ever helpful.
23

24
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,850
added the right parentheses for us.
24

25
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:32,830
I'm going to type in there string for the capital s case is very important.
25

26
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:38,990
when you're programming left to right square braces and the word args then I'm going to come over and add
26

27
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,910
a left curly brace and a right curly brace as you saw me do there.
27

28
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,580
All right so what have we done there.
28

29
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:49,510
Well firstly looking at this statement public was the access modifier we discussed when defining the
29

30
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,000
class in the last video.
30

31
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,690
It's the same principle here.
31

32
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:58,810
Static is a Java keyword that needs an understanding of other concepts to really be explained adequately.
32

33
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:04,030
So for now just know that we need to have a static for Java to find this special method to run the code
33

34
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:09,640
that we're going to be adding. Now void is yet another Java keyword used to indicate that the method
34

35
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,510
won't return any information.
35

36
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,960
But we're talking again more about that later.
36

37
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:18,350
And just a tip here that you might be perhaps thinking well why can't I learn all these things now.
37

38
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:24,160
But there is a specific order to learning Java and it pays to learn things in the right order so that
38

39
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,410
things don't get too overwhelming.
39

40
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:30,520
Rest assured that we'll be coming in to all these things in a lot of detail at the relevant point in
40

41
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,970
the course.
41

42
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:37,570
So moving on we've got the left to right parentheses that I talked about and that is needed for
42

43
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:41,050
a method declaration and that's what we're doing here by typing in this code.
43

44
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,000
We defining a method.
44

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,790
So the left the right parentheses are mandatory but they can optionally include one or more parameters
45

46
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,090
and parameters are a way to pass information to a method.
46

47
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,480
Now more on that again later.
47

48
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,670
Have said that a few times now.
48

49
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,730
But bear with me.
49

50
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:01,720
All right so here you can say there's been one parameter has been defined and we'll talk more about
50

51
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,530
what that means a little bit later.
51

52
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:09,790
For now though to enable Java to define the main method it has to be typed exactly like it's typed here.
52

53
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:15,120
So if you typed something different like for example if you used a capital P let's try to write when
53

54
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:20,830
we do that we suddenly get it highlighted in red and that's IntelliJ telling us that I cannot understand
54

55
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:25,690
the word public with a capital P but I'll change it back to where it was which one was a lowercase
55

56
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:26,440
P.
56

57
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:29,040
It's then quite happy and the error disappears.
57

58
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:34,420
So keep that in mind that often you'll find errors can be purely relating to you typing something in uppercase
58

59
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,250
or lowercase when it should have been the opposite.
59

60
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:37,560
All right.
60

61
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:39,010
So at the moment now we've got a method.
61

62
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:42,720
So let's try running it and we can run it a few ways in IntelliJ.
62

63
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:47,360
At the moment we haven't got an option up here to run it in the top right hand corner to the right of
63

64
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,120
where it says Add configuration that run button is disabled for now but you'll find once we run it for
64

65
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,630
the first time that when we run it for the first time that'll be enabled.
65

66
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:58,570
But over here we can click on these little buttons here to run it.
66

67
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:03,880
We can also right click in there and select run as well you can see there's a keyboard shortcut to do
67

68
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,020
the same thing.
68

69
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:12,180
I'm just gonna click over here to run our program some run Hello mine you can see down the bottom something's
69

70
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,010
happening.
70

71
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:17,610
What's actually happening is that IntelliJ via the Java developing kit is compiling the Java program
71

72
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,570
and you could say we got a little bit of that portend the bottom of the screen and what I've said is
72

73
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:28,200
a bit of output the first line there is the line the command that IntelliJ sent to Java to execute
73

74
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,880
our program and below that we've got this process finished with exit code zero.
74

75
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,860
And what that essentially means is everything is completed successfully zero as you often used to indicate
75

76
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,000
that there wasn't a problem.
76

77
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,930
And the reason we haven't had any other output our Hello World message for argument's sake we haven't
77

78
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,060
got that because of course we haven't typed the coding yet.
78

79
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:50,190
If you have a look at the main method declaration again there on line 3.
79

80
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:54,360
Notice that the left or right curly braces didn't talk about what they were.
80

81
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,410
They're actually a code block.
81

82
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:02,010
Now the code block is defined or was used to define the start and end of a method effectively and we
82

83
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:05,670
can put our code in between those in the form statements.
83

84
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:08,350
So at the start just to recap on that we've got our class.
84

85
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:13,950
A class has got the body block of code which is the left Kelly Price and the right Kelly Price of the
85

86
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:14,900
entire class.
86

87
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,850
And our method is effectively within that class.
87

88
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:23,640
And it's got its own code block which is a group of code statements if you will that we'll be defining
88

89
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,830
and that are unique to that specific method.
89

90
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,080
All right.
90

91
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:30,990
So let's continue on now the next thing we want to do is we want to print out a message and to do that
91

92
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:35,520
when you come back to this class and I'm just pressing tap and I'm kind of tab so it's indented like
92

93
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:42,970
that and I'm going to type system the capital S the period out period printing and noting that intelligence
93

94
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:47,880
hopefully helping us along the way and putting in and typing in the left parentheses double quite character
94

95
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:49,620
write to top Hallowell.
95

96
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:55,950
And notice that when I've done that we've got the right parentheses and double quotes were added automatically
96

97
00:05:56,010 --> 00:06:00,560
by intelligence for us and it was going to go over to the right hand side and put a semicolon and a
97

98
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:03,240
semicolon closes off the line to make it valid.
98

99
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,920
Notice if I get rid of that I can immediately get an error to the right hand side of that little indication
99

100
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,710
to say that's an error put a semicolon again.
100

101
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,460
And the error disappears.
101

102
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:11,910
All right.
102

103
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,090
So what we've done there is we've added a statement.
103

104
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:15,960
So what is the statement.
104

105
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,720
Well that's a complete command to be executed.
105

106
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:24,840
It can include one or more expressions and we'll be talking about expressions and a related topic operators
106

107
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:30,420
later in the course for now that what we've typed in is a command to basically call a method that comes
107

108
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:36,020
as part of Java code print line and we sent out the information of in this case the text hello world.
108

109
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,300
And it should print that out on the screen for us.
109

110
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:43,200
So let's actually try running that see that it works and notice now that up here the green arrow is
110

111
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,460
now enabled because we've run our code for the first time so I can click up there I can come over here
111

112
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:52,980
either way to run our program or I can right click in the main method when I say in the main method
112

113
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:57,720
making sure my cursors within there and select run of those ways or did the same thing and looking at
113

114
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:03,480
the airport paint on the bottom you can see now we've got Hollow World showing on the screen.
114

115
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:03,720
All right.
115

116
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,670
So at this point we've actually managed to do something we've actually printed up the words hello world.
116

117
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,060
Let's send the video here and then the next one.
117

118
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,560
I've got a challenge for you to get you to try making a little bit of a change in this program to print
118

119
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,990
something out so let's talk about that in the next video.
