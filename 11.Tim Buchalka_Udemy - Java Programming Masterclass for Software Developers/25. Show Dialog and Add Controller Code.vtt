00:00:05.350  -->  00:00:09.870
ok so now that we've actually loaded and
assign the dialogue pane or at least written
2

2

00:00:09.870  -->  00:00:13.610
the code to do so we now need to add our
buttons to the dialogue or more
3

3

00:00:13.610  -->  00:00:17.990
accurately to the dialogue pane and we
want our dialogue to have an OK and add a Cancel
4

4

00:00:17.990  -->  00:00:22.800
button and JavaFX provides a way for us
to specify those buttons
5

5

00:00:22.800  -->  00:00:26.410
and interestingly enough we can also create
custom buttons but we won't do that here
6

6

00:00:26.410  -->  00:00:31.100
so to add ok and cancel buttons what we need to do is create instances of the button type
7

7

00:00:31.100  -->  00:00:35.520
class and the button type constructor as you see
accepts the text we want on the button
8

8

00:00:35.520  -->  00:00:41.370
and button type so lets just go ahead and add this
so this is going to be after the try in here
9

9

00:00:41.370  -->  00:00:52.810
we are gonna put...
10

10

00:00:52.810  -->  00:01:07.400
....
11

11

00:01:07.400  -->  00:01:14.960
...so at this point
12

12

00:01:14.960  -->  00:01:19.590
we are ready to show our dialogue now theirs two
methods that we could use here to show
13

13

00:01:19.590  -->  00:01:24.280
it we could use show as the method or
show and wait and the difference
14

14

00:01:24.280  -->  00:01:27.850
between them is that show and wait will
bring up a blocking dialogue and show
15

15

00:01:27.850  -->  00:01:32.090
will bring up a non-blocking dialogue so
what does this actually mean well the
16

16

00:01:32.090  -->  00:01:35.820
show method will return immediately
after showing the dialogue in other
17

17

00:01:35.820  -->  00:01:40.070
words it won't wait for the user to press
the OK and Cancel buttons so we have to
18

18

00:01:40.070  -->  00:01:44.020
write code that would occasionally pull
the dialogue for a result and thinking
19

19

00:01:44.020  -->  00:01:47.810
about this its really not what we want to do
here we want to show the dialogue and then we
20

20

00:01:47.810  -->  00:01:48.960
want our event handler
21

21

00:01:48.960  -->  00:01:54.000
to be suspended while the user interacts
with the dialogue and when the user's finished
22

22

00:01:54.000  -->  00:01:57.770
our event handler will received the result of
the dialogue and then resumed executing
23

23

00:01:57.770  -->  00:02:03.100
and results of this will be which button will
the user pressed so as a result we
24

24

00:02:03.100  -->  00:02:06.010
want to use the show and wait method and
that's generally what you want to use
25

25

00:02:06.010  -->  00:02:10.800
with dialogue boxers so interested in which
button the user pressed because if they
26

26

00:02:10.800  -->  00:02:14.090
pressed ok and of course we add the to do
item they entered in
27

27

00:02:14.090  -->  00:02:18.440
the actual dialogue itself but if they press
cancel we don't do any adding at all so we
28

28

00:02:18.440  -->  00:02:22.110
don't do anything so for now we're just gonna
print out which button they pressed so that
29

29

00:02:22.110  -->  00:02:26.430
we can see if our code is working up until
this point so lets go and do that so
30

30

00:02:26.430  -->  00:02:37.960
after this ok and cancel we type....
31

31

00:02:38.940  -->  00:02:49.190
....
32

32

00:02:49.190  -->  00:03:05.670
...
33

33

00:03:05.670  -->  00:03:09.110
....
34

34

00:03:09.110  -->  00:03:26.250
....so lets run that so click on
35

35

00:03:26.250  -->  00:03:31.410
file and click on new and nothing
happens so why is that nothing happened
36

36

00:03:31.410  -->  00:03:34.890
well we have one more step what we haven't done
anything we haven't associated
37

37

00:03:34.890  -->  00:03:39.370
the event handler with the menu item we need to
go back to our main windows FXML and
38

38

00:03:39.370  -->  00:03:44.330
do that so we're telling it which code
to execute when we click on the new button
39

39

00:03:44.330  -->  00:03:53.050
in this case so closed it down and go back to our main window FXML and where we defined our menu items
40

40

00:03:53.050  -->  00:03:57.840
you can see that we got this new item here on line 18...we need to add
41

41

00:03:57.840  -->  00:04:05.430
something extra we put....
42

42

00:04:05.430  -->  00:04:09.920
...so we are telling it what
method to invoke if they select
43

43

00:04:09.920  -->  00:04:19.550
that option so now if we run it this time we click on file and new we get an error that means I've made a
44

44

00:04:19.550  -->  00:04:22.870
mistake somewhere so let's just check that
out so go back and see where the error was
45

45

00:04:22.870  -->  00:04:29.630
and the error is actually down here that
show new item dialogue controller
46

46

00:04:29.630  -->  00:04:33.750
on line 59 so if we just have a look
at that we are getting a problem with main border
47

47

00:04:33.750  -->  00:04:39.640
pane and just go back and make sure that we specified it ok in the FXML
48

48

00:04:41.810  -->  00:04:45.830
...and you can see what I've done there I've actually many top main border pain which was a
49

49

00:04:45.830  -->  00:04:48.380
pain in did so that should be pane
50

50

00:04:48.380  -->  00:04:52.620
we didn't really pay much attention to
that did I because when I type pain
51

51

00:04:52.620  -->  00:04:57.600
you can see it was basically in a different
color and you can't see a dramatic
52

52

00:04:57.600  -->  00:05:00.690
difference but if we hover over it we can see that theirs a warning
53

53

00:05:00.690  -->  00:05:06.400
unresolved reference so I should have actually
checked that so....should fix that the
54

54

00:05:06.400  -->  00:05:12.120
warnings is gone and if we go back to our controller.java that's now highlighted
55

55

00:05:12.120  -->  00:05:13.790
that was in gray before so if we run
56

56

00:05:13.790  -->  00:05:15.330
this again we should find that it
57

57

00:05:15.330  -->  00:05:22.510
will work now for us hopefully so we click on file new and this time we got a dialog box
58

58

00:05:22.510  -->  00:05:28.860
that's good we got our dialogue showing and if I click ok we get the message their ok was
59

59

00:05:28.860  -->  00:05:36.100
pressed file new cancel pressed and
interestingly enough if we just open
60

60

00:05:36.100  -->  00:05:41.930
that again file new notice that the ok boxes color
differently and that's because its
61

61

00:05:41.930  -->  00:05:47.750
the default button that means if we press ENTER while the dialogue is up the dialog
62

62

00:05:47.750  -->  00:05:52.440
is going to interpret this is pressing the OK button so now we got that open and if I just press enter we'll return
63

63

00:05:52.440  -->  00:05:56.770
you notice how that has been invoke and OK pressed has come up on the screen
64

64

00:05:56.770  -->  00:06:01.950
ok so the code is working great so far so
now let's write the code that will gather the
65

65

00:06:01.950  -->  00:06:06.650
information from the dialogues controls when
the user clicks the ok button but how do we
66

66

00:06:06.650  -->  00:06:11.040
actually do that now the FXML file that
defines the dialogue pane and all its
67

67

00:06:11.040  -->  00:06:15.570
controls is associated with another
controller so we can't create instance
68

68

00:06:15.570  -->  00:06:20.440
variables for our dialogues controls in our
main window's controller what we need is
69

69

00:06:20.440  -->  00:06:24.670
a way to get the dialogues controller so that
when the user presses the OK button we
70

70

00:06:24.670  -->  00:06:29.330
can then ask the dialogues controller too
process the data so to get the
71

71

00:06:29.330  -->  00:06:34.310
controller we have to change the way we
load the FXML so instead of using the
72

72

00:06:34.310  -->  00:06:40.040
load method we are gonna do it in several steps what we'll do
is first create an instance of the FXML
73

73

00:06:40.040  -->  00:06:44.040
loader class and then we'll tell it the
location of the FXML we want to
74

74

00:06:44.040  -->  00:06:48.150
actually load then we will go
ahead and load the FXML
75

75

00:06:49.850  -->  00:06:52.850
so lets close it down....
76

76

00:06:55.850  -->  00:06:59.110
so here is the code we are using at the moment in
the try block
77

77

00:06:59.110  -->  00:07:03.540
so we are gonna change this around a little bit so just
above the try in the show new item dialogue
78

78

00:07:03.540  -->  00:07:12.500
we going to type in....
79

79

00:07:12.500  -->  00:07:36.930
....
80

80

00:07:36.930  -->  00:07:41.950
...
81

81

00:07:41.950  -->  00:07:54.540
....
82

82

00:07:54.540  -->  00:07:59.540
....so now we can get our controller from the
83

83

00:07:59.540  -->  00:08:03.680
FXML loader instances you can see
their but first we need to write the
84

84

00:08:03.680  -->  00:08:06.820
method we want to call so lets switch to our
85

85

00:08:06.820  -->  00:08:12.110
dialogue controller Java class come over here so what we need to do
86

86

00:08:12.110  -->  00:08:15.530
is go back to our to do item dialogue we need some IDs for the
87

87

00:08:15.530  -->  00:08:19.510
various fields so let's add some ID's so the first one is a text field
88

88

00:08:19.510  -->  00:08:25.080
because we need to be retrieving the
values so...
89

89

00:08:26.040  -->  00:08:39.450
....
90

90

00:08:40.940  -->  00:08:44.120
....
91

91

00:08:44.910  -->  00:08:52.610
...so lets now go back to our dialog controller and
92

92

00:08:52.610  -->  00:08:55.810
we will declare these fields in there so...
93

93

00:08:55.810  -->  00:09:28.340
....
94

94

00:09:28.340  -->  00:09:41.620
...
95

95

00:09:41.620  -->  00:10:09.290
....
96

96

00:10:09.290  -->  00:10:13.310
...so in here what we want to do is we want to gather
97

97

00:10:13.310  -->  00:10:18.390
the user's input creating a new to do item and we add it to in our to
98

98

00:10:18.390  -->  00:10:20.230
do data instance
99

99

00:10:20.230  -->  00:10:31.850
so lets go ahead and do that so...
100

100

00:10:31.850  -->  00:10:47.480
....
101

101

00:10:49.670  -->  00:10:53.630
....
102

102

00:10:54.800  -->  00:11:03.570
....
103

103

00:11:03.570  -->  00:11:08.220
...
104

104

00:11:08.220  -->  00:11:27.970
....
105

105

00:11:27.970  -->  00:11:36.260
...so that will be the only thing we need to
106

106

00:11:36.260  -->  00:11:40.130
do from this point of view to process the
results after the OK button was written
107

107

00:11:40.130  -->  00:11:42.250
but we need to go back to our to do
108

108

00:11:42.250  -->  00:11:47.910
class and add this to do item methods so lets go back and do that....
109

109

00:11:47.910  -->  00:11:52.890
...and in the bottom will add that.....
110

110

00:11:57.860  -->  00:12:00.860
.....
111

111

00:12:03.490  -->  00:12:07.160
...so we are gonna do....
112

112

00:12:08.400  -->  00:13:04.900
....
113

113

00:13:07.160  -->  00:13:12.280
..ok so going back to dialogue controller that should
now be fixedo you can see the error went away
114

114

00:13:12.280  -->  00:13:17.340
because the method has now been added so now we've
done that we have to call the process
115

115

00:13:17.340  -->  00:13:22.470
results method from the event handler in
the main windows controller so to see
116

116

00:13:22.470  -->  00:13:28.080
what I mean will go back to our main controller
where we implemented the code at the moment we've got
117

117

00:13:28.080  -->  00:13:32.430
just putting out a message if ok was pressed so this is where we need to actually
118

118

00:13:32.430  -->  00:13:40.180
process something so we need to first get
the controller and we do that with...
119

119

00:13:40.180  -->  00:13:50.900
....
120

120

00:13:50.900  -->  00:13:58.470
...and that will then process that for us so
121

121

00:13:58.470  -->  00:14:01.470
let's run this....
122

122

00:14:02.300  -->  00:14:13.810
...add a new one....and we got an error....and the error is on Controller.java on line 63 and its got to do with the dialogue
123

123

00:14:13.810  -->  00:14:18.710
setting the content from the FXML loader so what I'm going to do is I'm going to finish the
124

124

00:14:18.710  -->  00:14:20.400
video here now because its getting quite long
125

125

00:14:20.400  -->  00:14:24.500
when we come back we'll fix this error and
then will actually look at making sure
126

126

00:14:24.500  -->  00:14:28.460
that when the to do item is added
in the dialogue that it has been added successfully
127

127

00:14:28.460  -->  00:14:32.090
and its also added successfully in our list view
as well so see you in the next video
