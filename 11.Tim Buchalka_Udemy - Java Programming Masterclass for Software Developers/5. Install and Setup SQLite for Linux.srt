00:00:04,620  -->  00:00:06,600
in this video we're going to install the
2

2

00:00:06,600  -->  00:00:09,000
sqlite commanded line shell for the Linux
3

3

00:00:09,000  -->  00:00:11,640
computers if you're using Windows or Mac
4

4

00:00:11,640  -->  00:00:14,460
refer to the previous two videos where
5

5

00:00:14,460  -->  00:00:15,900
we actually set up for those platforms
6

6

00:00:15,900  -->  00:00:17,580
but if you're running linux you're in
7

7

00:00:17,580  -->  00:00:19,010
the right place so let's get started
8

8

00:00:19,010  -->  00:00:21,930
writing database code straightaway
9

9

00:00:21,930  -->  00:00:23,460
isn't the easiest way to learn about
10

10

00:00:23,460  -->  00:00:24,930
sqlite and the sql language
11

11

00:00:24,930  -->  00:00:27,090
because if you get errors you have to
12

12

00:00:27,090  -->  00:00:29,070
work out if the errors in your code or
13

13

00:00:29,070  -->  00:00:30,570
the sql statements that you actually
14

14

00:00:30,570  -->  00:00:32,850
use so what we're going to do is we're
15

15

00:00:32,850  -->  00:00:34,470
going to start by using the sqite
16

16

00:00:34,470  -->  00:00:36,750
command line shell so that we can create
17

17

00:00:36,750  -->  00:00:39,830
databases and use sql commands without
18

18

00:00:39,830  -->  00:00:41,600
having to worry about code at this stage
19

19

00:00:41,600  -->  00:00:44,300
now on ubuntu linux turns out this is
20

20

00:00:44,300  -->  00:00:46,530
really easy going to start by opening a
21

21

00:00:46,530  -->  00:00:48,320
terminal session so i'm just going to
22

22

00:00:48,320  -->  00:00:51,300
use the shortcut on ubuntu which is control
23

23

00:00:51,300  -->  00:00:55,460
alt t that opens the windows you can
24

24

00:00:55,460  -->  00:00:59,690
see they're obviously I can come up
25

25

00:00:59,690  -->  00:01:01,440
here and just type terminal in there and
26

26

00:01:01,440  -->  00:01:02,900
open up that way as well
27

27

00:01:02,900  -->  00:01:04,890
alright so installing sqlite three
28

28

00:01:04,890  -->  00:01:06,050
firstly we check to see whether we've
29

29

00:01:06,050  -->  00:01:10,170
got it we type....you can see that
30

30

00:01:10,170  -->  00:01:11,730
it's saying that currently we haven't
31

31

00:01:11,730  -->  00:01:14,550
got the program installed so again on ubuntu
32

32

00:01:14,550  -->  00:01:18,090
linux we do a sudo...
33

33

00:01:18,090  -->  00:01:22,950
...
34

34

00:01:22,950  -->  00:01:26,690
....
35

35

00:01:26,690  -->  00:01:28,430
and you can see that was really really
36

36

00:01:28,430  -->  00:01:29,750
quick installation is only a small
37

37

00:01:29,750  -->  00:01:31,250
program because we are only getting the
38

38

00:01:31,250  -->  00:01:32,870
command-line shell not sqlite
39

39

00:01:32,870  -->  00:01:35,180
itself this point we can then check to
40

40

00:01:35,180  -->  00:01:37,160
see whether sqlite three is installed
41

41

00:01:37,160  -->  00:01:41,900
type....and you can see instead
42

42

00:01:41,900  -->  00:01:43,460
of getting an error like we did
43

43

00:01:43,460  -->  00:01:45,710
previously we can see it showing
44

44

00:01:45,710  -->  00:01:48,020
the sqlite version number . help
45

45

00:01:48,020  -->  00:01:50,390
instructions etc and incidentally you
46

46

00:01:50,390  -->  00:01:51,800
might see a slightly different version
47

47

00:01:51,800  -->  00:01:53,840
number to what I've got on the screen
48

48

00:01:53,840  -->  00:01:55,610
but that's ok so long as you can
49

49

00:01:55,610  -->  00:01:57,470
actually get it working and you can see
50

50

00:01:57,470  -->  00:01:59,090
that we actually started the sqlite
51

51

00:01:59,090  -->  00:02:02,120
command line shell then you are good to go and
52

52

00:02:02,120  -->  00:02:04,250
just keep in mind specifically with a
53

53

00:02:04,250  -->  00:02:08,000
ubuntu i'm using 14.04 but if
54

54

00:02:08,000  -->  00:02:10,370
you're using Ubuntu 1604 you will
55

55

00:02:10,370  -->  00:02:12,350
actually get out much later version but
56

56

00:02:12,350  -->  00:02:14,390
both versions will actually work fine
57

57

00:02:14,390  -->  00:02:16,160
with the course theirs no prerequisites for
58

58

00:02:16,160  -->  00:02:18,380
a specific version of sqlite three
59

59

00:02:18,380  -->  00:02:20,300
alright so at this point we've completed
60

60

00:02:20,300  -->  00:02:22,880
the installation type dot quit to get
61

61

00:02:22,880  -->  00:02:25,100
out of the sqlite 3 command line shell
62

62

00:02:25,100  -->  00:02:27,320
type exit to close down the terminal
63

63

00:02:27,320  -->  00:02:31,130
session and at this point we're done so
64

64

00:02:31,130  -->  00:02:32,600
let's now move on to the next video
65

65

00:02:32,600  -->  00:02:33,800
we're going to go through a bit of an
66

66

00:02:33,800  -->  00:02:36,500
introduction on using sqlite see you
67

67

00:02:36,500  -->  00:02:42,130
