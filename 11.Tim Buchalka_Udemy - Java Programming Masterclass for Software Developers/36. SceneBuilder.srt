00:00:03,390  -->  00:00:06,230
ok so we've learned how to create our
2

2

00:00:06,260  -->  00:00:08,790
UI using FXML and then we've been
ok so we've learned how to create our
3

3

00:00:08,820  -->  00:00:11,840
doing so by editing the fxml file now
UI using FXML and then we've been
4

4

00:00:11,870  -->  00:00:14,570
instead of writing the fxml ourselves
doing so by editing the fxml file now
5

5

00:00:14,600  -->  00:00:17,330
we could use the javafx scene builder
instead of writing the fxml ourselves
6

6

00:00:17,360  -->  00:00:20,190
tool now scene builder is a GUI builder
we could use the javafx scene builder
7

7

00:00:20,220  -->  00:00:22,890
graphical user interface builder now we
tool now scene builder is a GUI builder
8

8

00:00:22,920  -->  00:00:24,420
can actually use it to build our user
graphical user interface builder now we
9

9

00:00:24,450  -->  00:00:26,070
interface by dragging and dropping
can actually use it to build our user
10

10

00:00:26,100  -->  00:00:29,220
javafx controls and containers into a
interface by dragging and dropping
11

11

00:00:29,250  -->  00:00:32,280
Content area scene builder then generates
javafx controls and containers into a
12

12

00:00:32,310  -->  00:00:35,060
the fxml code for us and it's written
Content area scene builder then generates
13

13

00:00:35,090  -->  00:00:37,950
using javafx so it's an example of a
the fxml code for us and it's written
14

14

00:00:37,980  -->  00:00:41,090
complex javafx application now at this
using javafx so it's an example of a
15

15

00:00:41,120  -->  00:00:42,560
point you might be wondering why we've
complex javafx application now at this
16

16

00:00:42,590  -->  00:00:45,180
spent so much time learning how to code
point you might be wondering why we've
17

17

00:00:45,210  -->  00:00:47,000
fxml when we could have really just
spent so much time learning how to code
18

18

00:00:47,030  -->  00:00:49,340
used a tool like scene builder instead
fxml when we could have really just
19

19

00:00:49,370  -->  00:00:51,290
well gui builders can be wonderful
used a tool like scene builder instead
20

20

00:00:51,320  -->  00:00:53,000
tools that do you make our life easier
well gui builders can be wonderful
21

21

00:00:53,030  -->  00:00:55,500
but when using any tool that generates
tools that do you make our life easier
22

22

00:00:55,530  -->  00:00:58,550
code it's really important to learn how
but when using any tool that generates
23

23

00:00:58,580  -->  00:01:01,550
to write the code yourself first and the
code it's really important to learn how
24

24

00:01:01,580  -->  00:01:03,110
reason for that is tool might get
to write the code yourself first and the
25

25

00:01:03,140  -->  00:01:05,340
discontinued or we might want to tweak the
reason for that is tool might get
26

26

00:01:05,370  -->  00:01:07,700
generated code or perhaps you need to
discontinued or we might want to tweak the
27

27

00:01:07,730  -->  00:01:09,600
debug the code when it doesn't work as
generated code or perhaps you need to
28

28

00:01:09,630  -->  00:01:12,780
you would expect now gui builders should
debug the code when it doesn't work as
29

29

00:01:12,810  -->  00:01:14,640
always be seen as a way to help us
you would expect now gui builders should
30

30

00:01:14,670  -->  00:01:17,430
create the user interface they shouldn't
always be seen as a way to help us
31

31

00:01:17,460  -->  00:01:19,860
ever be used because we don't actually
create the user interface they shouldn't
32

32

00:01:19,890  -->  00:01:22,260
know how to write the code ourselves so we
ever be used because we don't actually
33

33

00:01:22,290  -->  00:01:23,540
don't understand what's happening behind
know how to write the code ourselves so we
34

34

00:01:23,570  -->  00:01:26,100
the scenes and that's why we spent so
don't understand what's happening behind
35

35

00:01:26,130  -->  00:01:28,080
many lessons in this section learning
the scenes and that's why we spent so
36

36

00:01:28,110  -->  00:01:30,720
the manual way of creating fxml so that
many lessons in this section learning
37

37

00:01:30,750  -->  00:01:32,400
scene builder tool is going
the manual way of creating fxml so that
38

38

00:01:32,430  -->  00:01:34,040
to really make things really going to
scene builder tool is going
39

39

00:01:34,070  -->  00:01:35,670
complement our skills now that we
to really make things really going to
40

40

00:01:35,700  -->  00:01:38,070
sort of started off the manual way and we
complement our skills now that we
41

41

00:01:38,100  -->  00:01:40,530
can now save a bit of time using scene builder now
sort of started off the manual way and we
42

42

00:01:40,560  -->  00:01:42,510
when it does come to scene builder the
can now save a bit of time using scene builder now
43

43

00:01:42,540  -->  00:01:45,680
javafx communities wondering and on
when it does come to scene builder the
44

44

00:01:45,710  -->  00:01:48,150
the same boat here whether the Oracle and
javafx communities wondering and on
45

45

00:01:48,180  -->  00:01:49,890
that's the company obviously that own Java
the same boat here whether the Oracle and
46

46

00:01:49,920  -->  00:01:51,800
and everything related to it will
that's the company obviously that own Java
47

47

00:01:51,830  -->  00:01:53,360
actually keep the tool under active
and everything related to it will
48

48

00:01:53,390  -->  00:01:56,150
development now to give an example of
actually keep the tool under active
49

49

00:01:56,180  -->  00:01:58,610
that oracle used to offer installer
development now to give an example of
50

50

00:01:58,640  -->  00:02:00,680
for scene builder but they no longer do
that oracle used to offer installer
51

51

00:02:00,710  -->  00:02:03,320
oracle instruct developers who want to
for scene builder but they no longer do
52

52

00:02:03,350  -->  00:02:05,570
use the tool to download the source code
oracle instruct developers who want to
53

53

00:02:05,600  -->  00:02:08,460
to build the tools themselves and also
use the tool to download the source code
54

54

00:02:08,490  -->  00:02:10,770
oracle have made the scene builder code
to build the tools themselves and also
55

55

00:02:10,800  -->  00:02:13,500
open source and potentially that could
oracle have made the scene builder code
56

56

00:02:13,530  -->  00:02:16,640
mean that oracle have don't have
open source and potentially that could
57

57

00:02:16,670  -->  00:02:16,930
any
mean that oracle have don't have
58

58

00:02:16,960  -->  00:02:18,340
long-term plans to work
any
59

59

00:02:18,370  -->  00:02:21,670
on anything anymore pure speculation but
long-term plans to work
60

60

00:02:21,700  -->  00:02:22,690
in any event
on anything anymore pure speculation but
61

61

00:02:22,720  -->  00:02:25,240
fortunately the javafx community has
in any event
62

62

00:02:25,270  -->  00:02:26,770
stepped up to the plate and they've
fortunately the javafx community has
63

63

00:02:26,800  -->  00:02:28,360
actually kept the scene builder code in
stepped up to the plate and they've
64

64

00:02:28,390  -->  00:02:31,060
sync with javafx update something that
actually kept the scene builder code in
65

65

00:02:31,090  -->  00:02:32,740
oracle haven't been doing but of course
sync with javafx update something that
66

66

00:02:32,770  -->  00:02:35,200
that could change at any time for now
oracle haven't been doing but of course
67

67

00:02:35,230  -->  00:02:37,060
the scene builder is still a tool that we can
that could change at any time for now
68

68

00:02:37,090  -->  00:02:40,270
use and it is still very useful now if
the scene builder is still a tool that we can
69

69

00:02:40,300  -->  00:02:42,100
you search for scene builder you might
use and it is still very useful now if
70

70

00:02:42,130  -->  00:02:44,080
find some old binaries from oracle that
you search for scene builder you might
71

71

00:02:44,110  -->  00:02:46,120
you can use but that actually include
find some old binaries from oracle that
72

72

00:02:46,150  -->  00:02:49,330
the latest updates to javafx so i'm
you can use but that actually include
73

73

00:02:49,360  -->  00:02:51,520
going to do is in the next few videos
the latest updates to javafx so i'm
74

74

00:02:51,550  -->  00:02:53,590
I'm going to actually show you how to
going to do is in the next few videos
75

75

00:02:53,620  -->  00:02:55,930
find an alternative way to get scene
I'm going to actually show you how to
76

76

00:02:55,960  -->  00:02:58,390
builder installed on a windows machine
find an alternative way to get scene
77

77

00:02:58,420  -->  00:03:00,610
and also on a Mac machine and although i
builder installed on a windows machine
78

78

00:03:00,640  -->  00:03:04,090
won't have a video for linux users I will also
and also on a Mac machine and although i
79

79

00:03:04,120  -->  00:03:06,130
outline how you can go about getting that
won't have a video for linux users I will also
80

80

00:03:06,160  -->  00:03:08,980
for your platform so let's continue in
outline how you can go about getting that
81

81

00:03:09,010  -->  00:03:10,510
the next video when I actually show you
for your platform so let's continue in
82

82

00:03:10,540  -->  00:03:13,090
how to install scene builder and get up and
the next video when I actually show you
83

83

00:03:13,120  -->  00:03:15,760
going for windows and if you're on a Mac
how to install scene builder and get up and
84

84

00:03:15,790  -->  00:03:18,010
skip that video and move straight onto the
going for windows and if you're on a Mac
85

85

00:03:18,040  -->  00:03:19,780
mac video which is the one after that
skip that video and move straight onto the
86

86

00:03:19,810  -->  00:03:26,490
so I'll see you one of those videos
mac video which is the one after that
