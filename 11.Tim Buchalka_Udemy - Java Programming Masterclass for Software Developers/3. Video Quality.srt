00:00:04,790  -->  00:00:08,580
<v ->So all videos in this course have been uploaded in 1080P</v>
2

2

00:00:08,580  -->  00:00:10,560
which is the highest quality format
3

3

00:00:10,560  -->  00:00:13,150
that Udemy currently accept for videos.
4

4

00:00:13,150  -->  00:00:16,000
So that's the good news, the bad news is that sometimes
5

5

00:00:16,000  -->  00:00:18,213
Udemy's video player seems to blur
6

6

00:00:18,213  -->  00:00:19,920
the videos a little bit.
7

7

00:00:19,920  -->  00:00:21,980
But the good news again, back to the good news,
8

8

00:00:21,980  -->  00:00:24,320
is that usually this is a temporary problem
9

9

00:00:24,320  -->  00:00:26,190
and can be overcome by coming down here
10

10

00:00:26,190  -->  00:00:27,660
and clicking on the little cog
11

11

00:00:27,660  -->  00:00:29,810
and choosing a resolution.
12

12

00:00:29,810  -->  00:00:32,300
A 720P is the best one to choose normally
13

13

00:00:32,300  -->  00:00:34,610
if you haven't got the auto option.
14

14

00:00:34,610  -->  00:00:36,240
But if you have got the auto option,
15

15

00:00:36,240  -->  00:00:38,760
select that because that will give you 1080P,
16

16

00:00:38,760  -->  00:00:40,790
and that's if Udemy's video player dictates
17

17

00:00:40,790  -->  00:00:43,020
that your internet speed is fast enough.
18

18

00:00:43,020  -->  00:00:45,880
So keep in mind that if you do experience blurriness
19

19

00:00:45,880  -->  00:00:48,110
to try that, but also keep in mind that sometimes
20

20

00:00:48,110  -->  00:00:50,660
the blurriness will just happen for the first few seconds
21

21

00:00:50,660  -->  00:00:52,970
for a video and then disappear and playback
22

22

00:00:52,970  -->  00:00:54,810
in a higher quality format.
23

23

00:00:54,810  -->  00:00:56,640
And you've probably seen that happen in YouTube as well
24

24

00:00:56,640  -->  00:00:58,870
where it will start streaming in a lower resolution
25

25

00:00:58,870  -->  00:01:00,620
and then get back up to a higher quality.
26

26

00:01:00,620  -->  00:01:02,810
Bottom line is that for most students,
27

27

00:01:02,810  -->  00:01:04,840
they seem to have no problems playing it but,
28

28

00:01:04,840  -->  00:01:06,370
playing in the highest quality.
29

29

00:01:06,370  -->  00:01:08,050
But if you do see an issue just have
30

30

00:01:08,050  -->  00:01:09,450
a bit fiddle with those settings
31

31

00:01:09,450  -->  00:01:12,210
and you find that you'll be able to play those videos
32

32

00:01:12,210  -->  00:01:13,930
in the highest quality.
33

33

00:01:13,930  -->  00:01:16,930
Thank you for watching, let's move on now to the next video.
