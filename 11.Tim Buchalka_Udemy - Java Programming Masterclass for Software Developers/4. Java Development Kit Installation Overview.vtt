00:00:05.100  -->  00:00:07.030
<v ->All right, so it's time now to instal</v>
2

2

00:00:07.030  -->  00:00:09.000
the Java Development Kit.
3

3

00:00:09.000  -->  00:00:11.860
Now we're going to be using an open source version
4

4

00:00:11.860  -->  00:00:15.280
of a Java Development Kit, the Open JDK
5

5

00:00:15.280  -->  00:00:17.429
and that's creatable version we're using
6

6

00:00:17.429  -->  00:00:21.100
is created by Amazon and they call it Amazon Corretto.
7

7

00:00:21.100  -->  00:00:24.030
We'll be using JDK version 11 in this course
8

8

00:00:24.030  -->  00:00:25.760
and not later versions.
9

9

00:00:25.760  -->  00:00:28.640
In a nutshell, version 11 is the LTS,
10

10

00:00:28.640  -->  00:00:32.030
or long term support version of Java.
11

11

00:00:32.030  -->  00:00:34.944
Now if you're wondering why we're using Amazon Corretto
12

12

00:00:34.944  -->  00:00:37.460
and why we're using JDK 11, I've got two videos
13

13

00:00:37.460  -->  00:00:39.120
on YouTube, check those out.
14

14

00:00:39.120  -->  00:00:41.450
They're in the resource section of this video.
15

15

00:00:41.450  -->  00:00:43.430
They give you the reasoning why we're using
16

16

00:00:43.430  -->  00:00:46.950
Amazon Corretto and why we're using JDK version 11.
17

17

00:00:46.950  -->  00:00:49.310
And look consider subscribing to the channel
18

18

00:00:49.310  -->  00:00:50.560
while you are there as well,
19

19

00:00:50.560  -->  00:00:53.780
because I'm releasing regular programming tips of the day
20

20

00:00:53.780  -->  00:00:55.310
and career advice, et cetera,
21

21

00:00:55.310  -->  00:00:58.070
separating that from the videos in this course.
22

22

00:00:58.070  -->  00:00:59.890
But getting back to this course though,
23

23

00:00:59.890  -->  00:01:03.270
there are Amazon Corretto videos, installation videos
24

24

00:01:03.270  -->  00:01:06.670
for the Java Development Kit, for Windows, Mac and Linux
25

25

00:01:06.670  -->  00:01:07.860
in this section.
26

26

00:01:07.860  -->  00:01:11.340
And in addition, for IntelliJ, there's also videos
27

27

00:01:11.340  -->  00:01:15.880
for the Windows platform, Mac and also for Linux as well.
28

28

00:01:15.880  -->  00:01:18.320
So watch the relevant video for your operating system
29

29

00:01:18.320  -->  00:01:19.210
and once you've done that,
30

30

00:01:19.210  -->  00:01:22.160
for both the JDK and IntelliJ IDEA,
31

31

00:01:22.160  -->  00:01:24.120
there's then a single video for you to watch,
32

32

00:01:24.120  -->  00:01:26.750
irrespective of the operating system you're running
33

33

00:01:26.750  -->  00:01:28.940
and that gives you some configuration,
34

34

00:01:28.940  -->  00:01:31.210
or an overview of the configuration steps you need to take
35

35

00:01:31.210  -->  00:01:33.570
within IntelliJ, to get it all working together.
36

36

00:01:33.570  -->  00:01:35.430
So make sure you check out that video,
37

37

00:01:35.430  -->  00:01:39.440
after you've installed both the JDK and IntelliJ IDEA.
38

38

00:01:39.440  -->  00:01:40.273
All right so that's it.
39

39

00:01:40.273  -->  00:01:42.290
Let's get stuck into it in the next video.
