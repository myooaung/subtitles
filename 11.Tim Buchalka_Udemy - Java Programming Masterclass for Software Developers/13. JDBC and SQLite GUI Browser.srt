1

00:00:04,920  -->  00:00:07,290
so we see how to work with a sqlite
2

2

00:00:07,290  -->  00:00:09,930
database from the command line now
3

3

00:00:09,930  -->  00:00:10,770
we're going to learn how to use a
4

4

00:00:10,770  -->  00:00:14,400
database from a java application and to
5

5

00:00:14,400  -->  00:00:18,800
do so we are going to be using the jdbc api now
6

6

00:00:18,800  -->  00:00:21,240
jdbc stands for java database
7

7

00:00:21,240  -->  00:00:24,750
connectivity so using jdbc we can not only
8

8

00:00:24,750  -->  00:00:26,400
work with databases but also
9

9

00:00:26,400  -->  00:00:29,600
spreadsheets and flat files so thinking
10

10

00:00:29,600  -->  00:00:33,440
for jdbc as a middle man that sits
11

11

00:00:33,440  -->  00:00:35,600
between a java application and a data
12

12

00:00:35,600  -->  00:00:38,550
source to use a particular data source
13

13

00:00:38,550  -->  00:00:40,760
from an application we need the jdbc
14

14

00:00:40,760  -->  00:00:43,790
driver for the data source for example
15

15

00:00:43,790  -->  00:00:46,010
to access sqlite database from an
16

16

00:00:46,010  -->  00:00:48,830
application we need a sqlite jdbc
17

17

00:00:48,830  -->  00:00:53,940
driver now the driver is simply a java
18

18

00:00:53,940  -->  00:00:55,970
library containing classes that
19

19

00:00:55,970  -->  00:00:59,990
implement the jdbc API now because all
20

20

00:00:59,990  -->  00:01:02,190
jdbc drivers have to implement the same
21

21

00:01:02,190  -->  00:01:04,370
interfaces it's not difficult to change
22

22

00:01:04,370  -->  00:01:07,760
the data source and application users for
23

23

00:01:07,760  -->  00:01:09,350
example if an application uses the
24

24

00:01:09,350  -->  00:01:11,700
sqlite database and then we decide later
25

25

00:01:11,700  -->  00:01:14,520
that we want to use a my sql database
26

26

00:01:14,520  -->  00:01:16,770
all we have to do is use the mysql
27

27

00:01:16,770  -->  00:01:19,400
jdbc driver instead of the sqlite
28

28

00:01:19,400  -->  00:01:21,860
one in addition to of course migrating
29

29

00:01:21,860  -->  00:01:24,370
the data to a mysql database
30

30

00:01:24,370  -->  00:01:27,720
[Music]
31

31

00:01:27,720  -->  00:01:29,790
so in reality unfortunately it's not
32

32

00:01:29,790  -->  00:01:30,720
that simple
33

33

00:01:30,720  -->  00:01:32,250
nothing is ever a hundred percent
34

34

00:01:32,250  -->  00:01:35,730
portable but if we write our jdbc code
35

35

00:01:35,730  -->  00:01:37,320
with thought in mind that we may have to
36

36

00:01:37,320  -->  00:01:39,630
change the data source later we can make
37

37

00:01:39,630  -->  00:01:42,510
our lives easier by avoiding the use of
38

38

00:01:42,510  -->  00:01:45,060
database specific sql code and also
39

39

00:01:45,060  -->  00:01:47,910
behaviors wherever possible if we wanted
40

40

00:01:47,910  -->  00:01:49,230
to work with the spreadsheet or flat
41

41

00:01:49,230  -->  00:01:51,990
file that's fine as long as a jdbc
42

42

00:01:51,990  -->  00:01:54,180
driver that works with that spreadsheet
43

43

00:01:54,180  -->  00:01:56,790
or file format if you're feeling
44

44

00:01:56,790  -->  00:01:58,770
particularly a game you can always write
45

45

00:01:58,770  -->  00:02:03,770
the jdbc driving yourself if necessary
46

46

00:02:03,770  -->  00:02:06,500
now the jdbc driver has to be written in
47

47

00:02:06,500  -->  00:02:09,170
Java but it can consist of a thin java
48

48

00:02:09,170  -->  00:02:11,260
layer that calls code written in other
49

49

00:02:11,260  -->  00:02:14,480
languages a current version of the jdbc
50

50

00:02:14,480  -->  00:02:18,340
API as of shooting this video is jdbc 4.2
51

51

00:02:18,340  -->  00:02:21,500
for backwards compatibility it contains
52

52

00:02:21,500  -->  00:02:23,150
all the methods that were in previous
53

53

00:02:23,150  -->  00:02:26,060
jdbc version now there have been
54

54

00:02:26,060  -->  00:02:29,060
changes to the way that jdbc works so
55

55

00:02:29,060  -->  00:02:30,650
make sure you're working with a driver
56

56

00:02:30,650  -->  00:02:35,060
that supports the at least jdbc 4.0 and
57

57

00:02:35,060  -->  00:02:36,500
if you use the one will download in this
58

58

00:02:36,500  -->  00:02:40,970
video you'll be fine
59

59

00:02:40,970  -->  00:02:44,480
jdbc consists of two packages java.sql
60

60

00:02:44,480  -->  00:02:47,720
which is core jdbc and java x
61

61

00:02:47,720  -->  00:02:51,110
.sql which is optional jdbc now the
62

62

00:02:51,110  -->  00:02:53,600
api's in the java x sql package are
63

63

00:02:53,600  -->  00:02:55,880
required when working with database
64

64

00:02:55,880  -->  00:02:57,710
servers and we'll talk about those a
65

65

00:02:57,710  -->  00:02:59,900
little bit later know all the popular
66

66

00:02:59,900  -->  00:03:03,620
databases provide jdbc drivers the jdk
67

67

00:03:03,620  -->  00:03:05,330
ships with the database actually called
68

68

00:03:05,330  -->  00:03:07,430
Derby which can be used for desktop
69

69

00:03:07,430  -->  00:03:09,500
applications or when prototyping
70

70

00:03:09,500  -->  00:03:12,710
the Derby jdbc driver is also included
71

71

00:03:12,710  -->  00:03:16,340
in the jdk
72

72

00:03:16,340  -->  00:03:18,500
but we're going to start by using a sql
73

73

00:03:18,500  -->  00:03:20,900
lite database so we're going to use a
74

74

00:03:20,900  -->  00:03:23,810
sql light jdbc driver now the driver
75

75

00:03:23,810  -->  00:03:25,970
that w's comes packaged with sqlite
76

76

00:03:25,970  -->  00:03:27,440
which means we don't have to
77

77

00:03:27,440  -->  00:03:30,010
install the database separately so we
78

78

00:03:30,010  -->  00:03:31,610
won't be using the sqlite command
79

79

00:03:31,610  -->  00:03:33,200
line tools that we used in a previous
80

80

00:03:33,200  -->  00:03:37,220
video so lets spring back over now and
81

81

00:03:37,220  -->  00:03:42,790
download the necessary driver
82

82

00:03:42,790  -->  00:03:44,230
alright so we need to download the
83

83

00:03:44,230  -->  00:03:47,360
sqlite jdbc driver so since we want to
84

84

00:03:47,360  -->  00:03:49,340
add the driver to the projects we create
85

85

00:03:49,340  -->  00:03:51,410
when you download it to make sure to
86

86

00:03:51,410  -->  00:03:52,840
save it somewhere that you will
87

87

00:03:52,840  -->  00:03:55,450
remember so let's just open the browser
88

88

00:03:55,450  -->  00:04:01,250
and paste in the link the link is
89

89

00:04:01,250  -->  00:04:04,700
in the resources section as always
90

90

00:04:04,700  -->  00:04:05,750
once we get here going to click on
91

91

00:04:05,750  -->  00:04:07,280
downloads over here to the left hand
92

92

00:04:07,280  -->  00:04:11,780
side you want to download the very
93

93

00:04:11,780  -->  00:04:13,810
latest version don't click this top
94

94

00:04:13,810  -->  00:04:17,000
link this download repository rather
95

95

00:04:17,000  -->  00:04:18,290
come down here and choose the latest
96

96

00:04:18,290  -->  00:04:19,430
version you can see in this particular
97

97

00:04:19,430  -->  00:04:23,690
case the latest version is 3.1 5.1 the
98

98

00:04:23,690  -->  00:04:26,380
date here was added to the
99

99

00:04:26,380  -->  00:04:28,580
repository was the 11th of november
100

100

00:04:28,580  -->  00:04:32,060
2016 we're going to click on that
101

101

00:04:32,060  -->  00:04:36,440
file and just save it somewhere will
102

102

00:04:36,440  -->  00:04:37,720
know where it is so we can refer to it later
103

103

00:04:37,720  -->  00:04:39,080
going to put in my downloads
104

104

00:04:39,080  -->  00:04:42,320
folder it's actually very small files
105

105

00:04:42,320  -->  00:04:44,840
you can see it's already completed the
106

106

00:04:44,840  -->  00:04:48,590
download process now there are other sql
107

107

00:04:48,590  -->  00:04:51,320
jdbc drivers but we're using this
108

108

00:04:51,320  -->  00:04:53,590
one because it contains the sqlite
109

109

00:04:53,590  -->  00:04:55,310
database and doesn't require any
110

110

00:04:55,310  -->  00:04:58,070
configuration now because we'll add the
111

111

00:04:58,070  -->  00:05:00,080
jar file to any projects there won't be
112

112

00:05:00,080  -->  00:05:01,720
any conflict with the sqlite we
113

113

00:05:01,720  -->  00:05:03,220
installed to use from the command line
114

114

00:05:03,220  -->  00:05:05,750
so our application we use the version
115

115

00:05:05,750  -->  00:05:08,660
that's in the jar file now will be
116

116

00:05:08,660  -->  00:05:10,070
wanting to check the contents of that
117

117

00:05:10,070  -->  00:05:11,690
database tables when we are coding our
118

118

00:05:11,690  -->  00:05:13,550
application to make sure everything is
119

119

00:05:13,550  -->  00:05:16,340
working as we expect now I guess we
120

120

00:05:16,340  -->  00:05:17,900
could use the command line version of
121

121

00:05:17,900  -->  00:05:19,250
sqlite to connect to the database
122

122

00:05:19,250  -->  00:05:22,130
that we're using our application but
123

123

00:05:22,130  -->  00:05:23,630
instead what we're going to do is we're
124

124

00:05:23,630  -->  00:05:26,120
going to use the DB browser for sqlite
125

125

00:05:26,120  -->  00:05:27,590
application
126

126

00:05:27,590  -->  00:05:30,740
which is a basically a an application
127

127

00:05:30,740  -->  00:05:33,050
it's got a GUI interface so we can
128

128

00:05:33,050  -->  00:05:35,410
access sqlite databases for so for the
129

129

00:05:35,410  -->  00:05:36,560
rest of this video what we're going to
130

130

00:05:36,560  -->  00:05:37,550
do is I'm going to quickly go through
131

131

00:05:37,550  -->  00:05:40,190
three operating systems windows mac and
132

132

00:05:40,190  -->  00:05:42,110
linux and show you how to go about
133

133

00:05:42,110  -->  00:05:44,240
installing that for each platform and
134

134

00:05:44,240  -->  00:05:46,340
then in the next video will continue on
135

135

00:05:46,340  -->  00:05:49,430
with the creating a java project using
136

136

00:05:49,430  -->  00:05:52,040
the sqlite jdbc drivers to access
137

137

00:05:52,040  -->  00:05:53,930
databases from within java code
138

138

00:05:53,930  -->  00:05:55,820
alright so let's start with the windows
139

139

00:05:55,820  -->  00:05:57,050

150

150

00:06:25,430  -->  00:06:26,930
right-hand side we've gotta download a

00:06:26,930  -->  00:06:29,750
32-bit version

207

207

00:08:44,020  -->  00:08:45,610

00:09:01,530  -->  00:09:04,230
such a small file and now i can just go
214

00:09:05,370  -->  00:09:07,080
Applications folder or just do a command
216

216

00:09:07,080  -->  00:09:11,400
space and capital D capital B
217

226

226

00:09:33,840  -->  00:09:35,820
next video because in that video we're
227

227

00:09:35,820  -->  00:09:37,740
going to start using the jdbc
228

228

00:09:37,740  -->  00:09:40,590
driver that we've downloaded by creating
229

229

00:09:40,590  -->  00:09:43,200
a new project in IntelliJ as well as
230

230

00:09:43,200  -->  00:09:46,740
using the db browser that we
231

231

00:09:46,740  -->  00:09:49,260
downloaded and installed as well so
232

232

00:09:49,260  -->  00:09:50,520
see you in the next video if you decide
233

233

00:09:50,520  -->  00:09:52,350
to do that but if you've got a linux
234

234

00:09:52,350  -->  00:09:53,850
machine that you want this installed on
235

235

00:09:53,850  -->  00:09:56,130
stay tuned and we'll do that right now
236

236

00:09:56,130  -->  00:09:59,760
alright so that's how to install the mac
237

237

00:09:59,760  -->  00:10:01,860
version of the sqlite browser and finally
238

238

00:10:01,860  -->  00:10:03,780
let's go now and just install linux
239

239

00:10:03,780  -->  00:10:07,410
version in this video we're going to
240

240

00:10:07,410  -->  00:10:10,470
download compile and build and install
241

241

00:10:10,470  -->  00:10:13,830
the sqlite database browser for linux
242

242

00:10:13,830  -->  00:10:15,990
first thing we need to go to a web
243

243

00:10:15,990  -->  00:10:19,620
browser and we need to go to sqlite
244

244

00:10:19,620  -->  00:10:23,880
browser.... then we need to
245

245

00:10:23,880  -->  00:10:25,560
right click this link this download
246

246

00:10:25,560  -->  00:10:27,270
tar.gz file so right click
247

247

00:10:27,270  -->  00:10:29,250
that i'm going to copy the link location
248

248

00:10:29,250  -->  00:10:31,950
then what i'm going to do is open the
249

249

00:10:31,950  -->  00:10:36,270
terminal window and i'm going to go in
250

250

00:10:36,270  -->  00:10:37,740
to the location where i want to install
251

251

00:10:37,740  -->  00:10:40,530
ultimately this product now
252

252

00:10:40,530  -->  00:10:45,210
on my computer and I got a software folder you
253

253

00:10:45,210  -->  00:10:46,920
can see there and I've got a subfolder
254

254

00:10:46,920  -->  00:10:49,170
there that for two other products that
255

255

00:10:49,170  -->  00:10:51,090
I'm using in another course my java
256

256

00:10:51,090  -->  00:10:53,010
spring course so what I'm going to do is
257

257

00:10:53,010  -->  00:10:54,240
create it in here
258

258

00:10:54,240  -->  00:10:57,930
so what I'm going to do is type...
259

259

00:10:57,930  -->  00:11:00,800
going to right click and paste
260

260

00:11:00,800  -->  00:11:02,240
which would give us the link that we
261

261

00:11:02,240  -->  00:11:06,200
copied from the browser press enter only
262

262

00:11:06,200  -->  00:11:08,420
small file so it should download quite
263

263

00:11:08,420  -->  00:11:10,610
quickly
264

264

00:11:10,610  -->  00:11:13,370
you can see the finish now and just
265

265

00:11:13,370  -->  00:11:16,490
close down the browser because we no
266

266

00:11:16,490  -->  00:11:18,470
longer need that
267

267

00:11:18,470  -->  00:11:20,600
alright so we have a look now we can see
268

268

00:11:20,600  -->  00:11:22,940
that we've got this file and not that
269

269

00:11:22,940  -->  00:11:24,440
the file name is a little bit
270

270

00:11:24,440  -->  00:11:25,640
funny so what we're gonna do is change
271

271

00:11:25,640  -->  00:11:27,800
that name so it's going to rename it's
272

272

00:11:27,800  -->  00:11:31,070
going to type...
273

273

00:11:31,070  -->  00:11:32,870
...
274

274

00:11:32,870  -->  00:11:35,540
....
275

275

00:11:35,540  -->  00:11:40,070
...so we now changed or
276

276

00:11:40,070  -->  00:11:42,470
rename that folder going to go into that
277

277

00:11:42,470  -->  00:11:47,080
folder...and I
278

278

00:11:47,080  -->  00:11:48,740
should've obviously added or kept the
279

279

00:11:48,740  -->  00:11:50,720
.tar.gz so let me do that so...
280

280

00:11:50,720  -->  00:11:54,230
...
281

281

00:11:54,230  -->  00:11:55,550
....
282

282

00:11:55,550  -->  00:11:57,470
alright so now we can extract that file
283

283

00:11:57,470  -->  00:12:02,360
...
284

284

00:12:02,360  -->  00:12:05,510
....
285

285

00:12:05,510  -->  00:12:08,120
...
286

286

00:12:08,120  -->  00:12:10,510
now we want to go into the folder....
287

287

00:12:10,510  -->  00:12:13,310
...
288

288

00:12:13,310  -->  00:12:22,220
....and
289

289

00:12:22,220  -->  00:12:24,470
what we want to do then is so we want to
290

290

00:12:24,470  -->  00:12:26,660
issue a couple of commands qmake
291

291

00:12:26,660  -->  00:12:30,070
which is a tool produced or that comes
292

292

00:12:30,070  -->  00:12:32,360
with QT which you may be familiar with
293

293

00:12:32,360  -->  00:12:33,890
so we may have to install it on your
294

294

00:12:33,890  -->  00:12:36,170
computer and i'm going to show you how
295

295

00:12:36,170  -->  00:12:38,020
to do that if necessary so we still we
296

296

00:12:38,020  -->  00:12:39,820
need to run these tools now to build it
297

297

00:12:39,820  -->  00:12:42,320
so first things first we try typing...
298

298

00:12:42,320  -->  00:12:44,810
...and if you get an error like
299

299

00:12:44,810  -->  00:12:47,000
we've got here essentially that's saying
300

300

00:12:47,000  -->  00:12:48,380
it can't execute no such file or
301

301

00:12:48,380  -->  00:12:49,160
directory
302

302

00:12:49,160  -->  00:12:50,890
it means qt isn't installed on your
303

303

00:12:50,890  -->  00:12:53,360
computer so if that's the case you need
304

304

00:12:53,360  -->  00:12:54,560
to install it i'm going to show you how
305

305

00:12:54,560  -->  00:12:56,480
to do that now but if you've got nothing
306

306

00:12:56,480  -->  00:12:58,160
you've got no output at all you just
307

307

00:12:58,160  -->  00:12:59,950
got back to the prompt that actually
308

308

00:12:59,950  -->  00:13:01,690
means that it worked ok you can by
309

309

00:13:01,690  -->  00:13:04,690
pass this next command and move on but in
310

310

00:13:04,690  -->  00:13:05,870
my case i got an error so I'm going to
311

311

00:13:05,870  -->  00:13:09,740
type....
312

312

00:13:09,740  -->  00:13:13,940
....
313

313

00:13:13,940  -->  00:13:42,860
...
314

314

00:13:42,860  -->  00:13:45,560
.....this will now download and
315

315

00:13:45,560  -->  00:13:47,380
install the various packages that
316

316

00:13:47,380  -->  00:13:50,500
we selected
317

317

00:13:50,500  -->  00:13:53,050
ok so the installation is now completed
318

318

00:13:53,050  -->  00:13:54,850
I'm going to clear the screen so you can
319

319

00:13:54,850  -->  00:13:58,120
see the commands again so now going to
320

320

00:13:58,120  -->  00:13:59,230
type that command that we've got an
321

321

00:13:59,230  -->  00:14:02,680
error before which was q make this time
322

322

00:14:02,680  -->  00:14:04,210
and almost instantly returned and that's
323

323

00:14:04,210  -->  00:14:06,190
what i was saying that if you had this
324

324

00:14:06,190  -->  00:14:07,660
installed already that's the output which
325

325

00:14:07,660  -->  00:14:08,500
you would have seen you wouldn't have
326

326

00:14:08,500  -->  00:14:10,720
seen any errors at all so that's
327

327

00:14:10,720  -->  00:14:12,160
obviously telling us that we installed
328

328

00:14:12,160  -->  00:14:14,560
qt correctly and the last command now
329

329

00:14:14,560  -->  00:14:17,650
we are going to type is make that's actually gonna
330

330

00:14:17,650  -->  00:14:19,960
build the sqlite database browser
331

331

00:14:19,960  -->  00:14:22,930
so I'll take a little while to build its
332

332

00:14:22,930  -->  00:14:24,910
going to take a minute or so to
333

333

00:14:24,910  -->  00:14:26,290
complete depending on the speed of your
334

334

00:14:26,290  -->  00:14:28,480
computer once we're finished we'll end
335

335

00:14:28,480  -->  00:14:30,550
up with an executable file that we can
336

336

00:14:30,550  -->  00:14:32,950
run that gives us a nice GUI
337

337

00:14:32,950  -->  00:14:40,010
interface for sqlite databases
338

338

00:14:40,010  -->  00:14:42,440
alright so at this point now it's finished
339

339

00:14:42,440  -->  00:14:45,620
and what happened is now there's been a
340

340

00:14:45,620  -->  00:14:48,200
source folder that's created if I type....
341

341

00:14:48,200  -->  00:14:51,920
...and have a look we now
342

342

00:14:51,920  -->  00:14:53,510
got you can see green in the top right hand
343

343

00:14:53,510  -->  00:14:56,480
corner of this terminal window sqlite
344

344

00:14:56,480  -->  00:14:58,170
browser so we can actually launched
345

345

00:14:58,170  -->  00:15:02,100
that...
346

346

00:15:02,100  -->  00:15:05,690
...hat runs the background and you can see
347

347

00:15:05,690  -->  00:15:07,580
we got a nice little db browse for
348

348

00:15:07,580  -->  00:15:10,640
sqlite utility at this point you can add
349

349

00:15:10,640  -->  00:15:11,990
it to the dash to do whatever you want
350

350

00:15:11,990  -->  00:15:14,420
to do if you want to add a shortcut to
351

351

00:15:14,420  -->  00:15:15,830
get it to start each time
352

352

00:15:15,830  -->  00:15:17,730
alternatively you can just go into that
353

353

00:15:17,730  -->  00:15:20,330
folder and started manually using the
354

354

00:15:20,330  -->  00:15:21,720
command line like I have actually
355

355

00:15:21,720  -->  00:15:24,260
shown you so we've now
356

356

00:15:24,260  -->  00:15:26,690
install down the sqlite browser
357

357

00:15:26,690  -->  00:15:29,160
db browser for sqlite application for
358

358

00:15:29,160  -->  00:15:32,220
windows mac and linux in the next video
359

359

00:15:32,220  -->  00:15:34,920
what we're going to do is fire up the d b
360

360

00:15:34,920  -->  00:15:36,360
browser just have a bit of a look at it
361

361

00:15:36,360  -->  00:15:38,240
and then we'll swing over and start
362

362

00:15:38,240  -->  00:15:40,610
working on our first project in IntelliJ
363

363

00:15:40,610  -->  00:15:44,270
that uses this jdbc sqlite driver
364

364

00:15:44,270  -->  00:15:47,120
that so we downloaded in this video see
365

365

00:15:47,120  -->  00:15:52,810
you in the next video
