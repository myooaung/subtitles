1

00:00:05,330  -->  00:00:09,110
so now that we have actually learn about the layouts that we can to create our
2

2

00:00:09,110  -->  00:00:14,050
user interface lets take a look at some
more of the user interface controls
3

3

00:00:14,050  -->  00:00:17,950
that we can add to these layouts now JavaFx itself has got a wide variety
4

4

00:00:17,950  -->  00:00:24,420
of controls and your already familiar with two of them namely
the button and the label controls so
5

5

00:00:24,420  -->  00:00:27,830
going to start with those two and then
we'll move on to other controls so what
6

6

00:00:27,830  -->  00:00:30,260
I've done is I've created a new java
7

7

00:00:30,260  -->  00:00:36,140
fx project I've called mine controls so
you want to do the same and just set it up so
8

8

00:00:36,140  -->  00:00:40,760
the default code is actually added so once
you've created that what we gonna do is
9

9

00:00:40,760  -->  00:00:45,510
make a few changes so firstly we going
to just increase the size of our scene so
10

10

00:00:45,510  -->  00:00:50,420
I'm going to come over here into the main.java code and where we got a size
11

11

00:00:50,420  -->  00:00:56,280
currently of 300 x 275 let's make that
much larger make it 800....
12

12

00:00:56,960  -->  00:01:05,960
by 500 like so and then go to our sample.fxml file and in there we are
13

13

00:01:05,960  -->  00:01:13,300
gonna add a button so going to keep the grid pane as it is but we gonna add a button within its so....
14

14

00:01:13,300  -->  00:01:14,840
....
15

15

00:01:14,840  -->  00:01:25,700
.....we are adding a button for the grid pane row 0 and index 0 and
16

16

00:01:25,700  -->  00:01:28,700
column 0 and....
17

17

00:01:29,870  -->  00:01:36,200
...so lets now run this it should obviously
work and its nothing that we haven't
18

18

00:01:36,200  -->  00:01:41,580
seen before will run it anyway and it's a very simple
window their that its working and obviously the
19

19

00:01:41,580  -->  00:01:46,270
buttons are in the middle and if we do
click it at the moment nothing's happening and
20

20

00:01:46,270  -->  00:01:50,000
the reason is that we need to attach an
event to that and we will be looking at
21

21

00:01:50,000  -->  00:01:54,940
advanced later on we are not going to be doing that right
now because we're focusing on controls
22

22

00:01:54,940  -->  00:01:59,880
but eventually we'll get to the stage
where we can actually capture that click
23

23

00:01:59,880  -->  00:02:05,580
and perform some processing when a click is actually
made by the user in this case so
24

24

00:02:05,580  -->  00:02:08,200
I'm gonna shut this down now
25

25

00:02:08,200  -->  00:02:11,720
so obviously the property that we've
used here is text so we've actually been
26

26

00:02:11,720  -->  00:02:16,480
able to assign a text some text to the
button so that it actually shows up in
27

27

00:02:16,480  -->  00:02:19,520
the area where it can be clicked but
what else can we actually do with
28

28

00:02:19,520  -->  00:02:23,170
button control now anytime you wanna
know what properties you can set on a
29

29

00:02:23,170  -->  00:02:27,380
given control its a good idea to check
the documentation that oracle put
30

30

00:02:27,380  -->  00:02:32,040
together for that control so you want to make sure your accessing the java 8
31

31

00:02:32,040  -->  00:02:38,090
documentation so lets go over to google I'm gonna open a browser and I can either give you the full link or you can
32

32

00:02:38,090  -->  00:02:42,800
often find it easy enough by doing a
search so in this case we know that
33

33

00:02:42,800  -->  00:02:47,640
working with the button class so lets type in....
34

34

00:02:47,640  -->  00:02:54,300
...so we are gonna do a search for
JavaFX 8 as in JDK 8 button class and that
35

35

00:02:54,300  -->  00:02:58,080
should give us a link and the very first
link there that's coming back is the
36

36

00:02:58,080  -->  00:03:05,310
official documents from oracle you can confirm that its / 8 in the path javafx 8 whicgh is the current version click
37

37

00:03:05,310  -->  00:03:10,160
on that and we got some basic
information here now about the button class
38

38

00:03:10,160  -->  00:03:13,990
and usually when you do a search
like that you usually get the
39

39

00:03:13,990  -->  00:03:17,130
documentation come up it's the first
result which is pretty cool at least
40

40

00:03:17,130  -->  00:03:22,610
when using Google so as you can see on
the screen that right at the top theirs a
41

41

00:03:22,610  -->  00:03:26,630
class hierarchy for the button control
these are all the other classes that
42

42

00:03:26,630  -->  00:03:31,890
basically the button classes extended from
looking at the list you see that one of
43

43

00:03:31,890  -->  00:03:36,320
the ancestors is the control class this
one up here and further up the hierarchy
44

44

00:03:36,320  -->  00:03:42,280
as we move up there is also node as well and from a previous lecture you
45

45

00:03:42,280  -->  00:03:47,480
hopefully recalled that the node class
is the base class 4 all scene graph nodes
46

46

00:03:47,480  -->  00:03:53,160
now the control class is the base class
for scene graph nodes that the user can
47

47

00:03:53,160  -->  00:03:58,490
interact with and this tells us that
there can be nodes in the scene that aren't user
48

48

00:03:58,490  -->  00:04:02,480
interface nodes because obviously their are
2 types their but we'll be looking at
49

49

00:04:02,480  -->  00:04:05,760
those types of nodes in the later
lecture for now we're going to focus on
50

50

00:04:05,760  -->  00:04:10,750
control nodes that obviously can be
interacted with so that's the various
51

51

00:04:10,750  -->  00:04:14,950
classes that collectively make up a button
now as you scroll down a little bit
52

52

00:04:14,950  -->  00:04:19,940
you can see we get to the property summary and
in there we can find out what properties
53

53

00:04:19,940  -->  00:04:24,630
a particular controls got now in the case of
the button control you see this property
54

54

00:04:24,630  -->  00:04:29,470
their for cancel button and default button and
basically the cancel button is the
55

55

00:04:29,470  -->  00:04:32,980
button that receives a keyboard
vk_escape press or if no
56

56

00:04:32,980  -->  00:04:37,820
other node in the scene consumes it and the default button is one that receives
57

57

00:04:37,820  -->  00:04:45,440
keyboard enter so a bit of a difference their when your defining the type of button but that's the two properties that come
58

58

00:04:45,440  -->  00:04:48,150
with it but there's also a lot of
properties that are inherited from these
59

59

00:04:48,150  -->  00:04:53,290
other classes that make up the button
class so scrolling down just seeing a list
60

60

00:04:53,290  -->  00:04:58,660
of them you can see that we've got one here
for height which is from the region ultimately
61

61

00:04:58,660  -->  00:05:03,320
is going to be the height of the button if
you click on that and scroll up and have
62

62

00:05:03,320  -->  00:05:13,560
a look you can see height is actually filled
that is part of the region class their there's
63

63

00:05:13,560  -->  00:05:18,850
height of this re-sizable node
and going back and another property if we go
64

64

00:05:18,850  -->  00:05:26,520
down and looking at control there is skin and if we have a look at skin and scroll up again and have a bit of a look
65

65

00:05:26,520  -->  00:05:32,000
skin is responsible for rendering this
control
66

66

00:05:34,250  -->  00:05:38,410
so lots of properties here that collectively
do makeup this button so its quite a complex
67

67

00:05:38,410  -->  00:05:44,420
set of classes that have been defined by
JavaFX just a good thing to keep in mind
68

68

00:05:44,420  -->  00:05:47,820
is that when you checking out the
documentation don't just look at the
69

69

00:05:47,820  -->  00:05:52,750
properties that are directly relating to the class in this case button you've
70

70

00:05:52,750  -->  00:05:56,130
also got a lot of inherited properties
as well
71

71

00:05:56,130  -->  00:06:01,500
that collectively add functionality to our button or to whatever control your looking at for that matter now
72

72

00:06:01,500  -->  00:06:06,250
talking about skin that is belongs to
the skinnable interface and if we just
73

73

00:06:06,250  -->  00:06:10,810
got up to the top again all implemented
interfaces skinable is actually one of
74

74

00:06:10,810  -->  00:06:14,880
these so its an interface that is this
button
75

75

00:06:14,880  -->  00:06:20,330
implements so if we click on skinable you can
see that there's also quiet a few classes here
76

76

00:06:20,330  -->  00:06:25,200
that are actually implement the skinable interface
and it's obviously useful also when you
77

77

00:06:25,200  -->  00:06:29,310
searching documentation to go into an
interface to see all the various
78

78

00:06:29,310  -->  00:06:33,710
controls in this case that actually
implement this interface so what this
79

79

00:06:33,710  -->  00:06:38,140
allows us to do is determine how a controller
should be rendered so every javaFx
80

80

00:06:38,140  -->  00:06:43,080
control provides default
implementation of this interface but if
81

81

00:06:43,080  -->  00:06:47,490
we wanted to we could subclass a
control and override the methods in this
82

82

00:06:47,490  -->  00:06:51,100
interface or we could even create a
custom control that implements this
83

83

00:06:51,100  -->  00:06:54,350
interface but these are really advanced
topics that we're not going to cover in
84

84

00:06:54,350  -->  00:06:57,490
this section but I just wanted to make
you aware that we're not limited to a
85

85

00:06:57,490  -->  00:07:02,120
control's default appearance or do a
set of controls that JavaFX offers out of
86

86

00:07:02,120  -->  00:07:07,600
the box is certainly got that capability
of creating new controls or extending
87

87

00:07:07,600  -->  00:07:14,800
functionality but let's get back to our button so as you've seen controls have lots
88

88

00:07:14,800  -->  00:07:19,140
of properties and many of them are
inherited from classes in their parent
89

89

00:07:19,140  -->  00:07:24,880
hierarchy so getting back to our code
again the Text property well where is that
90

90

00:07:24,880  -->  00:07:31,320
come from if you go back and have a look at
our documentation and do a search for text
91

91

00:07:31,320  -->  00:07:37,630
eventually will hit text and there it is
over here you can see that's part of the labeled
92

92

00:07:37,630  -->  00:07:43,520
class basically coming out from control.labeled so all controls can have text as
93

93

00:07:43,520  -->  00:07:49,030
part of the content inherit from this classic
label class so right now we can't cover every
94

94

00:07:49,030  -->  00:07:52,650
property so what we'll do is we'll touch
on those that you probably most likely
95

95

00:07:52,650  -->  00:07:57,510
wanna set now text is obviously one of those
and we have seen how to use that or how to
96

96

00:07:57,510  -->  00:08:01,700
set the buttons text using this
particular property but the button can
97

97

00:08:01,700  -->  00:08:03,480
also have an image
98

98

00:08:03,480  -->  00:08:09,450
so either in addition to the text or on its
own and java has actually got an icon repository
99

99

00:08:09,450  -->  00:08:13,270
that's pretty old now and shouldn't be
using real applications but will
100

100

00:08:13,270  -->  00:08:16,880
actually use it for our applications because
the icons arep free and we've got
101

101

00:08:16,880  -->  00:08:21,570
permission to use them so to get the icon
package I'm gonna copy a link and put
102

102

00:08:21,570  -->  00:08:24,770
it on the screen and this link will be
available in the Resources section as
103

103

00:08:24,770  -->  00:08:26,270
normal
104

104

00:08:26,270  -->  00:08:34,280
and i pasted it in there their is the link on the screen if you go to this link now you can see we got a java a look and feel graphics
105

105

00:08:34,280  -->  00:08:42,290
repository here and there is a download button so click on download and the link we want is the one up here click on
106

106

00:08:42,290  -->  00:08:48,580
Accept licenses and I'm going to click
on this downloads so we can download it and
107

107

00:08:48,580  -->  00:08:54,660
save this in my case to the desktop
just put it somewhere on your computer and then
108

108

00:08:54,660  -->  00:09:02,480
I'm going to open it I'm going to show it in finder and unzip it so next now I've done that I'm going to
109

109

00:09:02,480  -->  00:09:03,550
add it to our
110

110

00:09:03,550  -->  00:09:14,260
projects so go back to the project and click on controls right
click open module settings and click on
111

111

00:09:14,260  -->  00:09:21,200
+ and and select jars on directories I'm
going to navigate to the folder where
112

112

00:09:21,200  -->  00:09:26,110
I've just unzipped that jar file in this case
its gonna be on the desktop going to
113

113

00:09:26,110  -->  00:09:32,210
select the jar file and click on ok and
this message will pop up automatically that
114

114

00:09:32,210  -->  00:09:36,570
Idea can't determine what kind of files so even
though their is images in there we're
115

115

00:09:36,570  -->  00:09:41,110
going to choose classes because really
the newest match and the reason that
116

116

00:09:41,110  -->  00:09:45,360
we are selecting classes here is that its gonna
add the jar to the class path which is
117

117

00:09:45,360  -->  00:09:49,350
what we want so click on that point we have now got access to that
118

118

00:09:49,350  -->  00:09:52,930
jar file and if you wanted to another way
of doing this would be to actually
119

119

00:09:52,930  -->  00:10:01,140
delete this and ok that and we could instead just
right click click on reveal in finder
120

120

00:10:01,140  -->  00:10:05,970
and it might be on explorer if your on Windows click
on that that's going to navigate to the
121

121

00:10:05,970  -->  00:10:09,430
folder containing these files and then
what we could do is we could take the jar
122

122

00:10:09,430  -->  00:10:15,570
file copy it and paste it into that
folder and we are going to the controls
123

123

00:10:15,570  -->  00:10:20,280
directory where my code is paste it in
there and that way the actual jar file
124

124

00:10:20,280  -->  00:10:23,600
is in the project which might be easier
in case you're sort of moving
125

125

00:10:23,600  -->  00:10:28,700
or you accidentally delete the jar file from
the desktop so that's the case do the
126

126

00:10:28,700  -->  00:10:33,070
same thing though you come back here notice
how it appeared automatically there right
127

127

00:10:33,070  -->  00:10:36,070
click open module Settings
128

128

00:10:39,370  -->  00:10:46,160
add it jars directory this time i'm going to select it
from there because its in our project click ok
129

129

00:10:46,160  -->  00:10:52,530
choose classes and ultimately click OK and
that's now available in the class path
130

130

00:10:52,530  -->  00:10:56,400
that will be able to actually use it so now
that we actually got these icons in our
131

131

00:10:56,400  -->  00:11:00,230
class path lets actually add 1 to our buttons contents just to see what it
132

132

00:11:00,230  -->  00:11:06,160
looks like so what we are gonna use is
just click over here we can actually go
133

133

00:11:06,160  -->  00:11:11,340
into their you can sort of see them now so we got toolbar button graphics and their is a general folder
134

134

00:11:11,340  -->  00:11:16,720
we got all these various images here but
the one we are gonna look at is the tip of the
135

135

00:11:16,720  -->  00:11:21,450
day tip of the day 24 and if I just click that we can see
what that is that is that image there
136

136

00:11:21,450  -->  00:11:25,860
we are going to put that on our button so
close it down and obviously that was a light
137

137

00:11:25,860  -->  00:11:31,350
bulp icon so we are gonna add a graphic child element
to the button element and inside that an
138

138

00:11:31,350  -->  00:11:34,910
ImageView element so that this actually
shows up so how do we do well we
139

139

00:11:34,910  -->  00:11:41,760
come back here to button we need to get rid of
this closing tag because we need to add
140

140

00:11:41,760  -->  00:11:44,940
something in there and I'll actually add the one manually like so and just
141

141

00:11:44,940  -->  00:11:49,170
move that over because within their now what we need to do is firstly we need to add graphic
142

142

00:11:50,730  -->  00:12:02,870
like so and then within that we need
add an image so......and then
143

143

00:12:02,870  -->  00:12:06,670
we specify our image so how do we do that we'll put....
144

144

00:12:07,840  -->  00:12:10,840
....
145

145

00:12:11,450  -->  00:12:19,040
...and how do we
146

146

00:12:19,040  -->  00:12:19,980
access these
147

147

00:12:19,980  -->  00:12:31,120
well we got this in our class path we can just put.....
148

148

00:12:31,120  -->  00:12:34,640
.....
149

149

00:12:36,970  -->  00:12:39,970
.......and if we run that
150

150

00:12:48,820  -->  00:12:52,910
notice how the icon has now appearing to
the left of the text which is pretty
151

151

00:12:52,910  -->  00:12:59,820
cool looks pretty nice so just before we
finish this video we added obviously the icon
152

152

00:12:59,820  -->  00:13:04,170
for the button you can see how we used an actual property to ultimately enable us to
153

153

00:13:04,170  -->  00:13:08,110
actually put an image so that covers
what we mostly commonly do with a
154

154

00:13:08,110  -->  00:13:11,160
button set its text and graphics
its  the two main things you
155

155

00:13:11,160  -->  00:13:15,200
probably use it for so really button
can just have text or just a graphic
156

156

00:13:15,200  -->  00:13:19,380
or both and obviously in this scenario we are showing
both on the screen so let's just have a
157

157

00:13:19,380  -->  00:13:23,640
look at the label control before we
finish this video I know we've already seen it
158

158

00:13:23,640  -->  00:13:27,630
so we're are not gonna spend a lot of time
onit but like the button will most often
159

159

00:13:27,630  -->  00:13:33,600
change the label's text or graphic and
I'm we are gonna do it in the same way so we'll add a label...
160

160

00:13:33,600  -->  00:13:34,970
to the grid
161

161

00:13:34,970  -->  00:13:43,840
this time we are gonna add a column index one go
ahead and do that inside the button so....
162

162

00:13:43,840  -->  00:13:53,930
.....
163

163

00:13:53,930  -->  00:14:02,170
..I won't close it off
because we're going to put these same
164

164

00:14:02,170  -->  00:14:06,950
items in the middle their so lets also add an image for
that so....
165

165

00:14:06,950  -->  00:14:18,020
.....
166

166

00:14:18,020  -->  00:14:25,240
....
167

167

00:14:25,910  -->  00:14:31,490
.....and again
just to be sure in case you're not
168

168

00:14:31,490  -->  00:14:33,100
following
169

169

00:14:33,100  -->  00:14:38,840
ampersand / means to go to the root and by
specifying toolbar button graphics we are
170

170

00:14:38,840  -->  00:14:43,130
basically saying to look in the jar file
which is in the class path / general is the
171

171

00:14:43,130  -->  00:14:44,320
sub-folder
172

172

00:14:44,320  -->  00:14:49,490
and information24.gif if we scroll down we should see the gif their and that's the
173

173

00:14:49,490  -->  00:14:54,290
little gif that we gonna be actually using
for the label ok so I'll run that
174

174

00:14:57,570  -->  00:15:02,600
you can see that's working ok we got a label and also
an image to the left hand side so I'm gonna
175

175

00:15:02,600  -->  00:15:06,510
finish this video here now in the next view we are
gonna come back and we're going to make
176

176

00:15:06,510  -->  00:15:10,610
a few other changes we are going to change the
color and font which we have done before
177

177

00:15:10,610  -->  00:15:14,470
and play around with a few of the
other settings relating to this control
178

178

00:15:14,470  -->  00:15:16,130
so I'll see you in the next video
