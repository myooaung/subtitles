00:00:04,710  -->  00:00:07,319
Alright so in the last video we've got
2

2

00:00:07,319  -->  00:00:10,019
our application working but alluded to
3

3

00:00:10,019  -->  00:00:11,670
the fact that there were a few potential
4

4

00:00:11,670  -->  00:00:13,379
problems so let's go through in this
5

5

00:00:13,379  -->  00:00:15,990
video and discuss those problems and
6

6

00:00:15,990  -->  00:00:18,210
also how to resolve them so the first
7

7

00:00:18,210  -->  00:00:20,400
problem is what if the user enters a
8

8

00:00:20,400  -->  00:00:22,560
negative number for the year of birth
9

9

00:00:22,560  -->  00:00:24,570
what will happen to the user if they
10

10

00:00:24,570  -->  00:00:26,070
enter some letters instead of only
11

11

00:00:26,070  -->  00:00:28,260
numbers so let's actually test these two
12

12

00:00:28,260  -->  00:00:30,000
conditions by running the application
13

13

00:00:30,000  -->  00:00:35,399
again so firstly if a year of birth I'm
14

14

00:00:35,399  -->  00:00:38,520
going to enter minus 20 there and I'm
15

15

00:00:38,520  -->  00:00:42,540
going to enter my name again and it says
16

16

00:00:42,540  -->  00:00:45,360
now that I'm 2038 years old which is
17

17

00:00:45,360  -->  00:00:48,809
obviously not correct so what we need is
18

18

00:00:48,809  -->  00:00:51,510
to add some condition that would check
19

19

00:00:51,510  -->  00:00:54,390
if the birth year is positive or even
20

20

00:00:54,390  -->  00:00:57,510
better check a valid range so what we'll
21

21

00:00:57,510  -->  00:00:59,730
do is we'll check an age range of 0 to
22

22

00:00:59,730  -->  00:01:02,640
100 and if the age is not in that range
23

23

00:01:02,640  -->  00:01:04,619
we'll print an error message to the user
24

24

00:01:04,619  -->  00:01:06,689
all right so that's the first test but
25

25

00:01:06,689  -->  00:01:09,060
let's run our application again now to
26

26

00:01:09,060  -->  00:01:10,440
test what happens if we enter some
27

27

00:01:10,440  -->  00:01:14,340
letters instead of numbers so here what
28

28

00:01:14,340  -->  00:01:15,690
I'm going to do is I'm going to type in
29

29

00:01:15,690  -->  00:01:21,060
10 for the year of birth and you can see
30

30

00:01:21,060  -->  00:01:22,080
what's happened there we get an
31

31

00:01:22,080  -->  00:01:24,689
exception an error and the program exits
32

32

00:01:24,689  -->  00:01:27,780
and in fact it's a similar message to
33

33

00:01:27,780  -->  00:01:30,750
its similar exception to the exception
34

34

00:01:30,750  -->  00:01:33,000
we saw in a previous video that has a
35

35

00:01:33,000  -->  00:01:35,310
number format exception but this one is
36

36

00:01:35,310  -->  00:01:38,610
an input mismatch exception so basically
37

37

00:01:38,610  -->  00:01:41,360
the program crashed because next int
38

38

00:01:41,360  -->  00:01:44,790
cannot pass the text Tim as a number and
39

39

00:01:44,790  -->  00:01:47,579
a quest for that reason and you can see
40

40

00:01:47,579  -->  00:01:50,490
that conveniently here main dot Java 11
41

41

00:01:50,490  -->  00:01:51,630
is telling us that this is where it
42

42

00:01:51,630  -->  00:01:54,060
crashed on line 11 and that's that call
43

43

00:01:54,060  -->  00:01:56,520
to next int to try and convert what was
44

44

00:01:56,520  -->  00:02:00,030
typed into a number so it's clear at
45

45

00:02:00,030  -->  00:02:01,549
this point that we've got two problems
46

46

00:02:01,549  -->  00:02:04,079
one is with negative numbers as years
47

47

00:02:04,079  -->  00:02:06,810
and the other is with entering letters
48

48

00:02:06,810  -->  00:02:08,340
into the past intimates that are in
49

49

00:02:08,340  -->  00:02:10,950
other words entering numbers in the area
50

50

00:02:10,950  -->  00:02:13,439
where it's asking for an age so let's
51

51

00:02:13,439  -->  00:02:15,090
first deal with the problem of negative
52

52

00:02:15,090  -->  00:02:18,240
years so after we calculate age we were
53

53

00:02:18,240  -->  00:02:19,860
checking against a range of years from
54

54

00:02:19,860  -->  00:02:23,430
zero to 100 so to do this let's add an
55

55

00:02:23,430  -->  00:02:25,560
if statement I'm going to add that
56

56

00:02:25,560  -->  00:02:28,860
directly below here the age and I'm
57

57

00:02:28,860  -->  00:02:33,030
going to type if parentheses age is
58

58

00:02:33,030  -->  00:02:36,150
greater than equal to zero then two
59

59

00:02:36,150  -->  00:02:38,760
ampersands two ampersands which is
60

60

00:02:38,760  -->  00:02:43,040
indicating and age less than equal to
61

61

00:02:43,040  -->  00:02:46,170
100 we've got the closing parentheses
62

62

00:02:46,170  -->  00:02:48,390
there and if that's the case I'm also
63

63

00:02:48,390  -->  00:02:50,580
going to put a left curly brace there
64

64

00:02:50,580  -->  00:02:52,620
and press enter the right one gets added
65

65

00:02:52,620  -->  00:02:54,420
for us automatically and what we're
66

66

00:02:54,420  -->  00:02:56,640
going to do is move the print line
67

67

00:02:56,640  -->  00:02:59,490
statement into the block so what I mean
68

68

00:02:59,490  -->  00:03:01,140
by that is I'm going to come down here
69

69

00:03:01,140  -->  00:03:04,860
I'm going to copy this line going to cut
70

70

00:03:04,860  -->  00:03:07,010
it out and paste it into that block down
71

71

00:03:07,010  -->  00:03:09,720
so basically what that's checking is to
72

72

00:03:09,720  -->  00:03:11,790
see whether age is now greater than
73

73

00:03:11,790  -->  00:03:14,100
equal to zero and it's less than equal
74

74

00:03:14,100  -->  00:03:17,070
to 100 and then and only if both of
75

75

00:03:17,070  -->  00:03:18,960
those conditions are true will it print
76

76

00:03:18,960  -->  00:03:21,330
out this output so if age is in the
77

77

00:03:21,330  -->  00:03:23,940
range it's going to print that but if
78

78

00:03:23,940  -->  00:03:25,920
age isn't in the range what we should do
79

79

00:03:25,920  -->  00:03:27,960
is print out a message to the user so
80

80

00:03:27,960  -->  00:03:29,910
let's do that so if I come down here
81

81

00:03:29,910  -->  00:03:31,830
after the closing right curly brace and
82

82

00:03:31,830  -->  00:03:34,830
add else open another code block by
83

83

00:03:34,830  -->  00:03:36,690
typing in a left curly brace and the
84

84

00:03:36,690  -->  00:03:37,590
right one gets added for us
85

85

00:03:37,590  -->  00:03:40,500
automatically then we're going to print
86

86

00:03:40,500  -->  00:03:45,540
out invalid year of birth all right so
87

87

00:03:45,540  -->  00:03:48,570
this else will be executed if age is out of range
88

88

00:03:48,570  -->  00:03:50,700
meaning if age is a negative number or
89

89

00:03:50,700  -->  00:03:53,430
the number entered is greater than 100
90

90

00:03:53,430  -->  00:03:55,560
so let's actually run this to see that
91

91

00:03:55,560  -->  00:04:00,480
it works confirm that it works so for
92

92

00:04:00,480  -->  00:04:01,590
the year of birth I'm going to start
93

93

00:04:01,590  -->  00:04:05,820
this time by typing negative 20 and now
94

94

00:04:05,820  -->  00:04:08,400
we want to enter the name so I'll get
95

95

00:04:08,400  -->  00:04:12,420
into the name is Tim and now it exits
96

96

00:04:12,420  -->  00:04:14,040
the program but it prints out a message
97

97

00:04:14,040  -->  00:04:16,739
to say invalid year of birth so that's
98

98

00:04:16,739  -->  00:04:18,870
good it's no actually working whereas
99

99

00:04:18,870  -->  00:04:20,580
what it wasn't working before and we'll
100

100

00:04:20,580  -->  00:04:22,680
run it one more time this time with a
101

101

00:04:22,680  -->  00:04:25,350
valid value so I'll enter the value
102

102

00:04:25,350  -->  00:04:29,610
again 54 actually that was an error so
103

103

00:04:29,610  -->  00:04:30,810
I'll just close that program down and
104

104

00:04:30,810  -->  00:04:32,720
we'll start it again
105

105

00:04:32,720  -->  00:04:36,900
so you both should be 1964 and my name
106

106

00:04:36,900  -->  00:04:40,020
Tim and it's still calculating it
107

107

00:04:40,020  -->  00:04:41,250
correctly and you can see that the
108

108

00:04:41,250  -->  00:04:43,350
output we're getting is consistent with
109

109

00:04:43,350  -->  00:04:46,230
us entering a valid age all right so so
110

110

00:04:46,230  -->  00:04:49,050
far so good the next step is now to
111

111

00:04:49,050  -->  00:04:51,630
cater for the fact if the user enter
112

112

00:04:51,630  -->  00:04:53,700
some letters for the Year important now
113

113

00:04:53,700  -->  00:04:55,560
for that we want to use a method called
114

114

00:04:55,560  -->  00:04:58,890
has next int which returns a boolean
115

115

00:04:58,890  -->  00:05:01,230
type so let's type the code in and then
116

116

00:05:01,230  -->  00:05:03,150
I'll discuss it so I'm going to come
117

117

00:05:03,150  -->  00:05:04,890
down and close this window down first so
118

118

00:05:04,890  -->  00:05:07,320
I've got a bit more space and I want to
119

119

00:05:07,320  -->  00:05:10,980
put the code here after the year of
120

120

00:05:10,980  -->  00:05:12,480
birth entry here so I'm gonna put that
121

121

00:05:12,480  -->  00:05:14,760
here so what I'm going to top there is
122

122

00:05:14,760  -->  00:05:16,290
boolean this is immediately after the
123

123

00:05:16,290  -->  00:05:18,720
entire year of birth system output we're
124

124

00:05:18,720  -->  00:05:25,310
not billion has next int equals scanner
125

125

00:05:25,310  -->  00:05:30,210
dot has a next int and semicolon so that
126

126

00:05:30,210  -->  00:05:31,470
method that I've used there that has
127

127

00:05:31,470  -->  00:05:34,530
next int that checks to see if the next
128

128

00:05:34,530  -->  00:05:36,780
input entered is a number in this case
129

129

00:05:36,780  -->  00:05:38,250
in integer because we're using the
130

130

00:05:38,250  -->  00:05:40,860
interplay component however it will not
131

131

00:05:40,860  -->  00:05:43,110
remove it from the scanner so in other
132

132

00:05:43,110  -->  00:05:45,120
words it'll ask the user for input and
133

133

00:05:45,120  -->  00:05:47,850
check to see if it qualifies as an int
134

134

00:05:47,850  -->  00:05:50,760
if it doesn't qualify the method will
135

135

00:05:50,760  -->  00:05:53,370
return false so what that means is it
136

136

00:05:53,370  -->  00:05:55,440
allows us to avoid generating type
137

137

00:05:55,440  -->  00:05:58,890
errors when using next int but we need
138

138

00:05:58,890  -->  00:06:01,530
to add some extra code to add to the
139

139

00:06:01,530  -->  00:06:04,290
flow so that is the case so what we need
140

140

00:06:04,290  -->  00:06:06,600
to do is check to see if the boolean now
141

141

00:06:06,600  -->  00:06:09,600
has next int is true and if it is we can
142

142

00:06:09,600  -->  00:06:12,120
continue with our calculations so to do
143

143

00:06:12,120  -->  00:06:14,220
this where you need to add all our code
144

144

00:06:14,220  -->  00:06:15,900
below the boolean except for the scanner
145

145

00:06:15,900  -->  00:06:19,680
that closed inside an if statement so
146

146

00:06:19,680  -->  00:06:21,240
let's go ahead and add that if statement
147

147

00:06:21,240  -->  00:06:24,030
and close it out after the last else I'm
148

148

00:06:24,030  -->  00:06:28,260
going to come down here and put if has
149

149

00:06:28,260  -->  00:06:30,390
next int then we'll open a left curly
150

150

00:06:30,390  -->  00:06:31,410
brace and the right wing gets added
151

151

00:06:31,410  -->  00:06:33,300
automatically we then need to take a
152

152

00:06:33,300  -->  00:06:35,760
copy of all of this code up to but not
153

153

00:06:35,760  -->  00:06:38,370
including the scanner got close we're
154

154

00:06:38,370  -->  00:06:42,150
going to cut that and paste it in the
155

155

00:06:42,150  -->  00:06:43,560
code block so in other words after the
156

156

00:06:43,560  -->  00:06:45,810
left curly brace and before the right one
157

157

00:06:45,810  -->  00:06:47,550
I'm just going to clean up these blank
158

158

00:06:47,550  -->  00:06:48,990
lines here just so it's a bit more
159

159

00:06:48,990  -->  00:06:51,930
readable so now we're catering for the
160

160

00:06:51,930  -->  00:06:54,210
fact that it is a valid number but if it
161

161

00:06:54,210  -->  00:06:56,040
isn't a valid number so in other words
162

162

00:06:56,040  -->  00:06:58,110
there has next int appear if that
163

163

00:06:58,110  -->  00:07:00,600
returns false currently nothing will be
164

164

00:07:00,600  -->  00:07:02,850
printed but we want to inform the user
165

165

00:07:02,850  -->  00:07:05,130
that they've made an error so let's add
166

166

00:07:05,130  -->  00:07:08,160
an else to the has next if statement and
167

167

00:07:08,160  -->  00:07:09,900
just as a side note notice how we're
168

168

00:07:09,900  -->  00:07:12,180
able to test one if statement inside
169

169

00:07:12,180  -->  00:07:14,820
another if statement so we've got it if
170

170

00:07:14,820  -->  00:07:16,169
here on line 14
171

171

00:07:16,169  -->  00:07:18,030
we of course I got another if here on
172

172

00:07:18,030  -->  00:07:21,030
line 22 so that's pretty cool so let's
173

173

00:07:21,030  -->  00:07:22,410
add this else then the else is going to
174

174

00:07:22,410  -->  00:07:24,510
be now down here and you can see that
175

175

00:07:24,510  -->  00:07:27,270
IntelliJ helpfully puts a line to show
176

176

00:07:27,270  -->  00:07:29,280
you where the if is you can see there's
177

177

00:07:29,280  -->  00:07:31,080
an a line below the first if they're
178

178

00:07:31,080  -->  00:07:32,150
telling you that this is all related
179

179

00:07:32,150  -->  00:07:34,470
it's also a line down here telling you
180

180

00:07:34,470  -->  00:07:36,270
this parts related so we know we want to
181

181

00:07:36,270  -->  00:07:39,090
put an else there to handle the
182

182

00:07:39,090  -->  00:07:41,669
situation where someone the user hasn't
183

183

00:07:41,669  -->  00:07:43,680
entered a valid number in other words if
184

184

00:07:43,680  -->  00:07:46,860
it has next int billion returns false so
185

185

00:07:46,860  -->  00:07:48,600
that's the case what we want to do is
186

186

00:07:48,600  -->  00:07:51,229
print our message
187

187

00:07:51,229  -->  00:07:58,919
unable to pars year of birth alright so
188

188

00:07:58,919  -->  00:08:00,360
now that we've written that code we've
189

189

00:08:00,360  -->  00:08:03,060
catered for an invalid number being
190

190

00:08:03,060  -->  00:08:05,460
entered if a number has been it hasn't
191

191

00:08:05,460  -->  00:08:07,110
been entered using valid digits on other
192

192

00:08:07,110  -->  00:08:09,600
words numbers not using numbers using
193

193

00:08:09,600  -->  00:08:12,810
letters or symbols we've got that care
194

194

00:08:12,810  -->  00:08:14,190
before and a voice I've got that catered
195

195

00:08:14,190  -->  00:08:15,930
for the fact that a an age has been
196

196

00:08:15,930  -->  00:08:17,760
entered outside of a valid range that
197

197

00:08:17,760  -->  00:08:20,910
we've defined has been between 0 and 100
198

198

00:08:20,910  -->  00:08:25,410
so let's run the program we're going to
199

199

00:08:25,410  -->  00:08:28,680
start again to top ABC for the year of
200

200

00:08:28,680  -->  00:08:32,280
birth notice that straight away we get
201

201

00:08:32,280  -->  00:08:34,140
an error unable to pass here of birth
202

202

00:08:34,140  -->  00:08:36,719
because we used letters and the program
203

203

00:08:36,719  -->  00:08:39,270
immediately exits and it doesn't do any
204

204

00:08:39,270  -->  00:08:41,729
more processing including the fact that
205

205

00:08:41,729  -->  00:08:44,310
it doesn't ask for the name now the
206

206

00:08:44,310  -->  00:08:45,690
reason it's not asking for the name is
207

207

00:08:45,690  -->  00:08:48,959
has next int at a value of false we're
208

208

00:08:48,959  -->  00:08:53,010
only running this code here if the value
209

209

00:08:53,010  -->  00:08:54,660
was true so that's why that didn't get
210

210

00:08:54,660  -->  00:08:55,709
executed the only thing that get
211

211

00:08:55,709  -->  00:08:58,350
executed was the else here because has
212

212

00:08:58,350  -->  00:08:59,700
next int was false
213

213

00:08:59,700  -->  00:09:01,200
and we got the error message unable to
214

214

00:09:01,200  -->  00:09:05,360
pass year of birth so let's try it again
215

215

00:09:05,360  -->  00:09:07,500
in year with birth I'll enter a valid
216

216

00:09:07,500  -->  00:09:12,090
one we're still getting the right
217

217

00:09:12,090  -->  00:09:14,100
results if a valid range is entered and
218

218

00:09:14,100  -->  00:09:16,500
we'll do one more let's just try another
219

219

00:09:16,500  -->  00:09:18,390
one we'll try 101 this time which we
220

220

00:09:18,390  -->  00:09:21,600
know is invalid Tim invalid year of
221

221

00:09:21,600  -->  00:09:23,880
birth so that's also working and just to
222

222

00:09:23,880  -->  00:09:26,820
do one other final test Oberon minus 20
223

223

00:09:26,820  -->  00:09:30,480
again Tim and weave correctly getting an
224

224

00:09:30,480  -->  00:09:34,470
invalid year of birth showing again so
225

225

00:09:34,470  -->  00:09:35,700
I'll end on a positive note let's put a
226

226

00:09:35,700  -->  00:09:38,780
different number here in 1980 Bob and
227

227

00:09:38,780  -->  00:09:42,030
it's correctly returning 38 which would
228

228

00:09:42,030  -->  00:09:45,330
be correct in 2018 if Bob was born in
229

229

00:09:45,330  -->  00:09:48,270
1980 well so she's as you can see that
230

230

00:09:48,270  -->  00:09:49,890
we've got an application now we've built
231

231

00:09:49,890  -->  00:09:53,010
in some logic and some validation and
232

232

00:09:53,010  -->  00:09:55,230
although there's only a few lines of
233

233

00:09:55,230  -->  00:09:56,640
code there it's managed to do quite a
234

234

00:09:56,640  -->  00:09:58,860
few things to validate to make sure that
235

235

00:09:58,860  -->  00:10:00,690
numbers are entered and also a number
236

236

00:10:00,690  -->  00:10:03,540
within a specific range as well so the
237

237

00:10:03,540  -->  00:10:05,370
application is interactive meaning that
238

238

00:10:05,370  -->  00:10:07,380
we can interact with it by entering some
239

239

00:10:07,380  -->  00:10:08,940
data to the console and you saw in this
240

240

00:10:08,940  -->  00:10:11,280
case the year of birth and name and the
241

241

00:10:11,280  -->  00:10:13,410
application then calculating the users
242

242

00:10:13,410  -->  00:10:16,290
age based on the year of birth all right
243

243

00:10:16,290  -->  00:10:17,340
so that's all for this video
244

244

00:10:17,340  -->  00:10:18,780
I hope you got a lot out of it let's
245

245

00:10:18,780  -->  00:10:22,250
move on now to the next one.
