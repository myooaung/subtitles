00:00:05.590  -->  00:00:07.020
<v Tim Buchalka>In this video, we want to download</v>
2

2

00:00:07.020  -->  00:00:11.030
and instal IntelliJ IDEA for Linux platform.
3

3

00:00:11.030  -->  00:00:15.560
Specifically, we're gonna be using Ubuntu 18.04.01.
4

4

00:00:15.560  -->  00:00:17.430
The reason for that, that is the LTS,
5

5

00:00:17.430  -->  00:00:19.970
the long term support version of Ubuntu
6

6

00:00:19.970  -->  00:00:22.510
as of the time I'm recording this video.
7

7

00:00:22.510  -->  00:00:24.470
Now, what I wanna do is first show you
8

8

00:00:24.470  -->  00:00:26.520
the two versions that are available.
9

9

00:00:26.520  -->  00:00:28.301
So I've gone to jetbrains.com,
10

10

00:00:28.301  -->  00:00:29.530
you won't need to do that
11

11

00:00:29.530  -->  00:00:31.320
and that's because the commands I'm gonna be showing you
12

12

00:00:31.320  -->  00:00:34.350
are from the command line to do the installation.
13

13

00:00:34.350  -->  00:00:35.830
But I just wanna show you the two versions.
14

14

00:00:35.830  -->  00:00:38.940
I'm gonna go to tools here and click on IntelliJ IDEA.
15

15

00:00:38.940  -->  00:00:41.050
That's the integrated development environment,
16

16

00:00:41.050  -->  00:00:43.600
or editor, we will be using for this course.
17

17

00:00:43.600  -->  00:00:45.120
I'll just click on yes to accept that,
18

18

00:00:45.120  -->  00:00:47.050
close the cookies declaration,
19

19

00:00:47.050  -->  00:00:48.140
and I'm going to download, again,
20

20

00:00:48.140  -->  00:00:50.490
purely just to show you the various versions.
21

21

00:00:50.490  -->  00:00:52.200
We've got two versions there.
22

22

00:00:52.200  -->  00:00:55.490
We've got an Ultimate Edition, which is a paid tool,
23

23

00:00:55.490  -->  00:00:58.210
and a Community Edition, which is a free one.
24

24

00:00:58.210  -->  00:00:59.770
In this course, the Community Edition
25

25

00:00:59.770  -->  00:01:00.890
will do everything you need.
26

26

00:01:00.890  -->  00:01:03.640
So there's no need to pay for IntelliJ,
27

27

00:01:03.640  -->  00:01:05.273
unless you're doing some more professional things.
28

28

00:01:05.273  -->  00:01:06.870
And you can see over here to the left,
29

29

00:01:06.870  -->  00:01:09.210
we've got JavaScript, Java Enterprise Edition,
30

30

00:01:09.210  -->  00:01:11.220
Spring, and so on and so forth.
31

31

00:01:11.220  -->  00:01:13.750
So if you need that extra functionality in the future,
32

32

00:01:13.750  -->  00:01:16.410
you can come back and grab the Ultimate Edition.
33

33

00:01:16.410  -->  00:01:17.700
You will need to pay for that,
34

34

00:01:17.700  -->  00:01:19.810
though there is a free 30 day trial.
35

35

00:01:19.810  -->  00:01:22.500
In fact, I can extend that so you can send me a message
36

36

00:01:22.500  -->  00:01:25.510
if you need to extend the trial for the Ultimate Edition.
37

37

00:01:25.510  -->  00:01:26.810
But I think the Community Edition
38

38

00:01:26.810  -->  00:01:28.750
will do everything you need to do.
39

39

00:01:28.750  -->  00:01:30.010
So let's close that page down
40

40

00:01:30.010  -->  00:01:31.250
because I mentioned we're going to be using
41

41

00:01:31.250  -->  00:01:32.550
the command line for this.
42

42

00:01:33.790  -->  00:01:36.400
I'm gonna open a terminal window, clicking on activities,
43

43

00:01:36.400  -->  00:01:38.630
I'm just gonna type the first letter 't',
44

44

00:01:38.630  -->  00:01:40.330
brings this up, and click on terminal.
45

45

00:01:40.330  -->  00:01:42.540
Now there's two commands here
46

46

00:01:42.540  -->  00:01:45.130
if you want to instal the Community Edition.
47

47

00:01:45.130  -->  00:01:46.386
I'll type in the command first,
48

48

00:01:46.386  -->  00:01:49.970
that's gonna be sudo, space, snap, space, instal,
49

49

00:01:49.970  -->  00:01:52.750
space, intellij,
50

50

00:01:52.750  -->  00:01:54.280
dash, idea,
51

51

00:01:54.280  -->  00:01:55.890
would be the name of the IDE,
52

52

00:01:55.890  -->  00:01:56.893
dash, community.
53

53

00:01:58.800  -->  00:02:01.940
Now replace community with ultimate,
54

54

00:02:01.940  -->  00:02:03.790
if you want to instal the Ultimate Edition,
55

55

00:02:03.790  -->  00:02:05.770
the paid version of IntelliJ,
56

56

00:02:05.770  -->  00:02:08.280
remembering that you'll get a 30 day trial
57

57

00:02:08.280  -->  00:02:09.260
if you want to do that.
58

58

00:02:09.260  -->  00:02:11.050
But in my case, I'm going to instal the free
59

59

00:02:11.050  -->  00:02:12.600
and open source community edition.
60

60

00:02:12.600  -->  00:02:14.470
So I'm gonna leave the word community there.
61

61

00:02:14.470  -->  00:02:17.473
And then I got space, dash, dash, classic.
62

62

00:02:19.220  -->  00:02:20.420
Press enter there.
63

63

00:02:20.420  -->  00:02:21.920
I'm gonna type in my password.
64

64

00:02:23.960  -->  00:02:27.040
That's now going to download and then instal
65

65

00:02:27.040  -->  00:02:29.950
the latest version of IntelliJ IDEA directly down
66

66

00:02:29.950  -->  00:02:33.170
to our, into our Linux distro.
67

67

00:02:33.170  -->  00:02:34.980
So this version of Linux that we're running,
68

68

00:02:34.980  -->  00:02:38.800
which again was Ubuntu 18.0 4.1.
69

69

00:02:40.770  -->  00:02:42.070
Okay, you can see the download's completed.
70

70

00:02:42.070  -->  00:02:43.780
It's installing.
71

71

00:02:43.780  -->  00:02:44.850
And you can see in this case for me,
72

72

00:02:44.850  -->  00:02:48.940
it's installed the 2019.1.3 version,
73

73

00:02:48.940  -->  00:02:50.880
which is as of the time I'm recording this video,
74

74

00:02:50.880  -->  00:02:54.630
the latest version of the IntelliJ Community Edition.
75

75

00:02:54.630  -->  00:02:56.240
So we've actually now did successfully
76

76

00:02:56.240  -->  00:02:58.070
downloaded and installed there.
77

77

00:02:58.070  -->  00:02:59.060
What we can do is start.
78

78

00:02:59.060  -->  00:03:01.515
Into startup, you can come back to activities,
79

79

00:03:01.515  -->  00:03:04.530
and we can just type in 'in',
80

80

00:03:04.530  -->  00:03:07.060
noting that we've got an IntelliJ IDEA icon there.
81

81

00:03:07.060  -->  00:03:09.710
We can click on that and close up our command window,
82

82

00:03:11.020  -->  00:03:13.195
give that a moment to start.
83

83

00:03:13.195  -->  00:03:14.380
Let me just go through some of the settings now
84

84

00:03:14.380  -->  00:03:16.030
just to show you what happens here.
85

85

00:03:16.030  -->  00:03:18.860
So firstly, you get them when you first click
86

86

00:03:18.860  -->  00:03:21.330
on start IntelliJ IDEA for the first time.
87

87

00:03:21.330  -->  00:03:23.240
We've got an option to import settings
88

88

00:03:23.240  -->  00:03:24.470
from a previous installation,
89

89

00:03:24.470  -->  00:03:25.470
that would be the top option,
90

90

00:03:25.470  -->  00:03:27.440
config or installation folder.
91

91

00:03:27.440  -->  00:03:28.910
And that would be if you got an old version
92

92

00:03:28.910  -->  00:03:30.300
and you want to import the settings.
93

93

00:03:30.300  -->  00:03:33.060
Now perhaps you've configured it in a specific way,
94

94

00:03:33.060  -->  00:03:34.330
if you want to do that click on that
95

95

00:03:34.330  -->  00:03:36.060
and navigate to that folder.
96

96

00:03:36.060  -->  00:03:38.040
In my case, this is a brand new installation.
97

97

00:03:38.040  -->  00:03:40.010
I'm gonna check, or leave selected,
98

98

00:03:40.010  -->  00:03:42.363
do not import settings, and click OK.
99

99

00:03:43.810  -->  00:03:46.310
Next I'm going to agree to JetBrains privacy policy
100

100

00:03:46.310  -->  00:03:48.010
by checking the check box.
101

101

00:03:48.010  -->  00:03:49.173
I click on continue.
102

102

00:03:50.180  -->  00:03:53.890
We've got the option to send anonymous usage statistics
103

103

00:03:53.890  -->  00:03:56.200
to JetBrains, I'm going to click on don't send,
104

104

00:03:56.200  -->  00:03:57.720
but obviously you can choose the other option
105

105

00:03:57.720  -->  00:03:59.370
if you prefer.
106

106

00:03:59.370  -->  00:04:01.140
We've then got a choice of theme,
107

107

00:04:01.140  -->  00:04:02.760
do we wanna use a dark background
108

108

00:04:02.760  -->  00:04:04.290
with Darcula or Light.
109

109

00:04:04.290  -->  00:04:06.090
I'm gonna select Light because that's better
110

110

00:04:06.090  -->  00:04:09.060
for video purposes, but generally I recommend Darcula
111

111

00:04:09.060  -->  00:04:11.060
for developing, and that's what I would,
112

112

00:04:11.060  -->  00:04:12.920
from my normal development machine,
113

113

00:04:12.920  -->  00:04:16.260
I do certainly use dark background.
114

114

00:04:16.260  -->  00:04:18.460
Click on next for default plugins.
115

115

00:04:18.460  -->  00:04:19.620
I'm not gonna change anything there,
116

116

00:04:19.620  -->  00:04:21.140
you've got the options to disable
117

117

00:04:21.140  -->  00:04:23.640
or remove some options if you want.
118

118

00:04:23.640  -->  00:04:25.200
Those things are fine as is,
119

119

00:04:25.200  -->  00:04:27.130
I don't think we need to change anything there.
120

120

00:04:27.130  -->  00:04:29.150
And actually, you can always go back later
121

121

00:04:29.150  -->  00:04:31.160
and make these changes if you want to.
122

122

00:04:31.160  -->  00:04:34.320
I'm not going to do anything, I'm gonna click on next.
123

123

00:04:34.320  -->  00:04:36.510
And I've got the option to instal these three things,
124

124

00:04:36.510  -->  00:04:37.930
we won't be using them in the course,
125

125

00:04:37.930  -->  00:04:40.700
so therefore I'm not going to change anything there either.
126

126

00:04:40.700  -->  00:04:43.487
I'm going to click on 'Start using IntelliJ IDEA'.
127

127

00:04:44.590  -->  00:04:46.993
And you can see that's fired up IntelliJ IDEA.
128

128

00:04:48.650  -->  00:04:49.483
All right so at this point,
129

129

00:04:49.483  -->  00:04:52.110
we've now successfully installed IntelliJ IDEA
130

130

00:04:52.110  -->  00:04:53.500
on our Linux platform.
131

131

00:04:53.500  -->  00:04:55.420
There is a little bit more configuration we need to do
132

132

00:04:55.420  -->  00:04:56.860
and there's a separate video in the course
133

133

00:04:56.860  -->  00:04:58.920
for configuring IntelliJ IDEA.
134

134

00:04:58.920  -->  00:05:02.110
And that video is for all version of IntelliJ,
135

135

00:05:02.110  -->  00:05:04.370
for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
136

136

00:05:04.370  -->  00:05:06.490
But the good news is that now that you've got
137

137

00:05:06.490  -->  00:05:08.830
to this stage and IntelliJ's booted,
138

138

00:05:08.830  -->  00:05:10.370
the interface is pretty much identical
139

139

00:05:10.370  -->  00:05:11.390
for all three platforms.
140

140

00:05:11.390  -->  00:05:13.360
So fast forward now to that video,
141

141

00:05:13.360  -->  00:05:15.270
or go to that video in the course,
142

142

00:05:15.270  -->  00:05:16.730
and do the remaining configuration,
143

143

00:05:16.730  -->  00:05:19.370
and we'll be ready to start programming in this course.
144

144

00:05:19.370  -->  00:05:20.970
I'll see you in that next video.
