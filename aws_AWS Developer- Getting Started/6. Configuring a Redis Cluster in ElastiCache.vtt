00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.450
[Autogenerated] before setting up our actual cluster in Alaska cache we

2
00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.620
need to create a security group to use with that cluster are cluster

3
00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.630
will need to accept connections on port 6379.

4
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.140
The default Reddit Sport.

5
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.450
Unfortunately the elastic cache wizard doesn't let us make

6
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.630
a new security group so we should configure this ahead of

7
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.640
time and the web console, navigate to the ec.

8
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.040
Two dashboard in the left menu, select security group,

9
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.340
then click on the create security group button,

10
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.240
we'll name this security group.

11
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.840
Pizza readiness S G.

12
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.310
You also have to enter a description so just put something in there in the VPc,

13
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:46.280
drop down, select our Pizza Vpc in the inbound rules,

14
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.800
click add rule will be opening up port 6379.

15
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.890
So enter that in the port range in the source input field we're

16
00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.200
going to give access only to our Pizza lovers instances since they

17
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.920
can be dynamic and their IPs may change,

18
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.730
we should use their security group to configure this access in the field,

19
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:13.140
type pizza and then select the Pizza Ec two S G option.

20
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.670
Now we're done with this security group.

21
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.040
So click create now we're ready to create our reddest cluster,

22
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.610
navigate to the Alaska cache dashboard on the left side menu,

23
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.630
click the reddest option and then click this create button,

24
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.220
you can leave Red is selected and for our purposes leave the cluster mode

25
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.540
enabled checkbox unchecked will only be using one node for our cluster and

26
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.880
therefore don't need to configure more by enabling cluster.

27
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.270
mode Now let's give our reddest cluster a name, name it.

28
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.340
Pizza dash cluster.

29
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.550
You can select the version of red is to use configure a

30
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.900
different listening port and whether to create read replicas

31
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.450
or not in a production setting, you might want to enable replication,

32
00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.870
but for our purposes we will disable it.

33
00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.270
So change the number of replicas to zero.

34
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.240
Now choose your node type.

35
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.540
These are just ec two instance types that we've seen before.

36
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.450
I'll choose the smallest one.

37
00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.490
T two microbe just to make sure that we stay in the free tier.

38
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.340
Now click save in the advanced reddest settings,

39
00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.400
we need to create a cash sub net group.

40
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.440
This will set our Pizza VPc up to host a last a cache clusters.

41
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.540
We'll name it Pizza cache group.

42
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.700
Then in the VPc IDE drop-down you'll need to select your

43
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.210
Pizza VPc but unfortunately the drop-down doesn't currently

44
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.200
have the VPc names included,

45
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.290
so you'll need to pick the actual IDE you might want to look it

46
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:51.100
up in the VPc dashboard now select both of your sub nets now

47
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.940
we'll configure the security group,

48
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.540
click the pencil icon next to the security group.

49
00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.840
Id and then select the security group we just created.

50
00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.450
Now click save the rest of the options are for encryption,

51
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.850
automated backups and maintenance.

52
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:12.950
Windows will leave these options as is so go ahead and click create like most

53
00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:23.000
things it can take a little while to get the cluster created. So in the meantime we'll modify our application code to use this Red is cache
