1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,330
[Autogenerated] simple storage service shortened to S3

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,740
is one of the oldest services in A W.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,180
S alongside E C.

4
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:13,440
Two, the longevity and appeal of the service is in its simple utility,

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,650
S3 stores objects whatever they may be and allows you to

6
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:21,450
easily configure who can see them as three stores your

7
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,780
objects in whichever region you select,

8
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:27,770
which can be important for legal or regulatory reasons.

9
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:31,460
With the amount of regions available this type of specificity in

10
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:36,310
storage location should satisfy any concern and as three objects

11
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:38,440
are the fundamental storage structure.

12
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,040
An object is basically a file and metadata.

13
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,210
The metadata is used by S3 and includes things like file type and

14
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:50,200
modified date as well as any custom metadata added.

15
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,280
S3 doesn't care what type of object it is and the maximum file

16
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,380
size limit is essentially a joke except in the most extraordinary

17
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,270
circumstances in case you ever need it.

18
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:06,000
The maximum object size that can be stored currently in S3 is

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,820
five terabytes there is an upload limit as well for a single

20
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,210
put operation at five gigabytes.

21
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:15,890
So to get to the five terabyte limit,

22
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:20,180
you would need to use the S3 multipart upload tool.

23
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:24,040
I personally never even come close to approaching that type

24
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,930
of storage and S3 objects in S3 are stored in another

25
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,640
fundamental structure called buckets.

26
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,910
A bucket serves a few purposes in S3 The first is to

27
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:37,740
store your objects simple as that.

28
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,260
The second is to create a URL name space for those objects.

29
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:45,670
For instance if we created a bucket in the organ region and named it

30
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:51,340
Pizza Lovers S3 would assign this URL as the root for any objects

31
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:55,230
because of this the bucket name needs to be unique throughout all of

32
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:57,740
S3 not just in your account,

33
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:03,080
objects are uniquely identified in S3 via their key which is the path

34
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:07,530
and file name excluding the bucket name for instance an object with

35
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,930
the file name image dot PNG in the folder.

36
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:17,200
Images would have a key of images slash image dot PNG when

37
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,060
interacting with S3 via the Cli or SDK s.

38
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,480
The term key is used often so just keep in mind that it

39
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,140
includes the path as well as the file name.

40
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,950
There are a few different ways that you can configure who can

41
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:35,450
access your buckets and objects and how they can access them

42
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,330
but I want to focus on just two.

43
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:42,310
In this course the first is permissions for the bucket or object by default.

44
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:46,790
S three buckets and objects are only viewable by the AWS account which

45
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:52,110
created them permissions enable you to grant access to another AWS

46
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:57,350
account or anyone usually for web resources you would want them to be

47
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:01,140
viewable by everyone but not modifiable.

48
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:06,240
The other access mechanism is using S3 or I am policies,

49
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,830
we discussed policies in the clip on I am and by using those policies

50
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:15,930
you can enable a user on your account to interact with S3 The policies

51
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:20,680
and s3 or I am are modeled the same with some slight differences and we

52
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,040
will try out both in this module.

53
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,030
One thing you may be thinking is that storing all your objects in a

54
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:31,730
single region may increase latency for users making web requests from

55
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:34,850
other locations in the world and that is correct.

56
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:37,440
Users from Australia for instance,

57
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,960
requesting an object from a bucket in say Oregon will

58
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,490
experience more latency than if they were requesting the same

59
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:47,040
object from a bucket in the Sydney region.

60
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,410
One solution for this issue is cross region replication.

61
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:56,090
This is a configured feature of S3 that will automatically copy any files

62
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:00,640
added or modified in an S three bucket to a different region.

63
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,080
This feature can be used to reduce latency or to

64
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,240
increase redundancy of the data.

65
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,850
One consideration though,

66
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:12,610
is that cross region replication will copy to only one other region.

67
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:15,770
If you want to have a worldwide reduction of latency,

68
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:20,140
your best option is cloudfront, which we'll discuss in a later module.

69
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:28,000
S3 definitely has a lot going on, but as we begin working with it, the concepts will definitely begin to stick
