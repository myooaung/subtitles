00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.530
[Autogenerated] well you did it,

2
00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:06.940
you finished all the demos and videos for this course and now it's time

3
00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.170
to clean up the message you made here are almost all the resources we

4
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.930
created in the demo exercises from this course.

5
00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.830
Anything not included here isn't going to cost you anything

6
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.310
things like I am rolls or policies in this video.

7
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.940
I'm gonna show you how to delete everything that's in this list now,

8
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.140
make sure you don't blink.

9
00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.310
It's gonna go quick.

10
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:29.940
So let's get started.

11
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.740
We're gonna be removing everything with the AWS management console.

12
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.970
You can also remove resources with the AWS cli if you prefer.

13
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.640
But I won't be demoing that here.

14
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.590
Let's start with the last a cache.

15
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.640
Delete the reddest cluster.

16
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.620
This is gonna take some time so you can go delete any cluster backups if

17
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.300
they exist in the meantime and it's gonna take minutes so you're gonna have

18
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.240
to wait for the cluster deletion to complete.

19
00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.640
But when it's done, go delete the sub net group as well.

20
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.090
Now we can go to elastic beanstalk by deleting the application.

21
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.530
It will also delete the environment and all the resources that were created.

22
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.470
This solution is also going to take awhile but there's really nothing else to

23
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.320
do an elastic beanstalk so you can go ahead and set it to delete and then

24
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.760
move on and dynamo db delete both of the tables that we created toppings and

25
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.280
users in rDS delete the postgres SQL, database instance,

26
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.890
make sure you choose the options to not take final

27
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.640
backups or to keep any backups.

28
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.540
Here's another one that will take a while but again,

29
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.020
there's nothing else to do an Rds so you can continue on and

30
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.120
as three you can delete the bucket but you'll need to actually

31
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.560
empty it of all objects first.

32
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.340
Otherwise it won't let you use the handy empty button to do this.

33
00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.730
You can delete the bucket after but I'm actually going

34
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.740
to keep mine in case I need it later.

35
00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.740
Although you do have a limit on the maximum number of buckets for your account,

36
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.010
buckets that are empty.

37
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.270
Don't actually cost anything Now we'll move into ec two,

38
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.540
there's a lot of stuff to do here.

39
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.340
First we're going to delete the load balancer.

40
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.990
Now there's actually a bug where you should probably delete the listener on the

41
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.500
load balancer first and then delete the whole load balancer.

42
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.960
The reason you'd want to do this is so that you can

43
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.670
also delete the target group.

44
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.250
I didn't do this when I was recording the this demo here.

45
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.640
So I actually got an error when trying to delete my target group.

46
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.050
Target groups don't cost anything.

47
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.640
So if it's left over, it's not a big deal.

48
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.540
Next delete the auto scaling group,

49
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.230
then the launch template and then terminate all the instances that were

50
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.670
created in the elastic IPs screen first disassociate the IP address and

51
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.420
then release it next go to AmI S and d.

52
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.010
Register both of the AMI is that we created and then now you

53
00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.440
can delete the key pair that we created.

54
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.380
The aim is used snapshots for storing data.

55
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.340
So go to the ebs, snapshots screen and delete both of those.

56
00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.490
Then go to the security group screen.

57
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.080
was doesn't let you delete a security group if it is being

58
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.900
referenced in another security groups rules,

59
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.360
we actually did this quite a few times so just go through and delete any

60
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.040
inbound rules that exist on the security groups that we created,

61
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.440
make sure to not mess with the default security groups.

62
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.700
Then you can delete all those security groups that we created.

63
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:42.020
Finally go to the VPc dashboard and delete the pizza VPC that we created.

64
00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.460
This will actually delete all the resources contained

65
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.640
in that VPc as well and that's it.

66
00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.100
Those are all the resources that we needed to delete,

67
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.240
make sure to keep that CloudWatch billing alarm we created in the beginning

68
00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:06.000
it will let you know if we happen to miss something or you know you get any unexpected billing charges on your account
