[Autogenerated] RDS gives you many different types of

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.490
relational database engines to choose from.

3
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.030
Here are the current offerings amazon aurora,

4
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:16.610
my SQL Maria dB postgres, SQL oracle and Microsoft sequel server.

5
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.950
Each database engine has a different costs due to the potential

6
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.050
licensing costs if you're choosing between them here,

7
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.540
the questions I ask myself which might be useful to you as well.

8
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.340
What database type am I using locally?

9
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.630
This works for existing projects that you are migrating to the cloud

10
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.580
but may not matter if you're starting a new project,

11
00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.910
how much do I want to spend since each type has a different cost.

12
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.240
This is an important factor.

13
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.910
What database type do I have the most experience with if you

14
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.170
work with a particular engine in the past,

15
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.520
choosing that same one will save you a lot of ramp up time,

16
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.150
especially considering that working in the cloud presents

17
00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:00.340
its own learning opportunities finally, which has the best client,

18
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.920
a lot of your time interacting with the database engine will be done in

19
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.190
some sort of GUI client and the quality of those clients vary wildly but

20
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:17.000
they have a real impact on your usage Using these questions I'm confident you can choose the best solution for you
