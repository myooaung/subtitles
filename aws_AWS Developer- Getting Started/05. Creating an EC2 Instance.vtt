00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.930
[Autogenerated] I've talked enough about EC two now and I feel

2
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:06.370
like I've been hyping you up for it all course.

3
00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.710
So let's dive in and finally create our own instance

4
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.940
to install our application on.

5
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.600
Let's do something a little different now we will likely

6
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.010
be going to the Ec two dashboard often.

7
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.470
So let's set it up as a favorite.

8
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.200
Click on the services menu in the top left on the left hand side of this

9
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.330
drop-down you'll see an empty section for favorites.

10
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.440
This is where all your favorites will be.

11
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.490
Now, if you mouse over any of the services in the list,

12
00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:42.280
you'll see an empty star appears next to the service by clicking on the Star.

13
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.040
You will favorite that service,

14
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.940
Find EC two in this list and click the star next to it.

15
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.800
Now E C two is set up as a favorite,

16
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.910
click on the logo in the favorites menu and you'll

17
00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.740
be taken to the Ec two dashboard.

18
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.480
Now we're going to create our first ec two instance,

19
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.760
click the launch instance button and the launch wizard will begin.

20
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.420
We need to choose an image for this instance on the left.

21
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.140
You can see the different sections for images that I mentioned before.

22
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.040
For instance, the AWS marketplace,

23
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.940
we will select this amazon Linux to image from the quick start section,

24
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.540
click select next to it.

25
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.410
Now we need to choose the instance type for our image since

26
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.930
we're sticking to the free tier in this course.

27
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.470
We only really have one option and that's the T two micro instance with one

28
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.640
CPU one gig of RAM and low to moderate network performance,

29
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.730
click next in the bottom.

30
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.980
Right now we have a lot more options.

31
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.110
We'll just go with one instance for the time being as we'll be

32
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.580
setting up our auto scaling groups later for network.

33
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.780
If our Pizza VPC isn't already selected,

34
00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.480
selected here, pick either one of your subnets,

35
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.280
whichever doesn't matter, we don't need a public IP will assign one later.

36
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:12.660
So just use disable for auto assign public IP we will avoid setting and I am

37
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.110
rule for this instance for now although it is a suggested way for handling

38
00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.160
application credentials in the next section,

39
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.580
you can just leave the defaults.

40
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.720
Now click next The Wizard automatically configures the instance

41
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.040
with an eight gigabyte elastic block store volume,

42
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.640
which is fine.

43
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.490
We can add a name tag to this instance to better

44
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.030
differentiate it in the instance list,

45
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.240
let's name it Pizza O G for original gangster.

46
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:49.020
Now click next here, we will define the main security group for our instance,

47
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:55.340
let's create a new security group and name it Pizza E C two S G.

48
00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.060
We can give it a description as well.

49
00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.410
Security group for Pizza Lovers ec.

50
00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.440
Two instances for the rules,

51
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.150
you'll see that there is already one rule exposing the instance to ssh

52
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.110
sessions from anywhere you can leave this for now.

53
00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.710
Once an application goes into production you would want to

54
00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:20.560
either completely close off SSH access or restricted to a

55
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.440
single IP such as your own.

56
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.140
Let's add another rule to our security group, click add role.

57
00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.190
We want to open the port that our application will be running on, which is 3000.

58
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:39.070
So leave the drop-down as custom TCP rule In the port range,

59
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:45.740
enter 3000 and in the source, drop down select anywhere.

60
00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.240
Now we've got a security group that will let us SSH into our instance

61
00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.840
and also one that will let us access our application,

62
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.620
click review and launch and now click launch this last window wants us

63
00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.390
to select or create a key pair with our instance.

64
00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.840
This is very important since we need this key pair to SSH and to the instance,

65
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:15.440
select create a new key pair and name the key pair is something like pizza keys.

66
00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:21.140
Now click download, keep hair and it will download a PIM file,

67
00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:26.680
store this somewhere, you won't delete it now click launch instances.

68
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.810
This next step will take some time as the instance,

69
00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.510
launches and starts up and everything.

70
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.070
In the meantime, let's install local dependencies for our demo application,

71
00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:44.000
get it running locally and then get ready to ssh into the instance so that we can deploy it
