00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.970
[Autogenerated] AWS also provides a command line tool that makes it easy to

2
00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.180
integrate resource creation and configuration with shell scripts and

3
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.320
unsupported programming languages with the AWS CLI.

4
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.110
You can accomplish nearly every operation that is

5
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.640
available with the Web console or SDK s.

6
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.520
The main AWS CLI can interact with any of the services,

7
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.040
but amazon also provides a dedicated CLI for elastic beanstalk as well.

8
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.110
I'll be honest, I rarely use the AWS Cli in my day to day work.

9
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.950
I want to demonstrate some applications of it

10
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.120
because I think they may be useful,

11
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.600
but we're going to focus more attention on the

12
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.440
console and software development kits.

13
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.440
The documentation on the CLI is quite extensive,

14
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.430
so after trying it a few times in this course,

15
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.580
you should feel comfortable going it on your own if

16
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.640
the Cli fits your use case better.

17
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.590
In this course,

18
00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.190
we'll need to use the CLI to first configure our local

19
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.760
development environment to access our AWS account.

20
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.500
Once this is complete though,

21
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.720
will mainly look at the CLI as an alternative to

22
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.920
actions were doing in the console.

23
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.140
As developers,

24
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.230
we don't often need to automate infrastructure as

25
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:24.000
much as operations engineers do. So, the usefulness of the CLI is a little bit limited for us
