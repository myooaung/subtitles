[Autogenerated] after working with S3 for a bit,

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.340
I have a feeling that you may be starting to appreciate it,

3
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.230
its simplicity as part of its appeal and it's pretty amazing

4
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.530
what you can do with a little configuration.

5
00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.330
I'm also really glad we were able to functionally work in all

6
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.230
three AWS interaction methods in this clip,

7
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.620
the console cli SDK they all serve their purposes but

8
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.540
really use the tool you like the most.

9
00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.840
Let's recap what we did in this module.

10
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.540
We started out by learning about the different features and structures and S3

11
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.940
Then we created our first bucket and began uploading objects.

12
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.540
Next we went deep into the code and wired our note application to S3

13
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.360
and finally we configured cores and our bucket and created an I am

14
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.230
role for our application in the next module.

15
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.920
We're going to learn about two types of databases in AWS.

16
00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:01.040
SQL with relational database service and no SQL with Dynamo dB,

17
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.970
relational database service gives you multiple relational options to

18
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.440
choose from but takes care of the maintenance and complexity with

19
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.580
standing up a database on your own dynamo.

20
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.310
DB really takes out the complexity by completely abstracting away

21
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.990
hardware and working with a document based single table approach that

22
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.140
makes dealing with databases really simple,

23
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:30.000
we still got plenty to cover in this course, so stick with it and I'll see you in the next module
