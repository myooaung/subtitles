00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.840
[Autogenerated] creating an amazon machine Image will probably

2
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.120
be the easiest thing we do in this course.

3
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.140
Seriously, in the ec two dashboard, click on instances in the left menu,

4
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.520
select our Pizza Hoagie instance, then click the actions.

5
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:22.840
drop-down click images and templates and then click create image.

6
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.270
Give the image a name like Pizza image, The instance volumes.

7
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.610
Just define the size of the volume needed for this image

8
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.640
and we can leave it set to eight GB.

9
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.960
Go ahead and click create and that's it.

10
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.000
We have an AM I now created and ready for deployment now.

11
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.850
The Am I take some time to be created before we can use it.

12
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.940
So I'll fast forward my video a few minutes here.

13
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.770
If we click the launch instance button and select my am eyes,

14
00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.570
you'll see that we can now choose to launch an instance with our custom Am I?

15
00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.260
Which means it will come with amazon Linux node,

16
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.320
all the no dependencies and our demo application ready to

17
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.140
execute now we actually want to use this.

18
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:17.000
Am I to replicate instances of our demo application. So let's set up the rest of our scalable infrastructure
