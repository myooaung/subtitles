[Autogenerated] while most of the AWS services can be

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:06,730
interacted with over typical TCP connections.

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:10,290
Amazon also provides several software development kits

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,290
to make interacting with resources.

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:13,740
Even easier,

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,680
these s D K s are maintained by amazon developers and released

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,730
in popular programming languages like java,

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,610
.NET Javascript,

9
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:28,920
ruby and Objective-C Each SDK provides a robust API that enables you to

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,040
interact with services and resources inside your code base.

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,250
The documentation for each sDK is large,

12
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:41,190
simply because of the volume of interactions you can perform with every service,

13
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,790
we won't have enough time to cover even the majority of services in this course,

14
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:49,750
so we'll just focus on the most used ones in order to

15
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,380
connect our local code to the cloud.

16
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:57,280
We will need to use an AWS access key to properly configure

17
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,640
the SDK to access our account in the cloud.

18
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:09,740
This configuration will be used implicitly by both the SDK and the AWS cli tool.

19
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:13,820
In this course, we are going to be working with a no Js web application,

20
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:20,240
so we'll be using the javascript SDK to extend the application into a W S.

21
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,960
The SDK APIs are quite similar between languages,

22
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:30,000
so moving to a different sDK after watching this course shouldn't be a big stretch
