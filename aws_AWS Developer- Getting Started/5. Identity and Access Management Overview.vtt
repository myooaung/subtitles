[Autogenerated] I AM is an access management service that controls

2
00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.340
who can have access to what in your AWS account.

3
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.070
It's fitting that it's one of the first services that we're

4
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.680
going to cover in depth because it's really the gatekeeper

5
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.440
to all of the services in AWS.

6
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.640
I am allows you to easily administer access to various users on your account.

7
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.760
This includes managing passwords, multi factor authentication,

8
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.140
access keys and ssh keys for all users created on an account

9
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.110
permissions or the ability for those users to administer or use other

10
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.860
services on your account can also be managed through I am there are

11
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.300
several different methods to control these permissions but the main

12
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.840
structure to work with is a policy.

13
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.730
A policy is a collection of permissions to access

14
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.140
different services in a particular way,

15
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.070
policies can be very specific to the resource level or broad

16
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.240
and allow permissions on a type of service.

17
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.050
In addition,

18
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.040
policies are typically mixed and matched to a particular user or group.

19
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.170
A group for developers might have full access to ec two,

20
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.970
so they can spin up instances as needed.

21
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:20.610
Or a group for testers might have read only access to a dynamo db table

22
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.380
but full access to a particular S three bucket policies,

23
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.940
make it easy to assign permissions to users or groups in an

24
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.540
administrative way let's take a look at the I AM dashboard.

25
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.780
The dashboard gives you a snapshot of your current I am setup

26
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.640
such as number of users groups etcetera.

27
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.440
In addition it has some amazon suggested best

28
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.500
practices in the course of this module,

29
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.830
we will implement each one of these best practices on the left side.

30
00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.610
You'll see the individual sections of I am,

31
00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.510
we won't have time to go through all of these in this module,

32
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:05.300
but we'll cover the main sections like users groups and policies I

33
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.030
am is all about the security of your account.

34
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.300
And accordingly it is endlessly deep with ways you can

35
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.950
configure access and authentication with I am.

36
00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.790
Amazon makes it easy for even the newest developer to achieve

37
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:26.000
industry grade security on their account. Let's get started to secure our account and learn I am.
