00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.140
[Autogenerated] now that we have a postgres database

2
00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.540
instance created and available in the cloud.

3
00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.740
We need to connect to it.

4
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.500
If you'll remember when we created the database,

5
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.230
we had it create a new security group for the database instance.

6
00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.250
This security group was created with a rule that gave

7
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.120
access to the database port from our I.

8
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.250
P.

9
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.240
Address for that database instance.

10
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.100
As long as the IP address that you're at hasn't

11
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.700
changed since you created that database.

12
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.940
You don't need to change the rule or do anything else.

13
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.860
So to connect to our database from our local machine will use a

14
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.450
postgres specific GUI admin tool to connect.

15
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.600
I'm going to use PG admin.

16
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.770
It's a free client.

17
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.840
It's available for Mac or Windows and here's the current

18
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.520
URL where you can download it 1st.

19
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.340
We need to connect.

20
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.410
After opening PG admin,

21
00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.720
you can click the add new server link to create a new

22
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.440
connection first give it a name like Pizza Lovers.

23
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.540
Then select the connection tab.

24
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.720
We need the address for our database.

25
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.700
So switch back to the AWS console and go back to the database details,

26
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.740
screen copy this in point field.

27
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.540
Now paste it into the host input field in PG admin,

28
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.960
then enter the user name and password you set up Previously all

29
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.940
of the rest of the defaults will work for us.

30
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:43.750
Now click save and it should connect the connection will show up on the left.

31
00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.520
Under servers expand the Pizza Lovers connection and

32
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.840
then the databases icon under it.

33
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.080
You should see the Pizza Lovers database here,

34
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.320
we don't need to do anything else.

35
00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.090
now that we verify that you can connect to your database

36
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.930
locally and that it's up and running the O.

37
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:04.220
R.

38
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:04.450
M.

39
00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:11.440
And our demo application will create a Pizzas table and add the columns for us.

40
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:20.000
We'll do that and modify our application to store and retrieve data in this database in the next clip.
