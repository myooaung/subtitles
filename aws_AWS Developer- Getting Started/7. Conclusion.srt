00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,390
[Autogenerated] we didn't really write any code in this module but the services

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:09,480
that we learned about may have an even bigger impact on the experience than any

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,270
functions we could have possibly written both.

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,700
CloudFormation and elastic beanstalk allow you to take your

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,220
web application to the next level by standardizing resource

6
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,740
creation and application deployment.

7
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,340
Let's recap what we covered in this module.

8
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:28,340
We started by discussing CloudFormation and learned about how to use a

9
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:33,100
template to provision resources Then we use the CloudFormation template to

10
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,740
create a replica of our Pizza Lovers infrastructure.

11
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,480
Next I introduce elastic beanstalk and explain how to use

12
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,660
environments to easily deploy your application.

13
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:48,160
Then we zipped up Pizza Lovers and deployed it using a new elastic

14
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,610
beanstalk environment that we configured in the next module we're

15
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:56,490
going to look at to services provided by amazon that will increase

16
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:01,910
the speed of our application cloud front and elastic cache cloudfront

17
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:06,120
is a Cdn service that can be used to edge your application content

18
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,610
closer to users,

19
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:11,770
thereby reducing geographic latency cloudfront will work with our

20
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:16,340
existing storage and S3 So configuring it will be a cinch.

21
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,000
Alaska.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,270
cache is a caching service that enables you to use a

23
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:23,210
caching technology like readiness or meme.

24
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:28,360
cache de amazon handles the creation and management of cache clusters

25
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:34,000
to improve the performance of your applications. See you in the next module
