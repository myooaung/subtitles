00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.020
[Autogenerated] databases are essential to every web application and

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.750
they're especially essential to pizza loving social networks.

3
00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.130
We cover two different solutions in A W.

4
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.340
S with RDS and dynamo DB and configured and interacted with

5
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.570
them both in the web console and the SDK.

6
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.640
Let's recap everything we covered,

7
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.560
we started with an introduction to RDS and covered the key concepts and

8
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.440
factors to consider when choosing a database engine,

9
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.640
then we created a database instance and created a table for our pizzas.

10
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.040
Next we wrote all the code to connect to the database add to inquiry from it.

11
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.280
When we finish we moved on to dynamodb and the

12
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.340
fundamentals of throughput and keys.

13
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.240
I gave you my opinions on how to choose between dynamo dB and RDS.

14
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.920
Then we modified our toppings and users to store and

15
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.140
retrieve data from dynamodb tables.

16
00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.150
In the next module we will look at how to automate many of the

17
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.490
deployment and configuration activities in AWS using elastic

18
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:08.340
beanstalk and CloudFormation elastic beanstalk deploys and scales

19
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.040
your web application automatically for you.

20
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.950
Basically all the work we did with load balancers and auto scaling

21
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.240
groups is taken care of by elastic beanstalk.

22
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.380
After doing all that work,

23
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.040
I know you'll appreciate what elastic beanstalk does for you,

24
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.900
confirmation allows you to create in provision resources in AWS using

25
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.310
configuration templates which are just basic JSON This enables you to

26
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.530
have reproducible infrastructure configurations that can be easily

27
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.900
shared and checked into source control.

28
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.590
As you can see we've still got a lot of fascinating stuff

29
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.250
to learn on our path to becoming a W.

30
00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.420
S.

31
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.000
Developers. I look forward to seeing you in the next module.
