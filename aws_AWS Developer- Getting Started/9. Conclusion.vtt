[Autogenerated] in this module,

2
00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:05.490
I showed you how easy it is to use cloudfront and Alaska Cash to

3
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.840
dramatically improve the performance of your application.

4
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.540
The amount of control and easy scalability makes these

5
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.070
services ready for production usage and necessary for a

6
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.220
high performing web application.

7
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.840
Let's go over what we covered in this module.

8
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.460
We started with Cloudfront and I introduced you to the

9
00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.170
concepts of origins and distributions.

10
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.260
Then we created our first distribution and got to see how

11
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.300
pizza lovers perform behind a cache Next,

12
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.600
we looked at Alaska Cash and talked about using readiness and meme.

13
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.240
cache D to create clusters that provide high performance data retrieval.

14
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.740
Then we created a red is cluster and integrated it into our application

15
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.690
and that's the end of AWS developer getting started.

16
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.000
If you made it this far.

17
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.170
Congratulations.

18
00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.210
You've learned some of the basics for some of the most

19
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.740
powerful services in AWS and there's a lot more to AWS

20
00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.030
than what we were able to cover.

21
00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.440
So I hope I peach your interests and that you'll continue to learn more.

22
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.120
It was my pleasure to be able to teach this course for you

23
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.150
and I look forward to any questions or feedback you have

24
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.000
in the Pluralsight comments. Thanks and I'll talk to you later
