[Autogenerated] Welcome back to AWS developer getting started.

2
00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:08.580
My name is Ryan Lewis and this module is going to be all about databases.

3
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.150
Amazon gives you quite a few options to find a

4
00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.280
database service that matches your needs,

5
00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.700
whether it's managed relational databases or low configuration.

6
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.240
No SQL tables.

7
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.040
You'll be able to find the best database for you with a W S.

8
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.990
Let's take a look at what we'll be covering in this module.

9
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.030
We'll start by looking at amazon relational database

10
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.340
service and I'll go over it at a high level.

11
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.150
Well look at the database options you can choose with RDS and I'll

12
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.570
describe some of the differences to help you choose next.

13
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.940
We'll talk about configuration options and scaling before we

14
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.340
finally create our first database instance.

15
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.050
Then we'll finally set up our tables and connect to the database with our

16
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.070
application so we can start storing data in it after RDS I'll introduce

17
00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.510
amazon's no SQL option with Dynamo DB and we'll learn all about tables and

18
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.520
throughput configuration is pretty light with dynamo DB So we'll be jumping

19
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.620
into the code very quickly and have our code pushing and pulling data from

20
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.640
dynamo before you know it.

21
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:18.000
There's a lot of code to work on in this module so make sure to get comfortable and ready to do some typing
