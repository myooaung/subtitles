00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.820
Hello,

00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:01.070
guys.

00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:01.840
Thanks for joining.

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.510
Decision in decision.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.190
We're going to discuss about another repeat see component that is not get with and night

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:08.880
instances.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:09.970
In short,

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:11.710
we're going to discuss the vote net.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.760
That is network at this translation.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.050
So let's jump in tow the diagram.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:16.930
So,

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:17.200
no,

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.750
we're in tow.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.760
This dagger we have already discussed revolt submits road people,

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.700
Internet gateway and last session.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.260
We have discussed the water elastic I p no,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.710
we will discuss of or Net and we will discuss about,

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.510
not gate with along with Mac.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.240
Instance so majorly,

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.110
we're going to discuss the world night gate with but practical discussing about not Gateway

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.530
was his napkin stance.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.010
We should understand that.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.240
What?

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.920
Actually noctis tonight.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.210
The stands for network address translation.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.540
So here the question.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.810
Come,

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:46.240
please.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.460
Where do we use?

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.570
Not so to answer the question.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.390
We use net toe in a bill.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.950
Instances in the privates,

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.870
off net to connect to the Internet.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.530
So you must be wondering that.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.590
Why should I connect private in stances through the internet?

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.290
And if you wanted to connect to the Internet,

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:10.180
why do we created the instance as private instance so to answer your question in certain

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:17.050
scenarios where we must have to keep our instances as player it because so kind of

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.980
applications,

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.080
like databases,

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.800
monstrous aid into the flavor instances.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:27.350
And we want to connect the private instance toe the Internet because off software update

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.930
within private instances,

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.920
so then only private instance can access the Internet.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:33.620
What Internet?

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.450
Current aerobatic Texas toe.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.580
The private instance it would we achieve this?

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.530
We need a mechanism which will take care of this complex scenario.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.000
And the mechanism is not networker this translation.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.720
So no large.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.940
This with the world Whole night basically works one night,

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.070
the ways forward traffic from the instances in the privates of net through the Internet or

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.020
other AWS.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.960
So with it and then since the response back to doing stances when traffic goes to the

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:00.520
Internet,

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.060
the source i p Before red.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.710
This is replaced with the not the weight address,

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.710
and similarly,

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.760
when the results roughly goes to do since chances tonight,

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:15.180
the waiters translate the orders back to lose instances like retyping before addresses.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.340
Now we understand that how it works,

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.300
we will move further,

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.080
and we will discuss about some of the points to remember 90 races are not supported for I'd

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.300
be real X traffic.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.740
We can implement that design with the North AWS infrastructure by two.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.890
With either we can all the not get with over system made of Louis or we can create not easy

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.760
to instance using that a mice provided weight of Louis.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.650
So here question comes is just the best way or said a commended way for Nat management.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.970
So the recommendation from eight of Louis is to use,

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:49.800
not get with.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.230
Why?

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.500
Because first of all,

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.960
not get racism is a managed service.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.760
So the benefit off managed services we don't need to give the administration effort now

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.590
more for the we were looking toe one off the architectural right ground and discuss some of

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:04.610
the important point.

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.480
So this is our not get with set up.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.730
If we will look into that,

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.870
then you will find that it in need of Lewis.

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.580
We have a set up of the PC and that contains so full of the sub minute one is the public

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:16.050
submit.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.810
Another one is the private submarine.

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.980
And here you will find that in the within the public seven it there are three C two

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.240
instances is running with the following elastic eyepiece,

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.230
and it has not gateway associated with.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.780
And within the private submit,

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.500
you will find that there the data with Sober is running three database instances off the

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.870
sober is running and there is a implied rotor is also being applied to do the communication

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.780
with the public of networks over.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.970
So here you will find that if you're looking toe that it is going through him fried rotor.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.310
And here is going toe,

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.330
though not get with.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.710
And then your communication is happening over here and here you will find that the entry

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.860
for not Gateway is done in main road table,

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.140
also within the custom fruit table.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.640
So,

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.490
as we discussed that supposed that if we want to do any kind of a pad or say software

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:04.470
update process,

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.020
want to run the software update process and we need to access the Internet who don't lure

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.220
the soft bread and run the path into this database over.

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:18.350
This is not a feasible solution to expose this private sub net as public seven as it is a

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:19.790
risk for the business nag,

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:25.810
it will help us in this situation no discuss some of the important points to remember about

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:26.860
not get way.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.120
The point is to create a not get way.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.810
We must specify the public sub net in wheat not get with should reside.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:39.050
We must also specify an elastic I pre Andris we associate with the not get way.

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.880
When we created one point,

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.900
you should remember that elastic I p address cannot between once we associate it with a net

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.850
gateway Another point related to the configuration.

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:52.650
Once we have created the land gateway,

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:58.120
then we must have toe obeyed the route they will associated with one or more off our

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.440
privates of net wind,

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.660
Internet bound traffic toe the net.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:02.120
Katri,

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.980
this strip is really very important as this is step enables instances in our private

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.150
suddenly communicate with the Internet.

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.900
So these are some of the point or it's a good point for not get way.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:15.700
You know the question.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:16.850
Come over Myriads.

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.780
Is there any limitations off?

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:19.510
Not Gateway.

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:20.810
Then I can say that yes,

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.460
there are certain limitations.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:27.920
We will discuss that limitations now on that get with support five d repeat so bandwidth

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:34.370
and automatically scales up 2 45 Gbps we cannot associate a security group with,

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:35.650
though not get way.

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:41.360
We can use security groups for our in stances in the privates of net toe control the

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.830
traffic when from those instances we can use a nickel or the net Okay,

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:52.750
seal to control the traffic who went from the sub nit and wit not get with located?

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:52.970
No,

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:54.050
we understand this.

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:59.500
We will proceed for the and discuss some comparision between ad Gayatri and not in stances

00:05:59.500 --> 00:05:59.500
.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.610
Who the first aspect off comparison in a level ability.

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:07.400
If we talk about not get with the navigate with highly every level as it is a man,

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:07.790
it's over.

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:12.720
It's so not get within each availability zone are implemented with redundancy.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:18.080
We should create a nag a tree in each of litigation to ensure zone independent

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.530
architectures on the other hand or night and stances in terms of availability,

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:27.910
we need to use a script to manage fail over between instances now moving toe the another

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:34.440
point off comp arisen is bandwidth in the band with suspect not get with can scale up to 45

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.590
db peas and on the other hand,

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:37.770
not in stances.

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:42.500
Bandwidth can be depends Opondo Instance type now moving further.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:47.440
Another point of comparison is maintenance maintenance way with not get re.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:51.320
You don't have to bother about in tenants as it is a man of service.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.740
All the maintenance thing.

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:58.790
Administrative task is taken care by eat of Lewis and we talk about net instances and it

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:00.100
should be managed by us.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:06.500
Only any kind of patchwork likes after a break operating system Patties on the instances

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:11.160
we're night and stances running is all these things are taken care by us only.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:16.220
So these are some of the major point off competence which I wanted to discuss with you

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.040
regarding that gateway.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.330
Worse is not in sterile.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:19.730
That's it,

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:20.060
guys.

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:24.110
This is what I want you to discuss with you in decision in the next section.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:24.570
Till then,

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:24.840
Bob,

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:25.450
I take you
