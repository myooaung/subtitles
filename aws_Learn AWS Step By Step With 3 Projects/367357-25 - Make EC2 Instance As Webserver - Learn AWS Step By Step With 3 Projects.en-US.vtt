00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.450
Hello,

00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:00.710
guys.

00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.840
Thanks for joining decision in decision.

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:03.660
We're going toe.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.220
Create an easy to instant and make that easy Twins instance as a Web Sobel.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.640
And in that WEP Lobo,

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.540
we will host an estimate file,

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.220
and then we will access it with the public i p.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.250
So let's jump in tow the aid of Louis management console.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.270
So we're into the aid of Louis management console.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:26.040
So let's suppose discuss about water the steps which were going toe take in this exercise.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.970
So in the first test,

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.380
triple will create an easy two instance and one CC two instances being created.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.180
Then we belong in tow that,

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.810
for instance,

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:40.250
with the Help Off Party as I'm using Windows Machine that the reason I'm using party.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.350
If you are using Lee next machine,

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.670
then you can use directly assess such connection to access.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.600
The easy to instance and once reacts is the C two instance.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.430
Then we will install a purchase over within the easy to instance,

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.160
to install a budget so we will execute some common,

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.880
and once it is being done,

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.030
we will create an estimate file,

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.200
and that is Tim.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.910
Will file will display the meta data information.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.380
No easy to an instance.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.540
So let's execute the steps which we have discussed.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.820
No.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:10.280
So,

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.470
first we will goto the compute section and select the easy to instance.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.620
And we will create any C two instance over here.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:18.200
So no,

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.730
we're into Et tu dashboard.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:25.710
We will click on launch instance and here you can select the free tier only and we're going

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.060
to use the 1st 1 click Select.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.330
And here we will select default option.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.740
Next,

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.330
we will click on configure Instance details year.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:39.590
We will leave the before configuration and then we will click on next at the storage.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.750
So once it has been done again,

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.590
click on next attack.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.130
We will add some tag as we were going to create a rep.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.850
Sobel So name it has a collapsible.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.620
If you want to give another time,

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.140
you can give it another time.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.710
In tournament name all living commuted environment.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:58.700
Click on next.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.710
Conficker security group Here we will create a new security group.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.180
So provider name demo.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.670
You see two wears reps over and give the description as with so we have given the same name

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:11.450
is description.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.490
So this security group already has assess it.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:21.700
We confuse either my i p or I'm going to stay with anywhere so that it will be accessible

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.290
from any of the eyepiece.

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.540
No,

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.330
we learned another rule for Port 80.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.400
So that has to to be request will come and we can access it again.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.250
We're going to keep it as anywhere.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.360
So we have inserted with the protocol assess that was already existing.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.650
We have in certain arrested two p way because we are hosting you,

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.200
Tessa Web server,

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.980
and to access their steam ill.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.900
We need s TTP protocol.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.880
No click on reviewing loan.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.780
So it is giving us the warning that it is open to the world.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:50.440
That is fine.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.980
We know it.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.070
Just click on loan.

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.150
And here we're going to create a new keep here,

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.850
give it a name which we have used earlier them.

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:58.950
Luisito wears Web.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:59.330
Sobel,

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:00.570
download the keep it.

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:01.700
We will save it.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.640
Now we need to click on launch.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.380
Instance it,

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.200
which is launching the instance.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.070
So just go into the easy to dashboard.

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.050
So it is still creating.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.710
So,

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.990
no,

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.430
it has created the easy to instance.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.920
No,

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.650
we will goingto party software and connect the CC two instance So let me open the party

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:21.410
application.

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.110
But prior to that,

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:29.070
we need to generate the PPK key using the PEM file which we have downloaded the the steps

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.330
which I have already mentioned in one off our earlier session.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:33.970
So if you have any doubt,

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.100
you can refer those.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.930
So we have opened the Partick a generator Now,

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.370
Lord the key So too Lord the key We need to grab that m file So here is the perm file

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.970
selected open.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:45.920
Done.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:52.600
Now we need to save it as a private key so that our party can recognize it as a PPK so we

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.040
can give it a name again.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.160
Demo Easy to as webs over save it It is being saved.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.190
Now close it.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.850
So now we will open the party application and connect the easy to instant.

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:05.140
You know,

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.950
we open their party applications.

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:14.450
Who here we need to write easy to hyphen user at and we need to grab the i p public ap.

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:15.850
So grab it from here,

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:23.690
pasted and at such connection we need toe Goto ought on browse the key which we have just

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.300
generated for this This is the key which we have generated.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:33.510
Opening it open now we will go back session and here we will give with the name.

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.490
So just give it a name with the machine and save it.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.340
Now we will open it and looking toe that whether it is connecting to easy to instance or

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.800
not yes,

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.030
it connected.

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.660
So it is connected now.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:53.210
So what we need to do we need to type pseudo So don't let me make it full sized screen.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.700
So no,

00:04:53.700 --> 00:05:00.350
we're into full more So what we need to do We need to install the STT pds over for a party

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.350
.

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:06.900
So to do that first we need to run the update sold that we have all the thing up to write

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:07.570
off debt,

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.250
whiteness way and in tow Put operated.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:19.090
So it is done.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.450
No,

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.810
no,

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:20.650
we need toe.

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:21.970
Clear it.

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.260
So after that,

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.370
we need to install,

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.690
though as to t pds application.

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:36.840
That is a patches over Young stole STT PD minus y in tow.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.360
It is installing a party as TPD soft,

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.750
so no,

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.920
we haven't started off watches over.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:46.100
So here I wanted to let you know something.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.580
Ready?

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:51.470
Interesting and important when we're working with either of Louis management console.

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:58.430
So it is very easy to get the information about easy to instance how we go into the AWS

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.320
management console and whatever the information,

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.600
the meta information we want to grab for this.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.760
Easy to instance,

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.220
we will come over here and we will grab it.

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:13.580
But suppose we want toe grab this meta information from from easy to console.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.200
So how do we can grab this information?

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:23.880
So to grab this information from the easy tunes instance tw it's has provided and you were

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:27.250
really toe access the meta data information.

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.230
So let's do it.

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.690
No So let's first clear it now.

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:32.900
Also,

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.450
to access the meta data information,

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:47.980
we will be using girl as TTP 169 not to 44.169 Don't to 44 Last latest Last Met today

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:49.050
talking pinto.

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:56.840
So it will give us these information these meta data information when we access it.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.040
For example,

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:02.210
if we want to access the instance I d than what we need to do.

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:07.170
We need to use the same mural and put instance idee over there.

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:09.950
And then we will equally how to do that.

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:12.820
Put a semi colon and ICO in tow.

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.230
So it has returned.

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.730
Instance I d So what we're going to do,

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:20.790
we are goingto bring this instance I d in one of this team Will,

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:25.990
We will create an estimate which will display this idea in tow that as Tamil and we will

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:27.220
access that as chairman.

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.440
So this is the thing which we will do it.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:29.780
No.

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:30.950
So no clear it.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:32.700
So now what we need to do,

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:36.200
we need to put it into esteem and folder for party toe.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:36.670
Do that.

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:39.560
We need to write goal as TTP again.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.510
I will use the rear one which we have used it.

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:48.080
And here what we need to do passage auto as a team and we will create inestimable and

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:48.790
address.

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:49.030
Really,

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:57.680
we need to put this a stimulus that where the fruit of blue slash 60 minutes last index dot

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.340
as demon.

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:03.430
So this file it will create at this location to Yemen now in tow.

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:09.860
So it has created the file called indexed or test email at that location where the blood of

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:15.890
Louis Human no very find that whether our easy to instants working as a Web server.

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:17.540
So how do we can very fight?

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:23.830
We can go back to the AWS console and grab the public ap and open that public.

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:25.790
I've seen Tour browser,

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:29.170
so we're intuitive Lewis management console.

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:30.780
So we will grabbed I p.

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:31.930
We have Graham diaper.

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:36.940
Now we will put it into the browser and here we will access it.

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:37.410
So no,

00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:39.870
we try to access it once you click on it.

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:41.810
So it is not treatable.

00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:42.030
Why?

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:45.160
Because we haven't started the SOBO Apache.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:45.570
So what?

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:46.720
We need to extract it.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.300
So how to do that?

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:49.240
We need toe again.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.720
Go back to the easy to concern and the start.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.600
The so To do that,

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:58.450
we need to write service as TPD start.

00:08:58.450 --> 00:08:59.050
No,

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:03.150
we need to go back to the roser and play to access the Web page again.

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:04.290
So let's do it.

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:04.990
We're here.

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:05.470
No,

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:06.090
no.

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:06.340
Again.

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:07.300
Try to access it.

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:07.820
Yes.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:08.130
See,

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:14.050
you regard the instance I d So this is what I wanted to demonstrate to you.

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:16.180
But prior to closing the station,

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:21.100
I wanted to tell you that in the next session we're going to learn about bootstrapping

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:21.690
process.

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:23.210
So how towboat a strap,

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:25.840
our easy to instance at the time,

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.880
off creation off et to instant.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:33.610
So that means suppose that if I want to create a Web Sahwas at the time of creation off

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:34.830
easy to instance,

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:35.460
toe water,

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.630
their steps required to do that Because,

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:39.160
as you see that here,

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:45.250
it has so many steps required to make an easy two instance as a Web server.

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:49.130
And suppose that if we require more than 20 webs over,

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:55.680
so that means we need toe create an easy two instance and go one by one in each machine and

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.570
do the installation off a party.

00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:01.370
So So this is really dread Gary task to ease this thing.

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:02.310
What we will do,

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:04.650
we will create a Buddhist trapping,

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:08.990
which we will place at the time off creation off Easy to instance.

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:11.760
So the exit gate this is for this session.

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:12.790
So in the next session,

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:13.340
till then,

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:13.730
buh bye.

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:14.300
Take care
