00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.370
Hello,

00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:00.620
guys.

00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.650
Thanks for joining the session in this session.

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:07.230
We're going toe to a project where we will design the high availability eat of Louis

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.120
infrastructure.

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.650
So far,

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.430
we have learned so many services afraid of Louis.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.660
Now it's time to design a more meaningful project.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.550
Or let's jump into the diagram to understand what we are going to design in this project.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.050
So there's basically we're going to design this infrastructure where we are having a

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.070
deformed BPC along with elastic load balance,

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.180
and they're too easy to in stances,

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.520
which is being configured within two different travel ability zone.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.140
So we will listen such infrastructure where,

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:41.230
at any point of time in if any of the easy to instance is going out off service and another

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:41.230
,

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.400
easy to instance will automatically come as replacement of help off auto scaling.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.950
So now let's look into the design elements off this project.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.090
So in this project,

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.950
we're going to use easy to,

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.400
which is going to be converted into am I?

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.440
Then we're going to use Security group,

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.120
Target Group,

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.320
Launch Configuration,

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.860
Auto Scaling Group and the scaling Policy.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.110
These thing you will come to know in this project some of the things which we have already

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.720
gone through,

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.800
like easy toe A my security group Target group as well.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.000
Some of the thing which you will find over here in the new for you.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.760
That's okay.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.660
If we're not able to understand that once we will do the project and you will come to know

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.530
that what is the significance off all these elements?

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.780
So now let's jump into the aid of Louis Management console and we will do the first step.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.600
We will create an easy to instant.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.730
And then afterwards we will create any.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.350
Am I with the help off that easy to instance,

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.030
alerts jump into the AWS management console.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.650
No weird intuitive with management console.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.980
No,

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.790
we will goto the easy to dashboard.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:42.000
No,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.820
we need to click on launch instantly.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.820
Concretely only like the first World taken Next,

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.450
configure instant details.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.500
So here we will keep the things default.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.860
The only thing we need to change over years that we need to provide the voter strapped on

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.310
that Right?

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.820
Some voter strap over here.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.340
So I have written this cripple.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.120
This mood disturbance crypt is very straight forward.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.020
This cripple senior,

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.000
we're installing the institute PD.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.280
That is a process over.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.150
And they were doing the check conflict.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:13.900
And then off reports were creating an STM ill and placing it into a specified location.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.890
And then up toward at the last line,

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.340
we're starting the service.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.260
So that is STD pretty services.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.140
That is a project.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.980
So no moving for the click on next time the story.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.640
So click on next time dagger.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:25.660
We will give a tag.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.680
Your name give and for template was done.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.850
We need to configure security group Li con security group here we can add another rule for

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:35.290
a city.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.840
People open the Port Authority.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.410
We will keep it as a global if you want.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.480
Then you can provide any of the people for this session.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.760
We're going to keep it open so that it will be accessible from they.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:46.450
Any Avery?

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.880
No,

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.220
moving for the kick on review and launch.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.340
Now click on launch.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.160
So here we need to select the existing keep here.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.190
I already have,

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.950
like this one,

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.430
and I acknowledge click on launching stance It,

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.720
which is launching now.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.710
We need to click on the Instant Sadie.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:01.990
It will take it there.

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.500
So it is still creating.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.020
It takes usually one minute,

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.010
so it is created.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.310
No,

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.590
no.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.290
Let's verify that whether this issue to instance is solving our weapons or not.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.650
As this easy twins chances working as over apps over.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.240
So how do we can verify that?

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.890
We need to grab the saipi and we need to come over here and based it.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:20.790
And until yeah,

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.490
it is solving or repeat as we're getting the whatever we have.

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:25.230
Bootstraps,

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.450
which is displaying over here now moving for the Brits looking toe the diagram.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.710
So we have created the easy to instance.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:32.070
No.

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.560
Next we need to create toe.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.140
Am I using that easy to instant the Let's jump into the AWS management concern?

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.780
No here to create an image on machine image,

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.630
you need to come,

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.860
you know,

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.700
click connection goto image.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.150
Click on creative mate And here you need to provide our name,

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.580
observer me and leave everything as it We want to provide the description.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.640
You can come over here and provide the description as well,

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.100
and then you need to click on creating mate.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.620
It has created an image,

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.420
so it is in a process to create that image So that's what it is telling.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:03.310
So close it.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.370
We need to goto the am I So here we will get that information.

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.890
So it is still creating So that the reason it is telling that it is in a pending yesterday

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.150
So we will wait for it.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.780
So no,

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.440
it has created and we made No,

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.430
We will go ahead and delete the easy to instance.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.500
So we will go to is it for instance?

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.780
And here we need to select the actions and stands the state.

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.090
And here we need to select the toe minute.

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.400
Yes,

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:32.220
terminate This no longer needed as we have created the army that we will use in launch

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.080
Contra Gration.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.100
So it is dominated.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.390
No,

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.690
no.

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.080
We will move further and delete the security group which we have created with this instance

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.080
.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:45.230
We will come here and click on security groups and here we will come here and select action

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:46.610
on delete security group.

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.900
Yes,

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.780
delete No more further.

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.240
Let's jump into the diagram and let's look into that What we need to don't next.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.450
So,

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.740
no,

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.660
we have created the C two instance with the use of this Is he two instance we have

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:59.820
generated an image.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:00.060
No,

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.560
we need to configure elastic load balancer.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.650
Now let's go back toe eight of Louis management console.

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:06.390
So here,

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.400
now we need to play can load balancer,

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.250
no click on create load balancer And here we need to choose application,

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.480
load,

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.240
balance and click on Create.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.540
No,

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:16.970
we will Esposito your name.

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:17.900
Web server.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.120
You'll be it should be Internet facing.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.130
And here we need to specify into two of the availability zone availability Zone,

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.740
Zone one and the zone toe.

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:27.840
So let's go ahead.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.320
And so here.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:34.500
We need to specify that 1st 1 on the 2nd 1 and make sure that you will be choosing the

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.700
public's cabinet as I'm having only once of net over here.

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:38.950
Little because Yes,

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.460
while choosing the Cabinet,

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.330
it must be a public sub net.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.020
No click on next conflagration security setting.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.670
So we don't have security group.

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:52.160
So click on next Configure security group And here we will create a new security group.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.550
We will give it a name and here we have a specify your name.

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.420
That is where So we'll be security group remaining conflagration.

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.750
We will keep it as is so no click on next country grouting.

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:03.220
No,

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:09.340
we need to a specified target group over to name Web servers are groups or know everything

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:09.940
looks good.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:10.830
Three cornered,

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:11.990
one cell check setting.

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.320
So these are the recently metal health.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.380
You can change it as well if you want,

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.940
but we will keep it as is what It was a different configuration which is providing here to

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.330
know we will click on next register target.

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.870
They're going to keep it as is as there is nothing to configure because this will be taken

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.740
cared by auto scaling group.

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.350
So no click on next review.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:32.750
No click on Create.

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:32.980
So,

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:33.500
Lord well,

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.790
answer is now creating it is probably isn't now close over here.

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:37.740
So here it is.

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.120
Provisioning site is still provisioning it.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.150
We will wait for it now we will do the configuration for or to a scaling group.

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.730
So here we will click on or to a scaling group,

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:51.460
click on Create Auto Scaling Group Toe configuring Auto Scaling Group contents to Esther.

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:56.660
Process One is to select the launch conflagration on other ones to create an auto scaling

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:56.870
group.

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:58.120
So let's get this started.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.930
Click Konger two started so here We need to choose the A m I,

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:05.420
which we have created earlier as a long configuration.

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:05.960
So to say,

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.510
legal am I which we have created earlier.

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:09.430
We need to come here,

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:14.010
look on my am eyes and it will give us the same way which we have created.

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:19.470
We need to click on select and we're going to select 32 micro click on contribute details

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:20.730
or give it a name.

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:22.150
So I have given a name.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:26.200
Website was launched configuration So here we don't need to do anything.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.510
All thing comes from am I know.

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:30.210
Click on next and I store it.

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:33.450
So click on next configure security group.

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:36.350
So we need to configure it a security group over here.

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:39.140
So this set up is really interesting what we need to do.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.850
First we need to provide a name to let me provide it.

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:43.280
So now provided the name.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:47.450
So here we need to click on add rules and select as TTP.

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:53.360
So here we need to provide the I before load balancer because this instance is getting

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.420
access from the Lord Balancer toe.

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:55.840
Do that.

00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:00.390
We need to write SG so we will get the webs over he'll be which we have created the

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:01.680
security group earlier.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.980
Provide that or that it will be accessible from the load.

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:09.910
Balancer only know click on review Condoned configuration.

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:12.820
We will click on launch configuration,

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:14.370
create launch conflagration.

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:14.990
After that,

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:16.790
we need to select the repair,

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:18.140
which we already have.

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:22.290
I'm acknowledging it create launch configuration so forced the strip was completed.

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:22.620
No,

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:23.890
we're into second District.

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:27.280
We need to configure the auto scaling group over here,

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.330
so provide a name,

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.070
so auto scaling group.

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:32.260
So this is important in the group side.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.990
We need to have specified that at any point of time,

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:37.190
home in number off instance would be running.

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:42.020
So we had a specifying at least to any point of time and throw in the sub net section.

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:45.500
We need to specify which off the availability zone belongs.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.210
Toe this auto scaling group.

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:48.420
You go to the diagram,

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:51.080
then you will find that we have especially fired,

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.940
have little kids on one and have level it is on to.

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:58.880
So these two Jones reward do we have level into the or to a scaling group.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:08:59.700
So to do that,

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.990
we need to specify the sudden and details or let's do it.

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:08.840
So here we need to choose Liberty John one and then 21 A and one B.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.710
So no click on it once details.

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:13.720
And here we need to click on the load balancing glee.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.670
If you haven't created the target group,

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:17.160
you will get an option over here.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.700
But we have created already.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.580
So we're getting the option here.

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.630
We need to select it and health check time.

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:27.040
We're going to perform hell me and every 32nd the hell tickle happened.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.760
Now click on next Configure Skilling policies.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.390
So this is really very important.

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:32.640
If you remember that we have.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.880
It's with fried that at any point of time how many number off,

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:40.680
easy to instance will be executing in this auto scaling group were specified to.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.150
So this is really important.

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:47.130
Supposed that if we want to increase and decrease the size off the easy to instances,

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:48.770
that means if the Lord off,

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:53.790
the traffic is getting increased and you want to increase the number off instances and we

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:57.860
need to come here and select the Yucel Skilling policies,

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:00.530
we have earlier provided the size two.

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:03.820
So at any point of time it will maintain to number off.

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:04.980
Easy to instances.

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:07.900
But suppose if we want to a scale up on the scale down,

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:08.900
so what you need to do,

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:10.530
you need to come here on their.

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:11.520
Specify that,

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:14.000
and you need to click on our new alarm,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.550
and here you need to set of the configuration for alarm.

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:20.870
Suppose that ive utilization is going more than 80%.

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:24.150
Then you have to specify it and click on Create a lamp.

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:28.170
It will send a notification with the help of notification services.

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:29.260
In the same way,

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:34.110
you will also do it for the decrease groups say you suppose that's a pretty litigation is

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:39.250
going below the uses off 60% then you degrees it and he'll after that.

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:40.860
What action you need to take.

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:45.560
Suppose that if it is getting increased mortality person than number off instances,

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.910
you want to run this three.

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:49.110
You can also add the steps as well.

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:49.980
For this case,

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:51.490
we're going to stick with.

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:53.890
Keep this group at this any sensei's,

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:58.310
so that at any point of time it will maintain at least two number off instances.

00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:00.900
So no click on next configure notification.

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:03.940
We can also add the notification over here.

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:06.600
But we're going to a strict with the D for adoption.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:09.250
We're not going to have any kind of mortification.

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:09.710
So what?

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:14.780
This notification contains just looking toe that And here If at any point of time,

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:18.850
if we're launching our dominating or if any of the condition is meeting,

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:19.820
check over here,

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:21.620
then it will send the notification.

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:22.440
For example,

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:26.650
if you are easy to instances freed to terminate or fail to launch,

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:29.850
then you will get the notification work for this session.

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:32.290
We're not creating any kind of notification.

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:34.970
Now we need to click on next configure tax,

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:36.120
so give it a name.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.040
Now we will click on review.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:41.980
No click on Create or to a schooling group will create the auto Scaling Group.

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:42.950
So it created No,

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:44.550
we need to click on close.

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:47.650
So it has created So at any point of time,

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:52.040
it should run two instances currently there is no instances it will run.

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:52.310
No.

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:52.730
So,

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:53.200
no,

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.820
you will find that it is running two instances,

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:57.710
so we will look into those instances.

00:11:57.710 --> 00:12:00.440
We will go here and we will check that instances.

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:00.670
So,

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:00.920
no,

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.740
you will find that these twins.

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:05.760
Chances is running and which is coming from auto webs.

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:06.120
Over.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:06.990
So this is art,

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:10.830
or perhaps over and which is being created by the auto Scaling Group.

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:15.560
One thing I wanted to show you over here is that we haven't registered any kind of for easy

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:17.150
to instance in Target Group.

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:18.590
But if we will go there,

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:22.140
then you will find that these two instances is being registered.

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:23.440
As we mentioned,

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:26.400
it should be taken care way or to its killing group.

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:26.700
So,

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:27.380
CEO,

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:30.340
click over here and click on targets.

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:32.370
Then you will find that it is being registered.

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:34.200
Two instances is being registered,

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.780
which belongs toa order Web server.

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:38.600
So this is what I wanted to show you.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.980
Now it's time to test it.

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:41.000
So to do that,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.930
we need to click a load balancer.

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:44.560
We need to grab the D in its name.

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:48.200
So here we will grab this genus name and try to access it.

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:48.530
What?

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:49.150
It is coming.

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:49.620
Let's see,

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:50.050
you know,

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:50.840
have grabbed it.

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:51.150
Come.

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:53.060
You compose a right to access it?

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:53.810
Yeah,

00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:55.540
we're getting the project landing,

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.220
which next we re lured.

00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:58.510
Testing what we need to do.

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:02.050
We need to goto the instances and we will delete one,

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:04.770
and we will wait for some time and we will look into that.

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:09.840
The auto scaling will bring back that instance again so that it will maintain to healthy

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.720
instances at any point of time.

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:12.590
So let's do it.

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:14.170
Select one trick actions.

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:16.680
Instant state dominate is dominant,

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:21.120
and we will wait for some time and we will find that the other instance will come back

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:24.960
again because we're maintaining two instances at any point of time.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.090
So it is dominated.

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:28.680
So we will wait for 30 seconds as well.

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:32.760
The health check at 32nd as we have a specified in the configuration.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:38.490
So here you will find that it is started creating the easy to instance as it has to

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:41.550
maintain to number offense chance at any point of time.

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:46.260
The auto scaling group that the reason it is creating another instant what they did it had

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.590
checked that there were only one instance is running and after that,

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:54.180
trying that it is not matching with the auto scaling configuration toe to match it.

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:56.290
It has created another instance,

00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:58.750
and it know that which one was deleted earlier.

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:01.200
It was related in this availability zone.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:05.360
So again it has placed toe the same reverently results of CEO.

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:10.760
So it has bring back the easy to instance which was deleted or which was terminated to

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:15.770
maintain the true number often stances as which we have a specified earlier in tow,

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:17.940
the auto scaling group configuration.

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:20.760
So this set up is called high availability set up.

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.650
So this is what I wanted to demonstrate you in decision.

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:24.380
So no,

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:25.550
go back to diagram.

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:27.790
So we have designed this infrastructure.

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:31.850
There's a higher level infrastructure with the help of Porto a scaling group.

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:33.800
And to design all this thing,

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:39.110
we have used all these elements where we have use easy to instances am I?

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:43.550
Then we have created elastic load balancer security group Target Group.

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:45.950
We have used launch conflagration.

00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:51.250
Then we have set up auto scaling group and we have also gone toe a scaling policies where

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:53.200
we have keep the initial size two.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:55.040
And with the use off all these elements,

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:59.700
we have designed the higher liberty infrastructure on Arab Lewis.

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:02.810
I hope you enjoyed this project prior to closing the station.

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:05.170
I want to tell you that don't forget toe.

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:07.850
Clean up your AWS resources to do that.

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:10.550
Let's jump into the AWS management console.

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:13.050
So first we need to delete the auto scaling group.

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:14.290
We need to come over here.

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:16.350
This clean up is pretty much required else.

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:17.280
It is chargeable,

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:21.900
so make sure that you will clean up all the resources selected action delete.

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:24.920
It's to be so No.

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.220
Once you relieved this or to his killing group,

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:29.180
it will delete the instances as well.

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:30.840
Then after that we need toe.

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.440
Delete the launch configuration.

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:33.240
We need to come.

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.710
You click on launch configuration selected.

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:36.550
Action.

00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:39.780
Delete the launch configuration next to Goto the load balancer,

00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:41.070
Select the load balancer.

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:42.940
Click on actions on delete.

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:43.200
No,

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:43.850
we need toe.

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:48.900
Delete the target group to always make a practice to delete first load balancer and then

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:49.740
the target group.

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:52.200
So here you need to select the target group.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.850
Delete.

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:55.450
Yes,

00:15:55.450 --> 00:16:02.110
I checked that the Roadway Skilling Group is deleted or not going toe that is still
