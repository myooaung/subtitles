00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.390
Hello,

00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:00.660
guys.

00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.760
Thanks for joining the station in this session.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.680
We're going toe.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.960
Discuss about the AWS Cloud watch.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.400
This service is one of the mostly used.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.090
So this afraid of Louis?

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.460
So let's start our discussion on eight of Louis Cloud would.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.260
So what is the basic purpose off it of Louis Cloud?

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.470
What so basically eat of Louis Cloudwatch monitors either blew its resources on the

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.470
applications,

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.150
which we run on eight of Louis in real time.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.580
We use clothed was toe collect and track matrices.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.930
These matrices air basically variables which we can use to measure our resources and

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:36.970
applications.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.620
So to understand it better,

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.180
let's jump into the aid of Louis Cloudwatch console and we will look into the things.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.450
What are the things have level over there.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.440
So we are into eight of Louis management concert.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.110
Let's go into the cloud was dashboard toe,

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.850
go into the cloud was dashboard.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.230
We need to come over here and there is something called management and government and where

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.360
you can find the cloudwatch option who can click over here and it will take us to the

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.280
dashboard cloud.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.180
Was that so?

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.950
This is the home page of cloud work.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:08.910
So basically,

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:15.170
it gives us all the mattresses about every AWS services which we use.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.260
So in my case,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.750
I'm not using any of the resources.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.370
But see you earlier.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.980
I have created some off the easy to instant Sylvan's.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.460
I created the C two instance I'm getting all this option over here.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:34.370
But there is no particular matrices is being set up for these resources as it is not being

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:35.350
configured yet.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.260
We have set of this alarm at the beginning off the course,

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.150
if you remember.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.290
So if we're using the resources off rate of Louis,

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.360
then you will get all those details over here and you will get to know about resources.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.500
Pest free dashboard.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.060
So here,

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.150
this is not limited.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.480
Toe this page it of Louis,

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.350
provide us the capability to create our own dashboard.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.200
You should come here if you click on,

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.380
create dashboard and we need to provide the name off this dashboard.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.070
See the blue,

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.500
the mobile.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.280
Once you provide that click on create dashboard and here we can set the mattresses,

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.560
the different kind of graph you can set up.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.420
For example,

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.730
if you're tryingto creator dashboard which has compare metrics over time so you can click

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:16.270
over here,

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.390
Click on configured.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.940
So here we're finding these option and it has 107 mattresses in North Virginia.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.620
Reason so that the reason we're getting this 107 over here and we can set up as per your

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.920
requirements supposed that if we want to set up for CPU said we can search it for so it has

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.090
easy to put Instance.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.730
Mattress,

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.550
you can click it to see you Here it is displaying the earlier usage off CPU,

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.150
which we have created in some of the demos.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.630
So looking toe that so it is giving all the information.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:48.840
If you click over here,

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.100
if you want to see that,

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.500
you can find it over here.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.970
Well,

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.050
these are the instances which we have waited while doing the demo for other applications.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.430
We have created these number of easy two instances in each of the stations.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.850
That's what it is displaying over here on this is not limited.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:05.850
So this mattress it,

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.710
you can come up with your own matrices as well.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.000
So this is the way you can add graphs to your dashboard.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.330
So no moving further.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.700
Even feature is also pretty much used very miserably,

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.300
as it enables any off the infrastructure to respond on a real time basis.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:28.030
Supposed that you wanted to track some unusual pattern off your easy two instances and you

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.910
want the notification on a real time basis,

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.470
then you can use this so as the name.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.610
Such is that imagine CLOUDWATCH e.

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:42.310
When delivers a near real time stream off the stomach vents that describes injures in eight

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.240
of Louis resources to make it complete process,

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.880
you will see that three things is walking together.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:48.130
One.

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.070
This 1st 1 is determining why keeping an eye.

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:56.500
And then there is a certain rules on the bases off that these I will work and after that,

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.880
any event will happen.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:58.750
What it will do,

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.370
it will trigger some action,

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.330
and that action is a specific toe,

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.200
the targets.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.250
So here,

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:10.000
one point to remember that imagine Cloudwatch uses different various services toe build the

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.940
entire process,

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:11.840
for example,

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.850
clothed what uses a 1,000,000 simple notification services which we were looking toe

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:17.960
further in this course.

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:24.000
So Cloudwatch uses notification services to notify the users in case off any events.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.200
Aws cloud What is also used along with Easy toward to a scaling managed feature.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.750
Suppose in case if any outage will happen for any off the instance.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.550
So that means there is an event called out it.

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.140
So in that scenario,

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.290
it will send the notification,

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.970
and it will do.

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.830
The remediation of steps will do the auto scaling.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.800
There is other services called AWS Cloud Trail Go along with it of Louis Cloudwatch.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:55.900
So basically eight of Louis crowd trail enables to monitor the holes made toe the aid of

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.260
Louis clothes or a P A for our count,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.840
which includes Call made by eight of Louis management concert heat of Lewis,

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.100
come on line into fists and other services as well.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.070
Suppose that if you enable or say,

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.250
toned on the logging functionality off cloud drill,

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.930
then cloudwatch right.

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:19.410
The locks toe the imagine as three bucket that is being a specified at the time off,

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:20.870
setting off the cloud trail.

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.820
So here we're talking about law to understand how weight of loose cloud was worth.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:32.310
I wanted toe So you one of the diagram that helps us toe understanding the how we'd of

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:33.560
Louis Cloudwatch work.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.750
So let's jump into the diagram and then we will discuss.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.540
So if you look into this diagram,

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.180
then you will find that AWS Cloud,

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.740
which is basically a mattress repository,

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:44.700
for example,

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.900
resources that uses clothed war Easy to instant,

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.420
puts mattresses into the repository,

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:54.090
and we retrieve the statistic based on that.

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.990
Mattresses on one of the best feature is it is not limited to the Metris says,

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.330
which is being provided weight of Louis.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:08.810
We can also define our own matrices and put into the repository we have also probe isn't

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:13.940
toe configure alarm actions to a stop start order mini and easy to instance,

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:19.880
when certain criteria are met and this is not just limited to the information notification

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:20.280
a lot,

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.350
we can create the action able alarm as well.

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:26.040
So what does this acceptable alarmists?

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.730
So basically we can create alarm that initiate it,

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:30.570
W a C c.

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:35.850
Toward to a scaling eight of Louis Simple notifications always actions on our rehab.

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:37.110
So overall,

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:43.210
VWs cloudwatch is pretty much a straight forward services which we use basically for

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:44.420
monitoring purpose.

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:49.800
And we can use this service along with other services off eight of Louis to design the

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:54.680
resilient process in place for cloud infrastructure with aid of Louis.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:55.650
So on this north,

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:57.950
I wanted to restore decision.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.760
See you in the next season till then.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:00.100
Well,

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:00.850
why take you?
