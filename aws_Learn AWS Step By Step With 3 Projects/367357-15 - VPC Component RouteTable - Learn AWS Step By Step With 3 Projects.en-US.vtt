00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.630
Hello,

00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:00.900
guys.

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.200
Thanks for joining the station.

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:02.930
In this session,

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:07.450
we're going to discuss about another re PC components that is called Route Table.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.450
So let's jumps into the discussion from where we have left earlier.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.710
So last time we have discussed about sub nets and cider block.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:15.830
So in this session,

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.080
we are going to discuss about root table.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.450
So what,

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.490
actually route table is and why we use rooted.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:27.920
So Rude Table is one of the component off BBC where we can restore the roping information

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.070
about the sudden it.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.570
So let jump in tow the diagram,

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.790
and we will discuss in more detail about the route tables.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.230
But before understanding that how rude table works,

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.290
I wanted toe and discuss some of the major route table concept.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.460
So let's look into that work actually looted,

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.350
and then we will.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.210
And then we will come over here and discuss for the so these are the six concepts which we

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.380
are going to discuss.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.820
So let's start with men,

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:53.530
drew people.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.870
So what happens is that when you create a BBC,

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.640
it automatically has a main route table.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.220
So the question over here is what actually this main do people do so The answer is the main

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.450
room table controls the routing for all sudden it that are not explicitly associate it with

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.730
any other route table.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.560
You will come to know more about Main route table when we will do the lab.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.690
Some of the points to remember or main road table is that by default,

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.370
when we create a non differed with PC,

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.640
the main route table contains only a local roots.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.090
Here we get a new tone that is known default.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.710
Vpc.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.450
I wanted to let you know that there are two ways by which you can create a BBC.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.760
The first way is the wizard based that recall it.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.700
AZA Before we PC as most of the configuration,

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.290
we will use the default one,

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.140
which was provided way eight of Lewis and we will stick with those configuration.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.080
We will not do any kind of changes,

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.200
so this re PC is referred as default BPC.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.450
There is another way that is called normally for me pretty that is related to the custom

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.860
three PC creation to where we need to configure each component of VPC,

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.150
and then later we will associate those component at the time of creating three PC.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:15.190
So these two concepts you should remember whenever you are hearing non before we pretty,

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.740
that means it is related to the customary pretty,

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.730
where we provide our conflagration.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.540
And whenever you are hearing before we busy,

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.850
that means they're talking about.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.050
We have used wizard based re PC creation,

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.060
and we have kept the country gration,

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.620
as is,

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.620
whichever it of Lewis has provided so as simple as this.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.070
So moving further.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:42.540
Another point to remember is that when we use the BPC wizard in the console to create a 94

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.290
PPC with the net gateway or virtual private gateway,

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.250
the result automatically had route through the main route table.

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.310
For those gateway,

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.950
it's Another important point to remember is that we can't delete the main route table,

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.390
but we can replace the main route table with the custom route table so normal for the we

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.550
will discuss about custom route table by default.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.250
A costume room table is empty and we can add route whenever we needed.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:15.950
When we use the VPC results in the console to create a VPC with an Internet gateway,

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:22.180
the wizard creates a custom rooty will and add sir route through the Internet gateway.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:28.240
One way to protect your re PC is to leave the main route table in its original default

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.780
estate,

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:35.070
then explicitly associate eat new Submit that you create with one off the custom route

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.670
tables you have created.

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.080
So this ensures that you explicitly control how eat some knit groups.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.170
Traffic seem like men do table.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.870
We can add remove and mortified roots within customer table.

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:49.730
But here,

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.380
unlike Mander table,

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:52.590
we have option toe.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.510
Delete the custom route table,

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.950
but we don't have any option to delete main route table.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.470
So this is one off the difference between custom Rooty will in main route table.

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:08.190
Let's move forward earned the stand Route Table association so it is basically association

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:14.130
between a roof table and submit the ROOTY will associate it with the sub net controls.

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.820
The routing for that sub net.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.320
This is quite the straightforward,

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.960
so moving further and look into their destination.

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:26.160
This is also a straightforward so basically destination related to the destination cider,

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.950
where you want rapid from your submit to go.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.660
Once we understand destination now,

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.660
we will move forward and looking to target.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.540
Target is also very much a straightforward the target through which send the destination

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:38.060
traffic.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.850
So here,

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:39.870
for example,

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.970
Internet Gateway moving further toe Another concept doctors local route.

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.950
Local route is nothing but a default route for communication with then repeat.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.950
So now we understand these concepts,

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.980
we will move further and going toe the diagram.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.250
We will understand that.

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:55.850
How we Pretty rude table.

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:56.270
Well,

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.030
so if you're looking toe this diagram,

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.580
you will find that there is something called rotor.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:07.300
This is called implicit rotor or implied route that we use without table toe control.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.920
Where network traffic is directed Eat sub net.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.610
In our repeat,

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.470
E must be associated with the road table which controls the voting.

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:23.730
For the sudden it we can explicitly associate a sub net with a particular road table.

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:24.990
Otherwise,

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.210
the subcommittee is implicitly associated with the main road table.

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:34.990
One point to remember over here is that a sub net can only we associate ID with one root

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.550
table at a time,

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.850
but you can associate multiple sub nets with the same route table.

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.480
This is important.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.650
So this is what I want you to discuss in this session.

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.510
But prior to closing the session.

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:52.120
I wanted to show you how the voting they will look like.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.840
So basically,

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.100
it looked like this where we have an entry for destination and the target.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.250
This is the entry for the side of Loch and which is referring to the local.

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:02.780
This is also different.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.410
Tow the local here.

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:08.940
You were finding that Internet gateway in three toe that it will communicate with the

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.440
Internet when we do the lab,

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:15.760
then we will find all these things and you will feel more comfortable with all these

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:16.430
concepts.

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:21.130
One thing I wanted toe tell you that if you are not able to understand any off these

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:21.650
concepts,

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.040
that's perfectly fine.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.080
What do you have to do?

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:29.230
You need to go to the lab and look into the lab and understand that what are the things

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:30.230
exist over there?

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:31.110
And then again,

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:35.780
come back and look into these concepts that will make much sense.

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:39.620
You follow the reverse learning process you took and try this one.

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:40.250
So that's it.

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:43.140
Gates for decisions in the next session till then.

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:43.560
Bye bye.
