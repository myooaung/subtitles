00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.350
Hello,

00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:00.590
guys.

00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.550
Thanks for joining the session in this session.

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.100
We're going to do lab with a 1,000,000 history.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:05.860
Basically,

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:06.670
in this session,

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.240
we will look into all the thing which we have discussed in your theory section while doing

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.660
the lab.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.770
We will also discuss some of the points to remember while walking with s three.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.030
So let's jump into the AWS management console toe were in tow.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:25.000
Eight of Louis management console To access the three you need to come toe the a stories

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.660
section and click on history.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.650
So here you will find the option.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.390
This work done to create a bucket alerts click on Create Work it.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.410
And here you will find these options.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.140
It is the Richard based screamed where we need to provide first name and region than

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.550
country.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.970
Get often and we need to provide the set formation.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:43.850
And it again,

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.400
at the last stage it will be was the review option.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.850
While creating a bucket,

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.480
we must have to remember that it should be a start with lower case and the name should be

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.370
unique on the name is notice Patrick for the region,

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:56.600
it is a global thing.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.680
Make sure that you will be providing a unique name so that he'd of Lewis will create it.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.250
So let's try to give a name,

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.070
for example,

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.650
if you try to give a per case than it will through another,

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.610
and it will tell that given name into a lower kids.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.520
So another point to remember is that we're giving something like this and let's straight to

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.350
create it for So it is telling that this bucket is already exists.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.790
So you make sure that you will be providing a unique name.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.300
Let's give a unique name.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.940
So I have given the name look like it is going to be a union and then up towards what we

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:29.370
will do.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.120
We will select the region to make sure that you will be selecting the nearest region for my

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.450
kids.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.140
It is this your pits Wickman way.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.460
Then in the next step,

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.650
we're getting that copy settings from an existing bucket.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.480
So see you.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:47.550
You can copy the settings if you have any existing bucket and where you have set up some

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:48.220
permission,

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.630
some rules that you want to replicate it with this bucket,

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.800
you can use it to here you can choose,

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.680
but In my case,

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.420
I don't have any existing bucket,

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.570
so I will leave it blank and I will click on next.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.830
On the moment you friend is the 1st 1 You will get this blue tick mark after that.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.090
Here in the contribute options we need toe await the poisoning If we want to enable

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.140
poisoning on this bucket and you need to click on this.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.830
So here comes another point to remember is if you enable the worsening then you can't

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:18.630
disable it.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.020
You only suspend of poisoning and to enable poisoning you need to check Mark.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.600
This I believe it has is there is another option you were getting over here.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.200
It's over.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.850
Access logging So so well,

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.790
access logging is mainly related to the logging.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:32.870
If you enable this,

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.070
then we will get the information about who he is.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.480
Accessing our bucket.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.260
How many times he's accessing.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.120
So all these information will be captured in this longing.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.240
No moving further.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.590
We have other option called tax tax is similar to what we have seen earlier,

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.300
where we can provide the key value pair and it is very useful when you want to attract that

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.380
which book it is associated with rich environment.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.330
For example,

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:59.980
if you are associating this,

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.800
book it with the development environment or some testing tournament or some production in

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.150
wonderment on any other purpose for which you are keeping this bucket,

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.840
you can create the time it of Louis is three on super weight object level logging.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:14.680
So what it means,

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.940
it means that suppose if we're uploading any files and you want to track that,

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.430
who has access that file and how many times they treat me access from which I p it is being

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:25.010
access.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.220
All these details will be captured with this object level logging,

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.090
but for that you need to enable eight of Louis Cloud Print Service,

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.480
and that comes with additional costs to hear you have chosen the respective dress.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.610
In our case,

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.110
I'm not going to choose anything.

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.650
So let's move for them and look into the another option that is called set permissions.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.270
So here you will get options to provide the access to the users or who belongs to other

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.780
recount.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.730
If you remember that we have discussed about its years in or theory section where we

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.070
discuss about way we use the seals so by default.

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.690
Local public access.

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.250
This is being in ableto.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.610
That means if you try to access it from the browser than it will through the access denied

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.750
it.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.420
We were looking toe that forced.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.760
So I'm going to keep this default option here.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.630
You're finding some other option called Manus system permission Supposed that if we want to

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:23.110
provide access to any program which will write something within this bucket and you need to

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.600
enable the toe currently by default,

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.060
it is being disabled that the reason you're getting don't granted many on a three log

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.550
delivery group rate of taxes toe this bucket.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.890
Other option.

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.640
You will get that grant image industry log delivery group rate access to this bucket.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.950
We're going to stick with the default permission and we're going to click on next.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.510
Now here,

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:45.800
we're getting an option.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.510
Toe the view.

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.000
You can reveal that at a certain point of time.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.930
You want to change any of the thing you can come radically and click on it.

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:54.530
E on.

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.550
You conceded that once you are happy with this thing,

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.250
you come here and click on create bucket.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:06.950
So we have successfully created a market No we need to upload the object for the object,

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.340
which is goingto be a file,

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.620
which I have already mentioned about this.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.130
So let's click on this.

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:17.280
So we had inside the work it and you will find the option over here that you can upload an

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:17.750
object.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.700
We can set the properties object properties,

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.070
and we can also said the object permission.

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.530
So let's upload a file.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.050
Soto upload the file.

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.050
You need to click on upload and select a file.

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.550
Now our file is being uploaded.

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:33.800
We will click on next,

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.600
so we're into set permissions and let's look into the options.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.850
What other options have a level over here?

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:42.400
So you will find that manage juices,

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.960
who is donor and what kind off access I am having what kind of permission.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.060
So here I have read permission.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.780
I'm doughnut so that the reason I'm having read and write books and suppose if you want to

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.320
provide access to other AWS sickle,

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.340
then you need to use addict Con Burton and once you click on it,

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:05.400
then it will provide you the option to give the name which it won't You want to give the

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.430
access to this particular fight.

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:08.290
Currently,

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:09.900
no need to provide access,

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:10.990
so just clear it.

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.630
Now here.

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.170
This is pretty much interesting that if you look into that,

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:19.460
then you will find it is giving an option to manage the public permission and currently

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:25.060
test during the warning that you can't give because pocketable policy is blocking public

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.060
access so we can't give it no click on next year,

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.090
we will get an option to choose the storage class.

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.890
You remember that we have discussed able to storage.

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:35.210
Plus,

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.140
on the year we're getting the options like a standard,

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.600
intelligent eating standard.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:45.750
I gain frequent Texas 1 June infrequent access glace year unless you're deeper cape.

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:48.550
So we have a right to your options you can choose.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:52.800
So choose the storage class as per your need for my case.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.340
I'm going to stick with the standard that wins.

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:56.220
We will use it.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.260
People use it.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.360
That means it is an a standard option,

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.380
and the availability Jones it supports is greater than equal to three.

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.340
If you have any doubt aboard this,

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:09.800
you can refer our teary section where we have discussed all these thing in detail.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.300
Now moving for the Let's look into other options.

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:12.620
Water,

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.370
the other options given over here.

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:15.280
So here we are,

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.940
getting the encryption option so you can choose the aid of Lewis.

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:20.530
Came is must turkey on,

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:20.690
um,

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:21.180
a journalist.

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:22.020
Three master key,

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:22.980
whichever you want.

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:25.920
So you can choose any of the thing for encryption?

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:29.050
No moving for the there is something called meta data,

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:31.350
which is to say it doesn't name value here.

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:32.770
Once you define it,

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:34.040
you can't modify it.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:38.900
So that is the one off the restriction so you can check the header ordered.

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.040
The headers we have,

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.380
You can choose anyone,

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:43.640
whichever it's what you need now,

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:47.130
moving further and you need to specify the value as well.

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:52.440
So no moving for the ones who decided the storage class encryption meta data.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.450
Then we need to click on next.

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:56.950
Here we will get the option to review it.

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:59.190
Once you're happy with everything,

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:00.930
you just click on upload.

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:02.390
Once you uploaded the file,

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:04.370
then you will get the file over here.

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:07.560
Now you can select it once it is being uploaded.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.930
Just select this file.

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:12.260
Then it will given option about what are the things ever level.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:16.370
So here you will find that this file is being accessible with this location.

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:19.250
Let's cooperate straight to access it.

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:21.360
We're getting access denied.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:21.550
Why?

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:27.470
We're getting access denied because we have said that public access blocked to access this

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:27.760
Well,

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.820
we need toe unblock it.

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:31.010
So let's do it.

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:32.220
So to do that,

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:33.670
you need to come here,

00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:35.150
select the permissions,

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:37.690
and here you will get an option.

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:38.550
Public access.

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:43.340
You can provide access toe particular user as well or any of the records.

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:45.990
But for the time being were using everyone.

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:48.260
And we're going to give read access,

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:52.160
which is giving us the warning that it is accessible to everyone.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.350
That is fine for the devil purpose.

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:56.140
And click on save the here.

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.830
You need to also provide the he seals.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:00.800
For that was select anyone off them.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.140
I have selected read.

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.900
I haven't provided any right object permissions.

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:06.330
Then we will click on Save.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.350
Now we will go back and try to access this file.

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:10.650
Just repress it.

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:12.180
No,

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:15.830
we can't access it way because it is blocked that bucket level.

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:20.290
So we need to go to the bucket level and we need toe enable it.

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:21.410
So to do that,

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:27.760
let's come back and click on them were as three CP little tree little tree that is our

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:28.450
bucket name.

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:34.620
And here you need to click on permissions and then you need to click on it.

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:36.270
It Here it is during their block,

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:37.520
all public access.

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:38.740
Click on it it.

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:42.780
And here you need toe the select it and click on Save.

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:46.510
So it is telling that it is accessible by outside war.

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:47.850
So that is fine.

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:49.590
Confirm No.

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:50.950
Go back to the file,

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:56.470
which we have applauded the object your selected and provide a permission again.

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:57.100
Lead.

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:58.450
It was not accepting.

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:04.980
So here you need toe select everyone permission and click on read object provide to read

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:07.650
access Save notice said yes.

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:13.980
So let's go into the location and again try to access it Just ripped presage were able to

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.350
access the file No,

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:19.790
we have seen how to create a bucket how to upload an object toe a bucket.

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:25.600
And if we're not giving a public access to the bucket level irrespective off public taxes

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:32.200
given toe the object that is not accepting because the public access is not set or c block

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:33.450
at the bucket level,

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:36.150
then you are not able to access the objective.

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:42.560
So it is giving us a point off conclusion that if you have an object and you want to access

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:48.190
that object than public permissions should be allowed at the bucket level as well as the

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:49.070
object we will.

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:52.430
Then only you are able to access the file over here.

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:56.750
So no proceed for the click on its three and management council.

00:10:56.750 --> 00:11:00.830
So once it is being done that's looked at what are the options,

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:02.050
which is being every level?

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:04.370
You will get the option the file format,

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:06.950
and you can use a 1,000,000 net 10 toe.

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:12.090
Analyze your market me to seek welcome very kind of her thing so you can use amid unit in.

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:14.510
So always says you want to analyze what our kids.

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:15.830
We have only one file,

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:16.970
so there is no need.

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:20.420
So here you can see the option off wasn't in control here.

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:24.970
We haven't enabled any kind of wasn't so that the reason we're getting one option,

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:26.940
but if you have enabled the worsening,

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:29.400
then you will find multiple option over here.

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:30.670
No moving further.

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:35.550
Let's look into the property's Suppose we want to change any of the properties and then you

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:38.160
need to come over here and select those property.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.090
You want to change the storage class,

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:40.870
you come here,

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:42.150
click on a storage class,

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:44.370
then you will get the option to change that.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:47.350
A storage class for that particular object.

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:48.930
We want to enable encryption.

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:50.210
You can do it from here.

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:51.680
All the properties,

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:52.270
like metal,

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:53.760
later tax off the club.

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.310
All those things you can manage from this time.

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:59.620
Same kind of option you will get for the bucket level as well.

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:04.030
You click over here and then you will find the properties option for bucket level.

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:06.100
So where you can manage the worsening.

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:08.000
If you want to enable worsening,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.050
you can come back.

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:13.590
This will give option while creating on that time you have decided that you are not going

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:18.230
toe enable the worsening but later point off when you decided that I want to enable the

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:18.810
worsening.

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:20.180
Then you need to come here,

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:26.110
select the market on which book it you want to enable click on properties and then you need

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:27.470
to select the worsening.

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:29.120
If you click over here,

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.870
then it will give you the option.

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:33.870
As I already mentioned that once it is enabled,

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:35.300
it can be suspended,

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:36.850
but you can't disable it.

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:37.750
Cancel it.

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:39.150
Then afterwards,

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:40.350
there is a permissions.

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:42.350
You can change the permission as well.

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:43.940
We have already used this one.

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:46.040
You can set up the access control list.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:51.810
You can apply the bucket policies if you design any kind of a policy using policy language

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:51.810
.

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:52.170
Next,

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:56.970
we have courts conflagration that is maybe basically related with the cross original

00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:57.850
associating,

00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:03.380
which is a mechanism that uses there is no less Tito behaviors Hotel Broza toe give over of

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:08.320
application running at one origin and that is access to the selected resources,

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.700
probably different origin.

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:12.210
So you can specify the headers over here.

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:13.070
So no moving.

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:17.090
For though we have something called management within the management,

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:18.400
you can get an option toe,

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:19.770
create life cycle.

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:21.150
So to do that,

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:24.060
you can come here and you need to specify the rules.

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:24.960
What will happen,

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:30.180
which even object which is coming toe this particular bucket so it will associate it with

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:31.660
this particular life cycle.

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:39.050
You can specify that demo Thanks cycle and here you can specify any tags,

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:40.230
so let's leave it.

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:42.280
So how it is going to be transition.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:45.430
So the current wasn't and the previous world's any fair when they will,

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:46.290
any worsening,

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:47.280
you can choose it.

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:51.710
So what will happen to the previous wasn't but just select anyone off them.

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:53.990
And if you want to do a transition,

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:55.740
click on a transition.

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:59.210
What will happen that supposed that if we need off the words.

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:02.000
And if you enable that the Lear wasn't you want,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.240
we store it in tow.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:08.040
The place here so forced it will go through the standard infrequent access A storage.

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:09.200
And after 30 days,

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:13.810
we warned that that file should move through the place here than you can come here and you

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:14.650
can collect it.

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:15.340
Here it is,

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:16.410
giving us a warning.

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:17.900
Our file is very small.

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:21.570
And if we're keeping it into place here than it is used cost for you,

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:21.960
well,

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.600
that is the reason it is giving us the warning.

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:26.280
But it is a demo purpose.

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:27.290
So I'm leaving it,

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:29.370
as is I acknowledge selected.

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:30.550
Click on next.

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:31.070
Here.

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:34.880
You considered the exploration policy what will happen afterward?

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:35.190
Time.

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:38.910
So you can specify in that After certain days off time,

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:44.040
this file get deleted and you don't want to it storage so you can set,

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.640
Does it Violations policy.

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:47.410
And once it is bowing down,

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:49.510
click on next and save.

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:53.070
So this way you can clear the life cycle rules.

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:54.850
So we're going to dilate it.

00:14:54.850 --> 00:15:01.210
Selected desirable late cycle rules confirm So it is gone here you consider the replication

00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:01.870
policy.

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:04.650
Then you have an option for analytics.

00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:05.830
You can check that.

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:07.280
What is the uses pattern?

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:10.050
And then you will get an option for mattresses.

00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:11.560
So basically,

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:15.190
these are the things which is related for management off this bucket.

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:18.780
If we want to associate the thing for the management,

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:20.610
they already told that.

00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:20.960
Okay,

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:26.140
suppose that if any object is coming in tow this pockets you can associate the life cycle

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:26.410
route.

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:27.560
After 30 days,

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:30.890
it is going to sit in standard infrequent access,

00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:33.330
a storage class and after 60 date,

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:37.640
it is going to sustain toe the place here toe all this thing you can set a pinto,

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:40.510
the lifecycle ruling that you can associate it.

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:42.960
So we have already disabled it.

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:43.900
No,

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:45.910
we need to move for though,

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:51.620
on goto the millions history and select the market and delete it.

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:53.680
Just confirm it.

00:15:53.680 --> 00:16:00.110
You need to read the name so that it would delete that particular bucket couldn't from.

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:02.240
So are as three work.

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.550
It has been deleted now.

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:08.440
So this is what I wanted to demonstrate you in decision to you in the next days.

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:09.060
Until then,

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:09.320
Bob,

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:09.930
I take you.
