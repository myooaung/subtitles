00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.590
Hello,

00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:00.840
guys.

00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.800
Thanks for joining the station in this section,

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.970
we're going to discuss about a 1,000,000 machine image that is called Am I?

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.200
So there is the A M.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.490
A concept is pretty much a straight forward,

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:11.930
so to understand it better,

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.550
let's jump into the heat of Louis management console and discuss aboard the air Me.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:17.420
So,

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.700
guys,

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.020
we're into eight of Louis management concern.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.890
If you remember that whenever we're creating an easy two instance while going into the

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.390
computer and clicking on Easy to and here we were clicking on the launch,

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:35.010
easy to instance to in this process we are getting a stepped where we need to to the image

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.040
on machine image that is a mate.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.200
So here we're choosing the image in which you know,

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.710
let's understand that what actually they see me.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:42.580
So basically,

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.320
you may provide the information to launch an instance.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.980
So see you it is providing the information like what?

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.030
This instance images containing so whenever you're creating and stand losing this year

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.430
minds what this contains.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.440
So this contains,

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.380
like by tone drew people and job all these things preinstalled.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.350
If you want to create your own,

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.940
you might.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.420
You can do that as well,

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.100
so you can create the instance.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.490
We will go through the steps,

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.980
water the steps required to create our own Amazon machine images.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.010
But prior to that,

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.900
we were looking toe the life cycle over,

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:16.340
am I?

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.390
So let's jump into a diagram and then we will discuss So this diagram represent the

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.790
lifecycle of reminds.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.740
So it is telling that once you create enriched uranium way,

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:34.230
you can use it to launch new instances you can copy inhumane within the same reason or two

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:35.660
different regions as well.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.570
When you no longer required.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:38.360
And am I,

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.220
you can deregistered eight as well.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.160
So no,

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.580
let's look into the steps,

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.270
which is required to create our own am ways.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.830
So let's jumps into the AWS console.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.980
So the steps to create our only in weight is first recon launching instance from the

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:53.910
existing game.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.450
It's and then we will customize the instance.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.240
For example,

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.790
if we decided that we're going to use this,

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:00.330
am I,

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.910
then what we need to do?

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.750
We need to select this image and customize it as per our project requirement.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.340
Example.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.820
If we're building an image for our project where each developer machine must have,

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.420
Prince told reddest,

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.550
and it has 10 developers.

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.900
Then,

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:17.770
in this scenario,

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.220
it is really very helpful.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.100
Toe reinstall the reddest application within the existing game way.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.150
We will save it as am I.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.530
And that am way will be used way the developers.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.210
So whenever they will create an instance,

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.050
they will find that this is reconfigured.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.630
So in summary creation off somewhere three steps process in the force.

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.110
Chester,

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:46.550
we need to select existing Emily and we will create an instance off that particulary Emily

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.310
once for Sister Pearl done.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.870
Then in the second District,

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.710
we need to configure the created instance with our required configuration.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:55.430
For example,

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.230
in this case,

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.810
we project in will install readies application on the instance.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.170
Once it is being done,

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.670
then they will save it,

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.720
as am I and publish it,

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.180
toe the community and wait.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.340
You will get an option.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.880
Over here.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.460
There are certain community them a mite which you want to use it.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.480
You can use it toe the same way.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.610
They can also publish their my so that developers can use it.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:19.150
So,

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.420
no,

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.940
let's jump into the creation process of course,

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.040
the stuff we will come over here into the quickest aren't.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.000
And here we will select the am I to create an instance.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.140
We have selected it.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.310
Now we need to click on contribute and instance.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.740
Details will come over here and here.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.690
You can provide that whenever you were creating for a my purpose.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:40.620
You can do it.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.160
Either you provide the Buddhist trip on that time,

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.900
what will happen that it will install the required applications at the time of creation.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:49.800
Off instance.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.220
Who can do it with this?

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.830
Where as well.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:57.630
Or you can create an instance and do the installation off required applications.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.170
After launching it on one's done,

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:01.850
you can make a copy off it.

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:03.600
So in this example,

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:09.410
just consider that we are going to launch this a C two instance and just consider that we

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.590
have installed or required applications.

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:13.450
For example,

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.430
we can provide a tag over here.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.780
Whichever tag we want.

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:17.730
Toe white name,

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.630
silver click on security group.

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.620
We will keep it as is No,

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:24.720
we will launch it.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.140
So this is the easy to condition process.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.660
Once we create this one,

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.830
then we will get an instance and on that instance,

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.320
you can configure your application,

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.880
which I already mentioned here.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.810
We can create a new keep here and we can tell that And my demo once it is being done,

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.420
we can don't load the keep here,

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.900
save it and launch the instance.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.890
So it will create an instance which we have already seen.

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:50.780
This process.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.030
Now you can go there.

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.390
You will find that winning a street.

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:55.710
But it will create No,

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:56.760
it has been created.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:57.000
No.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.430
Considered that you have opened the instance and install the application,

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.590
whichever the required applications and close it.

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:05.190
So no.

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.780
You want to make a copy off your instance as a name.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:14.090
Toe that forced to step you need to do You need to first come over here and the Stop it.

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:15.660
So you need to come here.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.000
Click on the stop Once it is being a stop.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.270
Then you will make a copy off this instance as a name.

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.940
I so no,

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.550
it is being stopped.

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:24.890
So what we need to do?

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.140
We need to come over your click on actions.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.740
Images created me.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.150
So here you need to provide the details off the image.

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:38.490
So we will give it a name called I am a demo and if you want to provide a description,

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:39.680
you can provide it.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.950
We will use the same one.

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:47.380
One point to remember we're here is that if you're instances encrypted the same thing,

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:48.480
it will return.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.350
So that means for your instances encrypted,

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.820
you will get the encrypted option over here.

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.130
But if your enemy is not encrypted,

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.200
then you will not get this option.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.650
So you will get the not encrypted option over here.

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:06.960
So our previous is not encrypted that the reason it is giving us the North encrypted.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.000
And here we have a probe isn't where New Orleans.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.940
So you can use it that way as well.

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.650
But we're staying intact with this demo with the given options.

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:20.430
So now what we need to do we need to click on creating Mito.

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:21.440
Once it is being done,

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:27.040
then we will get the copy off that emitting the in my section and here you will see that

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.510
the status is bending.

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.060
That means it is creating it.

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.690
So this is being created.

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:31.920
No,

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:32.250
no,

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:32.960
let's looking toe,

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:33.340
doctor,

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:36.950
you can launch the in instance from the same way from the area itself.

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:37.510
One thing.

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:40.130
If we want to make it public and private,

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:43.540
then you can come over here and modify the image permissions.

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:44.020
So,

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:44.240
guys,

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.010
this is what I wanted to demonstrate you in decision.

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:48.940
See in the next six until then.

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:49.420
Bye bye.

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:49.950
Take care.
