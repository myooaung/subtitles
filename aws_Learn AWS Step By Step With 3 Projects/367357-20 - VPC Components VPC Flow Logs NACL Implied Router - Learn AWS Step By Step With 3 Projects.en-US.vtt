00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.740
Hello guys.

00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.110
Welcome to another session in decision we're going to discuss about remaining we busy

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.180
component that is we pretty flu log,

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.730
nickel and implied rotor.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.070
So let's jump into their discussion.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.440
So so far we have discussed sub nets Rout table,

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.740
Internet gateway elastic AP not get with not instances,

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:19.930
security groups.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.080
Now we will discuss about three PC flew low nickel and implied rotor.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.080
We will start me repeating through long.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.780
So what is re PC flow log?

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:34.010
Repeat The flow logs is one of the mechanism by which you can capture information about the

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.450
I P traffic going to and from network into phrases.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:44.700
In our repeat e PPC flew Long data can be published toe eight of Louis Cloudwatch logs and

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.810
image on a street.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:51.570
So these two services still need to discover for the time being just considered that these

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.150
air the Morton managed services off eight of Louis.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:01.440
We will discuss about Cloud what and Amazon s three in the upcoming stations No moving for

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.920
though we will understand that in worked Oslo logs can help us.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.400
So the answer over here is through logs are really helpful in diagnosing overly restrictive

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.830
security group roots.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.710
Another important task their flu log can help is monitoring the traffic that is reaching to

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:20.850
our instances.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.500
Flow logs can also help us in determining the direction off the track who went from the

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.080
network interfaces.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.960
So now we will discuss someone's to remember.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.090
For every PC flow logs flow law not only created for VPC,

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.150
we can create a flow lock for submit or a network interfaces.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.520
Suppose if you create a flow logs for a sub net or for re PC.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.110
In this scenario eaten,

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.190
you're talking to friends in the sub Nittel.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.150
VPC is monitored.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.400
Another point to remember is that flow log data for a monitor networking toe Faith is

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.460
recorded as low,

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.250
long record,

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.870
which are nothing but a lot given,

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.060
consisting off feels that described the traffic flow now moving for,

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.350
though,

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.490
when we create a flow logs,

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.460
we must have to specify for which resource we're creating this flow law.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.710
This is what I wanted to discuss with you regarding with busy flow logs.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.740
Now we understand that Why do we use now another repeat see component,

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.320
which we're going to look into it?

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.850
That network a seasons is he really stands for access control list.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.550
So let's understand that why we use network A Seal's basically undertook access control

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:36.980
list is an optional layer of security for our VPC that act as a firewall for controlling

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.400
traffic in and out off one or more sub net.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.270
So that means it is a security on top of sub minute.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.840
Let's jump into a diagram and we will understand it better.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.760
So no looking toe this diagram.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.000
Then you will find that there it is an extra layer of security on top up some night.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.340
That means you can provide inborn rule and are born rule for accessing the sub minute

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.270
through the network E seals prior to security group.

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.350
So know your family with all these components,

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.520
and you are looking into that we are having a extra layer of security in the form off

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.250
notebook access control list,

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.770
which will pass through Summit to access the instances.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.530
So now the complete picture will look like,

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.320
I suppose that if any off the request coming so it will come through router than it would

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.780
look into road table,

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.050
and then it will go into network A Seal's where network a seal's looking toe.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:39.630
The involvement are born rule whether the incoming request from an I P is being allowed or

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:40.330
not allowed.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.040
So on the basis off that it will proceed further if it is being allowed.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.510
Then again,

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.260
it will come you and check the security group whether the I P is being allowed or not

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.810
allowed in the security group to access the instance.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.820
So this is the complete No,

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:01.250
let's discuss about some of the points to remember while walking with Network A seals.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.310
This point is very important.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.370
Another point which I'm going to discuss.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.400
That is,

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.500
when we create a custom network,

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.880
a seal and when we associate with the sub net by default,

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:19.820
each custom network is heels denies all in bone and our born traffic until us specify the

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.850
rules to allow a specific eyepiece,

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.220
which you want to allow moving further,

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.820
and we will discuss another want to remember eat some nitty Nora.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.180
VPC must be associated with a network,

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.000
a seal and supposing kids,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.480
if you forgot to mention near Tokyo,

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.900
seals explicitly,

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:44.400
then submit will automatically associate with the Fort Network access control list.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:50.530
Another point to remember is that on network access control list can be associated with

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:51.720
multiple submit,

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:59.390
but the sudden it can have only one association with any network access control list at any

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.950
time.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:00.970
No moving toe.

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:01.990
The another point.

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.950
But before discussing this point,

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:09.910
I wanted to take you toe eight of Louis management console where I can show you how the

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.110
network access control list look like.

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.310
So let's jump into it of Louis management console.

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:16.870
So we are in tow.

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.090
AWS management console again.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.620
How do we can access service?

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:27.080
We can come over here and I three pc selected,

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.200
so it will take us to the VPC console.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.090
So we are in tow.

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:33.820
Vpc dashboard CEO.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.430
It is a part off sick purity.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.100
So you should remember this page.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:42.630
So now we will go into network a seal and here we will look their entry off a CSO here we

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:47.800
can see that we have six of knit association and now you will find the rules.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:48.990
The rules are in,

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:50.520
bond rules are born.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.610
Rules submit association For all these detail,

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:59.050
you can find a way so to discuss the point which I was telling now so you can see how it is

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:00.030
being designed,

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.190
you will see the the rule number it has given the rule of execution off.

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.290
These rules happened in order,

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:08.730
starting with the lowest number.

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:12.660
The highest number you can use for the rule is 3 to 7,

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:13.490
double six.

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:20.660
So keep the rules values within the range 3 to 7 double Six years of Louis recommendation

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:26.480
is that we should start by creating rules in increments like 10 or 100.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:27.150
Over here,

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:32.750
it is being used 100 so that in case any of the new rule which you want to insert,

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.470
we can insert with in between them.

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:38.160
Now let's discuss about network A seal schools.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:44.290
So you will see that the entry off Network A seal's rules which contains rule number type

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:51.890
protocol for print source allowing deny for in bond rules You are getting source over here

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:52.830
for our one rule.

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:54.640
You will get destination over here.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:59.950
So here you will find the entry rule where I already mentioned that you cannot specify the

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:05.160
number because it will execute from the Louis number type type is nothing but a type of

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.110
traffic like ssh connection.

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:08.110
In the protocol,

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:13.910
you can specify protocol that has a standard particle number in the port range where you

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:14.930
can specify,

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:16.800
like port 84 for three.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.020
And for the sources,

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:24.240
you can specify the side arranged from where the traffic is coming and allow and deny you

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:24.450
can.

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:28.370
I specify that whether it is being allowed or not allowed one last point,

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:33.170
which I want to discuss regarding network access control list is that like Okay,

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:34.750
seals are a straight list.

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:35.990
That means response,

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:38.090
which is being allowed in inborn traffic,

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:41.240
are subject rules off our born traffic.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:44.020
That means whatever allowed in inborn rule,

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:46.400
the same will be allowed in our bone rules.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.250
But that is not the case with the security group,

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:52.020
which I have discussed in one of our session.

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:56.250
So this is what I wanted to discuss with you regarding Network A Seal's rules.

00:07:56.250 --> 00:08:00.140
So let's move further and let's look into another VPC competent.

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:04.510
So another component which we're going to look into is that implied rotor.

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:06.140
So let's discuss about implied.

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:08.050
There are turtles jumping to their diagram.

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:10.780
It is one of the straightforward component.

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:14.280
If you look in tow that it is nothing better component,

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:17.060
which is helping in routing the traffic.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:19.990
So any traffic which is coming or going,

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:21.620
it will go through rotor.

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:26.670
It will check that from where the traffic is coming and from where it will go.

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:29.210
This is what I wanted to discuss in this session.

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:31.420
See you in the next session till then,

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:31.670
Bob,

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:32.250
I take you.
