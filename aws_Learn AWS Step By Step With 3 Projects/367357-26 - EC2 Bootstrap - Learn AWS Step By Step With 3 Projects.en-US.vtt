00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.470
Hello,

00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:00.720
guys.

00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.750
Thanks for joining the station in this session.

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:04.710
We're going to look into easy toe.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.540
Put the straps who let's jump into the AWS management console and create the Buddhist trap

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.520
for installing the Apache Isobel STT PDs over while creation off.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.800
Easy to instance.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.550
So we're into it of Louis management console.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.550
So prior to writing the Buddhist trap,

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.520
let's discuss about toward the exercises which were going toe perform in this lavish.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.730
If you remember that in our last session we have created a web Sobel.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:31.890
Along with that,

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.460
we have created an estimable file and that has table file.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.120
We deployed in toe a party reps over aan den.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.860
We have access that s team will file from the browser and to make an easy two instance as a

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.510
web so over we have gone through various a steps where we have first created the easy to

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:51.230
instance.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.780
And then we log in tow that easy to instance,

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.850
with the help off party application.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.070
After that,

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.820
we have manually installed apart.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:01.450
It's over.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:07.640
And then we have deployed this team and so there are various steps involved in that.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.150
Who is that process?

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.470
What I'm going to do in this lab.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:19.220
I will create an easy two instance and also write a Buddhist wrapper script that will

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.910
install the STT PD.

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:21.540
So well,

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.880
that is a party s over.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.490
And then it will grab the meta data information.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.990
And from that meta data information,

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.000
it will grab the instance I d and put it into index dot html.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.670
And once it is being done,

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.150
it will start the service for a party s over,

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.670
that is STD PD.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.670
So now let's execute their steps to execute the steps.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.750
We need to come over here and select the easy to from the compute.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.800
So we're into easy to dashboard.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.280
So now we need to click on launch instance.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.200
So here again,

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.010
we need to click on free two year only and select the first option.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.900
And here we need to click on configure instance details.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.150
We will leave all these options the default option,

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.190
and we will come over here and within the user data section.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.070
We need to specify the Buddhist traps.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.090
So let's trade the boldest trapped who We will start it like this.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:24.400
Then we need to install the TT pds after told TPD.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.280
So after that,

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.450
we need toe check contract.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.300
Once it is being done,

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:37.190
we need to call the meta data link.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.110
If you remember that,

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:47.720
we need to write cool as TTP Colon 169 Talk to try for thought.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:58.420
169 not toe four Greatest meta high phone data slash and chance I d When we will put it

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:09.530
Toto as table four girl where slash w w do that is Deimel class indexed or test email.

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.050
And then afterwards we need to start the service.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.490
22 pretty start.

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:17.550
So that's it.

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.500
So then we will proceed four,

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.890
though,

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:20.960
and click on next time.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:21.640
The storage?

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.100
No.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.580
Here.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.600
We need to click on again at text here.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.360
We cannot attack on.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.150
Give it to me.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.440
We're going to create a web Sobel.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.680
So give it to the web Server elected Have already done not clear that The reason we're

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.620
getting the option.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.750
No click on next.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.200
Contribute security group.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.580
We're going to use the existing security group.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.950
So we have used last time this one.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.450
So we will use this one only.

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.170
What if we want to create?

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.950
We can create,

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:57.950
but this is OK we will click contribution launch And here we will click on launch.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.430
We're going to use the same.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.310
We see too Que pill,

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.790
which we have created earlier.

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:04.950
We will acknowledge it.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.610
Launch instance.

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:07.430
No,

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:08.320
it is launching.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.400
So click on the instance 80.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.790
So it is creating No.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.070
So it is created.

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.290
No,

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.560
no,

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.680
we need to grab this I p on.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.250
We will check that whether it is excessive will or not.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.950
Click in tow.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:22.740
CEO,

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:30.120
we're getting the index door test email and it is giving us the instance I d So look here.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.540
For instance,

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:37.100
86 year zero toe and it is returning the same 60 of the roto.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.680
So all this thing we have done with the help of bootstrapping.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.820
So this is what Karl as a bootstrap.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:43.570
So that's it.

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.860
Guys,

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.550
this is what I want you to demonstrate you in this session.

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.450
So in the next session till then,

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.700
Bob,
