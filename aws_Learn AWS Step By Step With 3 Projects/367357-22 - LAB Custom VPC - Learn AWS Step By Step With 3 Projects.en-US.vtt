00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.930
Hello guys.

00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:02.160
Thanks for joining decision.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:02.880
In this section,

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.320
we are going to implement custom repeat see?

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:10.730
So let's jumps in tow the diagram off customary PC which we are going to implement in this

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:11.020
app.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:16.520
So this is the architecture off our custom vpc where we're going tohave to sub nets of net

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.510
wants of Netto,

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:18.700
Main road table,

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:19.950
custom route table,

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.320
Internet gateway and the implied rotor.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:22.850
So no,

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.920
let's jumps into the heat of Louis management console and design our vpc So we are in tow

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.670
AWS management console.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.950
And here we need to go below.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:33.520
And there,

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.750
in the networking and content delivery,

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.700
you can click on re PC.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.080
It will take you to the VPC desperate.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.720
No,

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.290
we're into vpc dashboard.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.740
Next,

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:48.030
we need to click on your PPC this We have already seen that we have a default entry for a

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.050
day for the BBC.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.450
We have already discussed in our last session.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.820
Now here we need to freak on this Create we PC weapon first,

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:56.810
let's create it.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:57.810
So we're in tow.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:58.980
Creatively prissy form.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:59.900
Let's understand.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.110
Here you need to provide the cider block range you remember?

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.570
Why do we use side of Loch Range side of Loch Range will be used to provide the range off I

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.940
P addresses at the third option I p with six cider block,

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.180
we need to choose No,

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.760
I people succeed of look for this particular implementation at the fort,

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.790
there is something called tendency.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.340
We will look into the options so default and dedicated to dedicated.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:30.030
So that means the hardware which is being a located toe this vpc that is goingto be only

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.690
used were you so that means it is not shared.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.330
But if we were using before to that hardware is being shared,

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.050
whichever eight of Liz will locate to you.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.170
So this is the difference.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.560
So let's fill out the form toe here we will,

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.630
right on the range which we are going to provide over here is that daughter don't know 00

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.510
slash extinct so you can get the information.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.770
If you have any doubt,

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.800
you can place your course over here.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.700
It will let you give you some tools,

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.710
tips that way this feel IDs being used for because I already explained no moving for the

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.290
week politically con create what?

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.090
Until we have,

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.100
you don't create Witten So it will not take much temps.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.300
So it is being created.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.780
So now it will take us toe the VPC desperate.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.950
Here we have created this one custom repeats and if you will go inside that,

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.150
then you will find all those detail what it has being a So the main thing you will find

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.870
over here that the default BBC you were getting over?

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:22.260
No,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.190
as it is a customary pretty.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.420
So let's look into that.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.440
What are the things which is being created when we have created discussed a repeat c So the

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.920
resources which is being associated with customary pretty we were going to solve nettle.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.240
We will find that only 67 it not Virginia reason and that is being associated with the

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.360
default Be pretty.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.050
So that means there is no communities automatically video.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.160
We need to create a suddenly and that we need to associate with a custom repeating Let's

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.510
look into the round table,

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.500
go to the round table on what we will find over here the main road table it has created.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.320
So why default?

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.290
Whenever we were creating any kind of v p c x,

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.350
create main route,

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.440
they will by default and that is being associated with the custom repeating.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.170
Go there,

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.750
then you will find over here and you will find that main door table,

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.780
which is ending with 60 Cito.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.490
Now we will go to the devil and we were very find that it's ending with 6 82 So that means

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:22.080
this round table is being automatically created when we created the custom bpc.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.280
So let's move further and looking toe that other competent with that it has been created or

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.590
not.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.510
We will move for the Internet gateway.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.380
So you will find that there is only one entry that meant it hasn't been created.

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.660
Any kind of Internet gateway this Internet gateway is being associated with before we PC,

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.290
no moving further and looking toe the other component from the security aspect goto the

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.360
network a seals and you will find that there is an association the year customary PC,

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.870
so it has by default created a network a seal's nickel for our customers.

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.870
So how do you are going to find that it is being associated with our custom?

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.650
Vpc will check over here.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.140
It meant in that customer.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.680
Now we have seen that network case years normal for door and looking toe The security

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.620
groups within the security group you will find there is one security group is also being

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.810
created to look into that Over here This is the security group which is associated with our

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.010
customary PT hold.

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.680
We were into fighting the customer everything the I d and you will check here that what it

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:25.010
is ending with 58 for you can go there to your reap between created ending with five report

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.140
And that name is the custom repeated.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:32.220
So it is being associated with the The security group is being associated with the custom

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.630
repeated to just give a name that has come before security group so that you can identify

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.850
it.

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.600
It is always a good practice to give tagging so that you can recognize it to know we will

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.790
proceed for their and creator sub net and that we will associate with our customary PCU.

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:53.170
Let's go toe the subject And here we need to create on click on create sub net Now in this

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.520
form,

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.380
we need to fill in the details off the summit which we want to create,

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.510
like name off the summit and which we piece it is going to associate it with.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.730
And we need to provide the availability.

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:04.020
Joan,

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.650
Preference.

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:05.820
If you will not provide,

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.750
then it will automatically choose that.

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:13.520
And here we need to provide the I p before cider block or summit which must be fall within

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.310
the wider range which we have defined when creating the VPC.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.450
So let's fill in their details Now Here we will fill that east of nets of net one and here

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.660
we need to choose the customary PC.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:25.430
And here it is,

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:26.870
tagged also default,

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.040
BBC and custom.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:33.310
VPC So now it has automatically pick up the VPC cider block if we're not going to choose

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:38.040
availability zone and what will happen that AWS will automatically pick the availability

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.010
zone for us Now here we need to define the range.

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.950
But prior to that,

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.540
we will also choose the availability zone over here.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:45.840
So we will choose the U.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.050
S.

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.830
East one so it must be associated with one off the availability zone.

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.340
If we will not provide,

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:52.980
then it will automatically pick up.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.570
But we have to the newest East one now here.

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:00.310
We need to provide the sub net or you will write and not zero dot We should all into the

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:01.040
side of rain.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:06.130
We have provided i p before cider blocking defect Any point of time if you have any doubts

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:11.110
so you can get the information with these iconic over here you will get the details vote

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.340
What?

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:11.780
Actually,

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:17.280
it is why this really getting you So it has given for each of the field we were using And

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.030
what is the purpose off these fields?

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:20.580
So click on create weapon.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.840
Once it has been Dunton our sudden it is being created to see your We have created a custom

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.380
sub net and it has given that to 51 Do you remember why it is 2 51?

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:34.680
As I told you so This is 32 We talked on 30 to minus 24.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:40.020
It has given a on We will find that again I will do the same calculation for you to hear

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:47.270
our calculator latest 30 to re talked it and we have told that we're going to use 24 so 30

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:53.600
to minus 24 We remain with eight weeks and if you take out to put the power rate.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.530
Then we will get to 56.

00:06:55.530 --> 00:07:01.150
And I already mentioned that five addresses which is being blocked way Amazon so that you

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:07.940
can remove it 2 56 minus my door for and the last 1 to 51 so that the reason we're getting

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.830
over 2 51 or no moving further,

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:14.390
you will find all the detail over here to see you were getting default cabinet.

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:14.730
No,

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:15.910
so far what we have.

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:16.160
Great.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.040
So let's go jump into the diagram.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:18.810
So so far,

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:23.670
we have created the sudden it that a sub net wonder and we have given the names of minute

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:23.900
one.

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:29.040
So now moving further and we will create those off Netto which is being associated with the

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.820
different availability it's on.

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.820
So let's jump into the AWS console now.

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:34.480
Now again,

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:35.920
click on Create submit.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:36.870
And here again,

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:41.640
we need to provide thesis of net of net to and we proceeded going to associate it with the

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:47.480
customary PC and here we will choose this time some different availability in select U

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.510
assist won't be.

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:52.270
And now here we need to provide the cider rain's off year and not,

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:52.850
you know,

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:54.930
don't order little dot to 0.0.0.

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:55.910
That's 24.

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:57.860
So now we have to find our range.

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:01.570
Now click on create weapons so it will create a second submit.

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:03.260
We will go and verify it.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.480
So now we have some knit one and submit toe.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:07.340
You will go there.

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:07.870
Diagram.

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:11.170
We have created the sub net one and some Nitto now moving further.

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:15.540
So now we have to make sure that one off the sudden it is being a public servant.

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:17.080
So how do we can do that?

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:22.440
We need to goto the Internet gateway And first we will create the Internet gateway.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:28.120
We can create Internet gateway to know here you need to provide the name so you can

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:34.420
associate C i d w And then you need to click on create So it is being created.

00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:39.020
But you will find that their status detect So we need to make sure that it should be

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:39.490
attached.

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:40.350
To do that,

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:44.250
we need to come your actions and at that has to be prissy.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:47.280
We need to select the customary pretty.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.510
We have selected it and click on the attack.

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:51.000
So no,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
this idea w is being asked with the customary PC So no,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.010
it is being get it.

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.390
And here I want to be a treat.

00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:03.960
The point to remember which we have discussed in a two resection on that is you thatch.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.070
A single Internet gateway.

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:09.440
Will BBC at any point of time now moving further,

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:13.080
we will go into the road people and create a custom wrote table.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:18.630
And then we were less was here this Internet gateway to that particular road table so that

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:21.820
we can have our Internet access within the VPC toe.

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:23.320
We're into the low table.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:28.220
So we need to create over your create wrote table and given name so that you can easily

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:28.910
eight into foreign,

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:30.080
customer or table.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:34.910
And here you need to specify which will be see you want to associate customary pretty.

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:40.410
We want to associate it can create weapon It has created a custom wrote table and here you

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:45.050
will get an intriguing what we need to do We just need to select it and need to check what

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:47.420
intrigued has when it is being created.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:50.850
Click on data you will find that it has ah local.

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:55.160
Do you remember that why it is being local and we have discussed this thing in North Theory

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:55.780
section.

00:09:55.780 --> 00:10:00.730
I have explained it all just because he's cider rains reachable in stances which exist

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:03.960
within the cider drink that should communicate with each other.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:08.910
So any traffic which is coming with within this traffic rain that will communicate all that

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:08.910
.

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:14.010
The reason it has already being entered within this road table tweeted that level by

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:14.540
default.

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:15.110
So here,

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:19.290
the point to remember reiterated that whether it's a main road table or whether it is the

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:20.470
custom road table,

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:23.460
this entry must exist within no doubt table.

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:26.670
Now we need to associate the Internet gateway,

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:29.140
which we have created in the last step,

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:32.450
and we will associate that Internet gateway over here.

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:33.710
So how to do that?

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:36.350
We need to come over here and click on Edit Room,

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:38.590
and then we will get an option toe add route,

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:44.450
and here we need to specify zero dot 0.0 Zito's Last Zero.

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:48.760
This is telling that this is going to be applicable for all the traffic,

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:51.950
and here we need toe choose the Internet gateway,

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:56.760
and here we need to specify that which Internet get with which we have created.

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:58.430
The idea of look like over here.

00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:00.950
And now we will need to clear save roots.

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:02.740
Click over your clothes.

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:04.790
Now we need to associate a sub net,

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:06.630
which we want to make it public.

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:07.910
So come here and here.

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:11.690
We need to select one off the summit and associate pull.

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:13.610
Do the seven IT association.

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:15.970
We need to come over here and click on edit,

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:17.160
submit association,

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.560
And here you need to select one off the Cabinet,

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:20.580
which we have created.

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:24.390
So we're going to make it seat summit one as a public submit photo.

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:24.930
Do that.

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:25.350
First,

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:27.590
we have to click on this and save it.

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:33.100
So now we have associated the sudden it for next to we need to make sure that or to assign

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:34.850
public I pre is being enabled.

00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:35.850
So how to do that?

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:38.040
We need to go into the sub nets,

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.540
and then we need to select the cease of net one.

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:44.150
And here you will find auto assigned Public Summit is no.

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:45.670
So what we're going to do,

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:46.650
we're going toe.

00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:47.440
Make it?

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:47.910
Yes.

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:48.770
How to do that?

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:51.260
To make sure that you have selected that sub net.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.540
And now we need to go on actions.

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:55.580
Modify your to assign I p Here,

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:57.890
we need to select enable Auto,

00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:01.010
it's I in public i p v four address and click on save.

00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:02.150
Now go and check.

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:04.860
So we will find that auto assigned public eyepiece.

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:05.230
Yes.

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:05.780
Oh no.

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:09.600
We have done with the all VPC component configuration.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:09.890
No,

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:15.390
we will move for the and create an easy to instant which belongs toe This custom re PC who

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:21.280
lets movinto the main console and from there we can create are easy to know we're into easy

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:21.940
to dashboard.

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:27.500
We need to come over here and select the longe Easy to instances and here you will select

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:32.820
the free two year only and then we need to select them is only next and then we need to

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:38.360
select the configurations translated and here we need to select the customary PCT there it

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:42.300
automatically Tuesday some nights which is being associated with this,

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:44.000
so we need to select the U.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:44.180
S.

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.250
Is east one as it is a public.

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:49.620
So we're going to create a public instant So here,

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.780
So that means we need to associate with the sub Netto,

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:58.750
which is being associated with the Internet Gateway tal this sudden it is being associative

00:12:58.750 --> 00:12:58.750
.

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:04.130
So once you have selected the sub net which is being associated with the public Internet

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:05.910
gateway So why we're doing this?

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:12.710
So because we wanted to launch our easy to instant in public submit so that the reason we

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:19.500
are associating with the C seven it won as it is having an association with Internet

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:20.080
Gateway.

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:26.550
So that means this is he Two instance can be accessed using public I p no more photo and we

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:28.280
will go there and click on.

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:29.430
Next are the storage.

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:34.040
We will leave it as it so we will go toe neck and here we can add some tag.

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:35.050
If we want,

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:38.180
we can give Ian visa webs over.

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:39.630
So now no,

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:43.650
next year we will move further and click on Configure Security Group.

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:49.000
So here you can create a new security group We're also going to create over here.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.400
So here we need to choose that s TTP.

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:57.770
So now you can give a name the SG group costume at Citigroup.

00:13:57.770 --> 00:13:58.990
Once it is being done,

00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:01.070
So click on review and launch.

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:02.100
Click over here.

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:02.960
Here again.

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:09.860
You need to provide the keep your given name that still BBC demo Don't Lord the Keep Here.

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:10.940
Save it on launch.

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:13.100
Easy to instance So it is launching.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:13.390
No,

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:14.390
we will go there.

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:15.080
So see,

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:15.510
year,

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:20.550
this is C two Instance got launch and it is being assigned that public I about what we need

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:21.620
to do this.

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:23.520
We have long enough Public summit.

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:28.800
Next instance we're going to launch and we will launch in tow the private submit so that we

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.760
can have this infrastructure design in place.

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.050
So let's jump into it of less console again.

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:40.090
So this time we're going to launch an easy two instances in our custom BBC with private

00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:45.420
submit So click on launch and stances and the stream against Select Free to your only

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:51.440
select And here you need to click on confident instance retail Tamir select the customary

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:58.500
PC And this time we're going to select C sub Nitto So it is already being selected as this

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:04.580
sub net is being associated with private summit because we haven't configured any kind off

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:06.700
Internet gateway with this sub net.

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:12.220
So it should be through the favorites of net only now click on Next are the storage.

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:15.200
We're going to leave it has this leak on our tag.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.880
We're going toe click on add tangled example.

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:20.350
We're going to keep it as a name.

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:22.470
Give it to name.

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:28.450
So private and stance mainly we can keep databases so you can give it a name Database one

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:30.150
which is residing in tow.

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:31.210
The private summit.

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:34.870
Now we will move for the configured security group.

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:37.430
So here you can create another security group.

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:38.580
Give it a name.

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:39.060
Thieves,

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:40.560
Private security group.

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:46.950
So here we will add rules so that it could be excess able from the database protocol only,

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:47.910
for example,

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:48.680
might sequel.

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:52.460
And it should be accessible from our public Soften it.

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:55.050
So we will choose that we will add one more.

00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:55.630
All right,

00:15:55.630 --> 00:16:02.940
CMP so that we can ping it for rights and be over here all light cmp ap before and we can

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:05.590
access one lee from the public Instance.

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:06.780
So here,

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:07.360
Now,

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:11.760
this easy to instance is being accessible from this I p,

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:14.150
which is associated with our public.

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:20.150
You see two instance here we can make sure that a sausage connection also you will do it

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:26.080
from this issue to instance proceed for the click on reviewing launch now click on launch.

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:28.170
So we need to provide a new key.

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:31.260
Pairs were more one you can give downloaded.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.020
We can launch instances.

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:33.520
No,

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:35.970
A recent wins chance getting launch.

00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:37.140
So see you.

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:40.630
This is having on Lee the private I p.

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:47.650
But nor the public AP on this instance is only exercisable through the I p which we have

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:48.160
mentioned.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:51.120
That is our public easy to instance so no,

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:55.860
we have to easy to instances running one has the public ap you will see you.

00:16:55.860 --> 00:17:00.460
And if you look into here the database is one it doesn't have the public.

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:01.320
I be so no,

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:02.970
we have completed our designs.

00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:06.540
So let's goingto the diagram and understand that what we did.

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:12.240
So we have completed this infrastructure designed where we have launched Too easy to

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:17.470
instances one in the private submit Another one is the public submit and those

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:23.200
subcommittees being associated within the custom vpc where we have created our Internet

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:28.460
gateway and associate id the custom submit one with the Internet gateway.

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:35.160
And then we have also created a custom route table where we had make an entry for that

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:36.360
Internet gateway.

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:37.020
So that's it,

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:37.340
guys,

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:38.530
this is what I wanted.

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:41.500
Toe the most treat you in this sessions even the next session.

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:41.980
Till then,

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:42.270
Bob,

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:42.920
I take you.
