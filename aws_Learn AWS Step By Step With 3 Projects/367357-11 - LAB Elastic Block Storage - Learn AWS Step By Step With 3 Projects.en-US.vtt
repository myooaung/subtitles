00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.400
Hello,

00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:00.690
guys.

00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.480
Welcome to the session in this session,

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.010
we're going toe do the lamb.

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.670
So basically,

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:05.300
in this love,

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.440
what we're going to do,

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.020
we're going to create an easy two instance.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.780
And then we will stop that easy to ends tents,

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.700
and we will take the route volume and we will create the snapshot.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:16.050
So,

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:17.850
after completion off this lab,

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.400
you will learn about how to start or out with stop B C.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.080
Two instance and how toe detest the route volume off.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.250
Easy to instance.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.540
And then you will also learn how to take snap shirt off that route volume devious solar

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:32.330
jumps in tow,

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.780
the aid of Lewes Council,

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.170
and we will perform the exercise.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.200
So we are intuitively this console.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.590
So as I already mentioned that how to access the easy to instance we have already visited

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.030
over here,

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.870
we can use it.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.370
One of the mostly used method it's you have to use to search box and type is easy to click

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:50.980
over here.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.850
So it will take us to the dashboard to were into easy to dashboard.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.830
So here what we need to do we need to play con launch Instance if you remember that we have

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.720
performed the same exercise in our last session.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.890
That is elastic compute cloud position.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:13.380
And here we will click on free tire Only then we will find that worst option that I mean

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.340
the only next to weigh in my image medium.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.900
So we will select this one,

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.050
and here we will get an option to choose the instance tape.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.830
And here we're getting The TV is only CEO.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.280
So this is offering us whenever we're creating this instance.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.850
Cordy,

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.740
toe Micro and devious is goingto be a tent where this operating system in being in stores,

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.060
were going to use it.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.180
So now we will click on next Contra gration instead of detail these exercises we have

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.070
performed earlier.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.610
So we're going toe stick with the default configuration.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.760
All these thing I have explained in our last session.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.190
So if you have any doubt about what are these options are you can with it last,

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.280
So no click on next added story.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.230
So here we get an option that you can add a new volume and we have already a rude volume

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.520
attached with this easy to instance.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.840
So we're again going toe stick with the same configuration and we will go ahead and click

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.110
on next time tax.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.500
And here we can add some Thai like,

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.850
Oh,

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.590
in one moment this is again going to be a devil.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.550
We're telling it the other day we will stick with one tag only now on,

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:23.390
click on next,

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.520
configure security.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.240
But also here you will make sure that you will be providing anywhere.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.280
So what it will do.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.390
It will open the port as a such port as such is used for road.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.070
The more Dexter Inlay necks that means you can access the CC two instance from outside

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.760
computer.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.380
You can access this easy to instant from any.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.290
So that's what here we're setting the Fire World Room were career dinger as a such a

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.260
security group.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.970
So we will provide the name of Lewis devious Syria's we can provide over here and now,

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.540
once it is being done to make sure that you were choosing anywhere if we will not choose

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.230
this one than what will happen,

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.430
you need to express if I for example,

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.500
my a p than you need to a specified this I p or custom.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.440
So you need to provide the i p off the machine.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.670
So it is accessible toe that particular.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.950
But for testing purposes on for the training purpose,

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:24.380
I'm going to use anywhere so that this easy to instance can be accessible from any of the I

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.800
B.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.990
So now we need to click on review and launch toe.

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.280
Once you click on this,

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.930
then you will get an option to review it once it is being done.

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.850
So here you need to click on launch.

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.520
So know this thing already,

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.650
Bean explained in our last session.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.140
So what do you have to do?

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.910
You have to provide a create a new keep here.

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.040
So we're going to give it a name aws devious.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.530
It will generate or dark Pam file which we will generally access from the party software

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.090
which I have explained you party.

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.640
Basically,

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.360
we're using toe connect brutally next machine from window.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.900
This is no system return amusing.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.510
So I need to connect toe this least lee next machine.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.340
That is easy to instances based off only next machine.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.830
So I need a party software.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.240
So but if you're using early next machine on during the training,

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.130
so now it is being done so here.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.610
We need to download this.

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:17.140
Keep it.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.810
So this is pretty much important if we will not do because this option you were getting

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.510
only wants to click on that.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:24.540
Save it once,

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:25.740
don't click on launch.

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:26.490
Instance it.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.890
So here you will find that the instances being created it is still creating.

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.900
So we're into a pending the street.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.050
If you look into that,

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:40.850
it has located this public I p this public I p we will use for connecting toe this easy to

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:41.620
instance.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.030
But in this level,

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.360
I'm not going to connect it.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:50.510
I wanted to show you that How toe detach the obvious route volume and then how we're going

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:51.990
to take the backup.

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.350
So now see your it is in the running a straight to know what we need to do.

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:57.570
We need to come here,

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:02.810
come into the volume and you will find that there is a root volume you will find over here

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.810
.

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.380
So this is the route volume which we are using.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:10.230
We will find this is associated with easy to instance which we have created.

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.470
Just know so to detach it.

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.080
What do you need toe First you need toe stop.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.600
The easy to instance which we have created.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.710
So let's go into the easy to that movinto,

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:22.710
the running and stand.

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.550
And here you can directly go.

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:25.920
If you click on instances,

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.010
you can come over here.

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.720
You know,

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:34.620
you can select all the actions which you want to toe perform on this easy to instance.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.310
So you select it and click on actions.

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.530
And here you will get an option.

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:40.390
For instance,

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.860
a state.

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.230
And here you will get an option to a Stop it.

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.100
So you need to come here and click on the stop.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.810
So once you select this one,

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.180
you can stop it.

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.710
So no,

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:50.750
it is being a stop.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:55.870
So make sure that whenever you are performing this action for taking the backup are

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.100
creating a snapshot.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:03.930
You should stop it on beat as the volume root root volume so that we don't have any running

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.420
processes while taking the backup.

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.890
Tono,

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:12.010
let's jump in tow the volumes click on the volume and we will get here and we can detest

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.960
the volumes once you detach it.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.430
Now we're ready to create the snap short just waiting for it to CEO.

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.520
It is the work is in progress.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.480
So now it is being detect.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:22.790
No,

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.530
we will goingto the snapshot and we will click on,

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:26.690
create snap shorter.

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:31.730
Here we will get an option to select the volume and we're getting the volume over here,

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:33.010
so you need to select it.

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:34.360
Provide the description.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.250
So now our route volume is not encrypted.

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.750
That the reason you were getting option not encrypted.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.330
So it will go as is If it is encrypted,

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:46.310
then you will get an option when encrypted the option enable over here.

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:47.140
So it is right.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:49.390
No other route volume is not encrypted.

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:50.670
So once it has been done,

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:52.130
you have provided or detail.

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:53.790
If you want to add any tag,

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:55.260
you can associate the tank.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:56.480
But for this level,

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.750
I'm not going to use it.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.580
But if you have multiple instances,

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:02.310
it is really very useful.

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:07.680
I suppose if you're having a project and where we have multiple in one moment and where we

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:13.030
have multiple and stances and you want to take the backup so you can easily group does the

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:19.590
instances volume or say V is volume back up and we you can Dagget,

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:22.920
So just click on now Create snapshot.

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:26.350
So it has created a snapshot.

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:30.250
Now close it and you will find that it is in the process.

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:31.420
Once it is being done,

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:32.810
then we will get an option.

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:33.970
Once it is being done,

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:35.620
a snap shirt will be created.

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:37.670
So here it has been completed.

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:41.240
Now you can use this snap short to do the following thing.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:44.350
Either you can create a volume with the same snatcher.

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:46.280
You can create any meat.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:51.860
Imagine machine emits so that you can create and easy to instance,

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:53.840
on this snapshot,

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.520
or you can copy it.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:58.470
So here you can also change the added tags.

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:02.320
You can modify the permissions over here so couldn't lead his private.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:03.720
You make it public as very.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:04.870
Just cancel it.

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:06.350
We're not going to do anything.

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:10.920
So this is what I wanted to demonstrate you in decision in this lab session,

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.910
seeing the next session till then.

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:13.450
Buh bye.
