00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.600
Hello,

00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:00.870
guys.

00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:02.800
Thanks for joining decision in this session,

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.100
we're going to discuss the vote.

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.670
Another BPZ components.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.380
That is a good only Internet gate with So let's jump into the discussion.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.450
So basically an instance in our public submit can connect to the Internet through the

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.710
Internet Gateway if it has public I P v four address or an I P.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.910
V six address as we already know that I people six addresses are globally unique and

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.650
therefore public by default.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.750
Now suppose if we want our instance to be able to access the Internet along with that,

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.840
we also want that to prevent the sources on the Internet from initiating communication with

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.470
our instances we can then use Agrees only Internet gateway.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.580
Now let's look in tow This diagram in this diagram every PC has an I.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.970
P V six cider block on the submit in the VPC has people six cider block.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:02.190
A custom route table is associated with sub net one and points all Internet bound I P V six

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.910
traffic to and egress only Internet gateway in the VPC here,

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.450
I want you to discuss some of the characteristic off,

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.950
agrees only Internet gateway with agrees only turn it gateway.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.250
We can't associate a security group,

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.100
can you?

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.820
Security groups of four hour instances in the privates of net toe control the traffic to

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.470
win from those instances.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.940
Another one of the characteristic off a grace only Internet gateways that we can use on

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.840
nickel that is cornetto is heel toe control.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.430
The traffic to and from the submit,

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.300
for which the agrees only Internet get reroute traffic will work.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.130
If you understand this diagram,

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.160
then you can easily understand that egress only Internet gateway.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.050
So now we have little understanding about agrees only Internet Gate with no,

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.500
we will jump in tow creative Lewis management console and look into the VPC section.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:08.080
And from where we can create this if Greece Internet it we or Cygnus only Internet gateway

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.080
.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.480
So let's go to the aid of Louis console management.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.850
So we are in tow eight of Louis console management.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:15.510
So here,

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.370
when I want to access the VPC than first thing we need to do,

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.920
we need toe take on services and here we need toe type BPC.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.410
Then we will get the option and when we goto the VPC,

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.600
then we will find all the components which I have discussed with you taking time.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.650
It is coming now.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.860
So see years where?

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:36.570
The left side.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.340
We're getting the navigational bar,

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.510
and they're the right side.

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.170
We're getting the dashboard.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.630
So here we will get the cigarettes only Internet gate with option over here.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.110
And if you click over there,

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.610
then we will find option to create the agrees only Internet gateway.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:52.460
So from here,

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.170
you can create the agrees only Internet gate with.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.290
So this is what I wanted to demonstrate your indecision.

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.640
See you in the next session till then,

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.890
Bob,

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:01.470
I take you.
