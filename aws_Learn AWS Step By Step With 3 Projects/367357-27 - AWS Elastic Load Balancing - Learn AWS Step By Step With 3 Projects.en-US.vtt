00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.640
Hello.

00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.770
Guys will come to another station in this session.

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.330
We're going to look into elastic load balancing.

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:06.440
So in this aspect,

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.640
we will learn about what,

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.080
Actually,

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.800
elastic load balancing is what is the benefit off load balancer.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.990
We were looking toe How elastic load balancing work.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.970
And we will also configure elastic load balancer in this lab.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.020
But prayer toe jumping into the lab.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.460
I wanted to give you some overview about the elastic load.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.690
Well,

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.220
and so guys work is elastic load balancing.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.810
So basically elastic load balancing as one of the mechanism by which you can distribute the

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:33.930
incoming traffic,

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:34.180
other,

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.700
different web so over distribution off traffic is not only limited to webs over it can be

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.880
distributed to multiple targets like containers and I p addresses.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.090
But for this lab,

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.090
we are going to stick with the BC two Instances,

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.890
which is working as a Web server.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:50.080
So,

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.440
guys,

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.930
the questions comes over here is what is the benefit we're achieving by using elastic load

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:56.580
balancing.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:02.600
Then I can say that elastic load balance give us the capability to design for high aval

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.260
ability infrastructure along with four tolerance infrastructure for our application.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.650
So What does it mean to in limine language?

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.930
We can understand that?

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.540
Suppose if we're having an application and which is running,

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.490
we hand the load,

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.230
balancer and load balance.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.290
It is associated with multiple Web server and in case,

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.980
if any,

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:23.540
of the Web.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:24.910
So what is going down?

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.020
It will not affect our application.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.400
Our application is a still accessible,

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.610
as we are accessing through elastic load balancer toe.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.050
This behaviour is called fault tolerance and suppose a scenario where a request to our

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.110
application is getting increased.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.100
So in that scenario we can easily add Web,

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.790
Sobel toe handle the request and this is called Scaling Within AWS.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.760
We can achieve all this with auto scaling that we will discuss in for the season off the

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.310
course now coming back toe high availability.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.770
High availability is mainly related with the $4 in case of failure off.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.390
Any reps over still were able to access our application without knowing that there is

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:06.190
something or,

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.560
say some reps over what field.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.910
So no moving photo.

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.530
We will understand that how elastic load balance of work to understand it better,

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:15.440
how it works.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.830
Let's jump into a diagram and then we will discuss their No,

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.050
we're into diagram.

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.560
Let's understand that how it actually works.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.200
So basically a load balance that accept incoming traffic complain and drugs request to its

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.600
registered Web server.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.000
That is,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.950
anyone off these instances,

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.090
which is have a level in three different availability zone.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.790
The load balancer also monitors the health all these reps over and ensures that it route

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:41.890
their traffic toe.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.700
The hell the Web server in key.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.430
If load balancer detects an unhealthy Web server,

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.860
the stops routing traffic with that particular webs over,

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.350
it wouldn't be resumes.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.920
Who wrote the traffic toe?

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.160
That particular Web server when it I didn't to find that the Web's over is healthy again

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.950
while doing the configuration off load balance except the incoming traffic we need to

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:04.870
express if I,

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.400
the listeners so here regard a new tome that is called Listener.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.940
So what Actually listeners is a listener is a process that actually checked for connection

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:14.640
requests.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.040
So basically,

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.900
this listener,

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.750
configured with the protocol and the port numb for connections from clients,

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.010
toe the Lord balancer.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.120
We will see all these inaction when we've configured the load balancer.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.540
So now enough of theory.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.270
Let's movinto aws console and we will configure the load balance.

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.910
So let's jumps into eight of Louis console now.

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.090
So we're into AWS console,

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.930
but pride toe configuring the elastic load balancer.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.420
We will understand that what we are going to do in this lab in this lab First,

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.580
we will create an easy two instance,

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.950
and then we will create an elastic load balance.

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.510
Then we will do the configuration for elastic load balancer,

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.190
where the traffic for accessing the easy to instance will come from.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.420
He'll be this lab.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.390
I'm keeping it simple with only once over,

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.830
because I wanted to demonstrate you how to configure.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.810
He'll be in this lab or or to a scaling and other high availability demonstration.

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.450
I have kept different sessions.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.930
So let's create any city instance with Bootstrap,

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.260
which we have discussed earlier,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.700
and that Buddhist Rabil in store the Apaches sober.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.430
And it will also create an estimable file and that as German filed,

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.270
we will access from Lord Balance or Deanna's after configuration.

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.490
So let's click on easy to.

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.450
So we're into easy to dashboard and here we need to click on launch instance.

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:42.190
So now you're familiar with all these steps and here you can select free tier only.

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.420
And then we will select the first auction.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:50.870
And here we will keep the things simple and we will click on contributing stance details.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.780
And here we will keep the things the fall here.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.750
I want to discuss about one point to remember regarding or to assign public i p.

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.800
When it comes to configuring elastic load balance,

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.120
though,

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.570
at that time we will get two options for setting off the load balancer that is Internet

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.940
raising,

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.690
load balancer or internal load balancer.

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.630
So if we're going with Internet facing load balancer,

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:20.770
then we should make sure that all the Web server should have public eyepiece then only load

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.480
balance are able to communicate with the Web servers.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.060
That is easy to instances from the Internet.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.880
Other type of flowed balances,

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.710
internal load balancer that is mainly a specific for internal load balancing.

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:33.930
Within the BBC.

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:39.390
It is mainly required if you want to configure load balance of four databases than in that

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:40.080
scenario,

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.270
we use internal load balancer that is not accessible from the Internet.

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:50.090
So now moving for though we will come over here and we will provide the user data.

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:51.490
That is our bootstrapping.

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:53.950
Remember that we can quickly type it.

00:05:53.950 --> 00:06:00.180
That has been rash here revealed Install it and stole the STT pds off Pretty check

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:00.770
conference.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.180
So I have typed it.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.200
Once it is being done,

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.220
we need to click on next time the storage Here we will leave the default option.

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.360
We need to come here.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.900
We will click on attack.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.880
We will provide a tag Web sober,

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:13.420
then work.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.970
So we need to mention Web server.

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:19.050
Then we need to click on Con Trigger Security group.

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.610
We need to set up a security group over here.

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:26.980
We will provide our name them or you will be provider description.

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.870
I'm going to copy the same one.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:32.180
And here we need to open the TTP.

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.380
So we need to come eo on selected TTP.

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:36.660
We will keep it open.

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:42.000
So here another point to remember which I wanted to discuss over here that this web So war

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.400
is accessible from the load balancer.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:51.090
So that means the I P should be mentioned over here or you'll be or say load balancer I p o

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:52.070
for Lord Balance.

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.400
Why?

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.520
It is Because Because the traffic is coming from the load balancer,

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:01.640
so that the reason we need to configure the security group or load balancer.

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:02.740
But for the time being,

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:07.050
we will leave it as open for all and click on review and launch.

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:11.540
Now here we need to press launch and we need to generate a key peer.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.630
We already have a key pair Ito have created earlier.

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.570
And here I can acknowledge it and launch in stances.

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:21.040
So now it is creating the easy to instant.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.630
So now let's configure the load balancer.

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:24.860
To do that,

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.250
we need to come over here.

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:28.070
Click on Lord Balancer,

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:31.820
Click on Create load balancer.

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:35.450
So we will be getting these three options.

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:36.330
So basically,

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.680
1st 1 is the application load balancer,

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.730
the network load balancer and classic load balance.

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:46.290
And so we're going to use the application Lord balance and we will click on Create.

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:49.620
So we will give a name for this case.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:50.800
We will give them a will.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.230
Be on then here.

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:53.810
Way have discussed about.

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:55.820
There are two kind of configuration.

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:58.970
Most one is the Internet racing and another one is the internal.

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:01.570
So we are going to use it for Internet facing.

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:06.360
So we will keep this election as is We have also discuss about listeners.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:10.530
So here we need to specify the port number on the protocol.

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:18.290
So here we are specifying as TTP and 80 we can also specify STT ps for the stitch ups you

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:24.560
need to specify for for three or four this demo I'm keeping it for STT people to call along

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:30.330
with the port 80 So moving for though here we have so many or availabilities on six have

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:36.190
little It is on as we are working on not were genial reason So we need to select select all

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:39.250
the sex You can also specify the tax if you want,

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:44.790
but we're keeping it as its next We need to play con conficker security sitting So here it

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:51.410
is telling that we don't have any secure listener as we are using s TTP critical with 80

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:53.450
put That's fine for this demo.

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:59.020
No moving for the click on next configure security group here we're going to use the demo

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:04.130
You'll be security group Then we will click on next country routing So this configuration

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:07.970
is is the configuration related to routing from here?

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:10.930
You will decide that where you want to road the traffic.

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:12.530
So let's now fill in the details.

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:16.210
So here we're goingto provide a name demo.

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:18.160
You'll be target group.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:23.130
Our target is in stunts time as we're voting the traffic toe Web sober.

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:24.730
That is an easy to instance.

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:26.330
So here it would be fine.

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:27.040
Health checked,

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.170
refined check on the options.

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:31.460
So these are the sum of their default values.

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:34.260
In case if it is going beyond this values,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.060
then they consider it webs over is not healthy,

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:41.490
and they will stop transferring the traffic through that particular Web server for,

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:44.400
in our case for this example for this example,

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.350
you just keep it.

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:47.750
Has this the four adoption?

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:49.410
After configuring routing,

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:51.230
we need to click on Register Target.

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:51.760
So here,

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:52.330
basically,

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:55.130
we can specify the sober what which are.

00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:55.770
The servers,

00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:57.510
which is being registered with this year,

00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:02.760
will be so now we need to click on add to register so that it will be registered with the

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:03.340
CLB.

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:05.450
Now click on next reveal.

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:09.050
So these are the things which we have configured click on create.

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:11.460
So this will create the load balancer for us,

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.780
so it has created a load,

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:14.460
balancer.

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:15.730
We need to close it.

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:19.090
And then we will find that this demo Welby has been created.

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:20.380
That is a load balancer.

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:27.280
And the details off this is you will find over here and the listeners We have configured

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:27.740
this list.

Now it has given the monitoring option as well.

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:33.380
That is associated with the matrices cloudwatch.

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:37.110
So these are the mattresses you can have for monitoring purposes.

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:40.200
So we have target groups so we can look into that.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.560
So here we can find the target group over here.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:44.420
Click over here.

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:47.150
So it is being registered with the nudity.

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:49.140
So no test that whether our rental,

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:51.400
