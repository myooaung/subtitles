00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.955
Hey everyone, welcome back.

00:00:02.955 --> 00:00:05.895
So far we've discussed a lot of basics.

00:00:05.895 --> 00:00:11.460
So we cover the introduction to Java and Java,

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.365
which will machine and what is JRE and what is JDK.

00:00:16.365 --> 00:00:20.910
And along with we had another simple Java program,

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.965
which is nothing but our HelloWorld program.

00:00:22.965 --> 00:00:24.990
So not only that,

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.350
we verified how you can use a variable or how we can create the variables.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.420
And if you want to create a variable,

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.150
you need to know what kind of data type you're going to use.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.510
Because variable is just a reference for a value, right?

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.875
So value can be any kind of a data.

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:44.510
Integer, double long, short,

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.595
byte, whatever it be, right?

00:00:46.595 --> 00:00:52.010
And so, and are also the same time we talked about Laurel variable to right?

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.600
And they're dealing with a lot of numbers.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.450
So we need to know the operators also,

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.405
like how you can pull from an addition operation,

00:00:59.405 --> 00:01:03.245
subtraction, multiplication, and water the operators for that.

00:01:03.245 --> 00:01:06.020
So everything we have discussed, right?

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.480
So when you're dealing with all those scenarios,

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.790
there is one thing else is missing.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.190
Right? So what is that?

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.455
Okay, so you have two numbers,

00:01:15.455 --> 00:01:17.100
50 and a 100,

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.770
and you want to write a logic to check which number is bigger.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.410
So that is not covered in the basics, right?

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.110
So what is it called? It is a control statement.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.750
Okay, So I have a control like 10 and I'm for example, 50 and a 100.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:33.935
I have two variables.

00:01:33.935 --> 00:01:40.625
I want to validate which one is bigger or less than a 100 or a 100,

00:01:40.625 --> 00:01:42.380
less than 50, something like that.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:49.715
So you need to perform several conditions to pull formula conditions we need the control.

00:01:49.715 --> 00:01:50.900
Correct?

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.250
So based on this scenario,

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.215
we can use a filter and we have some different kind of base also.

00:01:57.215 --> 00:02:01.670
So basically the entire topic is called as a control statement.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.470
So under control treatment,

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.425
we can check if else.

00:02:06.425 --> 00:02:12.155
So if true, I want to do this or else I want to do this.

00:02:12.155 --> 00:02:19.550
Okay, So if else and switch case and looping and looping until we have a multiple way.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.185
So for looping, like for loops and while loops and do while.

00:02:24.185 --> 00:02:25.880
And there is something called continue.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:32.135
And so we're going to talk about control treatment this entire section.

00:02:32.135 --> 00:02:34.940
Okay, Let's jump into the program and we'll

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.840
see how the effect is going to work. Thank you.
