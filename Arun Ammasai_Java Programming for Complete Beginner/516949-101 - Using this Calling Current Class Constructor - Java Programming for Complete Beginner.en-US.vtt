00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.455
Hello everyone.

00:00:01.455 --> 00:00:04.680
Welcome back. So we discussed about the first right,

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.550
which is nothing but this can be used to

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.540
refer the current class instance variable, correct?

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.845
So now what I'm gonna do,

00:00:13.845 --> 00:00:20.670
I'm going to use this keyword to invoke the constructor.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.755
We'll talk about the pandemic to write.

00:00:22.755 --> 00:00:25.020
So I tried to access the instance variable.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.760
Now I'm going to try to access them constructed, right?

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.500
So let's create a new class.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.305
I'm going to call them as n.

00:00:34.305 --> 00:00:39.225
So this, I need to be this keyword example 2.

00:00:39.225 --> 00:00:41.860
And I'll have a main motor unit.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.445
Finnish.

00:00:43.445 --> 00:00:45.200
Okay, so what is the deal?

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.510
I'm going to have a similar kind of scenario, right?

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.670
So I'm going to keep this data,

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.405
keeping everything in my new class,

00:00:53.405 --> 00:00:55.625
so I don't want to read it again.

00:00:55.625 --> 00:00:57.620
Okay, So for example,

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.065
on example 2 here.

00:01:00.065 --> 00:01:10.560
Correct. So now what I'm gonna do is let's how our default constructor also here.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.605
We know that before contract I will not have any parameters, right?

00:01:15.605 --> 00:01:17.270
So now what I'm gonna do,

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.780
I'm going to create an object for my class.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.860
So basically what I'm trying to do,

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.405
I had to construct a year.

00:01:26.405 --> 00:01:29.300
So the default constructor which will not contain

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.945
anything and down at the conservatory has to be parameterized.

00:01:32.945 --> 00:01:34.700
So I'm going to provide some message,

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.280
this message

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.200
from default constructor.

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:52.880
Sorry. And I'm going to provide something here in this method,

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.105
send message from parameterized constructor.

00:01:59.105 --> 00:02:03.260
We all know that when this particular contractor will be called.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:09.550
So whenever you create a using a keyword and you are calling a class, this method,

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.395
the full comfortable recalled,

00:02:11.395 --> 00:02:13.690
since I'm not passing any parameter here,

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.710
it belongs to the default constructor that we run this and show you what it happening.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.120
So the message from default constructor.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.865
But I haven't used a parameterized constructor.

00:02:27.865 --> 00:02:31.179
So as I mentioned, using this keyword,

00:02:31.179 --> 00:02:36.175
you can call the constructor in the same class.

00:02:36.175 --> 00:02:40.390
Okay, So I have, so our from our default constructor is being called, right?

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.125
So what I can do is I can use this keyword, this.

00:02:44.125 --> 00:02:47.900
So 2013.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.175
Correct.

00:02:51.175 --> 00:02:53.800
So now what happened in the previous example,

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.120
we tried something like this.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.910
Dot x is equal to and something,

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.770
whatever it is coming from the input.

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:05.260
We tried that right? And also make sure you need to use my L1,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.380
this, and this has to be beginning of the line.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.525
Make sure, right?

00:03:10.525 --> 00:03:14.020
So we can use something like that.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.330
This is what we tried in the previous example.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.510
And I can now, instead of the instance variable,

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.640
I'm calling the another concept which is available in my same class.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.670
So now I'm going to run them at that again.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.070
Now, we're going to see that different outcome.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:39.455
C message from parameterized constructor and default constructor.

00:03:39.455 --> 00:03:43.625
But why my parameter constructor is called the forest.

00:03:43.625 --> 00:03:45.680
Why default contract outcomes that can,

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.360
the reason when the constructor is called default constructor

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:56.520
immediately the first thing we did is we've called the parameters, can try this.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.280
What happened? You'll throw an error because

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.110
this keyword has to be beginning of the constructor.

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:07.310
Got it.

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.970
So now we should be able to call the constructor

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.920
from another constructor using this keyword.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:22.250
Correct? So, so we'd try it right?

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.580
So the second has been achieved.

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.470
Okay, this next point.

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:34.250
So what we need to do, so using this keyword to return the current class instance.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.200
So that is the next thing we're going to try.
