00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.890
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:08.865
So before we are moving on to the next concepts in programming system,

00:00:08.865 --> 00:00:12.660
Let's take an example of a class.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.205
So the first thing first,

00:00:14.205 --> 00:00:16.690
how to create a class.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.245
You need to know that, right?

00:00:19.245 --> 00:00:21.670
So syntax, the class name called,

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.665
I mean, the keyword class.

00:00:24.665 --> 00:00:28.100
And you need to provide a class name.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.145
For example, this is going to be test, correct.

00:00:31.145 --> 00:00:37.355
So this is the syntax of creating a class space, class name.

00:00:37.355 --> 00:00:41.090
And we all know that the naming convention class name must start with

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.400
a capital letter and then open and close curly brackets.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.740
This means start off class.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.750
And this means end of a class.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.645
Correct?

00:00:56.645 --> 00:00:59.255
And how to save the class?

00:00:59.255 --> 00:01:00.395
Let's save it.

00:01:00.395 --> 00:01:09.250
So you need to save the class as the class name dot Java, for example here.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.910
Test that Java.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.760
That is a first-order, correct.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.595
Okay, so now we know how to create a class.

00:01:18.595 --> 00:01:21.534
So what my class can contain.

00:01:21.534 --> 00:01:23.950
The first thing you are reading the main matter, right?

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:33.890
Like public, static, void, main, string, args.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.310
Which means I have a class inside the class,

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.725
I can create methods.

00:01:41.725 --> 00:01:43.555
This is my main method.

00:01:43.555 --> 00:01:48.305
So I can provide something system dot out dot,

00:01:48.305 --> 00:01:51.965
print LN, and you can provide a Hello World here.

00:01:51.965 --> 00:01:54.935
This is pretty much simple example for a class.

00:01:54.935 --> 00:01:56.870
We have seen everything layer,

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.730
but I'm just flushing it again.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.380
Okay, so I have a class each contains a method.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.185
What else it ten times time.

00:02:05.185 --> 00:02:07.535
So there are two things.

00:02:07.535 --> 00:02:11.465
A class can contain data members and methods.

00:02:11.465 --> 00:02:13.730
This is an example of data methods.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.385
So let's create an example for a data member.

00:02:16.385 --> 00:02:19.460
Members nothing but when you have a family,

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.560
you have a family member's.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.010
Correct. So those are all variables.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.570
So here, this is my family.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.400
So I have a variable c are like x is equal to 10.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.005
X is equal to ten.

00:02:38.005 --> 00:02:46.730
And also I can have a string colder test class.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.890
Okay, So this is a plasma membrane and this is the class methods

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.995
we can simply call these variables are the data members and the metadata data methods.

00:02:59.995 --> 00:03:02.305
You can have your own methods also.

00:03:02.305 --> 00:03:09.535
Add which will return something like system dot out,

00:03:09.535 --> 00:03:18.530
dot, print LN message from Edmonton.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.170
It's all up to you how you are going to define that.

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.245
Okay?

00:03:26.245 --> 00:03:28.780
So just take a look at the example of the class.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.005
The class has to start with the keyword called class.

00:03:32.005 --> 00:03:37.480
Okay, So and most important thing,

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.760
you need to prove it public class test.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.875
The reason why we are providing public.

00:03:41.875 --> 00:03:44.710
When you have multiple classes in the same file,

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.150
you need to tell the compiler,

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.360
which is my major class.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.610
Again, since I saved this particular class,

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.040
that Java, this is my main class, correct?

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.885
For example, if you have a class here and you're going to call lemme, just one.

00:03:59.885 --> 00:04:02.450
So now I have a desk and desk one.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.465
You cannot provide this class as the public.

00:04:05.465 --> 00:04:09.050
The reason, because now compatible, good confused,

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.985
which is my major class,

00:04:10.985 --> 00:04:14.015
since I saved my glasses at is that Java.

00:04:14.015 --> 00:04:17.270
So our compiler will identify,

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:18.665
this is my major,

00:04:18.665 --> 00:04:20.690
is that Java file.

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.155
But when you grow it on their glasses spaced,

00:04:24.155 --> 00:04:28.010
I mean, sorry, public competitor will get confused.

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.795
So it will throw an error that people glasses which contains the public.

00:04:32.795 --> 00:04:36.185
So you need to remove the public in the classes here,

00:04:36.185 --> 00:04:40.070
we'll talk about them when you're discussing the entire dance.

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:45.440
Okay, So now, now we have an idea about what a class contain.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.360
Glands contain data members,

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.770
which is I think but variables.

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.450
And it can contain data methods.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.310
Methods are you going to call the method functions?

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.330
All right, so let's meet each other in the next video and we want to talk with us.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:00.215
I might add concepts.

00:05:00.215 --> 00:05:01.590
Thank you.
