00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.845
Hello everyone.

00:00:01.845 --> 00:00:02.970
Welcome back.

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:09.570
So the software installation setup has been completed successfully and we will

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:16.230
require the java is available any other machine, right?

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.250
So download Java installed and we know where it is,

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.770
the JDK and GRE we'll talk about here in a separate session or separate videos.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.520
And we did a non-metal setup.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.920
So you got it right.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.465
What is Enlightenment setup?

00:00:33.465 --> 00:00:39.135
So make sure your Java is available for all the drives,

00:00:39.135 --> 00:00:42.490
are all the location in your entire mission.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.270
So that's why we call this environment setup.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.460
So now we all set, okay,

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.490
so just bad for some time.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:58.720
The reason is we are going through a lot of slides before we jumping actual coding.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.080
Okay, because I wanted to tell you some of

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.470
the history and what are the things we are going to learn,

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.570
and what are the topics we're going to cover.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:15.070
Okay, So a combination of more slides in the beginning of the course,

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.030
and once we jumped into the coding part,

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.730
will go through lot of coding.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.695
Right? So the next one,

00:01:26.695 --> 00:01:29.530
so what are the topics I'm going to cover here?

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.900
Is there any specific topic?

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:38.860
We're going to cover each and everything from the Java core, right?

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.855
So what does that?

00:01:40.855 --> 00:01:44.860
The first one, Java basics.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.220
So if you're not familiar with the Java basis,

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.830
I cannot move to the next topic or next section.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.755
And if you're learning Java,

00:01:56.755 --> 00:01:59.140
the one thing which you must know is

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.870
an object oriented programming language or object oriented programming concept.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.520
We call the method java.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.180
Oops.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.800
And exception handling.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:21.310
And collections and annotations,

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.125
along with some miscellaneous concepts.

00:02:26.125 --> 00:02:28.780
Okay, let's have what we'll cover in the Java basics.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.585
Okay, So when you talk about Java basics,

00:02:31.585 --> 00:02:35.290
we will cover some very cool information.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.825
Okay, So how to read your first Java program or how to declare a variable.

00:02:40.825 --> 00:02:43.540
We'll talk about what is variable at all.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.515
Right?

00:02:44.515 --> 00:02:46.510
So basically if you want to,

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.290
basically if you want to write a simple Hello World program, what do you need?

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.220
Right, And why do you need that?

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.790
So how to declare a variable and how can I use a variable?

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:01.720
Right?

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.125
And what are the different kinds of operators available?

00:03:05.125 --> 00:03:08.875
Everything you want to talk about under Java basics.

00:03:08.875 --> 00:03:09.760
In there.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.590
Whoops, we have a few concepts and rules like you must have

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.705
heard about a class, objects, encapsulation, inheritance.

00:03:19.705 --> 00:03:23.350
There are few others also will talk about everything in oops,

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.275
concept section and exception handling.

00:03:26.275 --> 00:03:27.880
That is, when you read some coding,

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.105
there is always a possibility you might have some error.

00:03:31.105 --> 00:03:33.360
So in case, Is there any error,

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.860
how I'm going to handle this particular situation?

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:43.145
Right? And collections, basically collection is data,

00:03:43.145 --> 00:03:46.745
data, elements of a data, right?

00:03:46.745 --> 00:03:48.905
If you are a single person.

00:03:48.905 --> 00:03:51.485
But what happened there at 1000%?

00:03:51.485 --> 00:03:55.940
We can put all we put everybody under a single collection,

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.190
the list of persons,

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.845
great list of products.

00:04:00.845 --> 00:04:03.740
Everything is come center collection.

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:12.570
And we're going to talk over some annotations and a few other miscellaneous concept.

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:21.655
So these are the topics we are going to cover in the basic spot.

00:04:21.655 --> 00:04:23.125
That's what I mentioned earlier.

00:04:23.125 --> 00:04:24.175
Direction.

00:04:24.175 --> 00:04:29.905
And we'll talk about what is JVM and fuzzy Oberon variable, datatypes, operators,

00:04:29.905 --> 00:04:33.460
and some control statements like if else,

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.060
which case for awhile, do everything.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.500
Correct.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.680
So these are the basic concept we are going to cover.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.335
Okay, So before we jump into the code,

00:04:44.335 --> 00:04:51.580
we'll talk about how the java has been introduced to the industry and who invented that.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.280
And then we'll talk about what is JVM,

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.250
what is GDP and what is JVM, right?

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.450
We'll talk about it every day.
