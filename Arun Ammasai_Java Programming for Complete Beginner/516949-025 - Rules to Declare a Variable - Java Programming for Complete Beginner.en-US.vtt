00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.815
So we explored how to declare a variable and

00:00:07.815 --> 00:00:14.115
the different types of data type and different types of variable 2.

00:00:14.115 --> 00:00:16.210
And we discussed their vote.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.910
We have discussed the difference between

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.365
instance variable and the static variable and how it is impacting the data.

00:00:24.365 --> 00:00:28.475
And different types that we already discussed.

00:00:28.475 --> 00:00:33.500
And one thing that is left is naming variables, right?

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.855
So as I mentioned,

00:00:35.855 --> 00:00:40.715
the variable name has to start with a proper way.

00:00:40.715 --> 00:00:42.815
But unlike a class name,

00:00:42.815 --> 00:00:47.100
the variable name start with a small letter, for example.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:53.390
So ain't my daughter.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.300
Can you see how this looks like?

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.345
Sorry. Minute or two.

00:00:59.345 --> 00:01:01.610
So you start with a small letter.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.010
And in case if you have a continuous war in

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.845
the particular variable name to capitalize them.

00:01:06.845 --> 00:01:09.845
So you can provide, sorry.

00:01:09.845 --> 00:01:13.460
So you can print them and see,

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.690
Let's go back to the command prompt will see variable example, right?

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:26.010
So CSPs variable example that Java and compel them.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:33.755
For example, the space, the class name.

00:01:33.755 --> 00:01:35.900
So we're going to execute the month.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.405
So my total is 125.

00:01:38.405 --> 00:01:39.050
Cool.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.930
Okay, So let's try how we should not create a variable.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.450
For example, one.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.615
Okay, let's go back and compare them.

00:01:49.615 --> 00:01:55.885
Of course, ends with error because the variable name cannot start with a number.

00:01:55.885 --> 00:01:58.765
For example, I'll give you a scenario.

00:01:58.765 --> 00:02:02.560
Normally people nowadays using multiple SIM cards, right?

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.865
So if you have a number in case if your mom Is it into SIM cards,

00:02:06.865 --> 00:02:11.605
you always use mom number one, mom number 2.

00:02:11.605 --> 00:02:14.095
So mom's mobile number one, mobile number two.

00:02:14.095 --> 00:02:15.700
But we won't save Lake one,

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.250
number two, number one, mm, two mm.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.440
Practically that won't come.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.520
Right?

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.490
So whenever you're naming something,

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.450
it has to start with inappropriate character.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.895
So if it is a variable,

00:02:28.895 --> 00:02:30.440
it cannot try to remember.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.140
And let me use some special characters here.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.770
M compelling them again.

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:37.925
Again, it's an issue.

00:02:37.925 --> 00:02:38.900
It's an add-on.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.395
It's not a valid integer variable type declaration.

00:02:42.395 --> 00:02:43.190
Okay?

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.440
So this special characters are not allowed,

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.850
numbers are not allowed,

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.750
but you can use capital letter. So what will happen?

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.940
So miter, okay, and interchange reference, I'll say, yeah.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.730
Let's compare them again.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.820
So we don't have any errors.

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:11.450
Because Starting Yeah, variable or the class name as the class capital letter.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.370
And if it is a variable, if you're a smaller type,

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.780
that is a standard,

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.355
that is not a mandatory.

00:03:16.355 --> 00:03:18.590
But if you're a programmer,

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:19.910
you are to follow some standard.

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.200
So if it is a class,

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.510
it has to start with a capital letter.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:24.980
And if it is a integer,

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.375
it has two stripes with a small letter.

00:03:29.375 --> 00:03:31.490
So that is the standard for Java.

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.465
Now let's compile them again and run it.

00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:37.925
You won't see any issues there.

00:03:37.925 --> 00:03:39.755
So we tried everything.

00:03:39.755 --> 00:03:42.500
We tried numbers which will end up in an issue.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.795
And we tried capital letter,

00:03:44.795 --> 00:03:49.235
and we tried to sum special characters.

00:03:49.235 --> 00:03:50.510
But as I mentioned,

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.820
there are two special characters that are allowed to use.

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.310
You just nothing but underscore.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.150
Okay, so let's copy and paste it here.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.435
And let's go back to the command prompt and tried to compel them again,

00:04:02.435 --> 00:04:10.010
which will still work because I'm allowed to use, okay, what happened here?

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.185
Let me underscore, underscore and save it.

00:04:15.185 --> 00:04:17.880
So compare them again.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.580
And then underscore, which will work because

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.105
there are exception symbols and there is one more.

00:04:26.105 --> 00:04:31.835
You can use the dollar symbol also. Compare them again.

00:04:31.835 --> 00:04:37.430
Sorry, I'm going to compile again and run it.

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.740
See now it is working.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.075
So you might avoid these only these two special getters because

00:04:44.075 --> 00:04:49.565
rest of the special character or used for some other purpose in Java.

00:04:49.565 --> 00:04:55.370
So we can use them as a defining a variable.

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.280
But dollar and understood it's not used anywhere.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.830
So we can use them to generate able.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.730
Thank you.
