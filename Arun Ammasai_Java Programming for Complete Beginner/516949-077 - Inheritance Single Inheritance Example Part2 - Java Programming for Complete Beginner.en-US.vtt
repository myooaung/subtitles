00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.140
Hello everyone.

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.220
In this example, we're going to talk about the single ingredients again,

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.770
because I want to show you a proper example.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.090
This is just a sample example.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.785
I want to create some proper example.

00:00:10.785 --> 00:00:14.100
If you are comfortable enough in her dense,

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.755
you can skip on to the next video.

00:00:16.755 --> 00:00:18.660
So I'm going to get an a plus here.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:29.020
So single, sorry, single inheritance example.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.860
Okay, so what are the classes you're going to create here? Now?

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.270
Let's create a class completion.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:51.390
So the class teacher contains a string.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.240
We're going to have a designation. Designation.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:06.680
Teacher or teachers find kitchen.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.010
And it has another property of string.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:17.580
Our institute institute name

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.790
in global Lemmy.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.100
So our two properties,

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.620
designation and lanes cute name.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.110
And I have

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:42.510
a method display.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.900
So which will just simply print the data.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.250
So designation,

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.810
designation here,

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.020
Institute name.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.065
Right?

00:02:17.065 --> 00:02:21.430
So I'm going to extend this teacher in this single inheritance example,

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.830
which means I can access this data's great.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.510
So we know that syntax extents.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.790
So first thing we need to have a main method.

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:48.460
So let's create an object for our class OBJ.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.740
You can create your own reference them also, it's not a big deal.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.465
Okay, so now I should be able to access all of them, right?

00:02:56.465 --> 00:03:05.225
So I can access directly like OBJ got designation.

00:03:05.225 --> 00:03:11.540
And I can access this flow

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.135
of designation or else

00:03:17.135 --> 00:03:23.030
I can access institute name so I can end the call right now.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.370
So I got a teacher and the Institute for Global Learning audience,

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.140
I can call the displacement that we will print Both details.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.560
So what I can do is I'm going to comment these two lines.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.090
So instead of calling these two variables,

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.175
I'm going to call them methods now,

00:03:43.175 --> 00:03:45.755
which means it's playing.

00:03:45.755 --> 00:03:48.230
So now I'm going to run it again.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.595
We should be able to see the outcome.

00:03:49.595 --> 00:03:52.760
So this is a simple example for single inheritance.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.310
So designation teacher and the Institute for Global Learning, right?

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.405
The next example we are going to DACA would the multilevel inheritance.

00:04:02.405 --> 00:04:04.080
Thank you.
