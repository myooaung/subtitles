00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280
Hello everyone, welcome back.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.335
So what are they going to talk right now?

00:00:04.335 --> 00:00:06.555
So keywords in Java.

00:00:06.555 --> 00:00:10.095
So basically you need to understand what is the keyword in Java.

00:00:10.095 --> 00:00:16.995
In Java, 8 cells that are 51 reserved words,

00:00:16.995 --> 00:00:20.190
that has a predefined meaning in Java.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.620
Okay, So you cannot use those reserved keywords for other purposes,

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.520
like let me show you what are the keywords.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.885
So these are the reserved keywords available in Java.

00:00:33.885 --> 00:00:38.880
Just take a look at an abstract God because we already used CAD double and int.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.160
And we tried class,

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.880
we tried already, and Boolean we tried.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.725
We're going to talk about everything.

00:00:45.725 --> 00:00:49.415
So, so far we covered a few of the keywords, right?

00:00:49.415 --> 00:00:53.135
So let me tell you how we can identify the keyword.

00:00:53.135 --> 00:00:56.390
So this is a class which we example,

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.790
which we discussed in the previous video, right?

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.725
So class is a keyword.

00:01:00.725 --> 00:01:03.410
Public is a keyword, static is a keyword,

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.365
void is a keyword. Int is a keyword.

00:01:06.365 --> 00:01:07.400
Correct.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.640
So you cannot use the int for any other purpose.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:19.115
And you cannot use doubled our Boolean because those are all predefined words.

00:01:19.115 --> 00:01:22.355
And each and everything has its own explanation.

00:01:22.355 --> 00:01:26.015
And they have predefined meaning for that, right?

00:01:26.015 --> 00:01:27.830
So far we just seen Wanli,

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.100
I don't tend to 15 keywords, right?

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.855
So if you want to know how,

00:01:32.855 --> 00:01:35.770
how do I know that secure, just take a look at it.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.550
Class that the keywords are highlighted in a different color.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.170
So that is how uniter,

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.465
No, it's not only in Notepad.

00:01:44.465 --> 00:01:46.220
You needed any are working in

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.495
some Integrated Development Environment or IDE Eclipse, something like that.

00:01:50.495 --> 00:01:54.110
Even there, they will show you in a different color font.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.330
Okay, so that will indicate that, okay,

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.520
those are keywords you cannot play with that.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.780
You can just use them.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.460
You cannot modify, you can add,

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.430
are you going to delete that keywords?

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.090
All right, so with this we came,

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.109
we covered pretty much the basics.

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:14.180
So next what we're going to talk about,

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.414
what we're going to talk about the control statements,

00:02:16.414 --> 00:02:19.490
which is nothing but how they felt condition is working.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:25.445
So how can I make sure it is working in a proper way and if I have some data to feed,

00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:30.140
so how to validate them with the help of if and how to use steady.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.435
And also we can check off for loop.

00:02:32.435 --> 00:02:33.830
Why do we need a for loop?

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.425
And where do we need a while loop?

00:02:36.425 --> 00:02:37.730
Right?

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.565
And do-while that a lot of things in place.

00:02:40.565 --> 00:02:45.120
So we're going to talk about the H and everything in the next video. Thank you.
