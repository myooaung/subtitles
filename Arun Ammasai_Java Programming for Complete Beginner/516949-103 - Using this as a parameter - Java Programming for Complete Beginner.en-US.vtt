00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280
Hello everyone, welcome back.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.305
So as you know,

00:00:04.305 --> 00:00:07.665
we tried three different possibilities of this, and that is three more.

00:00:07.665 --> 00:00:09.600
So we're moving on to this step four.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.070
So I'm going to create a new class here and which is called SR,

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.600
this keyword example and 4 finish and this keyword,

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.260
what we're going to do, we are going to use it this keyword as a parameter.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.765
I'm passing some value, we'll pass.

00:00:24.765 --> 00:00:26.790
It didn't come out on the right, something like that.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.805
We can pass this as an input parameter.

00:00:29.805 --> 00:00:32.040
Okay, let's go ahead and try that.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.610
I need pretty much everything which we written in the previous example.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.340
We'll make a small modification.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.050
I don't want to write the code again and again.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.030
So this should be four.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.210
Okay?

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.240
So here we have written this and is supposed to be four.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.395
Okay?

00:00:57.395 --> 00:01:01.550
So here what I'm gonna do is I have a show method which will

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.350
accept my this class as an input. So OBJ.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.030
So basically what I'm trying to do,

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:16.265
I'm trying to retrieve the value from 0 to t dot x and OBJ dot y.

00:01:16.265 --> 00:01:23.720
So this one, which we'll do the same instance of a class, right?

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.515
So now I'm going to pass this asset parameter now.

00:01:27.515 --> 00:01:29.615
So we need to call this method, right?

00:01:29.615 --> 00:01:32.210
So instead of returning this thing,

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.610
so what I'm gonna do, display.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.065
So when it is not calling on the second.

00:01:42.065 --> 00:01:46.880
So we are going to call the show method show and discovered.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.020
So I'm going to pass this,

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.295
what this will do here.

00:01:49.295 --> 00:01:52.430
Return this, return the same instance type bright,

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.645
so I'm using this year.

00:01:53.645 --> 00:01:55.730
So when I'm using this,

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.890
which will send back the instance of the same club is nothing but this class.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.960
What is that? This keyword example for?

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.100
So that is a instance will be passed to the show matter.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.935
So what is a type we're expecting the same class.

00:02:09.935 --> 00:02:16.130
So you can pass this keyword as a parameter. Got it.

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.170
So now we have a show mater and this,

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.810
and this, there is no need to be this type of case.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.160
So I can simply use of fire for now because we're not going to get anything.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.945
So I'm passing as a parameter, right?

00:02:29.945 --> 00:02:32.585
So instead the getMethod,

00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:36.170
I call the show method and passed at this as a parameter.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.115
Okay, so now we can rest is history, right?

00:02:40.115 --> 00:02:42.590
So we know that how to get out there right?

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.570
Now, for example, OBJ new object, sorry.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.540
So new object here.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.230
And then OBJ dot here.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.465
We're going to call the get method because getMethod will pass the object reference here.

00:02:59.465 --> 00:03:01.085
So this will take and get up this.

00:03:01.085 --> 00:03:06.890
So now let me run the same code now you should be able to see their proper outcome.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.500
By the way, how we called using this as a parametrized.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.020
Okay, So we achieved the basic for usage of this keyword.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.330
Okay, so in the next example,

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.930
we're going to use this because this has a lot of advantage if that is the first thing

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.725
which I mentioned while we chapter discussing about that this keyword,

00:03:27.725 --> 00:03:31.835
because there are a lot of advantages on the usage of this keyword.

00:03:31.835 --> 00:03:34.565
So the next example, we are going to still use the,

00:03:34.565 --> 00:03:38.585
this keyword to invoke current class methods.

00:03:38.585 --> 00:03:42.950
So we tried to call the instance variables,

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.425
and we tried to return the same instance.

00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:47.915
We tried to call the same constructor.

00:03:47.915 --> 00:03:51.110
We're ready to call the constructor in the same class.

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:52.145
We tried all of them.

00:03:52.145 --> 00:03:53.510
So now we're going to call them

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.970
methods matter in my class I'm going to call them at are using this keyword.

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.950
So we'll talk about in the next video.
