00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880
Hello everyone, welcome back.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:08.295
So far we covered under the basics concept, basic section.

00:00:08.295 --> 00:00:13.380
We covered introduction to Java and what is Java would call mission and chlorine,

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.645
JDK, JVM J everything.

00:00:15.645 --> 00:00:18.045
And we discussed a boatload,

00:00:18.045 --> 00:00:22.770
what JR is doing and how JDK is working,

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.150
and what we can do with the JDK and what you can do with the JRE,

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.770
and how the JVM is working and what is the architecture for JVM, right?

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.690
We discussed everything and along with that,

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.015
we created our first Java program.

00:00:36.015 --> 00:00:37.935
And we executed that.

00:00:37.935 --> 00:00:43.145
And we know how to create a Java program now and how to compile them,

00:00:43.145 --> 00:00:45.680
and how to run the particular code.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.945
And also we know how to navigate to the location and compile the code.

00:00:50.945 --> 00:00:51.860
Correct.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.520
And we know how to create a class and what is the syntax for that.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.600
And if you're naming it last fall and what are the rules in place?

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.095
So we have discussed all of them so far.

00:01:03.095 --> 00:01:05.735
Okay, So in order to create a class name,

00:01:05.735 --> 00:01:10.620
in order to create a class, you need to use class base class name.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.410
Correct?

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.795
So the similar way, the next thing.

00:01:14.795 --> 00:01:20.854
So we covered pretty much almost all the basics to start your development.

00:01:20.854 --> 00:01:24.680
So now we can do the actual coding coding part.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.625
So let's start up with variables.

00:01:28.625 --> 00:01:32.600
So let's create a simple class and we'll talk about variables

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.920
before we are jumping into the variable program,

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.745
Let's talk about what is a variable and how to define a variable,

00:01:40.745 --> 00:01:41.900
and what do they use,

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.030
and what kind of types of variables available.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.030
We'll discuss everything, then we'll move on to an example that will make

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.180
sense because they're going to directly jump into a program, okay?

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.680
This is how we integrate a variable.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.565
And this is a syntax that is not going to work for a long time, right?

00:01:55.565 --> 00:02:00.365
You need to understand what is a variable and why we need to create them.

00:02:00.365 --> 00:02:06.695
And what are the ways we need to create them and what kind of data we had to work with.

00:02:06.695 --> 00:02:10.670
So we should know the basic understanding of what is available

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.680
and some other concepts also along the variables.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.580
But it discuss about the variable in the next video.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.570
Thank you.
