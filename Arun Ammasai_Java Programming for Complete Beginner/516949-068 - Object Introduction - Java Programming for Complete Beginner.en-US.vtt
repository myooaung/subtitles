00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.365
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:02.365 --> 00:00:04.180
So we have discussed,

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.895
so what are the concepts available under?

00:00:06.895 --> 00:00:11.500
Whoops, right, let's go from object.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.765
So what is an object?

00:00:13.765 --> 00:00:17.455
Because from the beginning we are keep talking about objects.

00:00:17.455 --> 00:00:18.895
Objects, objects.

00:00:18.895 --> 00:00:20.500
What exactly is an object?

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.700
How you can prescribe an object and what it contains.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.830
Good, that's what we want to talk a bit about.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.220
So basically object isn't real-world entity.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.705
So what does it mean?

00:00:31.705 --> 00:00:34.975
I can give you an example so you can easily understand. So bank soon.

00:00:34.975 --> 00:00:39.655
For now, let's keep that object is real-world entity. I'm a human being.

00:00:39.655 --> 00:00:41.605
It's a real-world entity.

00:00:41.605 --> 00:00:42.930
I'm an object.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:43.550
Okay.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.615
That is my home.

00:00:44.615 --> 00:00:46.055
That is the real-world entity.

00:00:46.055 --> 00:00:48.665
Home is a, another object, right?

00:00:48.665 --> 00:00:54.275
So that is what we call them as objects, right?

00:00:54.275 --> 00:00:56.420
So what object contains?

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.530
Object combines basically the data and the behavior.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.020
As I mentioned earlier, I'm a human being.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.800
Okay?

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.570
That means I have a stage.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.355
And also I have some behaviors,

00:01:10.355 --> 00:01:12.125
which means I can walk,

00:01:12.125 --> 00:01:14.120
I can talk, I can drown.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.660
So basically object is a combination of data and

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.200
its behaviors are you can simply state and its behavior.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.010
So that's a good point.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.035
It has to get the sticks,

00:01:27.035 --> 00:01:29.510
which is nothing but the street and the behavior.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.805
For example, I'm a human,

00:01:31.805 --> 00:01:33.785
that is my state.

00:01:33.785 --> 00:01:37.175
And I had some barrier which is nothing but I can run,

00:01:37.175 --> 00:01:40.205
I can walk, I can talk, I can sink.

00:01:40.205 --> 00:01:44.315
So those are all the behaviors.

00:01:44.315 --> 00:01:46.730
And in other word,

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:52.460
you can simply say object defined as an instance of a class.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:59.210
So if you see any object that represent one of the class or any class, so object,

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.380
basically the instance of

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:07.230
a glass object can communicate to any of his own methods and members.

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.460
So as I mentioned,

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.275
I'm an object, I'm a human being.

00:02:11.275 --> 00:02:13.510
So that's an object I can walk.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.344
That means the object and communicate.

00:02:16.344 --> 00:02:19.645
So I'm gonna say my brain, okay, Walk now.

00:02:19.645 --> 00:02:24.235
Chuck newell, run, which means the object,

00:02:24.235 --> 00:02:27.220
I am control everything what I'm doing.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.734
So that is what we say that the object can communicate.

00:02:31.734 --> 00:02:34.480
So basically in a non-technical way.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:41.770
So the object can access the methods and the variable inside it on glasses.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:47.725
Right? Let's see a real-world example for an object.

00:02:47.725 --> 00:02:50.950
Take a look at this particular example.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.770
The top layer is home.

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.989
Home is an object.

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:56.890
Okay?

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.090
Home contains some states because we know that

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.830
right object is contains a state and the behavior home is this object.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.930
So of course it has some state and behavior.

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.505
So what are the state?

00:03:09.505 --> 00:03:12.175
Address and home color?

00:03:12.175 --> 00:03:14.005
And they have a wall.

00:03:14.005 --> 00:03:17.980
So those are all state of the home.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.315
Those are all state of the home object.

00:03:22.315 --> 00:03:23.965
Okay, So what is the behavior?

00:03:23.965 --> 00:03:26.695
Okay? When you have a home, it has address.

00:03:26.695 --> 00:03:30.355
The similar way it has some behavior to just nothing that you can open the door.

00:03:30.355 --> 00:03:34.165
You can watch the TV inside your home and you can close the door.

00:03:34.165 --> 00:03:39.775
So basically, it's everything combined together as an object which called as a home.

00:03:39.775 --> 00:03:43.615
Without object, everything else is meaningless.

00:03:43.615 --> 00:03:46.540
Do you really think without a home that this is valid?

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.060
Know, the color is valid, that is no home.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.950
How can you specific color to your home?

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.340
It is not possible. If there is no hole, there is no wallet.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.710
All right?

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:01.825
So when you have a state and you can have its own behaviors,

00:04:01.825 --> 00:04:06.400
you can open it or it's just enough high-level example, right?

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.250
You can simply combined with different examples also.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.355
Or you can have some additional examples.

00:04:15.355 --> 00:04:21.170
Instead of home, just imagine that it's an object which is called as a car.

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.260
Yes, God isn't real world entity, right? It's a car.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.910
God has a different status,

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.470
which means it has some color in it,

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.020
it has some brand and it has a weight and model.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.015
Those are all states, correct.

00:04:32.015 --> 00:04:35.690
Similarly, they have some behaviors like you can accelerate,

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.315
you can slow down, you can do the grid change.

00:04:38.315 --> 00:04:39.935
You can do ablate break.

00:04:39.935 --> 00:04:41.495
So those are behaviors.

00:04:41.495 --> 00:04:45.215
So that is what when I mentioned object in the real world entity,

00:04:45.215 --> 00:04:46.670
when it is a real-world entity,

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.580
it has some state and it asked him wouldn't be here. Yes.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:50.810
All right.

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:56.790
So let's meet each other the next video and we're going to talk about classes.
