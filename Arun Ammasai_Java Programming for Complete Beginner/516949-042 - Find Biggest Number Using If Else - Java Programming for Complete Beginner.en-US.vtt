00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.835
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:02.835 --> 00:00:07.350
So before we are moving into a switch case example,

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.600
so we have tried if else, right?

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.270
So we needed try some valid scenario before we are moving to some other contact.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.805
Let's try one or two examples.

00:00:17.805 --> 00:00:20.130
And then we can move on to the next one.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.810
Okay, the first example.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.630
So I'll have three numbers.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.150
So I want to take which is the biggest number.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.330
So how can we achieve that using if-else condition?

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.405
Can I do that? You can do that.

00:00:35.405 --> 00:00:40.085
So if you want to try, you can go to try or else let me try.

00:00:40.085 --> 00:00:49.085
So find, sorry, find.

00:00:49.085 --> 00:00:51.750
Because number.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.160
So let's have a main method in the first place.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.750
Some main Howard layman numbers, right?

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:14.400
So int a is equal to a 100.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.895
Come on.

00:01:16.895 --> 00:01:21.140
Be equal to a 100.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:28.020
Comma c is equal to seven.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.260
Okay, so you might think How come I am declared this kind of variables, okay?

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.600
So you can declare in the a is equal to 100 and you can do int b is equal to 100,

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.540
indices equal to 1070.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.360
Since all of them belong to the same type,

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.180
we can use comma and you can create a variable name.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.860
So it's basically it's like

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:59.330
so it

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.210
is NTIA comma b comma indices.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.475
So this is our ETL processing.

00:02:10.475 --> 00:02:14.705
Okay, so let's try to apply our if condition.

00:02:14.705 --> 00:02:19.925
Okay, the first thing I need to do is I need to check whether a is bigger.

00:02:19.925 --> 00:02:21.020
So the condition here,

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:27.635
I'm going to use a greater than or equal to b.

00:02:27.635 --> 00:02:34.340
We can use condition and a greater than r is equal

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.640
to

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.390
a greater than

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.370
or equal to c,

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.170
which means a is bigger, right?

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.955
So I'm going to have as a sloppy here.

00:02:55.955 --> 00:03:00.570
So a is bigger.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.050
So if you want to print what is the a?

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.000
You can still do that.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
The unit to provide the a here, right?

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.635
So you can concatenate using a plus symbol and you can probably,

00:03:18.635 --> 00:03:23.255
so which will print a is bigger and it will print the value of a.

00:03:23.255 --> 00:03:25.400
So if we want to concatenate string with

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.865
any other data in the US as a concatenation operator.

00:03:28.865 --> 00:03:32.105
It is also an operator of Eric and do the addition operation.

00:03:32.105 --> 00:03:38.030
And the same time it's illegal use to concatenate two different kinds of data also.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.469
Okay, so now I'm going to try the else-if,

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.360
else-if what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna check the B,

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.015
be greater than r equals a

00:03:53.015 --> 00:04:02.490
and be greater than or equal c, right?

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.270
So which means at copy this and paste it here.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.735
So b is bigger than B here,

00:04:11.735 --> 00:04:16.355
and B is bigger.

00:04:16.355 --> 00:04:19.715
So if, if both conditions are not satisfied,

00:04:19.715 --> 00:04:23.945
which means c is bigger by default, right?

00:04:23.945 --> 00:04:32.240
So C is bigger and the value is same.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.450
So just take an example on more time.

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.270
First I'm taking whether Yj is greater than b and c,

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.520
and then I'm taking B is give to them a and B,

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:46.175
a and C. So if both parents are not satisfied at ago, c is bigger.

00:04:46.175 --> 00:04:48.755
So now we know a 100,200 thousand debate.

00:04:48.755 --> 00:04:50.495
So B is bigger, right?

00:04:50.495 --> 00:04:54.530
So let's run and see what the outcome.

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.635
So as we expect, dot B is bigger,

00:04:57.635 --> 00:05:00.455
okay, Let me more if a is equal tos and moral happen.

00:05:00.455 --> 00:05:03.290
Of course the A's bigger, correct?

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:08.495
Let me modify this to 1000. So let's run it again.

00:05:08.495 --> 00:05:10.610
So C is bigger.

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.070
So using is an else-if condition,

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.560
you can find the biggest number.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.370
Thank you.
