00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.820
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.300
Let's jump into Java control statements.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:12.165
Okay, So in control statement instead is we have a different kinds of control statements.

00:00:12.165 --> 00:00:15.660
Let's see what are the different types.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:24.200
The first one is, so you're going to check a condition.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.000
If in case the condition is true,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.560
you're executing a block.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.125
In case it is not true,

00:00:30.125 --> 00:00:32.480
that meant it is going to block.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.190
So if it is wrong,

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.665
I'm going to exclude some, another block.

00:00:36.665 --> 00:00:41.750
Okay, So that is where we can use if and else and switch case.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.495
So we'll talk about Asian everything in a separate example.

00:00:44.495 --> 00:00:49.145
And the next one is following me switch case we have a for loop, for loop.

00:00:49.145 --> 00:00:51.650
And in the loop instead of a given three different kinds,

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.570
one is 4 second,

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.100
third, honestly do well.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.125
We'll talk about ancient everything.

00:00:57.125 --> 00:01:03.190
And there are two other statements where we can Continue and OK,

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.980
So now Let's go with the first one, if-else.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.590
So in if condition itself,

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.415
there are multiple types of testing if statement,

00:01:15.415 --> 00:01:17.990
if the condition true, do this.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.400
If it is not true, don't do anything.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.720
If it is true, then do it.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.100
That's all.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.220
And then Mr. different.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.780
So I have a condition.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:29.260
Okay.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.105
So the condition is true.

00:01:31.105 --> 00:01:34.970
I'm going inside and I have one more if condition.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.625
So that is called as a nested IF condition.

00:01:39.625 --> 00:01:41.650
So instead if condition that it's animated,

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.570
GIF condition said another if condition that is honor them.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.245
I mean, if conditions called us and nested if

00:01:48.245 --> 00:01:53.150
then else statement which is nothing but if it is true,

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.865
do this, else, do this.

00:01:55.865 --> 00:01:59.870
And the final on if and else-if.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.330
So we have multiple book because

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.620
normally all the above three we can check only one condition in a single line.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:07.850
So either one condition,

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.040
but when you're going for if else,

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.575
if what you can do is you can write fuel steps of if conditions,

00:02:15.575 --> 00:02:20.765
if some condition or else go to the another condition RL is go to our condition.

00:02:20.765 --> 00:02:23.639
So we can call them at the else-if.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.885
Okay, so the first one,

00:02:26.885 --> 00:02:28.820
let's see a nice simple syntax.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.965
So this is the syntax for if condition.

00:02:30.965 --> 00:02:33.935
This if is a keyword and the bracket,

00:02:33.935 --> 00:02:35.360
you are going to provide some condition.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.020
If it is true, write your own code and nested.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.300
If you have a condition, if condition,

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.135
you'll have one more if condition.

00:02:44.135 --> 00:02:50.780
And else if and else if condition if it is not true for the else.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.665
If else, if conditions and else's,

00:02:54.665 --> 00:02:57.815
you cannot check another condition if not,

00:02:57.815 --> 00:02:59.720
that allele one more relative because we don't

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.255
have any limitation how many else-if we can use it.

00:03:02.255 --> 00:03:06.875
And so if you wanted to see if else Harvard is going to work,

00:03:06.875 --> 00:03:08.510
you can check the flowchart.

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:09.740
Just take a look at.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.235
First is the beginning, the stat, right?

00:03:13.235 --> 00:03:16.040
So once the program is execution start out,

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.430
it'll comes to the condition, for example,

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.465
10 greater than or equal to five.

00:03:23.465 --> 00:03:25.550
So 10 of course is greater than five.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.050
So that's the condition true.

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.655
So it will go to true block and this block of code.

00:03:31.655 --> 00:03:33.890
In case no, my condition is wrong.

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.385
My 10 is greater than 20, so it is false.

00:03:37.385 --> 00:03:38.855
So the else block,

00:03:38.855 --> 00:03:42.635
and then in the legs the else block chord.

00:03:42.635 --> 00:03:47.150
And then it will move out of the if and else block and it will keep executing.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.115
The next lines are for core.

00:03:49.115 --> 00:03:53.720
All right, so we know how the if-else structure,

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.910
and we know what types of fields we are,

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.095
we have it in Java.

00:03:57.095 --> 00:04:02.580
Let's go and create an example for each and every type. Thank you.
