00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.350
Hello everyone.

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:06.870
Welcome back. So far we've discussed a lot of operators, right?

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.360
So that is one more different kind of operator.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.360
We used to call them as a ternary operator.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.990
So what do you mean by ternary operator?

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:23.610
Delete is used to create one-liner replacement for if, if else condition.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.745
For that, we need to know what is the if else condition.

00:00:26.745 --> 00:00:29.340
Okay, so I'm going to create a simple example,

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.430
will show you how they felt condition has to be

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.360
returned and how it can be replaced with a ternary operator.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.575
So they have a separate topic to discuss a lot about AFL, the control treatments.

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:44.450
But for now, I'm going to create an example to show

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.120
you how the ternary operators going to walk.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.060
So I'm going to create a new Java file here.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.290
So let's name it as our ternary operator example.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.140
Got it.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:06.545
So let's save them into the ask and we don't elaborate example that Java.

00:01:06.545 --> 00:01:08.285
So now we're good to go.

00:01:08.285 --> 00:01:09.770
So I have a main method,

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.245
so I can start coding now, right?

00:01:12.245 --> 00:01:18.020
So let's have int a is equal to 20,

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.565
and I have another a and B is equal to 15.

00:01:23.565 --> 00:01:29.410
So no worry about what you're gonna do right now.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.184
Okay, but I'm going to show you a simple example.

00:01:32.184 --> 00:01:34.675
If condition normally if condition, okay,

00:01:34.675 --> 00:01:38.305
so I'm going to check some condition if it is true,

00:01:38.305 --> 00:01:41.830
do something or else do something else.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:42.850
Right?

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.035
So what I'm gonna do is let me show you read a simple exam if,

00:01:47.035 --> 00:01:49.780
if a less than b.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.475
So then what I'm gonna do,

00:01:51.475 --> 00:01:58.400
I'll simply provide some bigger system.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.615
System.out dot, print LN,

00:02:04.615 --> 00:02:07.010
I'm going to print a.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.700
Okay?

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.040
In case if it is not I,

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:19.705
how else condition to check if else block, okay?

00:02:19.705 --> 00:02:25.015
So now if the condition is looks like if my NVDA is less than b,

00:02:25.015 --> 00:02:29.755
just print a or if it is not print B.

00:02:29.755 --> 00:02:39.805
Okay, so let's go back to our command prompt and type Java C ternary operator example.

00:02:39.805 --> 00:02:42.790
Okay, so then we'll compile them.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.200
Java.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.035
Compiled it, I'm going to run it right now.

00:02:47.035 --> 00:02:49.120
So the data is 2.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.495
So the reason it is going into the air, if bulla,

00:02:53.495 --> 00:02:56.960
because a less than b is equal to 2 and db is equal to 50,

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.720
of course, when D is less than 15.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.075
So now we're going to replace this entire if condition if else block in a single line.

00:03:05.075 --> 00:03:06.965
So that is called a ternary operator.

00:03:06.965 --> 00:03:16.835
Okay? So end result itself is equal.

00:03:16.835 --> 00:03:20.150
So what I'm going to do that condition first.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.805
So a less than b.

00:03:22.805 --> 00:03:25.880
So this is the condition.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.380
So if this condition true,

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.195
what else I need to do to the question mark that is called as a ternary operator.

00:03:32.195 --> 00:03:33.260
Okay?

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.020
So if it is true, return a,

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.020
and this colon belongs to the else part,

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.955
so which will return an else part.

00:03:40.955 --> 00:03:42.395
So orals B.

00:03:42.395 --> 00:03:48.695
So now what I can do is I'm going to copy this code and paste it here.

00:03:48.695 --> 00:03:51.390
And I'm going to print the result.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.045
Okay?

00:03:53.045 --> 00:03:55.460
So for now, I'm going to comment these lines.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.735
I don't want to show them. So go down here.

00:03:59.735 --> 00:04:03.380
Okay, So now I Donut Operator in place,

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.950
whatever we did an if-else block PDD-NOS in the lens.

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.560
So first is the condition and then the ternary operator.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.075
Then if it is a true,

00:04:11.075 --> 00:04:14.870
then return a and this belongs to else.

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.020
And if it is else, gopher, pre-written be.

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:24.470
Okay, Let's go back to the command prompt and let's compile them again.

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.075
And then it again. See we've got the same output.

00:04:29.075 --> 00:04:32.570
Okay, so don't worry about how the if else is working at all.

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.945
Because we're going to talk about in a brief way,

00:04:35.945 --> 00:04:39.155
when you're talking about control statements because we're going to talk about IV,

00:04:39.155 --> 00:04:40.745
far loop while loop, while,

00:04:40.745 --> 00:04:42.440
do, while everything we want to talk.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.250
Okay?

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.510
So this is how we introduce a ternary operator and give it some

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.730
dry and try with some samples so you can get

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.145
comfortable with the ternary operator, right?

00:04:52.145 --> 00:04:55.170
So let's meet each other the next video. Thank you.
