00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.935
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:01.935 --> 00:00:06.390
So let's talk about the hierarchical inheritance.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.085
So I'm going to create another example,

00:00:11.085 --> 00:00:20.890
high and Article 10 example.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.010
So here let's give a simple example.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.480
I tried animal, right?

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.130
Let's create a class,

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.715
but both can fly, right?

00:00:32.715 --> 00:00:37.930
So, but has its own method called bird fly.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:50.390
And I'm going to create another class called eagle.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.225
Eagle or so baud rate. So that also can play,

00:00:53.225 --> 00:00:57.240
I mean fly. So this extense.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:06.380
And I have another class called pigeon extends again,

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.670
but not the eagle.

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.110
Just take an example. I mean,

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.655
take a look at the previous example.

00:01:13.655 --> 00:01:16.415
So animal dog extends animal.

00:01:16.415 --> 00:01:18.155
Baby dog extends dog.

00:01:18.155 --> 00:01:22.190
But here, both, both,

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.190
both doublets extending the board property.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.795
It is like further.

00:01:26.795 --> 00:01:31.805
For example, if a father has a $0.02 class, Father class,

00:01:31.805 --> 00:01:35.630
someone extends father son to x since father,

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.585
that is hierarchical inheritance. Okay?

00:01:38.585 --> 00:01:41.660
So let me do that here.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.170
Void.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:56.930
And so our height, height level.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.550
Because for going the long way, it's right

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.090
here. I have a 101.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:25.490
My vision began autos.

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:26.690
We can create some other

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:36.685
LPG EGN

00:02:36.685 --> 00:02:38.360
flying away.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.850
Okay? So you might think what is the difference between the previous example,

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.680
this on previous example,

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.490
sharing each and every one's property because dog

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:53.125
extends animal so it can use its one property along with animal.

00:02:53.125 --> 00:02:57.625
So baby dog extends down so it can access it won't matter.

00:02:57.625 --> 00:03:01.585
And also dogs, my dog, extended animal,

00:03:01.585 --> 00:03:06.640
it can access any millimeter also. But here.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.385
Eagle can access bird.

00:03:09.385 --> 00:03:11.145
Bayesian can access bird,

00:03:11.145 --> 00:03:14.165
but BGN and Eagle,

00:03:14.165 --> 00:03:20.150
they cannot communicate individually because from BGN you cannot access eagle method.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.610
From Eagle, you cannot access them.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.140
Like, for example, I can share my father's property for if for example,

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.285
the father has a $0.02 each and every one wheelchair father's property at the same time.

00:03:32.285 --> 00:03:39.080
They have their own individual property because they won't share their own property.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.700
Right?

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.190
So let's create a main method here.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.710
So first let me create a class object for pigeon.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.955
So BGN is equal.

00:03:52.955 --> 00:03:56.780
Sorry. So new vision.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.020
So BGN can access the BGN properties,

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:07.790
which is nothing but BGN metallic.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:13.895
At the same time, it can access fly which is coming from the bird.

00:04:13.895 --> 00:04:17.040
So sorry.

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.425
So BGN, fly.

00:04:21.425 --> 00:04:25.055
But you cannot access eagle.

00:04:25.055 --> 00:04:31.835
Eagle separately extensible because Eagle does not have any communication between vision,

00:04:31.835 --> 00:04:37.115
but both of them individually has the extras between into board.

00:04:37.115 --> 00:04:38.570
So even though if you are trying to

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:47.570
access BGN dot height level, you won't be able to see.

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:54.800
That means you cannot access the reason.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.280
They don't have the visibility to each other because they're extending

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:04.020
different different subclasses. Okay, let me run it.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.480
Okay, so PG&E is flying away.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.040
There is no message from flow rate.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.520
So let me put something here. Here we go fly.

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.700
Okay, again and again. So now we have

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:29.060
a message from the BGN class itself and one from the bird, right?

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.350
So now I want to access the eagle.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.160
So what do you need to do in order to create a separate object for eagle so you

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.615
can access eagles property along with the board property.

00:05:41.615 --> 00:05:45.890
So e is equal to new agar.

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:51.065
So now we can use e dot height level.

00:05:51.065 --> 00:05:54.845
Also, you can use dot-dot-dot flying.

00:05:54.845 --> 00:06:02.495
So this is how you need to make use of hierarchical inheritance.

00:06:02.495 --> 00:06:08.630
See, these both belongs to the board and this belongs to the individual properties.

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.490
Begin cannot access the DOM.

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.140
I mean, median cannot access the eagle.

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.295
Eagle got actors.

00:06:13.295 --> 00:06:14.765
Bgn, that is long.

00:06:14.765 --> 00:06:18.690
It'll work. So let's see each other next video. Thanks.
