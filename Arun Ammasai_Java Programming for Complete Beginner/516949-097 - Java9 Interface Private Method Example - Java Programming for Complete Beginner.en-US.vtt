00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.010
Hello everyone.

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.630
Welcome back. So now we're going to talk about what is the change in Java name.

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.700
As a part of Zhao it we can have

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.390
static method implementation and default method implementations.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.050
Correct? So now we're going to talk about the changes in Java and in,

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.290
so the change in Java and it's nothing but in John and we

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.725
can have a private methods in the interface, correct?

00:00:22.725 --> 00:00:25.860
We all know that. What are the private, private method?

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.120
It's belongs to one class you cannot access outside of the class.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.590
So that is called as a private.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.325
You can call them as a privacy,

00:00:33.325 --> 00:00:37.850
which means you how your room only you're able to access or your warning them.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.260
That's our one. Group members can use it. That's our.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.950
So for that first thing we need to configure the build,

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.880
but because our counter current configuration is pointing to Java 8.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.860
So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to create

00:00:51.860 --> 00:01:00.995
a new library system library.

00:01:00.995 --> 00:01:03.510
So here I need to use.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.210
So 19 or I will use alternate.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.245
In Saudi Arabia is an ad for Java nine.

00:01:12.245 --> 00:01:15.290
Okay, if you want, you can follow it.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:21.170
So the location where I am in shelling down 19 is go to C drive.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.975
Program Files.

00:01:23.975 --> 00:01:31.790
Here is the Java java name subfolder.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.955
So JDK 9, I'm naming it doesn't do it again, I finish.

00:01:37.955 --> 00:01:41.840
So now what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna choose the JDK 9 and apply,

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.410
apply it and find out what I'm gonna do.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.050
I'm just default to being too heavy.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.495
Because I'm going to show you what will happen if you add play with them at that here.

00:01:53.495 --> 00:01:54.215
Okay?

00:01:54.215 --> 00:01:58.620
So I'm going to get into modality or private ward.

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.205
My one. Okay?

00:02:04.205 --> 00:02:06.320
Since I'm using Java 8,

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.015
it is showing an error message saying like illegal modifier because gravity is Nala,

00:02:11.015 --> 00:02:14.990
private is not a valid modified in

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.890
say the interface because it was not supported enjoyed.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.945
So basically what we need do,

00:02:20.945 --> 00:02:24.260
we need to modify the build part to Java nine,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.775
are able to alanine.

00:02:25.775 --> 00:02:35.915
Okay, so good at libraries and double-click that and choose alternative theory.

00:02:35.915 --> 00:02:38.810
And you can use JDK 9 here and finish,

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:45.490
apply, and then deduce Apply and Close. It might take awhile.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:55.540
It might take some time to load the configurations and apply and close it.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.175
So now we modified the GRE here.

00:03:00.175 --> 00:03:03.250
Still it is not working,

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.040
so I need to go back to the configuration,

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.610
but middle part configuration built,

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.150
but that might be some Java.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.340
Okay, So this remote,

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.890
this one for now, Apply and Close.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.835
So it is deliver. So even though we changed the bill,

00:03:28.835 --> 00:03:35.285
but it is finding to John 9 and we're using Gilligan n,

00:03:35.285 --> 00:03:38.315
Okay, that sometimes we need to modify

00:03:38.315 --> 00:03:42.410
the compiler itself so it is binding to Java 1.8, right?

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.900
So you need to change the compiler to Java nine and just apply.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.430
Yes.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.605
Implement Apply and Close.

00:03:51.605 --> 00:03:53.870
See now the error is gone, right?

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.295
So now let's provide something here, like some statements.

00:03:58.295 --> 00:04:08.090
So message from gray rate.

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.105
And then I'll key points which we need to keep it in mind.

00:04:16.105 --> 00:04:19.825
So when you're using private methods inside the interface,

00:04:19.825 --> 00:04:23.350
the method cannot be an abstract method,

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.110
right? That is the first store.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.490
And private method can be used one limited interface.

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.160
So if you're reverting the private methods here,

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.435
these are all only accessible inside is particularly interface alone.

00:04:37.435 --> 00:04:40.240
Like whenever you do a private method that elapses,

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.605
it will do only that particular class.

00:04:41.605 --> 00:04:43.960
The similar way whenever we're using private matter

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.870
inside an interface that we're only accessible inside of them.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.569
Interface.

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:51.140
And another important thing, prey,

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:57.620
which static method can be used inside at the static non-shedding interface meant that.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.945
What do you mean by that?

00:04:59.945 --> 00:05:02.810
When you're writing a private static methods.

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:03.740
Okay.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.455
So can be, it can be usually inside other,

00:05:06.455 --> 00:05:08.690
for example, when you have a three static models, right?

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:13.745
So you can call each other static methods inside any other static methods.

00:05:13.745 --> 00:05:16.955
And also a non-static methods also you can call,

00:05:16.955 --> 00:05:19.490
you can see an example of him and brave it.

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.540
Non-static method cannot be used inside a private static method,

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.135
right? But do you mean by that?

00:05:26.135 --> 00:05:32.420
We have non-static methods and they cannot be used in private static methods.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.820
Okay, So in instead the private setting with that,

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.575
make sure you're using static methods.

00:05:36.575 --> 00:05:42.180
Let's go through all the steps using the same example.
