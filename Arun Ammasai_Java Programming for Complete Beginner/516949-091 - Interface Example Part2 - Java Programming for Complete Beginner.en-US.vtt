00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.715
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:02.715 --> 00:00:09.360
So we created a simple interface and we implementer in another class.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.185
Correct?

00:00:10.185 --> 00:00:12.885
So as we mentioned in the PPD, right?

00:00:12.885 --> 00:00:15.300
So you cannot create objects for,

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.820
you cannot initialize an object for a interface or abstract class.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.940
So in this example is a interface here,

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:30.165
so we cannot initiate a variable or initially the object for it.

00:00:30.165 --> 00:00:32.355
Okay, so that is there isn't what we done.

00:00:32.355 --> 00:00:37.350
So we created object for the interface demo who's implementing that particular interface?

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.215
Correct.

00:00:38.215 --> 00:00:41.120
But there are other ways to do that. So how we can do that.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.485
So this is my interface, right?

00:00:42.485 --> 00:00:45.800
So interphase and interphase example.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.310
You cannot create the object for the interface,

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.995
but you can still create the object for

00:00:51.995 --> 00:00:55.400
that class who's implementing this particular interface.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.565
Okay, So in terms of new interface example,

00:00:58.565 --> 00:01:01.025
you can simply provide new interface.

00:01:01.025 --> 00:01:06.395
They see this, they interface.

00:01:06.395 --> 00:01:08.150
And this is the implementation class,

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.560
which is possible. Okay?

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:22.070
So now we can access the same data using I add for dementia doing the same thing.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.350
So now we got the boat outcome here.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.425
Correct.

00:01:27.425 --> 00:01:32.030
So this is a simple example to how we can

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.849
access our metadata and providing implementation in interface.

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:41.945
Great, So we access the matter and we do have a variable, right?

00:01:41.945 --> 00:01:44.915
Okay, So, so what is a variable?

00:01:44.915 --> 00:01:49.310
So I dot x.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.395
So now I'm going to undo that again.

00:01:51.395 --> 00:01:55.340
So we should be able to receive the data.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.280
Okay, What I'm gonna do is I'm going to try and to modify the data here is equal to 20.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.410
See what happened here?

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.350
I'm getting an exception here or error.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.180
The final field interphase example,

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.665
x cannot be assigned.

00:02:09.665 --> 00:02:11.885
It is says x is a finite.

00:02:11.885 --> 00:02:14.104
But when you go back to the interface,

00:02:14.104 --> 00:02:16.220
if you take a look at is there any final year?

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.835
No.

00:02:16.835 --> 00:02:18.200
So that is what I mentioned.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.020
Whenever you write any declare any variable in settings by default,

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.490
that is a final method by default, it's an abstract.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.470
Right?

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.455
So what are the tools we achieved so far?

00:02:33.455 --> 00:02:34.685
Let's go back to our PPT.

00:02:34.685 --> 00:02:36.320
So it's like a glass but not a class.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.655
We know how to create an interface.

00:02:37.655 --> 00:02:39.860
Interface. Interface name can have

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.135
method declaration exactly by default. That's that abstract.

00:02:44.135 --> 00:02:46.190
So I'm not providing any abstract keyword,

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.495
but still live concert as abstract and variable can be declared.

00:02:50.495 --> 00:02:52.160
And by default it's the final,

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.150
even though I'm not explicitly specify the variable is final.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.580
It's still considered as a final variable.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.970
And it cannot be initialized, instantiated,

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:11.375
which means you cannot create an object for an interface like abstract.

00:03:11.375 --> 00:03:12.635
Yeah, right.

00:03:12.635 --> 00:03:14.300
So we're going to see

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.680
some additional examples also on this interface topic in the next video.
