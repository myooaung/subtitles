00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.610
So we discussed several assignment operator.

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.855
So the next one, increment and decrement operator, we're going to talk,

00:00:09.855 --> 00:00:12.120
we're going to create a simple example to

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.720
show how the increment and decrement will welcome.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.630
Okay, So I'm going to create a new class here.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:28.920
So increment or agreement example.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.650
So just save the name John, John increment,

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.835
decrement that exempted John Snow.

00:00:37.835 --> 00:00:38.765
So what is it?

00:00:38.765 --> 00:00:42.320
There are two operators available.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.510
The oneness plus, plus, one is plus,

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.285
plus, and the second one is minus, minus.

00:00:47.285 --> 00:00:50.100
So what basically it means.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.735
Okay, Let's give it in a simple example.

00:00:53.735 --> 00:00:59.240
Let's have I have examined called int x is equal to ten.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.695
So if I'm providing X plus plus,

00:01:03.695 --> 00:01:05.195
so what does that mean?

00:01:05.195 --> 00:01:14.165
And what is going to print system out dot print LN and the valleys x.

00:01:14.165 --> 00:01:15.305
Okay?

00:01:15.305 --> 00:01:18.260
So what is it mean?

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:24.150
So basically x plus means it is adding one into that.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.230
If you want to put it in a simple way,

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.590
x is equal to x plus one.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.260
Okay?

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.010
In previous example, as M laboratory has been some x minus is equal to 4,

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.540
but here it just only one minus, one plus.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.010
But here it is e to the x plus plus means x plus one.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.570
Let's run the code and I'll show you the outcome.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.400
So Java C, increment,

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.615
decrement example and John space angry.

00:01:59.615 --> 00:02:01.505
And example.

00:02:01.505 --> 00:02:04.160
Look at the data item 11.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.345
Right?

00:02:05.345 --> 00:02:08.405
Okay, let's go back and create one more variable,

00:02:08.405 --> 00:02:14.735
like int y is equal to 25.

00:02:14.735 --> 00:02:17.870
So here I tried increment,

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.055
right? Let's try it.

00:02:19.055 --> 00:02:22.850
Decrement here, y minus minus.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.305
So what is that means?

00:02:24.305 --> 00:02:26.120
It means the similar way.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.600
So y is equal to y minus one.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.890
Let's see. What is the outcome.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.270
So what does x y value?

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.705
25 is a y minus 1, which is 24.

00:02:41.705 --> 00:02:46.010
So let's verify the outcome whether our understanding is correct.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.515
Let's compile the code again.

00:02:48.515 --> 00:02:50.210
Okay, So there's an error.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.990
So addressing the coelom is expected in the lane number seven.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.970
So go back to the line number 7 and add color.

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.280
This is why we need

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:06.395
manner compilation process and compel them again. And I'm going to read now.

00:03:06.395 --> 00:03:10.370
See it then becomes 11 and 25 becomes 24.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.110
That is how the plus,

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.610
plus and the minus minus,

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.785
in a simple words,

00:03:15.785 --> 00:03:17.690
It's add one into IT,

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.915
minus-minus, subtract one into it.

00:03:20.915 --> 00:03:24.515
Okay, That is something called prefix and postfix,

00:03:24.515 --> 00:03:32.060
like plus plus x or x plus plus.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.050
So we tried this is a postfix and prefix occur.

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.150
We don't want to discuss a prefix and post-doc

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.700
now because we've started talking about that,

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.985
you might get confused how this thing's going to work.

00:03:43.985 --> 00:03:49.055
We're gonna talk about that with the perfect example while on the course.

00:03:49.055 --> 00:03:53.825
Okay, so just understand that if somebody is asking how the increment is going to look,

00:03:53.825 --> 00:03:55.130
if somebody's giving X plus,

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.035
that means I'm adding one into that.

00:03:57.035 --> 00:03:58.040
Excel.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.840
If it is x minus minus,

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.225
what do you want to 0 x minus minus.

00:04:05.225 --> 00:04:08.045
You're subtracting one from that x value.

00:04:08.045 --> 00:04:09.905
If it is 10, 10 plus one,

00:04:09.905 --> 00:04:12.500
if it is 25, 25 minutes, or 24.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.405
So that is how it would work.

00:04:14.405 --> 00:04:21.455
So this is what does what do you know about the increment and decrement operator?

00:04:21.455 --> 00:04:23.945
So let's see the next video.

00:04:23.945 --> 00:04:26.490
We'll talk about logical operator.
