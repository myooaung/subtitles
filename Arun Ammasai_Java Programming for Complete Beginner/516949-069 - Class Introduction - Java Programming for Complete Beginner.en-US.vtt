00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.595
The next important thing.

00:00:05.595 --> 00:00:08.710
Under the books concept.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.945
You can simply say without class there is nothing in Java.

00:00:12.945 --> 00:00:14.310
You cannot create a program.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:19.680
We took that class because so far we have discussed lot of functional amino,

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.915
the control statements, operators,

00:00:21.915 --> 00:00:25.115
and a different kind of concepts.

00:00:25.115 --> 00:00:27.380
But everything we exercise,

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.610
you think some example of class plus operator example

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.545
plus arithmetic example H and everything must container class.

00:00:36.545 --> 00:00:39.050
So what is a class?

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.175
Unlike object, class is a logical entity.

00:00:43.175 --> 00:00:47.060
Which means class contains some objects,

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:52.355
which means the logical entity which contains some meaningful identity,

00:00:52.355 --> 00:00:55.955
which means I have a class which contains at home.

00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:58.445
So home is object inside a class.

00:00:58.445 --> 00:01:00.290
Home acids won't behaviors.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.285
And we know that whom is an object?

00:01:02.285 --> 00:01:04.580
Object is a real-world entity class,

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.420
it's a logical entity.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.234
Okay, So the real validity you can see and you can identify,

00:01:12.234 --> 00:01:14.695
but logical entity, you can't see them.

00:01:14.695 --> 00:01:18.130
And what exactly is the class?

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.095
Nothing but it's a collection of objects.

00:01:20.095 --> 00:01:21.340
You can have a methods,

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.245
you can have variables.

00:01:23.245 --> 00:01:27.460
It's a combination of objects or collection of objects.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.930
Everything grouped together inside a class.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:39.550
Or you can simply see the class is a blueprint of individual objects.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.750
Of course, because class knows everything or is dead inside.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.480
Because class must contain a lot of objects.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.185
So obviously the class is a blueprint off each and every individual objects.

00:01:51.185 --> 00:01:56.219
It represents the set of properties and methods.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.850
And methods, not all.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.700
So property means you can have variables in it,

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.775
or you can have methods.

00:02:04.775 --> 00:02:08.720
In the other word, you can have data members which is a variable and you have

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.640
a data method which is a material functions that are common are all the objects.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.155
And another important thing,

00:02:18.155 --> 00:02:23.674
I'm like object classes will not consume any space. Objects.

00:02:23.674 --> 00:02:27.035
Does that class is a logical entity, right?

00:02:27.035 --> 00:02:29.090
For logical entity you don't, for E,

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.035
for imagining something you don't need a memory, correct?

00:02:33.035 --> 00:02:34.280
Exact.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.555
I mean, what do you can simply say that for imagine something,

00:02:38.555 --> 00:02:43.910
you don't need the real-world entity, right?

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.630
But if you want to order something or if you want to get something, for example,

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.250
if you are purchasing something,

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.680
you need a place to store it.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.260
Okay? So you're going to a shop and you're getting

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.005
a refrigerator or a C, something like that.

00:02:57.005 --> 00:02:59.525
So when you buying something,

00:02:59.525 --> 00:03:02.735
some objects, you need to have a home.

00:03:02.735 --> 00:03:04.385
Home is another object.

00:03:04.385 --> 00:03:06.755
So when it has object,

00:03:06.755 --> 00:03:11.390
you can place your properties or methods. Correct?

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.905
But you are dreaming.

00:03:12.905 --> 00:03:15.305
Dreaming. It is a simple example, okay?

00:03:15.305 --> 00:03:17.345
Dreaming is a class.

00:03:17.345 --> 00:03:19.595
If you want to present simple word.

00:03:19.595 --> 00:03:21.455
When you're dreaming something.

00:03:21.455 --> 00:03:24.605
That is a class.

00:03:24.605 --> 00:03:27.230
Okay, The next day you've got some greens,

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.900
reds, and you're trying to implement something in the study trim.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.095
You are, you, you had a dream like you're going to purchase a DVD.

00:03:34.095 --> 00:03:35.000
Okay.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.870
You're going and purchasing it TV and put it in your home.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.685
That is our object.

00:03:40.685 --> 00:03:43.085
So imagination is glass,

00:03:43.085 --> 00:03:44.405
which is a logical thing,

00:03:44.405 --> 00:03:47.105
and object is real-world entity.

00:03:47.105 --> 00:03:49.040
So just try to understand that.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.800
I'm going to create a simple class.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.950
And I'll show you how to create a class and

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.205
what are the things that need to be provided in the class.

00:03:58.205 --> 00:04:01.955
We know that we have seen lot of examples,

00:04:01.955 --> 00:04:04.730
but we actually never talked about what is

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.215
exactly the class needs to be created and what is the syntax and what method,

00:04:09.215 --> 00:04:11.930
I mean, what the class can contain,

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.640
how you can define a class,

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.665
how you cannot define a class.

00:04:15.665 --> 00:04:17.720
I mean, the rules and the regulations.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.920
We'll talk over to the next video.
