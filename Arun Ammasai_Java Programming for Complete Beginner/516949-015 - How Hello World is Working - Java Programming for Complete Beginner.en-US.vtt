00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.295
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:02.295 --> 00:00:06.840
So successfully we ran our first Java program.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.940
Feels good, right?

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.300
But now let's try to understand what the program contains.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:22.290
Okay, so we need to know what are the key elements and what are the syntax is everything.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.505
So let's talk about the program which we have written here.

00:00:26.505 --> 00:00:28.935
So everything's a question about,

00:00:28.935 --> 00:00:30.915
I don't know what is it and are.

00:00:30.915 --> 00:00:34.155
Because we're going to talk about each and every elements in the class.

00:00:34.155 --> 00:00:40.105
The first one. Why did we save the file limit HelloWorld.java?

00:00:40.105 --> 00:00:44.000
Correct? Because my class name is Hello world.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.860
Okay, so that is a condition.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:52.730
When you write a Java program while saving the Java file,

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.300
it has to be the same name as your class name.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.285
For example, if you're creating x-ray is

00:00:59.285 --> 00:01:03.365
glass and you will find them should be X2, is it that Java?

00:01:03.365 --> 00:01:07.160
And if you're creating something called random class,

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.250
and you will find them should be random class that Java.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.350
So we should always name the file same as the class name.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.450
Okay, so then you might think,

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.430
okay, I created a class that is fine.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:25.400
I understand why we need to create at LastName and also the file limit the same.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:31.355
Now we're going to think about why there is a public static void main, this one.

00:01:31.355 --> 00:01:32.870
So what is this?

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.980
What is a public static void main here? Correct.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.440
So we'll talk about what each and everything.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.930
Before that, let me show you something, tell you something.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.605
So whenever if you want to write a class,

00:01:48.605 --> 00:01:53.610
the syntax is the class name.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.660
I'm in. The syntax is class base, class name.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.955
So this is the syntax.

00:02:04.955 --> 00:02:07.730
Okay, So this is very common climb.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.420
So which will not compile, it will ohmmeter.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.045
Okay, So the syntax for creating a class is class and the class name.

00:02:17.045 --> 00:02:19.715
So if you want to save the class name in your class,

00:02:19.715 --> 00:02:21.575
save as a class name dot Java,

00:02:21.575 --> 00:02:27.215
and open curly brace everything which will be inside this particular braces.

00:02:27.215 --> 00:02:28.760
Okay, So what is this?

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.610
This is beginning of the class.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.755
Beginning of the class.

00:02:36.755 --> 00:02:40.310
That means if you want to know how long,

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.440
I mean, the entire duration of the class says, go to click here.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.220
Click the open and close bracket.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.740
It will show you the limit,

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.300
the scope of the class file.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.640
So entire this thing comes and then my helloworld dot class.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.820
So this is beginning of the class and this is end up

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:11.760
the class and the class.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.890
Okay, now, so that is something else.

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.130
Also the RNA does open and close brackets.

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.740
And here this is a third.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.350
So this is the beginning of metal.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.130
And this will end.

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.790
So whenever you write a class or whenever you write a method,

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.955
it needs to have the beginning and the end.

00:03:40.955 --> 00:03:44.915
Okay, so one particular class which contain multiple methods.

00:03:44.915 --> 00:03:50.345
So each method acids one statement, correct?

00:03:50.345 --> 00:03:55.050
So I'm going to say this statement belongs to the main mountain.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:56.810
Right?

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.020
So and that is another rule.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:06.020
Okay, so the syntax is for creating a class glass space className.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.455
At the same time, the file has to be saved as a class name dot Java,

00:04:09.455 --> 00:04:15.330
which is nothing when HelloWorld.java, right?

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.960
So what is the next one here?

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.110
Okay, So why the public static,

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.280
void main, the first thing,

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.890
public access outside of the class,

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:36.020
because you write a Java program inside your own data tree.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.990
But you will compel her needs to access your class value which

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.080
is located in another directory. Okay?

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.640
For example, if you have a neighbor,

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.460
if you want same dairy and you are home unit to get the permission

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.375
oriented to give you a key to the neighbor so he can enter.

00:04:50.375 --> 00:04:52.055
Correct?

00:04:52.055 --> 00:04:55.744
And why static?

00:04:55.744 --> 00:04:58.445
Static is a different kind of a keyword.

00:04:58.445 --> 00:05:03.530
They can run itself it or an object that is very static, which we use.

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.930
And we'll talk about what is static and why we need them.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.770
We have a separate session and why the SAM method return type.

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.645
Okay, So if it is a void,

00:05:11.645 --> 00:05:15.230
it will not return anything wide means m directed to a 100 and anything.

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.920
And it is just an amateur name which

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:25.190
will works as the entry point to your class and sharing arguments.

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.405
So if you're calling a class and you want to pass some parameters to that.

00:05:29.405 --> 00:05:35.750
So you can use the arguments to pass the input arguments in the comment line.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.760
Still we're going to talk about what is public,

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.620
static, void, main and eat and everything.

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:48.570
And along with simple example for each and everything. Thank you.
