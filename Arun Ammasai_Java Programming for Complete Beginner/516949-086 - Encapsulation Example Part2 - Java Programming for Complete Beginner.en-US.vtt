00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.355
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:02.355 --> 00:00:08.970
So last video we discussed about creating a class and we can create

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:15.345
the private members and recreated the methods where we can get the data and the data.

00:00:15.345 --> 00:00:20.115
But now we're going to create the example for read-only access.

00:00:20.115 --> 00:00:21.240
Okay?

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.295
But even though if it is read only access,

00:00:23.295 --> 00:00:27.330
I cannot allow the person to access my name directly.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.200
So I can use the get name method alone.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.790
So in that case, I will not.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.140
How does it name here?

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.310
So what will happen?

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.780
The public String getName,

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.950
and I'll provide some data here.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.180
So x, why is that?

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.640
So now what'll happen when you can go back to your encapsulation example.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.370
And then now you can come on

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.940
this land because you don't need to set the name because it's a read-only.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.625
My employee itself.

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:00.560
They hear the data.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.620
So you should be able to access. Now.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:09.875
See, now you are able to access, right?

00:01:09.875 --> 00:01:12.800
Okay, This is an example for this read only.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.065
But what do you mean by write-only?

00:01:15.065 --> 00:01:25.100
Okay, so just take an example like so let's take an example of a name here.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.905
So now I'm going to comment that getName.

00:01:27.905 --> 00:01:30.500
See it's very pretty simple guy is actually.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.285
So if you comment the getName,

00:01:32.285 --> 00:01:35.135
the receiving part, which means we've said right, only.

00:01:35.135 --> 00:01:36.920
If you only enable the getName,

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.735
that meant it is read only.

00:01:38.735 --> 00:01:41.915
Okay, So now I am allowing them to set the name.

00:01:41.915 --> 00:01:46.410
So what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna come on this one.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.900
So now I'm allowed to say the name,

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.010
but there is no way to retrieve it because you cannot use

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.810
the employee object to receive the name directly because it's a private.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.615
So when you have a statement alone,

00:02:02.615 --> 00:02:04.100
which means the write-only,

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.570
you can write that, sorry,

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.055
you cannot retrieve the data.

00:02:07.055 --> 00:02:08.675
Even if some mistakes happen,

00:02:08.675 --> 00:02:10.205
you cannot retrieve vegans eat.

00:02:10.205 --> 00:02:12.260
So that is why always the DT was,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.150
which is nothing but data transfer objects.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.995
They are all read and write,

00:02:15.995 --> 00:02:18.785
but they cannot access directly.

00:02:18.785 --> 00:02:19.895
Right?

00:02:19.895 --> 00:02:26.150
So this is the best example and pretty simple examples also for encapsulation.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.460
I just give it a try and let me know if you guys are

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.860
stuck somewhere or if you want some better examples,

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.330
I can give you that also,

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.415
since the course is going pretty long.

00:02:34.415 --> 00:02:39.440
So I'm just giving you as simple as examples so you can easily understand them.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.160
Thank you.
