00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.025
Hello everyone.

00:00:02.025 --> 00:00:05.235
Let's talk about these things.

00:00:05.235 --> 00:00:07.155
So this is the first one and you are going to dock.

00:00:07.155 --> 00:00:09.090
So I'm going to create two interfaces.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.455
And I'm gonna go down to the class,

00:00:10.455 --> 00:00:12.555
and I'm going to add to this particular portion of a port.

00:00:12.555 --> 00:00:14.985
Okay, let's go back to our ID.

00:00:14.985 --> 00:00:20.530
So here, anti-communist middle line.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.815
So the first thing,

00:00:25.815 --> 00:00:27.764
we're going to create two interfaces.

00:00:27.764 --> 00:00:32.280
So I'm going to create interface 1.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:40.740
And I'm going to create one more interface and column as a interface 2.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.955
So each of them has one abstract method like wide.

00:00:46.955 --> 00:00:53.945
This one method, one.

00:00:53.945 --> 00:00:57.260
Method one means it's coming from interface one.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.790
Okay?

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.080
And I'm going to interface to and I'm creating

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.225
another matter which contents method

00:01:05.225 --> 00:01:10.025
to do interface each of them contain one abstract method,

00:01:10.025 --> 00:01:14.195
like interface one has in method one interface to matter too.

00:01:14.195 --> 00:01:16.205
So now I'm going to create one more.

00:01:16.205 --> 00:01:21.140
This time I'm going to create it Class be implemented the interface 1 and 2.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.690
Let's go ahead and create a class.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.150
And here, so multiple

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.250
inhere example. Got it.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.525
So no, we have class,

00:01:38.525 --> 00:01:40.085
as I mentioned earlier.

00:01:40.085 --> 00:01:42.230
Just take a little bit. This is my class now.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.550
So I can implement the interface 1 and interface 2. So how we can do that?

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.980
So the way we do that implements the interface going to implement not extent.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.565
So I can call interface one.

00:01:55.565 --> 00:02:01.730
Interface to be disposable if it is an interface.

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.515
But we've got some error message here.

00:02:03.515 --> 00:02:07.820
Of course it's an error message because interface and interface to both of them.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.725
How is an unimplemented method,

00:02:09.725 --> 00:02:11.795
which means partial methods?

00:02:11.795 --> 00:02:13.595
Or in simple words,

00:02:13.595 --> 00:02:16.535
my thirdly that the body, right?

00:02:16.535 --> 00:02:18.770
So we can add unimplemented methods here.

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.340
So now I can simply provide successful here.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.325
So here I can provide a message,

00:02:25.325 --> 00:02:29.090
message from my third T2.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.460
And you can provide the same thing here.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:40.250
So here in this place is matter from my third one, message from method 1.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.890
Okay, So now what we can do simple, right?

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.510
So I can create my one main method here so I can access them.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.100
Correct?

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.860
So either we can use, if you want to access,

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.285
introduce one method alone,

00:02:53.285 --> 00:02:55.265
you can create an interface.

00:02:55.265 --> 00:02:57.320
You can call only interface around.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.815
For example, I'm going to call only the interface 1.

00:03:00.815 --> 00:03:02.120
So interface, sorry.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.130
So interface 1 is equal to I1,

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.400
is equal to the new implementation class.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.480
What are the implementation classes?

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.835
Multiple inhere example.

00:03:10.835 --> 00:03:15.605
Great. What happened? No.

00:03:15.605 --> 00:03:20.540
Okay, now we have the access to the interface on our lab and I'm gonna call

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:28.950
I1 dot here my third 12, right?

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.090
So the method one I'm trying to access,

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.800
but just take a look at it.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.360
I can only see the method one here because we are trying to

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:45.845
create an object for multiple inheritance which is implementing buy only the interface 1,

00:03:45.845 --> 00:03:48.320
the interface one, only contentment that one.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.425
So when you're creating a reference for interface one,

00:03:51.425 --> 00:03:53.060
you should be able to access on leaves one,

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.890
but that's introduced one modality,

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.420
nothing wet method one.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.540
So now I can run this.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.750
So now we've got a message from myself, from my dad one.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:03.590
Okay.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.240
Let's do this under the dry.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.390
So I'm going to do the same thing for Interface 2.

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:17.255
So here in the Phase 2 and the same thing you can simply is

00:04:17.255 --> 00:04:25.640
i2.me name here, Interface 2.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.535
So here it should be met that DO now you can run it.

00:04:28.535 --> 00:04:32.735
You should be able to access my dad from the both interfaces.

00:04:32.735 --> 00:04:33.440
Okay?

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.990
So you might ask, why do I need to create multiple instances here so I can get to one.

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.695
Why can I grade on a single reference for both of them?

00:04:42.695 --> 00:04:45.560
You can do that because multiple inhere example,

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.869
this class has all the implementation.

00:04:47.869 --> 00:04:49.880
So instead of doing that,

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:57.860
what you can do is let me show you that you can simply greater,

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.270
sorry, you can create the object for multiple inheritance example.

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.470
Obj is equal to new multiple.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.365
In her example, using this object reference,

00:05:09.365 --> 00:05:11.300
you should be able to access both the methods.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.115
See my dad one,

00:05:13.115 --> 00:05:17.610
and also you can access method two.

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:24.185
So it's completely up to your Need,

00:05:24.185 --> 00:05:26.300
which meant that you're going to prefer.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.415
Okay? So basically what happen?

00:05:28.415 --> 00:05:31.040
Some people are using interface one interface to both,

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.335
but they didn't really matter from interface one.

00:05:33.335 --> 00:05:35.885
In that scenario. They don't need to use this.

00:05:35.885 --> 00:05:37.415
They can only try that.

00:05:37.415 --> 00:05:42.875
And some other people they need Wanli interface to the tools so they can only use this.

00:05:42.875 --> 00:05:45.560
You don't have data on how to do the entire thing here.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.100
Right? So we're going to talk about another simple example are

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.190
some real-world kind of entity example in the next video.

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:53.580
Thank you.
