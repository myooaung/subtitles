00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.475
Hello everyone. Welcome back.

00:00:02.475 --> 00:00:04.560
So when you're talking about the loop,

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.945
there are two important things we need to know.

00:00:06.945 --> 00:00:12.119
The one is break statement and then continue statement.

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:15.420
So where do we need a break statement and why do we need a continuous statement?

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.440
Let's talk about it here.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.260
The first thing, break is used to come out of the loop instantly.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:31.490
What does that mean? Your, your loop is running up to 1000 times.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.520
And there are certain conditions.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.650
If the particular loop is reached the limit of 750 or 700,

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:40.985
you don't want to run it anymore.

00:00:40.985 --> 00:00:43.220
You want to exit the loop.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:49.860
So you can use them break to exit from the loop so that time you can either break.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.360
So whenever the break encounter in a loop,

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.505
control directly come out of the loop and loop gets dominated the same.

00:00:58.505 --> 00:01:01.730
So I'm telling my for loop you can keep learning.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.835
Okay? But if you encountered this particular line of a code and it has break in it,

00:01:07.835 --> 00:01:13.440
so immediately come out of the loop and dominate the entire for loop.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:20.000
Okay, so break statements can be used in a loop along with a switch.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.820
And sometimes you can use in the if condition is also

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:30.065
breaks the current flow so that the meaning of breath rate derivatives keep going.

00:01:30.065 --> 00:01:33.770
If you put a diamond, say what'll happen, the fluid brake rate.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.470
So as I mentioned,

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.090
it can be used in all depth of flow,

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.265
while and do-while loop,

00:01:40.265 --> 00:01:42.530
even if you can use it.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.140
The next one, Continue.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.750
So break will stop the flow.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.475
So what continue will do?

00:01:49.475 --> 00:01:54.965
So again, like your break continue will be used inside the loops.

00:01:54.965 --> 00:01:59.510
So it is telling of a far lower than a specific value becomes.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.480
Jump to the next value. Don't continue editing.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.680
So whenever we encounter that, Continue.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.260
So here basically I'm running from, I'm funny,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:10.550
I'm running FOR loop,

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.530
which will print from one to 10.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.715
So I have a condition like if the value reached to five and continue.

00:02:16.715 --> 00:02:20.405
So what will happen? It will ever care about what is the upcoming lines.

00:02:20.405 --> 00:02:22.640
So what did the next thing that needs to be executed?

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.345
It will next go to the loop and proceed to the next value.

00:02:26.345 --> 00:02:29.210
That means it will not provide, which will not process.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:34.085
The data file can be used in welfare while and do-while loop.

00:02:34.085 --> 00:02:40.310
So it can be used to skip certain value in a loop.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.340
So we can see a simple example.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.830
So we can easily begin to have a better understanding

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.360
about why we have a continuing why we have a break.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.870
Thank you.
