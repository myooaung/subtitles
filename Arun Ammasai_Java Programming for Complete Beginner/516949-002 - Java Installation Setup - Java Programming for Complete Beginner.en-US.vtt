00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.425
Hello everyone.

00:00:01.425 --> 00:00:04.680
Welcome back. Let's talk about how we are going to

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.015
download the software and how we're going to install into your mission.

00:00:09.015 --> 00:00:10.410
The first thing is first.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.910
So let's open your browser and just dab download Java JDK.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.200
Normally it'll take you to

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.340
Oracle website and that have some other additional websites also,

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.020
but you don't have to worry about all those things,

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.785
but you can directly download from Oracle.com because adjudicates Oracle product.

00:00:28.785 --> 00:00:31.410
So let's go to Java SE downloads.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.500
Java SE is nothing but Java Standard Edition.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.860
And then click dedicate donor here.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.790
And then it'll take you to the next page where you can find out

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:50.735
all the different platforms like Linux, Mac, and Windows.

00:00:50.735 --> 00:00:53.465
We need it for Windows.

00:00:53.465 --> 00:00:57.020
So if you're using Windows 64 machine,

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.580
you can use Windows 64.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:59.375
Okay?

00:00:59.375 --> 00:01:03.800
Just click this hyperlink

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.705
and then it will show you must accept Darwin technology, some pop-up message.

00:01:08.705 --> 00:01:16.190
You need to accept the review and Oracle technology that agreement.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.170
And then you need to download the JDK,

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.160
this particular button which will download the EXE file.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.225
And you can save it wherever you want.

00:01:31.225 --> 00:01:39.170
So I'm going to save it into download and save it.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.180
Okay, it's downloaded in progress.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.515
I'm going to pause the video until the download is complete.

00:01:47.515 --> 00:01:49.884
The download is completed.

00:01:49.884 --> 00:01:55.030
Let me open the download folder that you can find out the JDK.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.970
Okay, So what basically you need to do,

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.265
just double-click the software.

00:02:00.265 --> 00:02:03.085
It will launch the installation setup.

00:02:03.085 --> 00:02:09.100
Just click Run. It might take awhile,

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.570
just give it a minute.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.140
So it's starter.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.765
The ones they installation Popper has been appear you need to choose Next.

00:02:22.765 --> 00:02:26.215
And it will show you which location it is going to be installed.

00:02:26.215 --> 00:02:28.360
It is going to be installed.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.580
You will see is write programming files,

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.995
Java and the Java JDK IF and 14.1.

00:02:35.995 --> 00:02:39.640
The reason why we have dedicated 14 points European and because there is

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.525
a latest version which is available in the Oracle website,

00:02:43.525 --> 00:02:45.490
if you want to change the location,

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.125
which normally we don't do.

00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:50.410
If you want, you can do it by clicking the Change button.

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:57.260
Click Next, then more minute. Just read.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.270
So far.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.590
Then we'll proceed from there

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.480
and begin close.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.280
Just want to make sure let's go back to

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.675
the installation directory to see our JDK has been installed.

00:04:25.675 --> 00:04:28.930
So go to local C drive,

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.290
Program Files and Program Files, Java.

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.635
Then you might see lot of versions here because i'm,

00:04:35.635 --> 00:04:37.195
I'm working at the different version.

00:04:37.195 --> 00:04:42.235
So the one which we installed is nothing but JDK 14.1.

00:04:42.235 --> 00:04:43.180
Correct.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.410
So we have a duty here,

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.705
but we talked about something called JRD, right?

00:04:46.705 --> 00:04:49.930
So this is the JRE,

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.960
which will help us to run the code.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.360
So in the next video, we'll set up

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.140
the environment so they insemination is then the next process setup.

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.830
Thank you.
