00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.575
So before we are moving into the eclipse,

00:00:04.575 --> 00:00:08.055
so we are done lot of examples before, right?

00:00:08.055 --> 00:00:10.380
So we saved inside,

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.390
see what's with Java basically,

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.810
and some other files right where it is located.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.835
Go to your C drive.

00:00:17.835 --> 00:00:20.174
And here we have our workspace.

00:00:20.174 --> 00:00:22.980
Instead, the workspace we had Java basically.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.100
And these are all in our previous example.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.195
So what I have done,

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:32.195
I copied the Java fields from here,

00:00:32.195 --> 00:00:36.740
and I went to our Eclipse ID and they create another package called

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.885
Java basics dot core dot fundamentals like how we did for the control statement.

00:00:41.885 --> 00:00:44.240
And I based all the course here,

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.875
there is only one change.

00:00:45.875 --> 00:00:50.105
So the first line which will be not there in our previous program,

00:00:50.105 --> 00:00:53.240
because it is not that in any subdirectories, right?

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.390
So since I'm using all the classes,

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.104
the entire Java basics dot core, dot fundamentals.

00:00:59.104 --> 00:01:00.650
I need to provide a package name.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:01.760
Here it is again the same.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.630
See the package and see that declaration here, Package declaration.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.690
So Java basics, which is nothing by me first folder and

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.975
code is nothing but my second folder and fundamentals, that third folder.

00:01:11.975 --> 00:01:13.430
So instead the third folder,

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.290
I have this particular example.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.170
So you need to provide the package declaration.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.310
Right here.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.500
We don't know how to add anything right now.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.610
So now what we're going to do,

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.355
we're going to use the control statements.

00:01:28.355 --> 00:01:29.990
Correct?

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.350
So whatever the example we are going to write, just click,

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.420
right-click in the contentment and new classified.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.300
And you can just simply provide that test. It's a class name.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:50.660
And it will open up while creating itself will automatically create the package.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.210
Okay, We don't have to prove it everytime, okay,

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.920
since I copied from somewhere else,

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.020
I had to provide it manually here.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.700
But this one is directly we are creating in the ID.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.530
So ID itself into taking care of

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:10.295
creating the package structure and it will create your class.

00:02:10.295 --> 00:02:12.530
Okay, so in the next example,

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.080
we'll talk about how the controls have

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.840
been looking at what kind of control statement we have in Java.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.700
And we'll go through one by one. Thank you.
