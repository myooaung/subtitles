00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.355
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:02.355 --> 00:00:05.520
So we discussed the example here.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.155
Let me come back to the diagram.

00:00:07.155 --> 00:00:09.555
So we tried this, right?

00:00:09.555 --> 00:00:10.920
Correct.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.230
So we verified this particular portion and we need to try this now.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.180
So what do I need?

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.350
How to interface? For example,

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.870
if there is 12 and I need to have one another interface

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.825
which extensity is to not make sense implements.

00:00:24.825 --> 00:00:25.950
Okay, and do that.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.945
Let's go back to our code here.

00:00:28.945 --> 00:00:31.400
We already have interface 1 and interface 2.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.429
All we need to create another interface.

00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:37.550
Okay, so go for a grana interface,

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.575
and here it can call them as a base interface and finish.

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:44.255
So now what we can do here,

00:00:44.255 --> 00:00:47.735
you can simply provide implements,

00:00:47.735 --> 00:00:51.470
sorry, a public interface.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.475
Implement, oh, my bad, my bad, my bad.

00:00:55.475 --> 00:00:59.795
Points again, I guess I forgot to tell you something.

00:00:59.795 --> 00:01:04.220
So when do interfaces implemented by a class we're going to use to implement but

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.155
one interface that trying to access to other interfaces,

00:01:09.155 --> 00:01:11.654
we can use the existence.

00:01:11.654 --> 00:01:15.520
So this extends against the interests and this

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.315
substance against the upset classes, right?

00:01:19.315 --> 00:01:21.430
So keep that in mind. It might be a little bit confusing,

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.660
but you need to practice that.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:23.440
Okay?

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.070
So what I'm gonna do, I'm going back to Eclipse now we know that right?

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.704
So can use extents.

00:01:28.704 --> 00:01:31.030
So what are the first interface, interface,

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.090
one command interface to?

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.220
So you can provide multiple interfaces using the extends keyword,

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.430
but one leaves inside the interface.

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.715
The interface, if you have a class here, you cannot do that.

00:01:45.715 --> 00:01:50.185
For example, what happen if I modify distribute class, which will not work.

00:01:50.185 --> 00:01:54.325
It can walk with only with only one. Correct.

00:01:54.325 --> 00:01:56.470
And also even though that not work,

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.640
because this an interface you're going to use extents you need to use implements.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.360
And now we learn error because it has some unimplemented methods,

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.340
so you need to provide the implementation for that.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.055
So I'm just providing control that.

00:02:09.055 --> 00:02:10.480
Okay?

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.070
So now what we can do.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.085
So this particular method,

00:02:15.085 --> 00:02:18.535
because you might see I extended my interfaces here.

00:02:18.535 --> 00:02:23.800
So whoever is implementing this particular interface,

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.315
they will be able to access the method from interface and the interface to,

00:02:28.315 --> 00:02:32.230
for example, like previously we had an exam right to say implements interface,

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.355
one interface to read.

00:02:33.355 --> 00:02:40.805
So instead, we can simply do base interface. What will happen?

00:02:40.805 --> 00:02:43.400
Nothing will happen because the base interface inside

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.910
it access interests one and interface 2.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.020
So you can throw it into it because there are times you don't want to get into it.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.225
One comma two comma three, comma volume of Eigen my six.

00:02:53.225 --> 00:02:54.350
And that kind of situation,

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.330
you can create a base interface which extends multiple interfaces inside.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.835
So you can do that.

00:03:01.835 --> 00:03:06.530
We pretty much covered most of the things about the interfaces.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.690
And there are few things which is lift because as you mentioned,

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:17.855
there are changes in the interface and no version of 89. Correct?

00:03:17.855 --> 00:03:22.595
So what MEN that we can have default and static methods.

00:03:22.595 --> 00:03:27.335
Okay, so let's implement those things also.

00:03:27.335 --> 00:03:28.055
Correct.

00:03:28.055 --> 00:03:31.055
So I'm going to create a new example in the next video.

00:03:31.055 --> 00:03:37.080
So I'm going to create an interface which contains it default under static method.
