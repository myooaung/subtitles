00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.195
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:03.195 --> 00:00:05.310
So let me create a new example again,

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.180
if we are going to use a for loop here to show you how the break and continue to

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.160
walk some break continue example.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.950
So the first thing first, in order to run the code,

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.165
we need to have a main method.

00:00:18.165 --> 00:00:20.560
So that's how a main method in it.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.130
So let's create a for loop here.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:35.020
So I want to write for 0 less than or equal again.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:43.830
So I'm printing the data value.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.775
The first we'll talk about break.

00:00:46.775 --> 00:00:50.240
Okay, so I have a conditional inside my for loop.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.930
So when the loop is reached to value fire.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.600
So what I want you to do is break it.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.280
So it'll happen.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.825
So even mention one is equal to phi i means that I is equal to 5.

00:01:05.825 --> 00:01:10.280
Then the moment the following reached $5, I become five.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.555
The five is called phi,

00:01:11.555 --> 00:01:13.280
then it needs to break the loop.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.910
So basically what'll happen is it'll break the entire loop. So what'll happen?

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.910
So I'm going to print another significant after the loop.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:27.690
So here I'm going to provide some string statement after furlough.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.810
Okay?

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.350
So basically what'll happen when our underscore,

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.390
it will print the data up to four.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.730
When it reached to fire, it will break the loop.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:44.030
So you can only see the value Abdu 0 to four because I have a limited,

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.010
okay, let me start from one.

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:54.440
Okay, so now we can see data printed one to four and then it went break everything.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.465
So because it's ignored 56789 10 because the loop has been broken.

00:01:59.465 --> 00:02:03.065
Correct? That's good. Okay.

00:02:03.065 --> 00:02:04.820
So now I can see 1, 2, 4,

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.855
and after follow-up, it came out of the loop.

00:02:08.855 --> 00:02:10.520
Okay, let's modify the condition.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.010
So instead of break,

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.065
I'm going to use continue here.

00:02:15.065 --> 00:02:16.790
So what will happen?

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.210
So when the value reached five,

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:25.775
instead of breaking, it will doesn't care what is available after this particular line.

00:02:25.775 --> 00:02:28.130
It will immediately move to the next value in the loop.

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.850
So File Save, it will not print the next value.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.520
So when i comes here, it will continue.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.950
So we are supposed to print five year,

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.930
but it won't come to this particular line because

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.395
the value has been skipped here using continue.

00:02:42.395 --> 00:02:44.030
So what happened there?

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.280
Six will come here, so then it will keep executing.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.125
So Hindi scenario.

00:02:48.125 --> 00:02:51.950
So one Do file will be print a one to four print out.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.090
But it won't be printed because when the scenario encounter five,

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.825
we would condition we would continue there.

00:02:59.825 --> 00:03:01.100
So it is more than the next value,

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.300
which is nothing but 601246 to 10. Let's run it again.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.010
Okay, so 12345 is missing here.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.540
The reason, because of the continuum.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.820
And not only in for loop,

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:25.040
you're pretty much use run all the loops. While loop.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.935
Now, January counter is equal to 1.

00:03:30.935 --> 00:03:38.450
Okay, so condition is while counter less than our ethical tenants.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.690
So then what I'm doing here inside seven,

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:48.845
the counter reached and the counter reached up to six.

00:03:48.845 --> 00:03:53.585
And the counter reached up to six.

00:03:53.585 --> 00:03:58.800
What I'm gonna do, I'm gonna do counter plus plus.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.230
And then I'm providing continue here.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.830
After that we'll print some things as well.

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.530
Counter.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.720
I'm just painting some data here.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.625
Countdown minus-minus.

00:04:25.625 --> 00:04:28.760
Can understand what the court up to.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:37.070
Hello counter one. And I'm taking that data is Abdu 10.

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.050
Then it's reached the seven.

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:46.440
I'm incrementing it tells me here.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.215
Okay.

00:04:48.215 --> 00:04:51.185
And then I'm printing the counter.

00:04:51.185 --> 00:04:53.465
And which means the value.

00:04:53.465 --> 00:04:55.745
So can it gets worse outcome here?

00:04:55.745 --> 00:04:58.670
So it will print 1, 2, 3,

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.735
4, 5, 6, 7, 6 will be missed out.

00:05:02.735 --> 00:05:04.490
Because if it is six,

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.175
we have a continuing place which had been missed out.

00:05:07.175 --> 00:05:10.760
Okay, let's run it and see what's going to happen.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:17.270
Let's now, after the fall of 123456 is missing here because,

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:23.180
because of that it is by Gropius up according to similar way you can use the break.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.380
And contrary if you want,

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.195
you can do to break also.

00:05:26.195 --> 00:05:28.910
We know that how break lower right?

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.385
So nothing will be printed after fire.

00:05:31.385 --> 00:05:35.330
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or show them our list has been,

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.070
I mean the for loop has been broken.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.320
So let's talk another important topic in the next video.
