00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.220
Hello everyone, welcome back.

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.245
In this example, we are going to talk about the multilevel inheritance.

00:00:07.245 --> 00:00:16.515
So I'm going to get an in-class multi level in exams.

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:20.940
Okay? So this is my class.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.920
Okay, let's decide what we're going to do.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.780
So multilevel means it's a chain of inheritance.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:36.104
For example, how we can see the property is inherited from my great grandfather,

00:00:36.104 --> 00:00:38.325
grandfather, my grandfather to my father,

00:00:38.325 --> 00:00:40.020
my father to me.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.980
From me to my child.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.210
That is a chain of link.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.245
Correct?

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:47.435
That isn't multilevel inheritance.

00:00:47.435 --> 00:00:48.830
So what I'm going to,

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.240
let me give you an,

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.770
a simple example, the traditional, Yeah,

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.615
For example, the animals, right?

00:00:53.615 --> 00:00:56.225
So I'm going to create the animal here.

00:00:56.225 --> 00:01:04.740
Animal. So animal class here.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.190
So I'll animal class here.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.920
So which order animal to animal will run to bitrates.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.280
I'm okay it eat.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.200
So here I'm going to provide some SOB here.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.110
So 18 or animal eating.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.930
So then what I'm gonna do,

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.255
I'm gonna get one more glass.

00:01:38.255 --> 00:01:40.500
Glass.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:50.735
Glass dog inherits because even dog can eat, right?

00:01:50.735 --> 00:01:55.730
Because what the logic which we are trying to achieve, animal content eight.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.975
So I am going to create a multiple animals here.

00:01:59.975 --> 00:02:04.685
All of them can shed the IID property.

00:02:04.685 --> 00:02:12.740
I'm so sorry, extends animal.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.030
So not only that, if it is a dog,

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.590
it has its own property also,

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.750
which means bark are make noise.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.480
So noise.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:34.710
So here I'm going to provide a dog barking.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.390
So next one is class.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.680
What else we can do that cat.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.370
Cat again extends dog.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:02.000
Or the example it is going to be.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.035
I have seen some example in some blocks.

00:03:06.035 --> 00:03:08.795
We can use Baby Doc that the examiner which he used.

00:03:08.795 --> 00:03:10.190
That's pretty much it makes sense.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.475
So baby dog extends

00:03:13.475 --> 00:03:22.140
dog and wide murmuring. Are we?

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.000
So here I'm going to print some things.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.650
So just take a look at an example.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.825
Okay, so animal is a common behavior.

00:03:35.825 --> 00:03:41.435
Okay, dog inherits the eight because I extended animal here.

00:03:41.435 --> 00:03:44.195
So dark and make noise.

00:03:44.195 --> 00:03:46.400
Correct? Which is cool.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.385
And baby Doc X and start, which means baby.

00:03:49.385 --> 00:03:52.205
It has access to make noise and eat.

00:03:52.205 --> 00:03:58.355
Because a baby duck and make noise wanted becomes mature and it can eat.

00:03:58.355 --> 00:03:59.420
Right?

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.790
The same time baby dog extends now and it has

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.805
its own way is basically animal has its own property.

00:04:04.805 --> 00:04:09.260
And here I have a dog and dog has its own map own property.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.490
And baby done is one property because I'm extending

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.980
Baby Doe extends dog so Baby Doc can access everything.

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.315
Right.

00:04:20.315 --> 00:04:22.430
And not only everything,

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.585
the Baby Doe has the capability of accessing its own property also.

00:04:26.585 --> 00:04:28.480
But dog cannot.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.695
If you had any property from Baby Doc because he is a list in the chain.

00:04:33.695 --> 00:04:36.350
So he has access to the Aibo,

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.645
all the chains, right?

00:04:38.645 --> 00:04:41.855
So here what I want to know the final class.

00:04:41.855 --> 00:04:49.890
So in her example extents what we can do or I don't want to do that.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.810
I can directly create a main method here.

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.005
So let's create a object for baby doll.

00:04:57.005 --> 00:04:59.975
So when you create a beautiful way baby dog.

00:04:59.975 --> 00:05:03.600
So baby dog is equal to nu.

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.140
So this baby dog I reference can access,

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.285
we make noise eat.

00:05:11.285 --> 00:05:15.860
Because from animal to dog,

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.390
dog2, baby down correctly.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:24.230
So this is the multilevel inheritance.

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.590
So let me try to access BD dot,

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.620
some method which is coming from the baby dog

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.855
and make noise which is coming from his father.

00:05:35.855 --> 00:05:36.755
The dog.

00:05:36.755 --> 00:05:44.615
Hence, this coming from animal.

00:05:44.615 --> 00:05:51.185
Right? Now, I can run this animal eating dog barking, beeping.

00:05:51.185 --> 00:05:52.895
Okay, so you might think,

00:05:52.895 --> 00:05:57.695
so what will happen if I create a object for dog?

00:05:57.695 --> 00:05:59.790
Dog, dog.

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:03.620
Dog can access its own metabolism.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.560
They would make noise and along with it can access,

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.515
but it cannot access anything from Baby Doll.

00:06:09.515 --> 00:06:17.340
Right. So dot-dot, dot-dot.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.670
But dog cannot access VIP.

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:25.945
My dad began VPs bottom, which is baby dog.

00:06:25.945 --> 00:06:30.550
So only child has the capability of using father's property.

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:36.220
Fathers doesn't have the eligibility of using our properties.

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:40.810
We can say even a simple volume. So you can run it.

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:44.995
So this is a pretty simple example for multilevel inheritance.

00:06:44.995 --> 00:06:49.390
The next example we are going to see multiple inheritance.

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:51.370
And I'm really sorry, it's not multiple level

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:53.980
because there is from different interfaces concept.

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:59.650
We're going to see hierarchical interface example, hierarchical hidden 106.

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:01.430
Thank you.
