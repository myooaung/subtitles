00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.055
Hello everyone.

00:00:02.055 --> 00:00:05.955
So we learned our cobalt comment in Java.

00:00:05.955 --> 00:00:08.445
So what do you mean? Comments in Java?

00:00:08.445 --> 00:00:12.390
Comments means the data which

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:17.379
we provided inside the comments which will not taken for completion.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.320
I'll show you what exactly it looks like.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.185
So basically the commutators to tell the compiler,

00:00:25.185 --> 00:00:28.710
you should not take the commented lines for a compilation process.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.520
Not only for that, we can provide some additional information,

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.600
you already matter where you can store the student information in the comment line you

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.125
can mention like so this particular method admin creator for storing them,

00:00:41.125 --> 00:00:43.910
Students information on it is calling

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.715
this particular system and it is calling the different APA,

00:00:46.715 --> 00:00:49.640
kinda the metalloids they explanations.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.425
And if you want to lead some other developers note what this method belongs to.

00:00:54.425 --> 00:00:58.289
So those kind of things you can provide in the comments.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.950
Okay, so there are three different types of comments available.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.210
The first one, it's a single,

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.640
I think you might have seen whenever I do coding,

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.290
I do lot of comments.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.280
So the first one is single line comment,

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.645
one little one line,

00:01:14.645 --> 00:01:23.175
and multiple land a separate block and documentation to provide some information.

00:01:23.175 --> 00:01:25.810
Okay, let me give you a simple example.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.820
How would the exact Let's look like?

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.390
So which matter we're going to use it.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.630
Okay, So let me create another example here.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:43.375
So comments in tower example.

00:01:43.375 --> 00:01:47.120
So let's have a main method.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.550
So the first one the first one single lane.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:00.955
Correct. So okay.

00:02:00.955 --> 00:02:09.350
Let's read the system dot I is equal to and I is equal to 100.

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:19.130
The value of I.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.375
So here what you can do is you can provide some comments here.

00:02:28.375 --> 00:02:39.250
So this variable stores the data.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.270
When you're providing this double slash,

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:49.580
which means this is going to be a single line comment.

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.845
Okay.

00:02:51.845 --> 00:02:53.945
So which will not impact anything.

00:02:53.945 --> 00:02:56.210
So if you want to keep it here also.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:04.280
Correct, or else I want to block the entire section multiple end.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.650
So what you can do use case slash star and star,

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.535
and it's less between if you want to bring in a simple way

00:03:13.535 --> 00:03:19.010
to see whatever you provide are inside this.

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.120
So everything becomes a multi-line comment.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.225
So these things are not taken for compilation process.

00:03:26.225 --> 00:03:29.790
So this is a multiple line.

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.035
I mean multiple any comments.

00:03:33.035 --> 00:03:36.920
So single n means we can use double slash multiple alignment.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:43.100
You can use a slash and a star and ends with a star slash that it has order.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:48.125
Okay, so what we need to call us a documentation, document commons type.

00:03:48.125 --> 00:03:52.320
The exam what I'm doing is hello developer.

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:59.990
So this mapper creator

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:08.704
for storing the student the tiles.

00:04:08.704 --> 00:04:15.620
So API call is from third party,

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:24.230
third party, use test client

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.755
to validate the data.

00:04:27.755 --> 00:04:29.465
Okay, So this is kind of,

00:04:29.465 --> 00:04:32.240
I'm providing some information to the another developer,

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.030
whoever is going to work on this particular module,

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.770
based on this comments, they can see it,

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.975
but this is giving me error rate.

00:04:38.975 --> 00:04:40.175
So what do you need to do?

00:04:40.175 --> 00:04:43.925
It has to provide inside the documentation comment.

00:04:43.925 --> 00:04:49.430
So let's copy this Control X.

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:55.685
So the way how in the proper documentation, comedies slash,

00:04:55.685 --> 00:05:06.150
double sharp space and star slash again, sorry, slash.

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.400
So whatever you provided here inside this,

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.500
this becomes a comment document.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.340
I mean common term for documentation purposes.

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.350
So this makes sense, right?

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:23.030
The single line is for commenting one L1 line are giving some hints.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.825
And multiline, if you want to block or hide some specific information,

00:05:26.825 --> 00:05:28.940
you can do them multiple lines.

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.390
If you want to provide some details able your methods,

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:34.955
you can use the commenter line.

00:05:34.955 --> 00:05:37.550
I mean documentation comments.

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.820
Okay, So let's see it in the next video. Thank you.
