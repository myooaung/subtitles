00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.745
Hello everyone. Welcome back.

00:00:02.745 --> 00:00:04.530
So what are we going to do?

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:09.675
We discussed a lot of things as an access modifier.

00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:12.510
Now it's time to exploit them.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.180
To prove that what I'm going to do,

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:21.165
we're going to eclipse and I'm going to create something different here. Okay?

00:00:21.165 --> 00:00:24.030
So inside instead of the project,

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.085
Let's create a simple package.

00:00:26.085 --> 00:00:29.110
So I want a package here.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:46.090
Let me do that, right click new package.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:52.810
So I'm going to call them as a pack one, back one.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:53.755
Got it.

00:00:53.755 --> 00:01:02.665
So I'm going to create a one more package which is called us package to do.

00:01:02.665 --> 00:01:05.620
And let me create a class inside my back,

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.150
one which is called as class 1.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.820
And I'm going to create one more class called us.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.400
So we're going to create a one more class instead then under the package,

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.425
which means the pack is called asset class three.

00:01:25.425 --> 00:01:30.420
Okay, let's take a look at all those classes which you create.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.785
All of them by default created the public.

00:01:33.785 --> 00:01:38.765
So if you want to make your class as a non-public unitary movement, really.

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:40.055
Got it.

00:01:40.055 --> 00:01:42.740
Okay, so now let's go back to our topic.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.825
So let's verify it public.

00:01:44.825 --> 00:01:47.120
So if you have a public,

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.705
which means anyone can access within the same package at the same time,

00:01:50.705 --> 00:01:52.235
it can be accessed.

00:01:52.235 --> 00:01:55.085
The other Baggett is asteroid can exploit that.

00:01:55.085 --> 00:01:58.160
Okay, so let's create a method here.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:06.870
So public class.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.005
One, last one, Matata, Okay.

00:02:12.005 --> 00:02:14.765
And here, just simply print a message,

00:02:14.765 --> 00:02:22.235
saying message from class one method. Got it.

00:02:22.235 --> 00:02:25.370
So let's have the same kind of matter in all the classes,

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.370
just to have a one common method.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.490
So this is going to be class three matter.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.695
Save it, go here.

00:02:36.695 --> 00:02:39.390
And this is going to be class.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.665
Okay?

00:02:42.665 --> 00:02:47.495
So we got it. Okay, So now what I'm gonna do,

00:02:47.495 --> 00:02:50.180
I'm gonna explore the public,

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.490
which means I can access instead of the package,

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.125
which means class to this,

00:02:54.125 --> 00:02:56.810
which is received in the same package and classroom,

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.465
it is available the next another package.

00:02:59.465 --> 00:03:00.635
So let's try to access.

00:03:00.635 --> 00:03:02.345
The boat. Loves us.

00:03:02.345 --> 00:03:04.850
So I'm going to create a main here.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.110
Great, So I'm going to create an object for class one.

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.045
Class one is equal to Vg is class one.

00:03:14.045 --> 00:03:15.005
Got it.

00:03:15.005 --> 00:03:19.915
So now I'm trying to access or mediate dot Last one.

00:03:19.915 --> 00:03:23.500
Okay, so let's do the same thing in the other package also,

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.700
which means that class which is available in a different package.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:28.600
Got it.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.175
So, so far, no issues.

00:03:30.175 --> 00:03:33.980
I can run the code, right? Let me run it.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.030
I can do it like this.

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.970
Okay, So message from plasmodesmata.

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.135
You're accessing class one matter. Got it.

00:03:43.135 --> 00:03:44.620
Let's go to class 3.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.790
And class 3, I'm again calling the plasma flow,

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.895
which means I can access from the same package,

00:03:51.895 --> 00:03:54.355
even from the other packages also.

00:03:54.355 --> 00:03:55.300
Okay.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:01.570
So how are you going to prove by default access modifier class,

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.115
it's not a public simple thing.

00:04:03.115 --> 00:04:08.500
Just go and remove the public and you can see the impact immediately.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.620
That last tool which will not show any errors.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.905
The reason it's in the same package,

00:04:14.905 --> 00:04:16.555
because if it is a default,

00:04:16.555 --> 00:04:24.220
what we can do access within the access within package.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.685
So Class 2, which is available in the same package, so no issues.

00:04:27.685 --> 00:04:31.375
But Class 3 which resides in another baggage.

00:04:31.375 --> 00:04:34.855
So if your class has not public, they cannot access.

00:04:34.855 --> 00:04:39.175
So that is, it isn't whenever the class is automatically created by any IDE,

00:04:39.175 --> 00:04:42.520
it will be created as a public,

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.790
okay, the moment you modify the plasma nasa default.

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.460
So we got to add it in class three,

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.205
which means my class one.

00:04:52.205 --> 00:04:54.950
It's not visible to the package too,

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.335
because that's a different package, right?

00:04:57.335 --> 00:04:59.840
So let's talk about other things like variables,

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.540
methods, and constructor in the next video. Thank you.
