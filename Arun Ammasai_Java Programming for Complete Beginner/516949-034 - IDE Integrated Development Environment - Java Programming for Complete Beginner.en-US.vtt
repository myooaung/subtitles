00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
Hello everyone, welcome back.

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.970
So far, whatever examples we have gone through,

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.495
we are reused some Notepad kind of ID.

00:00:09.495 --> 00:00:11.415
Like I use Reddit plus.

00:00:11.415 --> 00:00:17.850
You can use node bad or whatever the edit edit ID which you have.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.235
So this is time to move some proper ID.

00:00:23.235 --> 00:00:26.910
So I can keep doing a program and go to

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.300
command prompt and compile them and execute them separately.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.035
That is taking your time six times, right?

00:00:34.035 --> 00:00:36.075
So what we're going to do route,

00:00:36.075 --> 00:00:38.700
we are going to download ID,

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.705
which is called as an eclipse.

00:00:40.705 --> 00:00:45.245
So ID is nothing but integrated development environment.

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:50.030
That means we have a development area where you can develop

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.520
your code and you can execute your code that is

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.375
called integrated development. Environment.

00:00:56.375 --> 00:00:58.730
Like JRE.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.795
Jre is for runtime environment to run Java programs in the similar way.

00:01:02.795 --> 00:01:08.780
We have ID where you can compile or we can create your code and you can compile and run.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.855
Okay, so let me show you how we can download Eclipse.

00:01:14.855 --> 00:01:18.080
So if you want, you can go for your preferred idea all so what,

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.490
I'm going to use Eclipse IDE,

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.179
so I'm going to download Eclipse IDE.

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:28.220
Download. I think it's better to go for Eclipse oxygen motion.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:35.375
So Eclipse, so oxygen ID download.

00:01:35.375 --> 00:01:38.720
So here you can see them,

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.590
can always choose the first search result of him.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.215
So here you have a link called download, a 64-bit,

00:01:48.215 --> 00:01:56.219
you can click, say it will start the download.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.340
Say it will take you to another page where you can

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:08.510
choose different metals that a lot of download resources,

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:10.130
but we always go for them.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.540
The main one, click Download.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.090
And make sure if you're running into a 64-bit,

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.875
you how to download 64 or else that is a version for 32-bit also.

00:02:24.875 --> 00:02:28.280
So now it will allow you to download

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.405
the Eclipse installed Windows 64 version and you can save it,

00:02:32.405 --> 00:02:34.835
and then you can execute it.

00:02:34.835 --> 00:02:36.140
Right?

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.690
So I'm not going to save it,

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.445
try it now because I'm going to show you

00:02:40.445 --> 00:02:43.970
another way because this needs to be installed, okay,

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.105
but that is another package which you need to just

00:02:47.105 --> 00:02:51.410
extract the zip file and then you can directly use it.

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.750
Let me show you how we can do that.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.295
So if you want, you can save it.

00:02:55.295 --> 00:02:57.170
And once you say it, what do you need to do?

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.810
Just double-click the EXE and gave next,

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.520
next, next, and then finished it.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.785
So you can download a zip version.

00:03:06.785 --> 00:03:15.210
I can just go back to the same page and go back.

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:21.210
And here you have downloaded packages statistically down our packages.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.740
It will take you to, so which fortunately been done on

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.155
I1 Eclipse IDE for Java developers,

00:03:27.155 --> 00:03:29.750
and I want 64-bit for Windows.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.730
Let's click it.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.280
So once you click the download link,

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.315
it will take you to the next page where you can download.

00:03:38.315 --> 00:03:40.190
Here, you can have eclipse,

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.880
Java, Windows 32 or 64-bit.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.080
It says zip file,

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.385
so you don't need to instead,

00:03:46.385 --> 00:03:49.490
you just need to extract and you can use it.

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:53.420
Okay? So just click file

00:03:53.420 --> 00:04:01.145
and the file to download it to your local machine so that our pop-up will come.

00:04:01.145 --> 00:04:06.845
You can just click save and download it take a while.

00:04:06.845 --> 00:04:08.990
So I'm going to pass it the video for a while.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.735
So onto donor, then we're going to zoom back out.

00:04:11.735 --> 00:04:17.000
Okay, Um, so, so this might a zip file which I downloaded.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.900
So I just DO my mode of the zip file into my development folder.

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:27.035
So you can give it wherever you want and you need to right-click and extract here.

00:04:27.035 --> 00:04:29.105
So one knew when,

00:04:29.105 --> 00:04:31.460
once you click Extract here, it will,

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.700
it will extract the entire package, the same folder,

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.090
and this is extracted folder, right?

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:44.930
So you can right-click this particular eclipse and you can open the Eclipse IDE.

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.250
Okay, So the next video,

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.625
I'm going to open the Eclipse ID and I'll show you how we can use it.

00:04:49.625 --> 00:04:51.180
Thank you.
