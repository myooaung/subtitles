WEBVTT

00:04.030 --> 00:12.190
So let's see how we can create a new tap inside that we're going to display the video that we added.

00:12.270 --> 00:15.220
So that's a for insurance.

00:15.420 --> 00:22.500
And you know we'd be you sort of not function at all.

00:22.510 --> 00:35.530
On by again what going to call these when Beeville and we're going to have a field day at and on the

00:35.540 --> 00:43.960
top you can see we look almost commercial hook that manages all everything about the tax on one of these

00:43.960 --> 00:44.370
right.

00:44.420 --> 00:51.400
You know when I called these in at this a below the Francia to stay consistent with the goal that we're

00:51.730 --> 00:58.810
writing page right here and what we're going to give up priority over 11 we're going to pass one argument

01:00.090 --> 01:04.490
so right here on out that's and you can have a go.

01:04.540 --> 01:14.990
Bre Ã©cole closing the pretax and we're going about them the value of the ops just to see what is coming

01:14.990 --> 01:22.400
in these in these very well sort of a low right here and you can see that we have a rate with two positions

01:22.430 --> 01:28.630
additional information and then we have these Dayrell we're printing the brand name.

01:28.770 --> 01:34.860
Then we have a callback that callback is going to be another function that will display everything.

01:35.300 --> 01:42.400
So if we were going to remove these and I'm going to have a new That's what we're going to create a

01:42.400 --> 01:44.650
new element in the array.

01:45.370 --> 01:47.280
And we're going to create an array.

01:47.290 --> 01:54.440
We're going to pass all the information inside an array because you consume data priority in callback.

01:54.520 --> 02:05.000
So when I pass Dayrell it's going to be you think get a comma and we have the priority priority ready

02:05.310 --> 02:10.990
going at 15 and then we have the callback the quarterback is going to be there for lunch and that will

02:10.990 --> 02:20.570
display the video so we don't have a callback and we're going to have Caterina's these play media.

02:20.640 --> 02:23.220
So we need to create this callback function function.

02:23.230 --> 02:23.730
Rohit

02:26.480 --> 02:34.180
So now we have the new tab right here and I'm going to echo BVO here and I forgot we need to the right

02:34.210 --> 02:35.280
wing taps.

02:35.460 --> 02:39.710
That's what we're missing that Pat and relo rescue.

02:42.390 --> 02:46.480
And you can see we have a new BVO media here.

02:47.250 --> 02:52.460
So we need to we can play with the priority in this case for example this one is dirty.

02:52.500 --> 02:54.090
So we got something bigger.

02:54.370 --> 02:55.310
Right here.

02:56.860 --> 03:03.810
And you can see the on the bottom 20 you can play with the values to play the video in the exact place

03:03.810 --> 03:04.710
that you went.

03:05.630 --> 03:11.270
But for example you can see here you can see that we can be here and it's pretty nice.

03:11.330 --> 03:14.470
So this function is communicating with this one.

03:14.480 --> 03:17.090
I'm going to change this to 50 This way we can.

03:17.270 --> 03:22.090
This way we can show the video by before and it's finished.

03:22.520 --> 03:28.910
So there's not all the pros with her video sort of going out.

03:29.130 --> 03:37.980
Well let's bring the value for his Global Post again and then we're going to be the other variable equals

03:38.200 --> 03:42.410
to get a feel and then we're going to read the value from the view.

03:42.480 --> 03:45.860
It's going to be really with pass balls.

03:46.060 --> 03:55.630
And in this case for example looking at the map with the brain there there you are a red light.

03:55.890 --> 03:58.210
You know you see something like this.

03:58.210 --> 04:01.220
This is the syntax.

04:01.420 --> 04:04.860
And you can see that we have they were right.

04:05.010 --> 04:06.220
So this is looking nice.

04:06.420 --> 04:13.110
So first Not all the videos will not all the pros will help us or even have an if statement if in case

04:13.180 --> 04:19.550
we have a video we're going to display the video if not we're going to ignore these We're going to have

04:20.150 --> 04:31.210
Echo BVO controls where we're going to use the Timofei be the player that we have in and most in the

04:31.330 --> 04:32.970
and browser.

04:33.080 --> 04:42.350
And then what happened at Sauers Sowers is Selsey and inside single quotes the world's goods to concatenate

04:42.370 --> 04:46.900
the ready we're going to be the angry Kunkle of these races.

04:47.170 --> 04:49.600
And then Ecko and goes the video

04:53.990 --> 05:02.180
so you can save these and reload and then you can see that we have the video and of course you can add

05:02.430 --> 05:10.580
in the attributes for example out to play so reload this video is going to play by the different body

05:10.620 --> 05:15.040
of course when they use it because this is going to happen like this.

05:15.240 --> 05:20.140
And then they are going to start reading the Wii the description and everything.

05:20.670 --> 05:28.480
So it's a good idea for me a thing that the user should play these should play the scene in the browser.

05:28.860 --> 05:34.230
So you can play cricket and you can see they have a video here for additional information or for the

05:34.230 --> 05:36.700
rebels.

05:36.710 --> 05:42.520
So this is the nice in this case this example doesn't have the full of the prologue.

05:42.560 --> 05:50.410
If I click here on the pro you can see that this is a Canton area empty right here.

05:50.490 --> 05:51.360
And we can copy these.

05:51.360 --> 05:57.060
For example just to just to test everything of the and reload

05:59.780 --> 06:03.480
so you can see we have become good and we can play with the priority now.

06:03.740 --> 06:11.850
But something like then below maybe five because in this this time is just in the priority of 10 so

06:11.850 --> 06:12.840
we can't reload.

06:12.880 --> 06:20.100
Now we have the video get description additional information and the reviews and so on we have the red

06:20.100 --> 06:21.610
arrows.

06:21.670 --> 06:23.500
So now this looks more complete.

06:24.650 --> 06:26.200
And we have a new review.

06:26.850 --> 06:36.250
And again that's up in another pro can like on products and that's up and they essentially view

06:39.060 --> 06:47.090
and you can see that we have Bedia here but we don't have any BVO so we can again make and model make

06:47.090 --> 06:47.930
us smile.

06:47.990 --> 06:56.760
If a statement were not something you like Global Post we're going to call BS and most everything from

06:56.760 --> 07:06.390
here so engaged that we have some in case that we have the video we're going to have on tap in case

07:06.450 --> 07:07.140
we don't.

07:07.300 --> 07:13.620
We're going to ignore that and Eve and then we're doing the taps something like this will work.

07:13.900 --> 07:20.520
So relo right here now you can see that we don't have the video in case that we have video like these

07:22.340 --> 07:24.340
is into this play the video there.

07:24.530 --> 07:32.030
So you can have more tabs really really easily use create a new element in the array and use these three

07:33.870 --> 07:40.150
these three pieces of the original information with the title the priority to display the order in the

07:40.150 --> 07:46.660
taps and also the callback function that will display the content in the top.

07:46.900 --> 07:48.240
That's something really helpful.

07:49.670 --> 07:55.350
So what Almazan with this let's see how you can work with these guns in the next video.
