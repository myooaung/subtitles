00:04.210 --> 00:07.680
So let's continue working with these design everything from kids.

00:07.830 --> 00:15.730
I think it's fine by the if we open the website design you can see that we have these text in this image

00:16.680 --> 00:23.290
the idea of these is only to give a message to enforce the mentors that were trying to get with this

00:23.350 --> 00:24.270
website.

00:24.490 --> 00:27.650
Spoil yourself with these high quality prose.

00:28.120 --> 00:29.910
And I'm going to show you how to do that.

00:30.220 --> 00:31.560
It's going to be really simple.

00:32.550 --> 00:41.080
The previous example I think was more complex than these when so feels when I open my door I'm going

00:41.080 --> 00:48.570
up and down on them and here on really nice back I'm going to reichlich and she'll be fine.

00:48.570 --> 00:58.190
So he's going to open up the corner probably and refuter you can create an item you for that these and

00:58.230 --> 01:03.450
you will find a banner at the back so you can copy these in page right here.

01:03.730 --> 01:10.090
So this soon to be a more static content but that's something really common as so in a lot of Wordpress

01:10.090 --> 01:13.240
Web site we're going to have biner

01:15.570 --> 01:19.290
in Bandhan we miss that.

01:19.670 --> 01:27.990
Of course you can make more or more of this great descriptive So again I'm going out and simple show

01:27.990 --> 01:38.210
hooks and show actual cooks and we have the bunch of these right after the best sellers is what I want

01:38.210 --> 01:39.750
to bring in this manner.

01:42.540 --> 01:43.320
Over.

01:43.670 --> 01:51.870
Page and the best selling prose are using our priority of 17 into either bigger or number of these ladies

01:51.900 --> 01:58.060
in next to this bestselling sort of like a spa.

01:58.630 --> 02:07.590
Boy you manage then we have another action and then we're going to use page and then we use the function

02:09.620 --> 02:12.890
inside single quotes and then we have 80 something like that.

02:13.340 --> 02:18.000
So let's add something like Echo manif here.

02:19.390 --> 02:21.670
Save these and remove their hooks

02:24.750 --> 02:27.110
scroll to the bottom and then you can see the banner here.

02:27.940 --> 02:30.230
So we're going to add the.

02:30.430 --> 02:37.930
And I think I'm going to make these clothes a bit dark so we can write Morrish the man and then I'm

02:37.930 --> 02:40.560
going to deep set something like Banner's.

02:40.570 --> 02:48.530
Boy you and yeah see how you're going to make these.

02:48.540 --> 02:50.580
Maybe you can add another that deep is going to be

02:54.040 --> 03:01.440
columns for the other one is going to be columns 8 something like that.

03:01.460 --> 03:02.740
And then we can use.

03:02.910 --> 03:03.810
Yes I see.

03:03.830 --> 03:10.410
So we can display the match of course and I'm going to show you how to do that in the next videos.

03:10.550 --> 03:17.270
We're going to see how you can use advanced custom fields the most popular custom fields in commerce

03:17.300 --> 03:18.800
and work in wordpress.

03:18.990 --> 03:26.820
They say it's available that you can use also in combers so square going have a beach but that it go

03:26.930 --> 03:29.520
get this shit directory.

03:29.630 --> 03:30.500
You're right.

03:32.010 --> 03:38.410
Get that shit directory you are right this is the function that we went to use.

03:38.740 --> 03:46.890
Then we are there for Shlash and then we use AMG then we have a banner that cheapish sameas and up in

03:46.890 --> 03:50.900
the front in and you can see we have the image.

03:50.950 --> 03:56.450
So next we're going to have maybe I'm going to use a NH area right here or something like that.

03:56.590 --> 04:00.020
It's going to be for you yourself

04:03.080 --> 04:06.480
with these high quality products.

04:07.470 --> 04:12.880
It's the same these up and again and you can see that we have something like this.

04:12.880 --> 04:20.040
Of course we need to add some CSSA to make this look exactly like we need to.

04:20.360 --> 04:27.460
So in the next we are going to finish this example can I write some C assess to finish this section.
