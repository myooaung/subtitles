WEBVTT

00:00.380 --> 00:05.370
In this way they were when I started WordPress when I started WordPress locally so we're going up on

00:05.370 --> 00:12.990
this website will WordPress that or Inverkeithing you can click on get the corpus Sophron keep your

00:13.000 --> 00:16.100
own that WordPress WordPress.

00:16.570 --> 00:18.790
This is the current version of wordpress.

00:18.790 --> 00:25.150
Hey maybe when you watch these cars maybe this nobody is going to be a little different but you don't

00:25.150 --> 00:25.790
have to worry.

00:25.780 --> 00:29.840
The steps are the same when installing WordPress.

00:30.190 --> 00:38.600
The meet up and this in finden and going to be using a local server that is called ma'am ma'am.

00:38.650 --> 00:45.020
It contains BHB my sequel which are needed to create that WordPress site.

00:45.190 --> 00:46.720
There are some different options.

00:46.720 --> 00:53.340
For example you can also use the local bay flag with DC and their local server that you can install

00:53.710 --> 00:56.920
is free and is available in different platforms.

00:57.200 --> 00:58.510
Also ma'am.

00:58.610 --> 01:02.780
It is this is the Web site you can install in Windows or Linux.

01:03.070 --> 01:10.960
And finally we have one server that we have a server that supports Apache BHB My sequel and these three

01:10.960 --> 01:12.700
options are the best that you can find.

01:13.590 --> 01:15.370
So next I'm going to be using man.

01:15.390 --> 01:23.940
As I said before so let me open the manifold there and you need to open this issue see dogs for there.

01:24.300 --> 01:27.470
So I really downloaded the place file.

01:27.540 --> 01:35.670
So let me drag this into the folder and let me decompresses this file so you can see the file it is

01:35.670 --> 01:36.520
called WordPress.

01:36.520 --> 01:43.480
I'm going to call this one of all or the praise is going to be called newcomer's.

01:43.660 --> 01:51.520
We need to create a database led me up in map and you can click it on Ben Webster page so the we have

01:51.580 --> 01:52.940
tools and then you copy it.

01:53.000 --> 02:02.080
May mean in the case that you install it locally by flywheel and you can skip this this step because

02:02.680 --> 02:06.730
your locale is going to do everything for you.

02:07.270 --> 02:12.790
So here I am on the beach in Miami and you click on to speech of mine and Procul you can create the

02:12.790 --> 02:15.420
database so periculum databases.

02:15.940 --> 02:23.480
And I'm going to call this one Arrhenius on the score here for the newcomers.

02:23.620 --> 02:27.730
Give me a quick you know create and the database is going to be empty.

02:27.730 --> 02:31.910
Wordpress is going to create different tables and everything.

02:32.140 --> 02:37.920
So you can see that I in the ME open the docs you can see a call for their work.

02:37.960 --> 02:39.860
So we need to open these in the Sarette.

02:40.450 --> 02:44.050
So from here you can remove everything in the.

02:44.130 --> 02:49.820
You can get the localhost and the port and I'm going to go commers.

02:50.340 --> 02:55.730
So here then the and for a kid you can install WordPress.

02:56.120 --> 03:02.650
So this is going to be that page and you select the language so you don't continue in.

03:02.830 --> 03:04.580
Let's go there.

03:04.640 --> 03:12.100
We call this one Catalina's back on discardable you see if you're using mamm their username root and

03:12.200 --> 03:13.720
the password is had sort of.

03:14.060 --> 03:19.400
In the case that you are using one server they use her name is Ruth and the password should be empty

03:19.880 --> 03:21.290
like this.

03:21.290 --> 03:23.780
In my case he is going to be rude.

03:23.980 --> 03:26.010
And then when I leave the false right here.

03:26.330 --> 03:33.590
So put it on submit and run the installation program when I give this website the names of what I call

03:33.600 --> 03:41.090
this one Caterina's back on online Istar and then when I create a username and password.

03:41.290 --> 03:50.590
Since we're a working locally I'm going out on a napkin and of course this is not very secure but this

03:50.710 --> 03:53.950
this is only for the development phase of this project.

03:54.010 --> 03:59.080
So when you upload these into a real server you need to change the username and password for something

03:59.420 --> 04:00.200
more strong.

04:00.220 --> 04:08.530
So let me click on Compare let me add any email is going to work for these phase of developments so

04:08.530 --> 04:11.250
let me have you start WordPress.

04:11.290 --> 04:16.840
So this is going to create the database and it's going to run the different scripts and is going to

04:16.880 --> 04:24.950
start WordPress locally so click it on logon and Fromkin we can have admin anatman.

04:25.190 --> 04:31.790
So I'm in an admin in both fields and you can see a couple WordPress when I refer to the section as

04:31.790 --> 04:38.120
the back in the also called they were pre-Saddam in and if you click on this section right here on this

04:38.120 --> 04:45.040
route on the top on the left corner you can see the front end of your side.

04:45.040 --> 04:48.600
So I'm going to refer to this section as well as the front end.

04:48.950 --> 04:53.430
So this is going to be the back end this is going to be the front end and that's all well back in or

04:53.480 --> 04:53.700
out.

04:53.700 --> 05:03.180
I mean I mean these museums these are little so we install WordPress in the next video we're going to

05:03.190 --> 05:04.720
install newcomer's.
