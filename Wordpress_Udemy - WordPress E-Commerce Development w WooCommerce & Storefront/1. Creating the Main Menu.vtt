00:04.200 --> 00:07.630
So let's create a menu in a store front.

00:07.940 --> 00:10.820
The staff room provides three different menus.

00:11.810 --> 00:18.770
And what are going up in the back of Wordpress for a kid in the Knesset like Iberians and menus.

00:18.800 --> 00:26.210
You can also access to the menus in their customize that you can pick it up customize and for a kid

00:26.200 --> 00:29.380
you can select menus and you can create the menus.

00:29.440 --> 00:34.770
In my case I went Laddie's in the back in because I'm going to show you how to add something very nice.

00:35.570 --> 00:39.210
In the in your website in your store.

00:39.350 --> 00:45.540
So let's create a few dozen menu of menu here you can see we added your menu below.

00:45.560 --> 00:49.280
But you can see we have these empty and we have created a new menu so you can click here.

00:50.280 --> 00:54.730
And what we're going to call these when main obligation some denied that of course you can name these

00:54.750 --> 00:57.600
whatever you want and create a menu.

00:59.030 --> 01:05.360
So now we have created the menu and you can see at the bottom we have three different display locations.

01:05.480 --> 01:07.840
These three belong to a storefront.

01:08.100 --> 01:14.720
So it's important for example if you decide to use a storefront and then you register the menu and then

01:14.720 --> 01:20.520
you decide to change to a different bad theme or even a different theme.

01:20.600 --> 01:23.130
These are going to be different.

01:23.170 --> 01:29.690
So keep in mind that so we Karadi the main navigation thing we need to attach these to the primary menu

01:29.750 --> 01:34.360
in the store from in theme or in or child.

01:34.560 --> 01:39.990
If you remember inheriting all the functionality from the Valentinian to a child.

01:40.060 --> 01:42.580
So we have access to these three menus.

01:42.910 --> 01:45.250
And of course you can create more menus.

01:45.280 --> 01:54.960
In my case it Indri enough to achieve that and that we want to make say the menu angrezi you create

01:54.960 --> 02:00.720
a menu in say the location and you're going to start menu items.

02:00.860 --> 02:08.320
What are going to get a mule in from it and then I send them home and then going out the menu knowing

02:08.450 --> 02:10.370
where we're going to make their own laws.

02:10.650 --> 02:12.230
And you can see here in the sand.

02:12.630 --> 02:21.540
We have come about as a star contact cause you're going to wow those blog contact us shop and we're

02:21.540 --> 02:24.110
going to add these to the menu.

02:24.140 --> 02:26.860
You can see how many welcome us.

02:26.960 --> 02:31.450
BLOCK Contact Us and shop you can preorder these really easily.

02:31.450 --> 02:34.240
You can only click here and rack the.

02:34.310 --> 02:42.250
Now you can see we have some that we're going to save these An I'm going to close these Greedo the front

02:42.250 --> 02:50.670
end and you can see we can welcome you how about us shop blog and contact us.

02:50.690 --> 02:53.420
So for example if you want to change the tags that we have here.

02:53.450 --> 02:54.700
Welcome.

02:54.770 --> 02:59.930
You can click here on this dango that is put into the bottom and click on the navigation label you can

02:59.930 --> 03:06.490
change these to come of course you can change this to whatever you want but you're not easy to come

03:06.620 --> 03:16.570
and save and reload again an agency we have come we've had about us shop blog and contact us.

03:16.610 --> 03:18.350
I want to create another item.

03:18.350 --> 03:28.170
The menu is going to be called the My Account menu and right after the shop I'm going to add these save

03:28.170 --> 03:34.070
the menu and wrote and they see my account in your country here.

03:34.080 --> 03:42.280
It's going to take you to their account page and so for example if you want to make their account of

03:42.400 --> 03:47.660
item of the shop you can only click here and there are to right.

03:48.110 --> 03:53.620
And you can see if we have this dotted line so you can continue that into the right.

03:53.640 --> 03:58.030
And when you see that change mean you can say sobeit them.

03:58.260 --> 04:02.450
So say the menu again and reload.

04:02.490 --> 04:05.900
So now we have a shop and you can see we had a triangle pointing to the bottom.

04:05.940 --> 04:10.690
And if you over here you can see I will keep my account.

04:10.730 --> 04:12.200
So this is a way out.

04:12.230 --> 04:16.900
This is where you have pages but you can answer that post so you can see at the moment.

04:16.910 --> 04:20.280
We only have the Kellow were those our custom things.

04:20.300 --> 04:29.920
Let's say that you went to your Facebook page you're going on Facebook or Twitter or YouTube any web

04:29.920 --> 04:33.680
site you can be it can be added here on the custom links.

04:33.740 --> 04:37.620
They were has categories these categories Milans to the polls that we have here.

04:38.030 --> 04:40.920
And then we have and they will commerce and points.

04:41.390 --> 04:47.750
So I think it's going to be nice if you come over here and you can see for example the categories that

04:47.750 --> 04:48.640
we provided.

04:48.890 --> 04:55.620
So for example if I open brokes categories and you can see we have four categories right here.

04:55.860 --> 04:57.150
So it will be nice.

04:57.150 --> 05:00.580
For example if I go over here and I can see those four categories right.

05:01.350 --> 05:05.090
Well that feature is kited in commerce.

05:05.130 --> 05:12.650
You can be easily added into your menus right here so scroll to the top and get on the right you will

05:12.650 --> 05:17.870
find these clean options begin and you will find product categories right here.

05:17.870 --> 05:23.470
You can click here and close the screen options and a new menu is going to be added right here.

05:23.480 --> 05:31.140
We have broke categories so for a kid who cannot be or is going to have all the categories you can select

05:31.140 --> 05:31.840
all.

05:31.940 --> 05:37.210
Now you can see where they got to go read or check and you can add to the menu.

05:37.330 --> 05:46.430
So how can those guides in PBF concretes and Torchwood's and we can pre-contract to reorder these into

05:46.430 --> 05:54.880
our shop so something like these will work and say to many and reload.

05:55.410 --> 06:02.310
And you can see if I covered up now I up they pick up the bodies from our brokes.

06:02.350 --> 06:09.130
So for example to something candle's and we don't have any candell So we're going to try and guide some

06:09.130 --> 06:09.630
PBF.

06:09.640 --> 06:11.200
You can see we have these guys.

06:11.510 --> 06:18.190
And in fact the killer in shop is going to play all day all the pros that we have of course at the moment

06:18.190 --> 06:19.760
are Istar Cass.

06:20.050 --> 06:23.170
Very few brokes bother with the pass of the cause.

06:23.170 --> 06:28.870
We're going to continue adding more and more so the more problems that we have the better this is going

06:28.870 --> 06:30.690
to look at the moment it looks at it all.

06:30.690 --> 06:32.960
MT But that's fine.

06:32.950 --> 06:39.030
But to continue doing so in the next video we're going to see the other menus.

06:39.230 --> 06:45.430
So for example you can click here and you can see that we have a secondary menu and a handheld menu.

06:45.590 --> 06:49.470
So let's continue working with the secondary menu in the next video.
