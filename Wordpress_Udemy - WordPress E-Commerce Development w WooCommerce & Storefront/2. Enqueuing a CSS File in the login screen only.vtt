WEBVTT

00:04.500 --> 00:06.730
So let's start working with this project.

00:06.940 --> 00:11.590
First we're going up and the code for the child theme that we create with this course.

00:11.750 --> 00:19.100
I'm going to add a comment here that is learning styles and we're going to write a function to load

00:19.120 --> 00:28.010
and study shit only in the screens who will not function on Greenspan underscore Leuven style is open

00:28.010 --> 00:29.640
and closed parentheses.

00:30.080 --> 00:36.230
And it clearly says they we're going to hook these action.

00:36.350 --> 00:43.360
And normally if you have a ready experience working with it will come with team development.

00:43.520 --> 00:49.080
You use a hook that is called the Lupi on cute scripts.

00:49.160 --> 00:52.390
In this case we went to law this time she had indeed screen.

00:52.610 --> 00:57.730
So this one is called log in underscore on cue scripts.

00:58.010 --> 01:00.910
Then we pass the name of the function that we have right here.

01:03.300 --> 01:11.410
And we kind of start adding all or Aristarchi adds and justifies what going to load and stylesheet so

01:11.420 --> 01:14.010
we use the repeat on queue style.

01:14.340 --> 01:22.060
If you want a low damaske find you use to be on cueist click like we're going to call these monkery

01:22.060 --> 01:25.550
nest by logging in a comma.

01:25.760 --> 01:33.290
We use Get a sheet directory you are right because we are working with the child team and then we're

01:33.290 --> 01:40.690
going to create a new folder is going to entry called login and we're going to identify code logging

01:40.700 --> 01:41.670
that's us

01:45.060 --> 01:55.180
so one of the slash login slash login that's Jasus and let's open the log that says least make us mad.

01:55.240 --> 02:06.050
There's a body bag and Encore cornflower blue save these up and the browser and you can see that we've

02:06.060 --> 02:09.870
had the color the background color display.

02:09.900 --> 02:12.530
So this is working fine.

02:12.570 --> 02:13.960
We can't remove these.

02:14.280 --> 02:18.070
And in the next video we can start working with these files.

02:18.860 --> 02:20.740
To customize the Longinus screen.
