00:03.990 --> 00:11.580
So let's continue working with the variations so you can see if I make the change to Brown you can see

00:11.580 --> 00:13.130
that there is no prize.

00:13.410 --> 00:16.830
And as you can see what happens with this blog is unavailable.

00:17.250 --> 00:24.250
So once you have the variations right here this will act as a total independent Bruhl.

00:24.690 --> 00:32.610
So you can expand these and Raphael for example you can see it's regular price and the sell price so

00:32.610 --> 00:36.190
you can set different prices for different colors.

00:37.100 --> 00:43.880
So let's say for example that the Jell-O well is going to be $5 or something like that.

00:45.200 --> 00:49.030
Scrotal me maybe that red Zentrum then.

00:49.310 --> 01:00.570
And so that being then the green again then Brown then the tender blue name is the best selling.

01:00.610 --> 01:07.750
Maybe we can charge a little more for these kind of 20 and I sell price of 15 something like these.

01:08.230 --> 01:09.680
So save the changes.

01:11.360 --> 01:20.910
And that's to say they up or clicking on up they never go and you can see we have from five to 15.

01:21.060 --> 01:28.710
So this is out of the prices so you can see here on the variations you can handle everything for each

01:28.990 --> 01:30.720
Bagration that you've got.

01:31.370 --> 01:39.220
So for example in the case of the Royal Navy is going to be 15 in the case of the red is going to eat

01:39.230 --> 01:40.160
them.

01:40.720 --> 01:43.370
Angello it's going to be $5.

01:43.680 --> 01:51.240
And it's really common especially for clothing and shoes online stores they charge different prices

01:51.450 --> 01:56.410
for different sizes of the clothes and not so for different colors.

01:56.640 --> 01:57.610
That's really common.

01:57.620 --> 02:02.260
Now you can see how you can have these and this looks great.

02:02.260 --> 02:04.770
You can see so we're changing the match on the live.
