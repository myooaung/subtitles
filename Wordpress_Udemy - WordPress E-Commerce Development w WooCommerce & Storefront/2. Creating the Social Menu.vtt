00:04.070 --> 00:09.920
So let's see if you can work with the secondary menu the secondary menu is a great menu if you're one

00:10.280 --> 00:13.240
of our social media icons menu.

00:13.520 --> 00:14.900
What are the next week you don't use.

00:14.900 --> 00:20.790
New menu and that selection menu and create the menu.

00:22.470 --> 00:28.620
And we're going to you can see we have a secondary menu at iteration so we're going to use a custom

00:28.620 --> 00:29.510
links.

00:29.700 --> 00:34.580
And for example if you look at our Facebook page you can copy the Facebook link.

00:34.590 --> 00:36.660
It's going to be something like Facebook that come in.

00:36.660 --> 00:39.790
They add something like an I.D. right.

00:40.110 --> 00:46.710
Another new face that come for this example but you can copy or grab that link from your Facebook page

00:46.830 --> 00:51.690
and page right here on going on Facebook and at the menu.

00:52.080 --> 00:54.720
Again we're going to add another one.

00:54.780 --> 01:00.470
So for example if you have a Twitter profile you're going on Twitter that come slash your profile.

01:00.870 --> 01:04.350
In this case I'm going to keep this empty.

01:04.530 --> 01:08.590
They want to add you to for example.

01:08.820 --> 01:11.840
And if you have a YouTube channel you can page they you are right right here.

01:11.880 --> 01:15.510
And finally we're going to have another one called Instagram that come again.

01:15.510 --> 01:16.750
Same goes for you here.

01:16.770 --> 01:22.470
You can copy grab the link from your social networks and page right here.

01:23.420 --> 01:28.130
So now you can see we have four items in the menu and you can add them or you can have whatever do you

01:28.130 --> 01:28.880
want.

01:29.390 --> 01:31.920
And you can say the menu.

01:32.060 --> 01:39.820
So let's open the front and and Google and you can see we have Facebook Twitter and Instagram if you're

01:39.990 --> 01:43.050
looking in the site and you can see that we have these icons right here.

01:44.160 --> 01:50.160
And on the materials I'm going to add these social menu styles.

01:50.610 --> 01:59.260
So for example you can go you can grow and copy everything up and decided that CSA is and you can page

01:59.270 --> 01:59.980
right here.

02:01.370 --> 02:05.730
So this will Styne decent.

02:06.210 --> 02:13.140
The secondary navigation and it's going to look for the social networks and it's going to print and

02:13.160 --> 02:17.290
I can so you can see we have a bunch of different options.

02:17.290 --> 02:30.190
We have the April Facebook made to YouTube WordPress Dombo they Foursquare Google Blogs LinkedIn Pinterest

02:30.480 --> 02:32.460
or a lot of options.

02:32.860 --> 02:40.560
So now it's up in the front end of her Web site and we can reload and you can see that we have the icons

02:40.560 --> 02:41.280
right here.

02:42.410 --> 02:48.260
So again one of the really nice things about using these WordPress menus is that you can preorder really

02:48.260 --> 02:48.680
easily.

02:48.680 --> 02:55.160
So let's say that you went on YouTube as the last item you can reorder these say the menu and open the

02:55.160 --> 03:02.210
front in and now you're the last item in the menu that's something very nice and you can see these icons

03:02.210 --> 03:04.640
looks look really really nice.

03:05.750 --> 03:10.570
So what Almazan with the other.

03:10.780 --> 03:11.200
If I may.

03:11.200 --> 03:13.410
This is Malate.

03:13.470 --> 03:18.250
You can see it on the menu you can see that we have a bigger menu right here.

03:18.660 --> 03:22.860
So the last menu that we have available is a fancier menu.

03:23.130 --> 03:29.120
This is the menu that is going to be displayed when you visit the Web site in a mall with the Bise.

03:29.490 --> 03:31.530
So let's review the menu in the next reading.
