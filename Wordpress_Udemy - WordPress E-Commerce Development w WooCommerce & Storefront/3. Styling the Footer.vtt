WEBVTT

00:04.020 --> 00:06.660
So let's continue working with these Web site.

00:06.960 --> 00:12.530
The next section is going to be the four of you can see for example the headlines of the four different

00:12.550 --> 00:16.810
colors and whether there are different opinions what are going on.

00:16.800 --> 00:18.620
Right click here any spec these

00:22.410 --> 00:29.630
you can see that they are in Niaspan and then we have these widget Dayrell and then we have the widget

00:29.680 --> 00:31.220
decks and everything.

00:31.240 --> 00:37.110
For example I think that we can target these with widget anguage at idle.

00:37.200 --> 00:43.700
So we're going up an already thought atom and I'm going to scroll to the bottom right here may some

00:43.710 --> 00:47.470
space in the wall we're going to have four inch

00:51.700 --> 00:57.200
and I'm going to widget that glass and then we have this widget on

01:01.310 --> 01:05.430
and we're going to use and reheated for the same.

01:05.450 --> 01:16.680
What do you see in black from family is going to be Lato sans serif and we're going to use fonde wait

01:17.810 --> 01:21.950
nine candidate the color red is going to be different.

01:22.190 --> 01:31.620
If you take a style guide it's going to be these one and the font size going at one point for him.

01:31.640 --> 01:38.040
So save these and RIDO the front in and you can see how we can measure.

01:38.060 --> 01:46.310
We need to also transform uppercase will make these uppercase all the letters and you can see better

01:49.020 --> 01:49.650
looking better.

01:49.650 --> 01:55.040
In this case this one is in two lines because we have categories here and we have product categories

01:55.790 --> 01:58.670
and 6:42 are the name of the menu.

01:58.860 --> 02:06.280
So let's continue and for example you can see that these icons in the menus are imprinted in my case.

02:06.330 --> 02:10.540
In my case I don't like how they look.

02:10.540 --> 02:19.270
So we're going to remove that and you can see they are printed on the before so we can use something

02:19.270 --> 02:21.520
like widget

02:24.380 --> 02:27.940
we can use the select of these with the broad categories

02:31.930 --> 02:34.750
and then we have these cat item in them before

02:40.200 --> 02:42.750
and what is going on display none too high.

02:42.760 --> 02:48.140
Those reload and you can see now he's looking better.

02:48.160 --> 02:52.510
I think right here we have some by the same margin and that's fine.

02:52.520 --> 02:53.430
You can see the the.

02:53.430 --> 02:57.220
We have lots of these Madian we need to remove that control.

02:57.300 --> 03:05.400
So we're going inspect these in this case they have these main navigation and all of these men knew

03:06.100 --> 03:06.990
are going on.

03:07.810 --> 03:17.090
A copy of the copy command basing we're going to remove these this is going to be menu and I think it's

03:17.240 --> 03:24.630
ready also to have food right here this way with a mess in the future with when we are in there the

03:24.630 --> 03:33.760
rest of the of the widgets so we come in line and you can see we have a menu item a menu item and then

03:33.940 --> 03:41.120
before these play on something like this don't snow you can see it's working better.

03:41.120 --> 03:45.170
And so you want to remove these self-manage manual in my opinion.

03:45.220 --> 03:52.610
I don't like how it looks and my you know I don't want to bring in these so many.

03:52.940 --> 03:56.860
So if I just pick these you can see a menu item cost children.

03:56.870 --> 03:57.950
We can copy these

04:01.740 --> 04:06.500
and we can have for menu item cost children.

04:06.520 --> 04:12.480
And then you have these northerlies we can tell you where and display none.

04:12.700 --> 04:23.800
We can also use these so we can cut these coma based and remove these go RIDO these.

04:24.290 --> 04:26.930
And you can see the menus looking better.

04:26.930 --> 04:34.440
Finally the final judgment that we can make this home and if things like this is going to use the Coran

04:34.460 --> 04:44.290
menu them so we can copy the selector and that Foret right here for and color white.

04:44.880 --> 04:50.500
So save these and reload again and you can see this looking better.

04:51.380 --> 04:59.140
So we can call it collapses and space right here and that's happening because we have only added day

04:59.300 --> 05:02.890
for calling 1 two and four with Skip the three.

05:02.920 --> 05:04.990
So you can have another way just right there.

05:05.990 --> 05:14.570
So finally we have this section on the bottom and I'm going up in my later years you can see that we

05:14.570 --> 05:20.720
have these research so we can use for resetter.

05:21.230 --> 05:26.590
And I think is another be united in their food because we added these after the food for

05:30.140 --> 05:33.830
so you can see the food it is right here and they have these rosette.

05:34.370 --> 05:35.030
But that's fine.

05:35.030 --> 05:37.070
We can add something like research.

05:37.820 --> 05:46.330
And then we can use background color and copy these codes with a color and then if they can keep saying

05:46.400 --> 05:50.630
we need to add some piling on the top and on the bottom as well on our body.

05:50.900 --> 05:59.460
When Im in syrup and then we're going out Risser in the paragraph and the functions you can see they

05:59.490 --> 06:09.630
have a neat weather pattern up here so we can target these easier in close up and it's going to have

06:09.630 --> 06:11.870
the color right here.

06:13.290 --> 06:21.330
And black it's going to be a color and it's going to be white black and we're going to use the phone

06:21.330 --> 06:27.980
for Amedee lotto with a fun size of 1.2 M.

06:28.130 --> 06:32.350
And finally and you can see that is not the case.

06:32.380 --> 06:36.200
Now you can reload with these.

06:36.440 --> 06:45.290
And I didn't something what I'm missing is it takes a line center so you can see it in the sandy center.

06:45.310 --> 06:50.890
So this is the C Ss and let's reload the front in.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.760
So you can see he's looking better but we're missing something here.

06:54.780 --> 07:01.890
If I inspect this paragraph by the for commerce in the state that says they have these margin on the

07:01.890 --> 07:03.290
bottom so we can fix that.

07:03.300 --> 07:10.740
And so the conclusion really is black where when and have a different color and muddy bottom zero and

07:10.760 --> 07:11.890
what are going to change the color.

07:11.900 --> 07:20.720
We're going to use this one from the style guide and see these and relo the front end like an now is

07:20.720 --> 07:26.910
going to be the final piece and you can see this looking better.

07:27.840 --> 07:31.750
Maybe we can make this a little bigger and the Muller went M.

07:32.050 --> 07:33.150
Yes something like that.

07:33.180 --> 07:38.540
I think this is the correct way of bringing these Forder.

07:38.560 --> 07:40.360
So this is looking great.

07:40.420 --> 07:42.930
And with these we finish the home page.

07:43.150 --> 07:48.940
Now the home page is really really de-friend of what used to be.

07:49.000 --> 07:56.350
If you remember we have these coupons we have a new menu we have this social network we have this special

07:56.350 --> 08:00.710
section coming from Atlanta custom fields we're printing these categories.

08:00.710 --> 08:04.360
We're printing these brows from the home kit category.

08:04.360 --> 08:06.180
They will have this new in on sale.

08:06.280 --> 08:07.630
Best seller.

08:07.630 --> 08:16.160
These men such as who are print in some blog entries we can wear it out so subscriptions to the newsletter

08:16.620 --> 08:18.520
and our cost of for.

08:18.620 --> 08:19.750
This is looking great.

08:20.070 --> 08:22.610
And there is more to come in the next few years.

08:22.650 --> 08:28.620
We're going to continue our style need each section of this Web site and I'm going to show you more

08:28.620 --> 08:29.530
hooks.

08:29.910 --> 08:38.220
And one more call that you can draw on to customize your own and stores with with cucumbers in a storefront.
