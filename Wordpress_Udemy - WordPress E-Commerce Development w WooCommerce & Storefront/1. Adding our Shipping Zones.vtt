Snowcap some for a little know restore in this video start working with the shipping methods that we

00:10.550 --> 00:13.310
have available in combers.

00:13.320 --> 00:20.510
So first I'm going to click it on all comers and from here on when I click on settings from here it

00:20.510 --> 00:24.320
will find a dive that is called Shippen and you can click here

00:27.160 --> 00:31.900
and you can see the second option is shipping options so what are going to open these in a note that

00:34.760 --> 00:37.010
so here you can make some adjustments.

00:38.670 --> 00:44.420
And for example the one with shipping is a good idea to have these check.

00:44.490 --> 00:48.520
So make sure you have these enable and the other ones are.

00:48.540 --> 00:48.920
OK.

00:48.930 --> 00:49.990
So the full.

00:50.390 --> 00:55.830
So why don't I start working with the shipping sands and what are going to create a new ship in some

00:55.830 --> 01:04.380
sort of the market here shipping some and from here I'm going to name these something like United States

01:06.650 --> 01:13.300
and from here you can click and you can select the countries where this ship in Spain is going to apply.

01:13.640 --> 01:20.500
So for example in my case I went to create a shop in sun for the United States and other shipping south

01:20.510 --> 01:25.300
for Mexico and Canada and another ship and so on for the rest of the world.

01:25.730 --> 01:28.150
So we're looking for the United States right here.

01:28.150 --> 01:36.210
So I am a United States man and I said look these when ever I'm going I say changes then I'm going to

01:36.420 --> 01:40.600
be kid again and be in Sons and what are going to create another one.

01:41.700 --> 01:49.700
I'm going to call these North America and from here I'm going to Solich Ghana and I'm going to sound

01:49.700 --> 01:50.970
like Mexico.

01:51.320 --> 01:56.780
So all the customers that we have from Canada and Mexico we're going to that ship in metals right here

01:58.030 --> 02:05.040
say the changes in Finally if you if we can make on shipping sands you will find that we have location

02:05.040 --> 02:08.000
not cover by your other songs.

02:08.010 --> 02:10.590
So this is going to be the ship and so on for the rest of the world.

02:10.720 --> 02:15.930
You know we have our ship in song for the United States and then we have another one from Canada in

02:15.930 --> 02:16.680
Mexico.

02:16.860 --> 02:19.420
And this one is going to be for the rest of the world.

02:20.880 --> 02:26.720
So in the next video we're going to start working with the United States ship and so on and we're going

02:26.720 --> 02:30.220
out on a ship in metals and prices and everything.
