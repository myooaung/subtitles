00:00.360 --> 00:02.010
So this is a really common question.

00:02.020 --> 00:09.350
What combers and Shopify why you have to choose commerce of Shopify.

00:09.410 --> 00:15.710
So first with combers one of the advantages of using commerce is that you don't have bare transaction

00:15.710 --> 00:16.780
fees.

00:16.820 --> 00:23.390
Once you start with commerce and you start selling products the only fee you have to pay is for example

00:23.390 --> 00:26.890
to Pay-Pal or pay you or the stripe.

00:27.050 --> 00:32.540
The platform that you decide to use to process the payments in newcomer's there are no monthly plans.

00:32.690 --> 00:37.610
So the progun is free you can instead of Wordpress and then instead with commerce everything is going

00:37.610 --> 00:42.870
to be free in combers not percentage their transaction.

00:43.130 --> 00:51.440
The number one item in this list and a did one may is see like the same but a Shopify charges you better

00:51.440 --> 00:56.430
transaction and also charges you better percentage better transaction.

00:56.540 --> 00:58.410
And this is something really important.

00:58.580 --> 01:04.480
Commerce's stock cost around twenty ten to twenty thousand dollars so that's a lot of money.

01:04.880 --> 01:07.410
So let's see the shop if I basic plan.

01:07.610 --> 01:11.040
The basic plan goes to twenty nine dollars per month.

01:12.170 --> 01:14.420
It doesn't really matter if you are selling or not.

01:14.420 --> 01:17.610
You have to pay twenty nine dollars per month.

01:18.140 --> 01:23.580
They also charge two point nine percent their transaction.

01:23.600 --> 01:32.640
This means that if you're selling at 100 dollars or look you have to pay 2.9 percent of that $100.

01:32.670 --> 01:41.570
So you have to pay to Shopify two point nine dollars for this transaction and also have to pay additionally

01:42.140 --> 01:44.980
30 cents for that transaction.

01:46.120 --> 01:51.460
So let's say that you are selling three $300 items in a month.

01:51.910 --> 01:55.030
That means you have to pay that twenty nine dollars.

01:55.330 --> 02:00.610
So you have to pay eight point seven dollars but you have to pay these three times because you made

02:00.670 --> 02:06.430
three transactions and that's so you have to pay 30 cents.

02:06.430 --> 02:16.730
Three times because you made three transactions so you're Shopify beer goes from $29 to sixty six dollars

02:16.960 --> 02:17.810
in a month.

02:19.040 --> 02:27.810
Anger says around nine dollars in advance glance of Shopify you have to pay two hundred ninety nine

02:27.810 --> 02:29.180
dollars per month.

02:29.430 --> 02:32.280
Again selling or not you have to pay this every month.

02:32.310 --> 02:37.620
In Shopify the percentage Bertran section only says maladie in this plan.

02:37.690 --> 02:40.330
So you got to pay 2.4 percent.

02:40.500 --> 02:45.420
And so you have to continue paying in the sense Burton action.

02:45.840 --> 02:54.720
So let's say that you said one candidate $25 items in a month that means you have to pay two hundred

02:54.720 --> 02:57.100
ninety nine dollars for the month.

02:57.630 --> 03:03.020
And also you have to pay the percentage which in this case is 60 cents.

03:03.300 --> 03:11.320
But you have to pay 60 cents 100 times and so you need to pay the sense 100 times.

03:11.560 --> 03:19.540
At this point your sales are of twenty five hundred dollars and you shall be Fabyan is it three hundred

03:19.570 --> 03:21.090
eighty nine dollars.

03:21.100 --> 03:24.140
So this is almost 50 percent of your cells.

03:24.430 --> 03:25.770
So that's a lot of money.

03:25.780 --> 03:26.740
You're too candid.

03:26.740 --> 03:32.490
Ninety nine dollars plan goes from 299 to defend it every night at the end of the month.

03:33.890 --> 03:40.790
So another example again that transplant two hundred ninety nine dollars per month two point four percent

03:40.790 --> 03:45.300
poultry section in that sense birther's action.

03:45.350 --> 03:52.210
So let's say that in this month you Captain Dowson transactions and you're selling $25 products.

03:52.580 --> 03:55.560
This means that in a month you have to pay well.

03:55.660 --> 04:01.580
The two hundred ninety nine dollars you have to pay these are the ones that are 60 cents.

04:01.580 --> 04:04.670
Now you have to pay these ten thousand times.

04:04.820 --> 04:12.350
So this means you have to pay $6000 in fees for the percentage transaction.

04:12.350 --> 04:17.890
And so that 30 sense you have to pay these 10000 times.

04:17.990 --> 04:27.140
So basically your assets are of $250000 in your shop if I can see is higher than $9000 or so that's

04:27.140 --> 04:28.050
a lot of money.

04:28.880 --> 04:34.400
And this $9000 is really close or pretty close to the cost or the commerce Web site.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.090
So this is something really important.

04:37.120 --> 04:38.280
There should be fees.

04:38.320 --> 04:44.430
It's something that you have to show to your client and you can use these fees to combines your client

04:44.600 --> 04:46.830
to hire you and the rest of the break.

04:47.100 --> 04:52.460
Well commerce is a better option if your client needs a Noank than platform.
