00:04.370 --> 00:12.100
So lets out the post right here so we can have some block bows to explain the board on our Web.

00:12.320 --> 00:19.810
You can see that we have some products on the page but we also want to play some blog entries.

00:19.820 --> 00:23.870
This is going to be a really common theme in your life.

00:23.920 --> 00:31.700
How the this had really come on the need for the clients a lot of them to to display some blog entries

00:32.660 --> 00:36.860
where they are talking about the products and everything.

00:37.370 --> 00:44.980
So let's see how we can print the repro reposed in the bottom of their website right here before they

00:44.980 --> 00:46.090
spoil yourself.

00:46.100 --> 00:50.410
S. So let's open this and remove this killer word.

00:50.410 --> 00:52.960
This is the sample pose that comes with wordpress.

00:52.990 --> 00:54.190
We need to create another one.

00:54.230 --> 01:03.020
When I click on that new and are going to use some of the images that we cover here and we're going

01:03.020 --> 01:07.370
to use cells so they loaded up some web site to create some content so what are going on.

01:07.400 --> 01:13.500
So for example I'm going to add Sikh's perhaps and generate the lot in Epsom.

01:13.630 --> 01:21.370
I'm going to copy these and let's add something like space is content and I'm going to cut some of the

01:21.400 --> 01:29.840
content right here to show these as the title then on the right we're going out on categories and here

01:29.860 --> 01:35.530
on the DAX let's add something like skin care or something like that.

01:35.900 --> 01:38.120
Then we're going to add a new feature rematch.

01:39.530 --> 01:41.450
Something that we can use.

01:41.890 --> 01:43.230
Yeah one of these may be

01:46.510 --> 01:47.820
said the future rematch.

01:47.820 --> 01:53.030
And we're going to publish these three.

01:53.040 --> 01:57.630
So next we're going to create another one we need to clear at least three entries and I'm going to read

01:57.630 --> 02:00.030
all these to create different content.

02:00.170 --> 02:01.090
Copy everything.

02:01.940 --> 02:02.940
Bay's right here.

02:03.100 --> 02:08.730
And that's got the ladies copy and paste.

02:09.060 --> 02:15.320
They are going to add something is messages in this category.

02:15.430 --> 02:24.180
And again we're going to use Methodius and we're going I don't know very much we can use these women

02:24.180 --> 02:25.190
for example.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.600
And said the feature the matching what we're going to polish these

02:34.390 --> 02:39.550
and you to have another one and let's create another.

02:39.610 --> 02:49.380
I mean takes raciness we're going to copy everything and Basie's And then when I got the title so we

02:49.380 --> 02:51.270
have some months back it's

02:55.780 --> 03:02.340
this isn't the place for the content something that we can show before adding the actual content.

03:03.900 --> 03:16.420
So when I use this much and said the feature they match and publish so if I click on post now you can

03:16.420 --> 03:19.170
see that I have the from post.

03:19.180 --> 03:26.100
So in the next video we're going to ride the fashion that will display these in the bottom of the website.
