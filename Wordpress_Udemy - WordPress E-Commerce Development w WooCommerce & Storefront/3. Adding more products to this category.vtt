00:04.230 --> 00:06.650
Let's do more brokes.

00:06.790 --> 00:16.510
So they come kids category or going up in the back and in the pros and then you have a new bro.

00:16.710 --> 00:18.930
And in this case we want to use

00:23.870 --> 00:25.270
maybe the soap.

00:25.270 --> 00:26.180
Number five

00:30.260 --> 00:33.190
and that's these when five at number 10 so what are we going to

00:36.750 --> 00:44.300
probably you know or Broglie's soon to be these one at about a bar soap then we're going to have the

00:44.370 --> 00:45.410
description

00:48.010 --> 01:01.480
the president is three and it's going to become Keets and we need to have some brothers that's individually

01:01.480 --> 01:04.880
much of what are going to apply the match and to be number five.

01:20.540 --> 01:21.830
And that's what going on.

01:21.860 --> 01:24.550
Another one is going to be number three and I think

01:30.180 --> 01:36.720
so it's going to be the other one the one based thing we're going to compete is this clip shown

01:42.770 --> 01:43.280
page right.

01:43.280 --> 01:45.320
These are the prices.

01:45.380 --> 01:47.930
Twenty eight.

01:48.190 --> 01:49.870
Again we're going to use some kids

01:52.620 --> 01:56.190
nap said the brother.

01:56.440 --> 02:05.500
You mentioned it with this one and I got up to brother so maybe you were going to use these essential

02:05.500 --> 02:06.230
oils.

02:09.020 --> 02:10.570
His mentor was better.

02:10.650 --> 02:14.640
Yeah maybe this one essentially is the golden ratio.

02:14.650 --> 02:16.590
So we're going to copius in new

02:19.240 --> 02:26.390
ways racier are going to copy these men up as the race and race.

02:27.470 --> 02:37.970
Brice's 50 and so it's not that that since show you.

02:38.900 --> 02:42.220
And that and then what are going to be the match

02:44.760 --> 02:46.850
so I this one is better.

02:49.840 --> 02:56.090
So broke and publish so we come out it three pounds right here.

02:58.020 --> 03:01.650
Now you can see the most brothers that you have definitely.

03:01.650 --> 03:03.030
This story is going to look better.

03:03.030 --> 03:09.630
So what went out of the front in and now you can see that we're printing four different brokes in the

03:09.640 --> 03:15.240
next video we're when I finish these charcoal to display exactly what we want.

03:15.280 --> 03:20.860
We can pass several parameters to these charcoal and I'm going to show you some of them in the next

03:20.870 --> 03:21.480
video.
