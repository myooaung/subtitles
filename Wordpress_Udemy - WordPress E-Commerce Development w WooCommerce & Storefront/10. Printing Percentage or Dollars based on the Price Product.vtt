00:04.080 --> 00:11.540
So let's see how you can mix these two shows that we have added so it's not going to it like everything

00:11.540 --> 00:12.030
from here.

00:12.030 --> 00:18.960
And then when I click on the lecture imbue sorry eddied and the comments well when.

00:19.050 --> 00:25.820
And Sean Spicer underscore these play Sabin's.

00:26.040 --> 00:29.170
And again I'm going to pick up these prize Ambrose

00:33.070 --> 00:35.880
and we're going to use these feel the same feel for race here.

00:37.160 --> 00:40.050
We're going to use a lot of the code that we have here.

00:40.520 --> 00:45.890
So for example we are only running this function if there is how you come so why don't I steal the code

00:45.890 --> 00:46.610
for you.

00:49.440 --> 00:50.500
So we kept.

00:50.550 --> 00:58.260
There is a sale price on these but then we're going to have an invariable regular on the price.

00:58.380 --> 01:01.670
So it's going to be the regular price without any discounts.

01:02.170 --> 01:03.980
And we're going to have trouble.

01:04.230 --> 01:05.720
And we're going to read.

01:05.780 --> 01:09.500
They get regular price.

01:09.610 --> 01:15.470
So these would rate on the regular price for example in this case going out at all 50 and what are going

01:15.470 --> 01:26.070
to Yves their regular price is bigger than $100.

01:26.160 --> 01:32.220
That means that when you went to these these you see the dollars.

01:32.490 --> 01:40.140
So for example if the price is to $200 and we are selling they broke at $100.

01:40.170 --> 01:46.330
We want to bring in say $100 because that that's more meaningful for the user.

01:46.410 --> 01:51.100
Saving $100 than saving 50 percent.

01:51.110 --> 01:54.590
So in this case what when bring the section on the top.

01:54.640 --> 01:58.550
So we're going to copy these in page right here.

01:59.070 --> 02:00.320
And then going to the comments

02:03.320 --> 02:04.460
something like this.

02:05.280 --> 02:09.300
And then if the price is lower than $100 what is going on these

02:17.480 --> 02:19.880
remove these.

02:20.090 --> 02:26.120
And you can see that we are thrown in the prices right here in case that we will have that surprise.

02:26.120 --> 02:28.480
We need to retune the price anyway.

02:28.520 --> 02:30.180
It's all on price right here.

02:30.310 --> 02:35.210
And yet I hear a cop in the field there about didn't change the function so we're going to change these

02:35.810 --> 02:37.980
and say this and reload.

02:38.060 --> 02:46.090
So now you can see for example if we have our brother $50 and the best pitcher price is $10 is $10 we're

02:46.100 --> 02:48.280
printing say 3 percent.

02:48.410 --> 02:54.160
So we're going to click here on every product and we're going to change the price.

02:54.390 --> 02:55.580
Scroll to the bottom.

02:55.980 --> 03:06.130
You don't want to add one hundred and fifty dollars and let's sell price of 60 sort of one of these

03:07.680 --> 03:14.070
and reload and now you can see say $90 was working perfect.

03:14.160 --> 03:21.040
So we're going to click on shop and for example you can see that we have saved $90.

03:21.540 --> 03:26.850
And this one we have say only 9 percent that's working exactly as we're looking for.

03:26.900 --> 03:34.380
This is going to be really helpful in your story that Bill being one for your business to tell the users

03:34.740 --> 03:41.640
that they are going to display something significant for them so they continue working in the next video

03:42.120 --> 03:43.490
improving these Web site.
