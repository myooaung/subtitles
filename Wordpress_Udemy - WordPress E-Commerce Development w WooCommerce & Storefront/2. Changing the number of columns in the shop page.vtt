00:04.510 --> 00:08.990
So let's see if you can control the number of columns hitting the shop page.

00:09.420 --> 00:15.850
What do I gain up in their functions that beats being where when I come and change their number of columns

00:17.590 --> 00:23.640
in shop and so these will work for the audience archive pages.

00:24.010 --> 00:27.330
So we're going to be a fun show on when I got back.

00:27.750 --> 00:32.990
Shub underscore Gollum's ng what have an opposite columns.

00:34.760 --> 00:36.140
And what do I feel there.

00:36.150 --> 00:41.580
I feel that this behavior is going to change just in a few.

00:41.870 --> 00:48.830
And what do I use up shop Gollum's and then where I command as the second one.

00:50.450 --> 00:54.520
Then where a comma has a priority of 20.

00:54.560 --> 01:00.010
So for example in this case we can presume for columns if you say these.

01:00.230 --> 01:02.960
And then when I beg these fears.

01:03.530 --> 01:07.600
You can click here in one of these and you don't they like dogs.

01:07.670 --> 01:14.180
So for example in the dead when you can see that we have this class called Last using this last class

01:14.840 --> 01:19.910
newcomer's that removes the margin on the right you can see the is one on the second one has these orange

01:19.940 --> 01:22.570
area that did Windows and Kabat.

01:22.740 --> 01:30.820
So let's save these and reload it for on in and then you can see that we have some problems in the in

01:30.820 --> 01:31.250
the grid.

01:31.240 --> 01:35.670
But for example if I inspect these now they're for broke.

01:35.670 --> 01:41.650
It's going to have the last the last that is right here but you can see it for broke.

01:42.090 --> 01:48.170
So we need to make some changes as this year's is and I'm going up in this state that's Jasus and we're

01:48.190 --> 01:51.370
going to have four columns

01:54.520 --> 01:59.390
in this shop Bache and we're going outside main.

01:59.490 --> 02:03.650
This is the selector columns 3 this is the columns.

02:03.660 --> 02:05.110
This is the batting element.

02:05.130 --> 02:08.420
For example if I scroll this one right here the.

02:08.550 --> 02:14.840
And then we're going to continue we're going to have that UL brokes and then the like with the arrow

02:15.010 --> 02:17.070
back and life size limit.

02:17.070 --> 02:22.170
That's what a lot of movies up and I'm going out with 20 percent.

02:23.230 --> 02:30.540
So you can say these hand-wrote and then you can see that we have four brokes in each column.

02:33.760 --> 02:37.080
So it's up to you how many columns are you want to display.

02:37.090 --> 02:47.250
So for example if you wanna make a change to two columns you have to check which with is the best to

02:47.250 --> 02:56.620
please play this correctly and make it they went out for and read all.

02:56.670 --> 02:59.560
So I'm happy with this result in the next video.

02:59.560 --> 03:03.970
Let's see another call that we can draw on in the shop page.
