00:05.200 --> 00:08.410
The stuff you can see that we have these Starbright here.

00:09.290 --> 00:11.670
And this is that means our feature broke.

00:11.870 --> 00:18.120
So for example let's say that we want to show we not just like there only feature brogues So let's see

00:18.140 --> 00:28.570
for example that I want to feature these when and these one these one it's another one these

00:32.180 --> 00:42.170
we have three of them more or and five and most of the pros are a feature because we have a few brogues

00:42.550 --> 00:47.230
that you can see if we have these five broke at the moment we're printing them products.

00:47.230 --> 00:49.330
You can see here on their functions.

00:49.550 --> 00:50.470
We have these.

00:50.580 --> 00:56.280
But let's see how you can print only the probes that have the starfield.

00:56.300 --> 01:05.100
So here you go to is and what going got back Square-D and we're going to use an array right here.

01:06.720 --> 01:10.380
My name we have I know that every.

01:10.630 --> 01:20.370
And we're going to add taxonomy the taxonomy for these is called a brotherhood underscore b c b d.

01:20.460 --> 01:21.980
Then we are comma.

01:22.090 --> 01:30.340
Next is the field the field is going to be the name we are name and then we have that there's that there's

01:30.340 --> 01:40.820
sort of this is called feature into the feature comma and finally the operator a check that actually

01:41.330 --> 01:48.680
they are using it in the they are in any case when you feel this is that we have something like these

01:48.890 --> 01:54.930
now you can't blow the front in and you can see that we have very few products.

01:57.160 --> 02:03.350
You can see that all the problems that fab These now are showing this stuff.

02:03.580 --> 02:07.250
So let's say that I went to feature these cars.

02:07.600 --> 02:11.230
Well seeing white collar and the ropes we can click here.

02:14.420 --> 02:15.590
And up in the front in

02:20.480 --> 02:22.960
and you can click here and there you can see right here.

02:23.860 --> 02:26.820
So let's say that they guy do we want to remove that from the feature.

02:26.830 --> 02:27.830
We can click here.

02:30.890 --> 02:38.670
And of the front and again and then you can see that we remove that.

02:38.680 --> 02:42.280
So this is working nice in the next video that's out there.

02:42.350 --> 02:47.630
Last year says you can see cover a lot of space right here and also the name of the products is really

02:47.640 --> 02:50.270
big.

02:50.460 --> 02:52.850
And now we're going to use this example.
