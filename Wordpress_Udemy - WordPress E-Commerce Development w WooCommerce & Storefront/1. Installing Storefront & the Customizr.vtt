WEBVTT

00:00.500 --> 00:02.460
From here we're going to start working.

00:02.460 --> 00:04.230
We had a storefront.

00:04.550 --> 00:09.070
We already installed a storefront when we installed combers.

00:09.110 --> 00:16.220
So basically you only open appearance then teams and then you activate the storefronts you don't activate

00:16.730 --> 00:19.910
when Starfleet is activated you can create your own customized.

00:19.910 --> 00:22.560
And this is going to open the cost of my server.

00:22.650 --> 00:28.940
So for example you can click from the first auction site in the know where you can click here to select

00:28.990 --> 00:29.600
a logo.

00:29.810 --> 00:35.320
And in the course materials for these aspecific be you you will find these low that DNG.

00:35.330 --> 00:40.580
So let me open these if you already have on a star if you have a logo for your company you can upload

00:40.630 --> 00:46.520
these on Salek and I'm going to skip cropping and this is going to pick up.

00:46.940 --> 00:48.100
They will match.

00:48.140 --> 00:49.590
You can see we have something like this.

00:50.350 --> 00:54.990
And you can see now we have the dillo into the heather.

00:55.210 --> 01:01.050
For example you can see we have the site title and the dotted line and then we remove the logo to show

01:01.050 --> 01:09.240
you these indicates that you didn't apply the law to me and reload these options that are in line to

01:09.240 --> 01:19.300
for example you had something like the online store for Catalina spa.

01:19.320 --> 01:25.250
So this is going to update the tag line that we have here on the bottom below the site name and let's

01:25.250 --> 01:27.530
say that you went to remove our latest are right here.

01:27.840 --> 01:30.800
So you can customize these D.S..

01:30.810 --> 01:32.330
You can see it's kind of nice back.

01:32.610 --> 01:33.860
And I said takling.

01:34.290 --> 01:35.790
Let me apply the law again.

01:35.790 --> 01:43.800
So let me click here and select skip cropping and this is going to apply the law once you apply the

01:43.800 --> 01:44.260
logo.

01:44.280 --> 01:46.500
The next is going to be normal.

01:46.510 --> 01:47.880
So let me click it on publish.

01:47.910 --> 01:51.400
So this is going to save the changes that we are doing.

01:52.010 --> 01:54.430
You can change the color of the header.

01:54.660 --> 01:57.290
So for example you can have a background color right here.

01:57.540 --> 02:01.290
So you can have this color right here.

02:01.340 --> 02:04.050
This is going to apply a background color into the carrier.

02:04.410 --> 02:07.750
So let me open the second file that is called the style guide.

02:08.070 --> 02:14.710
Let me copy this color I'm going to be using these.

02:14.820 --> 02:22.450
So it's going to apply this color in that so you can either text or call or I'm going to keep this the

02:22.450 --> 02:22.740
full.

02:22.740 --> 02:24.180
So let me go back.

02:24.350 --> 02:29.290
For example you can change the color of the links in this options.

02:29.360 --> 02:38.450
The links for the hair the Mi-Go back to go back and then we have the forward.

02:38.670 --> 02:43.580
So clicking on for her in a scroll to the bottom you will find the food right here you can see it.

02:43.620 --> 02:47.660
These imported these products doesn't really matter.

02:48.650 --> 02:53.100
What is going on continue working with these.

02:53.140 --> 02:58.150
So we have the background color I'm going to be using again me my my palate you can see we have these

02:59.350 --> 03:00.250
dark color.

03:00.280 --> 03:01.340
So then me.

03:01.420 --> 03:04.690
So it is not a color for these.

03:04.770 --> 03:08.880
This is going to play a lot of color and that's why we have this heavy collar cutting core is going

03:08.880 --> 03:10.840
to be the screens that we have here.

03:10.880 --> 03:17.320
So in this case I'm going to play white and we have a tax cut and I'm going to play white in the link.

03:17.320 --> 03:17.770
All right.

03:17.780 --> 03:18.580
Who's going to be white.

03:18.590 --> 03:21.580
Well honestly like white in all of these.

03:21.780 --> 03:24.460
So you can see everything he's white in there.

03:24.460 --> 03:29.520
So let me go back then we have the background color uncle or uncle or Furbies.

03:29.950 --> 03:39.550
I'm going to say like like Ray nothing really dark and like Ray Clerihew then we have their From here

03:39.550 --> 03:41.640
you can go to a top.

03:41.680 --> 03:46.810
This is going to be the Kevin color for the sexual rescue for example you can click here and then me

03:46.810 --> 03:54.760
again up in my ballot I'm going to select the scholar and then make a nice this is going to change the

03:54.760 --> 03:57.980
color for these screens getting of the.

03:58.420 --> 04:04.890
And that's why we have scholars in this case is going to be a like this is going to play up like all

04:04.920 --> 04:05.960
right here.

04:06.320 --> 04:10.300
And that's why we have the corner for buildings at the moment we don't have any links.

04:10.310 --> 04:12.500
Well we have the links right here.

04:12.650 --> 04:16.540
So for example you can change the color so I'm going to show you how to change these With see assessing

04:16.560 --> 04:21.640
the comedians because I'm going at some extra hair styling.

04:21.650 --> 04:28.240
I'm going to change the color because the pink color that I have is different to this one so let me

04:29.270 --> 04:29.880
add this quarter.

04:29.880 --> 04:35.670
So this is going to apply this in all the links that we have in the website and then going out go back

04:35.700 --> 04:38.140
racier then we have the boot.

04:38.140 --> 04:40.110
So let me scroll to the bottom.

04:40.110 --> 04:43.540
We have this vote on so here you can change the color for the buttons.

04:43.600 --> 04:45.960
In this case we're using again this pink color.

04:45.960 --> 04:48.700
So let me add background color right here.

04:48.730 --> 04:50.470
She's going to apply the background color.

04:52.110 --> 04:57.380
You can see change a change so there those were going to change.

04:57.390 --> 04:59.740
So it takes quite honestly or dance.

05:00.010 --> 05:02.830
The color is going to be it's going to be white.

05:02.890 --> 05:09.160
So you can see we have some these when I go back then we have the law for the law.

05:09.190 --> 05:12.630
Let me publish these changes for the law.

05:12.670 --> 05:18.840
We need to up in a different sort of crop up shop on the up in the first option.

05:19.800 --> 05:26.160
If you're lying you can see that we have this product on the left and we have these cyber on the right.

05:26.550 --> 05:31.380
So from you can select the law oversample if you want to add this cybering to the left you can click

05:31.380 --> 05:31.920
here.

05:32.130 --> 05:37.300
And this is going to Strub the are they're going to push they cyber to the left and they contend it's

05:37.320 --> 05:37.820
going to be true.

05:37.830 --> 05:38.450
Right.

05:38.780 --> 05:39.530
So it's up to you.

05:39.530 --> 05:42.220
Which design you see.

05:42.270 --> 05:52.450
Well you like most of these then we have the brother page here you can stick it at the car and by the.

05:52.450 --> 05:54.650
I think I'm going to leave that for Troy here.

05:54.910 --> 05:56.840
And also we have menus.

05:57.040 --> 06:00.430
So in a storefront you can create three different menus.

06:00.520 --> 06:07.260
One is the primary menu which is one name we have the secondary menu which are going to be you.

06:07.300 --> 06:10.500
We're going to use these for the social menu.

06:10.570 --> 06:12.820
And finally we have our menu.

06:13.120 --> 06:17.000
When we the visitor is using the mobile device.

06:17.470 --> 06:21.130
So this is the of help menu you can see we have a shop right here.

06:21.130 --> 06:24.950
So these handheld menus are going to be the menu that is going to be display for the mobile device so

06:24.970 --> 06:27.090
for example you can either extract.

06:27.250 --> 06:34.320
Let me add this about Page let me publish these they can see we have shop in about and you can reorder

06:34.320 --> 06:37.530
these items had about and shop.

06:37.920 --> 06:43.080
And if you go back you can see we had the primary menu and the secondary menu at the moment you have

06:43.080 --> 06:45.890
only my account which is going to be this right.

06:46.200 --> 06:51.750
I'm going to use it when I use these to add the social navigation with some social icons rescue is going

06:51.750 --> 06:52.810
to be really nice.

06:53.700 --> 06:54.720
Let me go back.

06:54.750 --> 06:59.740
We have widgets in this already cast on several we get.

06:59.840 --> 07:03.620
For example the section on the right is called the Saldivar.

07:03.620 --> 07:10.480
So Rocky you got search reassembles recent comments you can remove these for supper movies or this one

07:10.540 --> 07:14.900
also the archives for wordpress.

07:14.940 --> 07:17.280
We did a little removal of these.

07:17.490 --> 07:23.700
And you can either way yet when you enable commerce and stuff from will it will create several different

07:23.700 --> 07:24.720
widgets.

07:24.810 --> 07:32.010
So you got something like a field that products by my price range and we can feel that the prices of

07:32.010 --> 07:39.750
the products for example you can see these when these 16 dollars than me make these two are right in

07:39.750 --> 07:45.750
this broke is going to be with you don't feel that this problem is going to be easy to remove from the

07:45.750 --> 07:50.220
screen because I'm filtering the products by the price so this is very nice.

07:50.280 --> 07:55.950
We did in the upcoming business I'm going to show you a different widgets that we have right here.

07:56.090 --> 08:02.180
So we also have these four columns one two three and four this and this one is right here.

08:02.360 --> 08:04.130
So you can see at the moment we only have two.

08:04.190 --> 08:08.440
So you're going to be hearing a good thing about the site is the section right here.

08:08.520 --> 08:13.260
You can click here and you can change the text which you use.

08:13.290 --> 08:14.100
Yes.

08:16.250 --> 08:26.130
And then start for you then me course you can see when you make the changes in the editor is going to

08:26.130 --> 08:26.500
be.

08:26.540 --> 08:27.010
Right.

08:27.030 --> 08:28.790
So this is something very nice.

08:29.030 --> 08:31.620
That's a half or column we've had these finals.

08:31.650 --> 08:37.880
Can you cancel a change this information and you can see we have only two options.

08:38.000 --> 08:45.340
If you have another one that say that you and do outside the products and list of products maybe you

08:45.340 --> 08:48.610
want to have only two prongs on the bottom and then you have two products.

08:53.020 --> 09:03.430
In the two products because they added 23 so it is going to display two different products and you can

09:03.430 --> 09:04.290
have another one.

09:04.290 --> 09:09.590
So for example let's say that you want to have this one that is race imbue brokes is going to create

09:09.610 --> 09:16.300
another we get it we haven't been any broke so let me open one of these.

09:16.400 --> 09:22.820
Now you can see we have their recent products that may have maybe that risk in the products is going

09:22.820 --> 09:28.110
to be refined so make you don't polish and then you can see we have the widgets.

09:28.240 --> 09:36.580
So it's really nice that storefront Casagrande all these the widget songs sundried very nice.

09:36.710 --> 09:39.360
You can on the homepage settings.

09:39.580 --> 09:42.250
I'm going to leave that before the company is going to be welcome.

09:42.580 --> 09:44.400
And the post-paid she's going to be the block.

09:44.530 --> 09:45.880
So this is fine.

09:46.420 --> 09:48.740
And that's what we have this commercial for example.

09:48.770 --> 09:50.690
This is something we're nice also.

09:50.850 --> 09:52.540
We have these Istar Norris.

09:52.800 --> 10:03.990
So for example we can have something like use the coupon do any off to receive 20 percent of

10:07.190 --> 10:13.160
in your card torrents that I.

10:13.270 --> 10:16.970
And I think I can at 20 percent like this.

10:17.300 --> 10:19.370
And from here you can make a list or not.

10:19.370 --> 10:25.620
So this is going to display the master sheet on the bottom and you can see we can use a coupon 20 of

10:27.840 --> 10:31.860
maybe laid off 20.

10:31.900 --> 10:39.840
So when someone besides this Web site they are going to see this notice at the bottom something similar

10:39.850 --> 10:45.630
for example if you said that you the Web site they have this Barg when they cabaret when they are running

10:45.640 --> 10:53.510
some promotions that make you go back to the catalog from and you can and let me go to a top.

10:53.650 --> 10:55.200
You can see we got Prospero's.

10:55.200 --> 11:00.580
For example you can change these two two and this is going to this beta brokes are you going to have

11:00.570 --> 11:03.410
four brothers and he's going to play four in that row.

11:03.700 --> 11:05.260
This is something really nice.

11:05.280 --> 11:07.700
This is something that can be achieved as a with God.

11:07.950 --> 11:13.430
But the stuff makes these even easier than me at three products.

11:13.710 --> 11:15.900
I'm happy with the number three.

11:15.900 --> 11:18.840
Let me go back so we can produce images.

11:18.840 --> 11:23.370
I'm going to leave the phones because I really like the size of how they look and that's what we call

11:23.370 --> 11:28.920
the Cecco the chicken is going to be really important because for example let's say that you don't want

11:28.920 --> 11:35.220
to display the company name so you can have company name and you can have hidden this impuls is going

11:35.220 --> 11:38.030
to be here and from day one.

11:38.610 --> 11:43.470
Or let's say that you want to display these and you went to make these required.

11:43.560 --> 11:47.940
You can see we have required ending we have the sign that says that this feed is required.

11:48.130 --> 11:51.620
And we have different options radian broken you cannot Sobol right.

11:51.820 --> 11:54.000
The privacy policy right here.

11:54.160 --> 11:56.010
So this is something really nice.

11:56.140 --> 12:00.220
They added this in the latest versions and it works really really well.

12:01.600 --> 12:05.170
And finally we have the additional CSSA for you you can add some CSSA.

12:05.440 --> 12:10.720
I don't recommend that you save see assessing D.S. I recommend that you see assess what are going to

12:10.720 --> 12:12.760
create a child for this theme.

12:12.810 --> 12:16.670
We're going to go right to see who says there's a thing this is a better option.

12:16.690 --> 12:19.030
Let me go back and finally we have this more.

12:19.030 --> 12:25.780
It says something about Mr. with commerce and when I go back through again I'm going I couldn't publish

12:26.260 --> 12:29.720
with these when I click it closes.

12:29.920 --> 12:33.940
And this is going to be the star at the moment we have something like this.

12:33.960 --> 12:40.860
Day three of this course is that you can learn everything about commerce and that's how to customize

12:41.330 --> 12:44.940
your store to achieve the design that we have in mind.

12:45.250 --> 12:47.940
So in the next video we're going to continue working with this.

12:48.070 --> 12:50.350
First we're going to learn how to create drogues.
