Select your child Im seeing WordPress child is a safe way to edit a WordPress theme without losing the

00:14.150 --> 00:16.100
changes in the next update.

00:18.040 --> 00:27.640
So what does her child deem a child team will inherit their styling and functionality from another team.

00:27.650 --> 00:30.320
Normally we refer to this as the Biden team

00:33.200 --> 00:40.220
create in our child deem is the recommended way to heavy and existing WordPress theme.

00:40.310 --> 00:47.180
So lets say that you find a really nice WordPress theme on the Wordpress repository of themes and you

00:47.180 --> 00:50.380
want to see some changes maybe you want to add different colors.

00:50.380 --> 00:55.030
Maybe you want to change something in the sidebar or in the main page.

00:55.070 --> 01:02.860
The best way to win this is to create a child theme so let's say that we bought into a bunch of BHB

01:02.860 --> 01:05.350
javascript and CSSA files.

01:05.500 --> 01:13.140
When we create the child team is going to inherit all this functionality into the child team.

01:13.240 --> 01:22.730
So the process of creating a child team if you modify the arena team finds you will lose all the changes

01:22.730 --> 01:24.930
that you made in the next update.

01:26.540 --> 01:35.870
Create in our child team ensures that these modifications are preset And also you can create a team

01:36.080 --> 01:45.540
really really fast you can learn about WordPress in developed man building Chuy's teams so to create

01:45.570 --> 01:50.330
a child team you can create a fall there in the teens for there.

01:50.330 --> 01:55.410
So for example in this case I had it for the recall team.

01:55.510 --> 01:57.260
You can name these whatever you want.

01:57.910 --> 02:04.580
And then you need to create different shows that ph profile and they style that says fine.

02:05.110 --> 02:08.560
And of course you need to provide some information

02:11.230 --> 02:18.960
so lets say that you want to modify a specific file or template copy that file from the original folder

02:19.690 --> 02:26.070
and paste into the Chais deem and then you can make the modifications.

02:26.180 --> 02:32.930
There isn't an important copy only the files that you need to edit you don't have to copy all the files

02:33.830 --> 02:43.360
so you can only copy the home page or the cyber or something like that and you will have complete Deam.

02:43.450 --> 02:44.400
So the next step

02:47.090 --> 02:49.980
beaute are chiding from a storefront.
