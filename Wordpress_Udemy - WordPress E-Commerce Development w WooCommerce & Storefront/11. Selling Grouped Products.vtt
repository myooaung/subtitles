00:04.280 --> 00:10.930
And 13 that is really really come on is that you are selling products as a bundle of New Right here.

00:11.980 --> 00:17.030
I mean when I close tabs I hear so for example it's clear that bundle.

00:17.050 --> 00:25.080
And when I click on our products and that's create a bond with these were these companies and the guys

00:25.560 --> 00:27.950
at the top that way.

00:28.220 --> 00:30.250
Come get.

00:30.760 --> 00:31.490
Guys.

00:31.540 --> 00:33.450
Something like that will work.

00:34.830 --> 00:36.050
So fiscally a little bit.

00:36.060 --> 00:39.710
You can see we can produce data and we're going to change this to group problem.

00:39.930 --> 00:42.810
So this is going to send the programs a bundle.

00:43.010 --> 00:52.950
Then you can click on Dink products and you can select brokes so that when they come get become it's

00:52.950 --> 00:53.890
going to be that way.

00:53.930 --> 01:00.080
Also and this is going to be the and guy that we have added in the previous media.

01:00.220 --> 01:05.940
So it does show you are what printing they we're selling these three products into one.

01:05.980 --> 01:08.200
So let's add some description maybe.

01:08.220 --> 01:09.430
Right here we're going up

01:12.330 --> 01:24.300
bundle includes They get all went and did PDAF guys for September or something like that.

01:25.320 --> 01:32.620
And of course you can create the problem as match or anything so other than either one of these and

01:32.820 --> 01:40.460
why don't I take these when and of course you can create the reality you can have one of these stairwells

01:41.120 --> 01:51.140
and you can either Also PBF guide and match up two images.

01:51.150 --> 02:01.770
And there's one and you can see that there is no doubt to the price of Commerce is going to take the

02:01.770 --> 02:07.650
price for it broke and is going to make it assume we're gonna pay that price.

02:08.500 --> 02:10.180
So you can on to be broke.

02:12.750 --> 02:16.430
And you can see when you open these you can thought Well applause applause.

02:16.450 --> 02:17.130
Right.

02:17.670 --> 02:24.420
And you can see that we have the price is right here and you can select wine that you can select the

02:24.420 --> 02:25.360
options.

02:25.550 --> 02:34.030
If you remember we have these variations added but this way you can create a bundle.

02:34.050 --> 02:38.480
There are some really powerful blowguns in commerce.

02:38.910 --> 02:46.190
For example if you want to sell these bundled maybe you want to allow the user to save $5 or something.

02:46.470 --> 02:55.860
There are a lot of blow ins we do that one Chanology into the Bondel by the default commercial doesn't

02:55.860 --> 03:01.690
allow you to either discount right here but hopefully soon they add that functionality.
