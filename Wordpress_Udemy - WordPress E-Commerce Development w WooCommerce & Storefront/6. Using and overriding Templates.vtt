00:04.140 --> 00:12.820
Next let's take a look at how to modify templates in combers first thing when I close my door and I'm

00:12.830 --> 00:19.910
going up in front of Rubicon and I'm going up and all these people live into my or modifying Diem's

00:19.960 --> 00:21.540
a little more complex.

00:21.670 --> 00:31.120
We need to copy that template that we want to modify from the team or from the Brillion in this case

00:31.140 --> 00:40.430
we're going to modify our template from the blueing fairly Tangled Up in Blue Jeans racing and we're

00:40.470 --> 00:45.430
going to establish a pro called better font awesome better fun.

00:45.430 --> 00:46.070
Awesome.

00:46.120 --> 00:46.930
We live.

00:47.020 --> 00:50.740
Well they found awesome icons that are fun.

00:50.780 --> 00:56.760
Awesome.

00:56.810 --> 01:01.060
And you can see of the plug in breaking down when they install these

01:05.300 --> 01:06.850
doing what I can activate.

01:07.240 --> 01:14.720
So now that they plug in is install it we have available day icons from fun.

01:14.740 --> 01:15.330
Awesome.

01:16.360 --> 01:22.960
So that's open or A-train and I'm going up in blue jeans and you can see if we have cucumbers I'm going

01:22.960 --> 01:27.140
up and comers and you will find these templates for them.

01:27.580 --> 01:29.940
So everything that you see right here.

01:29.940 --> 01:31.760
So for example it's open.

01:32.200 --> 01:34.800
They shop.

01:34.960 --> 01:42.850
So for example everything that you see here you see is in these files and for example if you went up

01:42.850 --> 01:47.360
and these humko eat this is going to be the single.

01:47.360 --> 01:53.580
So for example you will find that we have single Bruhl right here all the single brokes of these files.

01:55.070 --> 02:00.770
Wintron that everything that you have right here so you can see for example we of different flavors.

02:00.770 --> 02:07.680
We have one for the Mirror Mirror is going to be something like these going up and it's by and you can

02:07.680 --> 02:15.330
see that we have the Q wrapper that got the body in the back so it's going to be D.S. right here.

02:16.650 --> 02:24.700
They can close these surprise you can see we have these Brize that BHB and these will only bring the

02:24.700 --> 02:25.840
price.

02:25.850 --> 02:32.330
So it's going to be that these ration and we have the review rating everything is going to be here soon

02:32.370 --> 02:36.320
to be the bottom section.

02:36.490 --> 02:40.860
Then we carve out so the shared Wooten's the moment we haven't added they shared with us.

02:40.870 --> 02:44.880
I'm going to show you how to have the shareable dancing.

02:44.940 --> 02:47.400
So social networks going up could mean millions.

02:47.620 --> 02:48.950
Then we come to God.

02:49.000 --> 02:57.490
You can see that we have the friend fights for variations for variables simple and group and everything.

02:57.810 --> 02:59.560
So what I want to make something simple.

02:59.570 --> 03:04.740
You know I'm going to copy these simple and you can see on the top you can see that we have some description

03:04.740 --> 03:13.650
and say simple broke to cut and you can see that we are also the instructions this template can be rewritten

03:13.680 --> 03:20.220
by copying it way your theme will combers single broke at the and simple that BHP.

03:20.310 --> 03:27.690
So let's do that and then up and Olympic and then diems and then my brilliant career back then I'm going

03:27.690 --> 03:30.660
to create a new for this going to be called newcomer's.

03:30.750 --> 03:36.640
You can see a common theme with commerce namely to create this single brother.

03:36.900 --> 03:41.630
So let's create the single probe single broke something nice.

03:41.760 --> 03:43.200
Then you have to cut

03:47.490 --> 03:51.000
and raise it is going to be nice simple that be.

03:51.240 --> 03:59.080
So for example you can copy these everything and then collapse these and then it's up and theme's gutter

03:59.100 --> 04:06.410
and back will combers single broke at the and rescued whatever an accidental fire call simple that is

04:06.500 --> 04:10.870
the based for example is make us smile.

04:10.870 --> 04:22.640
This right here on going out and each one I from the the and RIDO

04:26.940 --> 04:28.890
and you can see we can carry from the.

04:28.940 --> 04:29.780
Maybe it is.

04:29.820 --> 04:34.220
I think it's better safe from the team right from the team.

04:34.500 --> 04:42.350
But you can see we have over ridden these now these simple that BHB that is located in the walk combers

04:42.510 --> 04:47.590
fall there is not the template that is being applied at the moment.

04:48.820 --> 04:54.040
So next we're going to scroll down the road and we come up with some types of meat.

04:54.280 --> 04:57.370
And the first is cut because it's value.

04:57.730 --> 04:59.850
And right here we have these glasses.

05:00.180 --> 05:02.860
So I'm going to that class Fran fun.

05:02.890 --> 05:03.820
Awesome.

05:04.300 --> 05:16.260
Nicklaus's if a if a shopping cart so save these and reload and you can see we have got it right here.

05:17.980 --> 05:20.990
We can me you can see it.

05:20.990 --> 05:23.940
We have something like these as looking nice.

05:24.110 --> 05:30.340
And for example I can make a combination I can bake these right here and you can see that we don't need

05:30.360 --> 05:42.940
see before so we can copy and see the business that's Jasus and you can copy these glassing a lot cat

05:42.990 --> 05:47.730
We'll done and I would not single cut them.

05:47.890 --> 05:54.970
And then you can see the icons being printed in these before so we can use before right here.

05:58.410 --> 06:00.280
And I'm going to have a Madigan right.

06:00.470 --> 06:08.150
Then the pieces the same piece and reload and you can see I think that's a lot to me.

06:08.170 --> 06:10.140
This is mother.

06:10.380 --> 06:17.240
So now you can see that we have the at the top and we have the they like go we can change this Jasus

06:18.640 --> 06:25.090
So we're writing templates is really powerful especially if we want to add or remove some content in

06:25.090 --> 06:25.660
the markup.

06:25.660 --> 06:32.360
In this case where it's submission the mail that we're using these techniques is going to be really

06:32.360 --> 06:33.120
careful.

06:34.100 --> 06:41.450
So in the next video we're going to take a look at the most powerful way of modifying a template you've

06:41.460 --> 06:42.770
seen Hooke's.
