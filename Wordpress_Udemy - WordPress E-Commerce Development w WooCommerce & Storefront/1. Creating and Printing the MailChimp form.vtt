Make a great option if you want a marketing some marketing with emails and for example you can click

00:10.710 --> 00:15.970
it on pricing and you will find that the new business have a free plan.

00:15.970 --> 00:22.260
The plan is great to start the subscriptions to you remain.

00:22.900 --> 00:29.380
And the grants is throwing your you can increase your plan to the different options that they cap.

00:29.430 --> 00:34.630
So let's remove these and get on the Web site that we're really you can see we have subscribed in years

00:34.630 --> 00:40.690
later and that's just to disclose if these people can live to day remains.

00:41.230 --> 00:44.240
And we're going to send some special promos.

00:44.280 --> 00:49.430
This is something that's really come on and this is great if you're building your website for your business.

00:49.560 --> 00:52.680
Send in a special promos to your doors.

00:52.930 --> 00:54.220
YOU SOMETHING GREAT.

00:55.910 --> 00:57.790
Is something really great.

00:58.060 --> 01:00.430
So here I have the manging website.

01:00.440 --> 01:06.350
You have a ready access and it's always a good idea to create a new list and I'm going to click on the

01:06.350 --> 01:07.070
list.

01:07.960 --> 01:11.910
And for it I'm going see it on your list so create the list.

01:13.300 --> 01:15.100
And I'm going to give these list a name.

01:15.100 --> 01:22.910
So what I'm going to call these when asked by and from Caloocan are they the fall out is so for example

01:22.910 --> 01:24.640
when you send an e-mail.

01:24.980 --> 01:31.650
This is the other is that it's going to be displayed for the visitors and when I have my web site my

01:32.120 --> 01:38.960
made and then you can use her name and I'm going to copy and paste you can I that remind there.

01:38.970 --> 01:42.280
Where did you get the e-mails for your visitors.

01:43.420 --> 01:48.450
And in this case I'm going to not on me and I'm going to say these.

01:48.650 --> 01:51.480
The important part is the sign up form.

01:51.560 --> 01:56.690
So here you can you can see we have the and as badly as we have created these days.

01:56.960 --> 02:02.290
And then when I click on sign or forms and here you have some options.

02:02.310 --> 02:10.570
So for example you have the gender forms we have the embedded forms and we have also the subscribe button

02:10.570 --> 02:11.580
up.

02:11.650 --> 02:16.180
In this case they embed forms out of the ones that we're going to use.

02:16.210 --> 02:22.410
You can see this one generates the Milko and something that we can copy and paste in your web site.

02:22.690 --> 02:24.040
But again I said Look here.

02:25.160 --> 02:30.950
And here you have some options you have the classic suppressed Leam or isn't that for the purpose of

02:30.950 --> 02:31.970
this example.

02:31.970 --> 02:34.630
There is Santal is the one that we're going to use.

02:34.970 --> 02:42.850
But feel free to use any of these options that suites better in your design.

02:43.980 --> 02:46.530
So you can see that we have subscribed to the newsletters.

02:46.550 --> 02:55.120
We're going to change these to their newsletter and that's what we have access to exclusive.

02:55.130 --> 03:00.090
That's why we're going to change that with the code in the next video.

03:00.360 --> 03:02.240
And you can see that we that is right here.

03:02.340 --> 03:03.560
So we're going to copy everything.

03:03.550 --> 03:13.350
Now you can click here and copy this code open at them and then when I close these and I scroll to the

03:13.350 --> 03:23.290
bottom and then when I I've display MailChimp in the home page but this will display the many Cimino

03:23.300 --> 03:30.390
the pages I'm going to show you how to display these on the on the page in the upcoming Beebe's if you

03:30.390 --> 03:35.260
open the front in and you click here on simply show hooks.

03:35.580 --> 03:37.470
You can see that in our design.

03:37.470 --> 03:40.200
Again we have the same problem that we have put right here.

03:41.940 --> 03:47.080
We need to expand the the color to the edges.

03:48.080 --> 03:53.460
And if you look to the campaign we need to have the same estimate that we had is right here.

03:53.790 --> 03:59.990
But if you scroll to the bottom here before the food you will find these storefront from hour before

03:59.980 --> 04:00.540
food.

04:00.660 --> 04:02.510
What are going to use this hook.

04:02.520 --> 04:16.900
So we're going up an Adam function or Nusbaum display main CIM form and we're going that close BHB right

04:16.900 --> 04:19.750
here and up in BHB again right here.

04:19.960 --> 04:22.510
And I'm going to paste that gold right there.

04:22.510 --> 04:25.570
Why don't I fix this up in the next video.

04:25.690 --> 04:34.480
So next one going out of action and what are going to copy these stuff from before for comma and then

04:34.480 --> 04:40.510
we pass in the name of this function the priority by the full extent.

04:40.640 --> 04:44.460
And this one doesn't have anything hook right here.

04:44.840 --> 04:50.480
So we're going our past is empty so now we can't reload and stop showing hooks

04:53.890 --> 04:57.380
and you can see that we can subscribe to the newsletter.

04:57.990 --> 04:59.490
This is working.

04:59.490 --> 05:04.860
Now you can fill the form and click on subscribe by the minutes we are going to show you how to style

05:04.860 --> 05:08.010
that form to look something like this.
