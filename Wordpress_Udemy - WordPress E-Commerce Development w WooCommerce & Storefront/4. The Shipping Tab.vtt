00:04.260 --> 00:05.960
So the next stop is the shipping.

00:06.000 --> 00:07.420
You can see we have shipping.

00:07.440 --> 00:10.730
There is a complete chapter about shipping in these cards.

00:10.980 --> 00:12.570
You can create shipping zones.

00:12.930 --> 00:17.330
And that's chapter I'm going to show you how to create shipping sons you can see here we have that reshipping

00:17.330 --> 00:17.990
sounds.

00:18.050 --> 00:20.110
We cover also the shipping options.

00:20.310 --> 00:25.920
So for example here you can enable the shipping calculator on the card page or you can either coast

00:26.000 --> 00:28.020
on the analysis center.

00:28.130 --> 00:30.350
The for ones you open the checkout.

00:30.600 --> 00:31.450
We'll prom.

00:31.650 --> 00:35.390
The shipping method with a price.

00:35.670 --> 00:41.760
But for example if in April this Wednesday you said that's the country is the state and the zip code

00:41.780 --> 00:45.370
is going to have the cost.

00:45.400 --> 00:53.800
And normally I see on CHUGG these so you can either shop in this dimension the fold you can add the

00:53.890 --> 00:59.980
shipping it is sort of a meeting that is normally a list Thorsen use the Bidi nowadays but this is going

00:59.980 --> 01:05.320
to be a the for the user can change the values in the checkout form.

01:05.530 --> 01:11.230
And if you have any problem and if you run and run into any problems when you are working with shipping

01:11.320 --> 01:13.260
you can enable that cable mode.

01:13.330 --> 01:22.990
This will bring some errors that you can really easily copy make or form a searching tool so you can

01:22.990 --> 01:24.750
find a solution.

01:24.820 --> 01:28.900
Of course you can also send me a message with the error.

01:28.990 --> 01:30.600
And I will try to help you.

01:30.850 --> 01:33.520
And that's what we kept shipping classes at glassine.

01:33.550 --> 01:36.030
Shipping is a way that you can group.

01:36.030 --> 01:43.270
So for example you can create an insurance or you can create an extra fee for handling or anything you

01:43.270 --> 01:50.210
can create a rule that you can decide which bros you want to apply.

01:50.350 --> 01:58.570
In this case we added insurance and we only added the insurance to some specific brokes products that

01:58.780 --> 02:03.430
it's really possible that they get that much in the shipping.

02:03.850 --> 02:09.350
So this way you can group simulate brogues with the shipping classes.

02:09.400 --> 02:15.300
Finally the USPS in the United States Postal Service discipline that we added.

02:15.520 --> 02:17.030
So this is shipping.

02:17.200 --> 02:18.430
It's really really simple.

02:18.430 --> 02:22.900
The menus is one of the most powerful features of Commerce.
