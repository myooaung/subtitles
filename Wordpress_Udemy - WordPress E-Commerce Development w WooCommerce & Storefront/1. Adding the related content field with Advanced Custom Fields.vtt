In previous videos I read these blog entries in the in the bottom of the page and this is a great marketing

00:11.240 --> 00:20.010
tool especially if you have a small business you can create some guides for example you can also review

00:20.020 --> 00:25.820
some products or wake up three and three right here and that's up and isn't going to click on real Pridmore

00:26.990 --> 00:33.300
and let's say that we have this blog entry we are describing the one of the pros that we're settling

00:34.010 --> 00:35.390
in on the bottom.

00:35.550 --> 00:39.160
I want to have our related products section.

00:39.180 --> 00:45.870
So let's say for example that we write an entry about the everything that you need to create your own

00:45.950 --> 00:53.210
spa at home and at the bottom we can have their related products this way the readers of the Web site

00:53.880 --> 01:00.610
will find the exact products and they come by the products that we're showing in this entry.

01:00.650 --> 01:07.010
So if it isn't and I click don't on the post and you can see for example that there is no field to relate

01:07.010 --> 01:08.050
content right here.

01:09.010 --> 01:16.230
But if you open custom fields you would see that we have some options to our related products.

01:16.510 --> 01:18.470
So we're going to blog right here.

01:18.610 --> 01:24.630
And again I'm going to change this to a standard metal box especially our personal preference then we're

01:24.630 --> 01:27.260
going to show this some the pasta that is equal to both.

01:27.370 --> 01:28.210
That's fine.

01:28.540 --> 01:30.480
And then we're going to click here on that field.

01:31.360 --> 01:38.450
And I don't actually have a name related brogues So we have the name and if you click it on the field

01:38.660 --> 01:43.330
you can see that we have a relation and so you can add a page link.

01:43.340 --> 01:50.160
You can also link to post object relationship and taxonomy or usage.

01:50.620 --> 01:57.060
So for example this part ballsed object from Ontario have their boss type.

01:57.190 --> 02:04.900
For example you can select the brokes that brother and I'm going to give you false and I'm going to

02:05.220 --> 02:11.260
update these bullies these then get rid of these.

02:11.310 --> 02:15.190
So here on the wall and you can see that we kept blocking we have related problems.

02:15.610 --> 02:19.770
And from here you can see that we have the card and asked by the guide and you can select the other

02:19.780 --> 02:21.190
brokes.

02:21.370 --> 02:24.800
There is a second field you can click on it.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.260
We're going to change these relationship.

02:27.430 --> 02:31.300
I think this one works better for these example.

02:31.520 --> 02:37.340
And we're going to change the format to post ideas and we're going to the post I broke.

02:38.630 --> 02:49.520
So everything is fine and then go up the DS and reload the blog entry and this is a nice interface you

02:49.520 --> 02:55.860
can see that we have the pros on the left and we can for example select one of these.

02:56.030 --> 03:00.400
Here you can see that we have this plus and you can leg is going to read the really red arrows.

03:00.740 --> 03:03.120
So let's say that we are these curliness bad guys.

03:03.140 --> 03:04.980
And then we had these come get.

03:05.210 --> 03:09.590
So we have two related products and it's of the Diest

03:13.400 --> 03:15.710
and there's a front and we're going to click it on.

03:15.700 --> 03:23.020
Simple show hooks to find the exit Huq where we're going to bring these related products or we're going

03:23.020 --> 03:28.930
to scroll down the road and raise that we have in store for one single post bottom.

03:29.090 --> 03:33.740
So we're going to use these when copy these.

03:33.910 --> 03:39.280
Or maybe this is from post-Clinton afternoon you can see these when it's inside the container and this

03:39.290 --> 03:41.670
one so also I would say we're going to copy these.

03:41.710 --> 03:46.120
This is going to be a better place and I find the function scroll to the bottom.

03:46.390 --> 03:55.280
And we're going to add a comment call related products MBLAQ.

03:55.420 --> 04:05.550
So we're going to write the ones from Caterina's blah blah underscore law and related products in what

04:05.650 --> 04:15.540
are going to have an action or inaction or action with Bozza and then with as a function does what does

04:15.790 --> 04:22.470
it mean we're going to add a default which is then Echo products here.

04:24.240 --> 04:29.190
And save these up in the front and then reload and then you can see we have.

04:29.260 --> 04:32.890
Skin you're going to stop showing kooks.

04:33.050 --> 04:34.560
And then we have products.

04:35.120 --> 04:42.290
So the next video we're going to finish this function to bring in there with airdromes in the blog entry

04:42.290 --> 04:42.570
is.
