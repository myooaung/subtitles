00:04.260 --> 00:08.030
So let's start working with the styling for the section.

00:08.130 --> 00:13.620
These will take this and maybe the next me to accomplish something like this.

00:13.680 --> 00:21.210
So let's been the narrator feels I'm going to make this his mother and on the financial side when I

00:21.210 --> 00:29.910
click here and split these two right and then up in the start that he sees this because it can be easier

00:29.910 --> 00:33.640
to see it is this markup to write the correct selectors.

00:34.820 --> 00:42.690
So you don't even have come kids because they worry and we're going to copy these.

00:42.840 --> 00:48.250
This is going to be the end of all the selectors and if they're going to get in there he's saying we

00:48.250 --> 00:51.110
have these great color.

00:51.280 --> 00:55.220
So if they get a kid in the country guy is going to be the.

00:56.650 --> 01:03.470
So copy these in other quote unquote ding we're going to add somebody.

01:03.470 --> 01:05.640
So we're going out batting one him.

01:06.020 --> 01:09.260
And finally we're going to have even them of to him.

01:10.300 --> 01:11.780
So I'll save these.

01:12.060 --> 01:19.540
And you know and you can see we have the great color and we have somebody in.

01:19.590 --> 01:23.710
So next we're going to copy paste and then we have this content.

01:23.880 --> 01:26.150
It's wearing out that cont'd.

01:26.380 --> 01:28.620
And he had another background color.

01:29.020 --> 01:39.440
It's going to be white in this case the white color is on HEFCE and I would have got some padding of

01:39.440 --> 01:40.420
one him.

01:40.790 --> 01:44.400
So save these up and the Browns said OK and reload.

01:44.870 --> 01:47.510
And you can see we have that defect that we're looking for.

01:48.460 --> 01:49.980
So this is looking nice.

01:50.620 --> 01:55.820
And then we have these columns three and we're going to target this H-2 and these patterns from these

01:55.820 --> 01:56.270
columns.

01:56.270 --> 02:04.810
These are what you want to copy these based and what have and have H-2.

02:04.910 --> 02:06.660
But I went to target the column three.

02:06.660 --> 02:18.120
So what I'm going to have are really nonselective Raheen and they have had six or nine center sameas

02:18.150 --> 02:20.260
and reload.

02:20.500 --> 02:22.700
So you can see the center is looking nice.

02:27.090 --> 02:35.350
And then when I target this program and these anchors are going to be these and it's going to be and

02:35.380 --> 02:38.360
this is going to be anchor.

02:38.580 --> 02:47.600
So the paragraph tag what the margin bottom maybe to him and for the anchors that I'm going to.

02:47.770 --> 02:50.200
And if they can look you in the sand is being caught.

02:50.210 --> 02:58.810
So let's open again or call our guy got our based daing what are going out that phone size we're going

02:58.810 --> 03:06.290
to make this get 1.4 am then we're going to change the family is going to be the phone family.

03:06.310 --> 03:10.590
We heard about it previously from family that's all.

03:10.710 --> 03:18.330
So when I scroll to the top cop it is Lato to the boardroom and paste.

03:18.570 --> 03:23.190
So next another phone weighed 700.

03:23.760 --> 03:31.770
And then we're going to have this play block by the fall of the anchors producing display in line and

03:31.770 --> 03:34.180
we're going to display Brugge blog right here.

03:34.530 --> 03:39.460
So that's up in the front in and you can see we have our problems right here.

03:39.730 --> 03:45.680
Of course we're going to write some C assess to display the three columns from the left and the nine

03:45.680 --> 03:49.660
columns on the right at the moment we're working with the section rates.

03:50.390 --> 03:56.810
The moment on the day my liberation So definitely this is looking great.

03:58.100 --> 04:06.320
So in the next video we're going to finish these and we're going to write the selectors for the columns

04:07.220 --> 04:08.630
and columns nine that we have.
