00:04.290 --> 00:09.550
Send this are we're gonna see how you can customize their checkout page.

00:09.580 --> 00:16.870
This is going to add some drugs and I'm going to hit for example Gladys blog these I saw so and so these

00:16.870 --> 00:23.170
one and then I got you can see this working nice.

00:23.190 --> 00:32.060
You can see that we have this couponing we're going to be a top a coupon coupon now you can see we have

00:32.130 --> 00:40.010
these come looking nice and I'm going to click on price at the checkout so you can see we have something

00:40.010 --> 00:45.170
a DS is really common that a lot of Web sites removed.

00:45.170 --> 00:52.740
For example the sidebar and also they share and so therefore they're normally at this point.

00:53.030 --> 01:00.890
They believe that the user has fine everything and they even want the user to see for example a block

01:00.890 --> 01:01.670
entry.

01:01.670 --> 01:07.890
Then they forgot to use they are buying something in the web site.

01:07.940 --> 01:15.410
So what we're going to see how you can remove all their unnecessary content from these screen.

01:15.580 --> 01:18.440
So I'm going to click here and then going back.

01:18.810 --> 01:23.490
So here's we're going to remove these by the of these main navigation and you can see that we have these

01:24.330 --> 01:31.470
and it's going to be the one these primary navigation so you have to start from primary navigation.

01:31.820 --> 01:39.140
And if you're a little kid in the body you will find that we have these cameras check out glass.

01:39.390 --> 01:40.920
So what are going to copy these.

01:41.040 --> 01:42.620
But I copy everything Rohit

01:45.520 --> 01:56.210
we're going to use some see Asus Cziko and we have another commercial checkout line we're going up in

01:56.210 --> 02:03.890
Chrome and right here we have these is that from primary navigation with these glass or an app called

02:03.890 --> 02:07.470
Biddy's and then going to display.

02:07.480 --> 02:08.940
None.

02:08.970 --> 02:12.040
So now remove that Cirilo these

02:16.110 --> 02:18.550
and you can see is working is looking nice.

02:19.350 --> 02:25.910
So for example you can click it on the page Halsall you get on that template you can use the file with

02:26.030 --> 02:26.640
Temperley.

02:26.710 --> 02:34.980
And I'm one of the these credos and you can see that we get rid of the cyber.

02:34.980 --> 02:39.030
So now it is working better and you can see that we have this breadcrumb.

02:39.060 --> 02:46.500
So it's a nice idea to keep the link to the comp age but we're going to sort of move this section right

02:46.500 --> 02:52.070
here and going to inspect these and this section right here.

02:53.730 --> 02:56.740
Is this secondary navigation on the site search.

02:56.880 --> 03:00.580
We're going to copy these in a Akamai right here.

03:00.610 --> 03:09.000
What combers check out secondary navigation of this site search Gomer's.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.340
Check out site search.

03:12.350 --> 03:17.110
We're going to save these and reload.

03:17.240 --> 03:20.280
Now you can see that the interface is dimmer.

03:20.380 --> 03:25.660
So why don't we have all of these for the and I think we can remove all the widgets.

03:27.600 --> 03:31.540
You can see that we have this block and we have these for our widgets.

03:31.540 --> 03:39.400
So we're going to use these when companies are widgets in going on a comer.

03:40.140 --> 03:41.990
Newcomers check out.

03:42.420 --> 03:44.100
And then for the widgets.

03:44.100 --> 03:49.160
So everything is going to be highlighted in the checkout so closes in your you.

03:53.210 --> 03:57.980
Now you can see that this looks more cleaner and of course you can't remove the section right here.

04:00.530 --> 04:06.320
Instead of having the disease for it of colophon with this site.

04:06.480 --> 04:17.500
So we're going I use our site for you instead of the widgets so we can reload these.

04:17.680 --> 04:21.300
And then you can see this it looks more cleaner at this point.

04:21.340 --> 04:31.300
So a good idea that the store finishes the process of buying their stuff and you don't want to have

04:31.900 --> 04:35.710
blog entries or other products or something at this time.

04:35.700 --> 04:37.490
They really need to finish everything.

04:38.370 --> 04:42.980
So and then we're going to show you how to remove some of these fields in case you need to.

04:43.410 --> 04:47.400
And that's one of common beliefs out loud some extra feels right here.
