00:05.250 --> 00:10.530
So let's continue working with these example these Brillion that were working that were working the

00:10.530 --> 00:12.060
way developing.

00:12.210 --> 00:13.500
So let's add something here.

00:13.500 --> 00:20.130
We're going to add another function and then I call this one execute the next slider and we're going

00:20.130 --> 00:28.700
to create another function call the policy slider underscore execute.

00:28.750 --> 00:35.840
So these will contain the code that is required to run these.

00:35.840 --> 00:43.270
So what I'm going to hook these on going out of action and we're going to hook these inside of the P4

00:45.520 --> 00:53.080
and we're going to call this fun show you song reclose BHB it right here in Angola now.

00:53.080 --> 00:54.910
Impeach it right here.

00:55.580 --> 00:59.150
So normally this is the way that unmuzzled begins work.

00:59.330 --> 01:05.520
You need to have the libraries then you have to have the mark of the mill and then you execute the methods

01:05.870 --> 01:12.550
normally like this you know and set up the command ready and then they select more and the metal.

01:12.640 --> 01:20.970
So they're going to copy these and grace and I'm going to have the script we can remove these type text

01:20.970 --> 01:29.580
javascript scenes by default all the browsers will render a script that takes obviously we can Bumblebee's

01:29.590 --> 01:32.770
there is no problem we come back right here.

01:34.460 --> 01:43.470
And I'm going to load Jake worry as usual Jake Querrey not comfy.

01:45.710 --> 01:49.400
Gone Flake.

01:49.570 --> 01:51.500
And we can change these ul.

01:51.670 --> 01:57.080
You can see the UL has these grass like they're brokes.

01:57.100 --> 02:02.050
We can change these right here and you can save these and up and running.

02:05.100 --> 02:06.850
And it didn't work.

02:06.850 --> 02:13.630
And right here again I'm using the equals Eurail class equals was like that brokes.

02:13.680 --> 02:20.820
This is one of the reasons that I prefer to close always BHB and write this the man alone.

02:21.330 --> 02:28.630
But let's say these up in the front in and you can see this essentially is working a little strange

02:28.630 --> 02:32.830
because Fakeer this one is not.

02:32.860 --> 02:36.430
This one is the pose that we didn't have an much.

02:36.510 --> 02:47.880
So in order to avoid a problem we can add something like Mira Kii and we can use thumbnail ID so save

02:47.880 --> 02:49.740
these hand reload again.

02:51.440 --> 02:57.780
And now you can see that we have only post that contains an image in the featured image.

02:59.150 --> 03:07.640
In it this is important especially if you are adding a slider like this one.

03:07.710 --> 03:08.840
So this is looking nice.

03:08.840 --> 03:11.470
Definitely I'm going to inspect these.

03:11.490 --> 03:17.460
Maybe something is a little weird here because it's not taking the food with.

03:17.600 --> 03:18.170
Three.

03:18.750 --> 03:26.630
We need to override the selectors So we're going to have copies in our pain atom integration I'm going

03:26.630 --> 03:38.520
to have this and it's something we 100 percent and that's going to up Max with Max with the initial

03:40.180 --> 03:42.360
So that's up in the front in Hilo.

03:44.280 --> 03:46.510
Now you can see he's taking all of the weight.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.910
Next you can see that this label is not moving.

03:51.280 --> 03:57.050
So very simple here where we're executing there's labor inside the parentheses we can pass on options.

03:57.370 --> 04:01.870
If you open the options in the basics like that you will find a bunch of different options or you can

04:01.870 --> 04:05.750
change their evils and everything.

04:05.750 --> 04:11.800
So for example let's say that we want to move these lights are going out out all too true.

04:12.200 --> 04:13.520
So save these and Riddel

04:19.680 --> 04:21.070
and you can see more in.

04:21.670 --> 04:24.600
So next for example I went through this play for lights.

04:24.730 --> 04:26.870
Is simple for this laser here.

04:27.120 --> 04:38.770
But again I mean this light's in or out for Max's light for I also get it going to AB slide with.

04:39.000 --> 04:45.980
And it's like we were going to add something like two hundred and fifty pixels that speaks of the reducing

04:46.020 --> 04:50.490
pixels and the greatest love is like margin going at them.

04:50.650 --> 04:56.370
So reloader front end and then you can see that we have these lights.

04:56.530 --> 05:04.390
So these values for OK next we're going at a comma and we're going to move as lights to one say this

05:04.390 --> 05:07.980
and relo And let's see.

05:08.070 --> 05:10.540
And that's way into this movie.

05:10.660 --> 05:19.040
And you can see something like this.

05:19.070 --> 05:20.610
So this is looking fine.

05:23.900 --> 05:25.270
And it's working great.

05:26.350 --> 05:33.900
And for example let's say you saw these you can click here and this will take you to these Brul and

05:33.900 --> 05:39.880
this is the way that you create a simple blue yin in newcomer's.

05:40.340 --> 05:44.680
And it's like they're from magic where a library that we find on the Internet.
