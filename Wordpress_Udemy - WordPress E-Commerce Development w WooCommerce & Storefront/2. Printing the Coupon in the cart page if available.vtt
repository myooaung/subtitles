00:04.410 --> 00:07.450
So let's bring the banner you match.

00:07.530 --> 00:13.600
And when I click it on simple show kooks to see the hopes that we have available in the card page so

00:13.610 --> 00:17.330
for example you can see we have an action race in.

00:17.500 --> 00:21.580
Check Card items here we have another ones.

00:21.630 --> 00:23.480
These ones are not being.

00:24.030 --> 00:28.390
And that's if you want to display these below the customer match.

00:28.420 --> 00:30.910
You can see some of that right here.

00:31.120 --> 00:37.710
Only one apprentice on the bottom the card table or on the right whatever you want you can see a bunch

00:37.710 --> 00:41.790
of different options and things to simple show hooks.

00:42.240 --> 00:45.210
You can see him in a more graphical way.

00:45.210 --> 00:54.620
Where do these kooks are deciding what going to copy will commanders check carb items and then when

00:55.380 --> 01:10.110
a common display display button there in they got a page or a function call or display manager got a

01:10.660 --> 01:23.370
page in what are going to have an action of action check of items and what are going to copy these and

01:23.380 --> 01:28.170
what have and have a call manager here just to see that this is working.

01:29.100 --> 01:34.140
And stop showing Cookes and then you can see Habanera here.

01:34.180 --> 01:35.090
It's looking nice.

01:35.090 --> 01:38.610
Exactly the place that we want to bring their banners.

01:39.080 --> 01:46.510
So first I'm going to add the Global Post again this is the way that you access the global post of.

01:46.760 --> 01:56.320
And then we're going to have you match your rent equals to get Phil and then you buys the name of the

01:56.320 --> 01:56.990
field.

01:57.280 --> 02:05.660
In this case going up in Carstone feels an got you know maybe they would've gone to Coby's But here

02:05.980 --> 02:14.550
we can manage it in the second that we bought the so this way we made these a little more portable.

02:14.550 --> 02:23.870
They called and they were going to Yves you match you are a rare case that these Xs are going to execute

02:23.870 --> 02:25.480
this code in case.

02:25.540 --> 02:29.280
Now we're going to ignore this and the fortune is going to end.

02:29.490 --> 02:34.800
So next we're going I finish the pitch because I'll close the pitch be Dyken up in this race.

02:36.910 --> 02:42.600
So right here asininity this is better.

02:42.680 --> 02:53.630
We're not going that deep with declasse you've been caught ending what I'm going to echo.

02:54.060 --> 03:06.400
I am yes I see what I call the the majeur echo match you around in the way use the as it takes you palm

03:08.320 --> 03:17.430
so you can save these up in the browser and Rouleau and you can see we have the card and you can see

03:17.450 --> 03:24.070
we have a grand opening a special offer say up to 20 percent and the coupon code right here.

03:24.870 --> 03:33.900
So for example we're running a special offer that we can we can log in to war back in low coupon and

03:33.930 --> 03:39.590
they tours when they are in the kind of page with this coupon that they can apply right here.

03:39.660 --> 03:45.950
That's something really nice when you have a special offer one day license to use this special offer.

03:46.110 --> 03:49.110
And there is no better place than the card page.

03:49.170 --> 03:51.660
Do these play these kind of coupons.

03:51.660 --> 04:00.120
So we're going up in the style that's Jasus and Gracy and gonna start this coupon cart coupon cart and

04:00.120 --> 04:09.780
then another Maryan born of one am so save these and reload now you can see have some MySpace here and

04:09.780 --> 04:11.390
this is looking nice.

04:11.550 --> 04:22.460
So let's say that the sale is over we can close this and up the DS Grillo and you can see that nothing

04:22.460 --> 04:23.340
is being printed.

04:24.720 --> 04:29.840
I'm going to add the coupon and so they'll be matching up the

04:34.530 --> 04:37.090
SO in the next video I'm going to show you how to either.

04:37.290 --> 04:40.520
You can see we have like you've been in the car.

04:40.670 --> 04:45.600
And then I show you a hot button to clear the car.

04:45.690 --> 04:48.770
This is going to be a really common requirement by the clients.

04:49.200 --> 04:51.810
And I'm going to show you how to do that in the next video.
