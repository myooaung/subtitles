WEBVTT

00:05.510 --> 00:10.050
So the next stop is a check up and you can see that we have a bunch of options right here.

00:10.280 --> 00:15.680
But it really easy so will find you bonce enable the use of coupons.

00:16.490 --> 00:22.610
Or maybe you want to have coupons there is something really important in the coupons.

00:22.640 --> 00:30.700
Option maybe you are not offering coupons but you keep these enable when they use air.

00:30.700 --> 00:35.720
For example right here on the checkout you can see that we have this coupon.

00:35.720 --> 00:44.040
Click here to enter your code so maybe you can Cup the coupons buy the babysitter see something like

00:44.040 --> 00:53.760
this and maybe they are going to cancel the purchase because they found these gold and they are trying

00:53.760 --> 00:55.630
to find a coupon.

00:55.980 --> 01:03.000
So if you don't want to have coupons and you plan to create coupons I recommend that you check these

01:03.000 --> 01:07.900
because lists and check these and save the changes and up and check out again.

01:08.630 --> 01:13.970
You can see that we get rid of that message that something really really important only enable this

01:14.030 --> 01:16.850
if you already plan to create coupons.

01:16.850 --> 01:23.030
In my case I plan to cut coupons and then I show you how to create coupons and apply apply them in the

01:23.030 --> 01:28.440
mix medius then you can calculate coupons.

01:28.450 --> 01:34.640
These can sequentially so you can see when I play music multiple coupons I play the first coupon and

01:34.640 --> 01:36.420
the full price for the full price.

01:36.430 --> 01:39.170
And then the second coupon is gone price.

01:39.190 --> 01:40.000
And so one.

01:40.090 --> 01:45.410
So lets say that you have $100 broke and your shares are $20 coupon.

01:45.790 --> 01:54.000
So its going to be $20 of and if they use it adds another coupon Maybe that extra 10 percent is going

01:54.000 --> 01:58.200
to be 10 percent of that $80.

01:58.760 --> 02:05.570
But if you disable this is going to address $20 and then an extra $10.

02:05.570 --> 02:09.850
So we have to make sure that you check these and see how this works.

02:10.720 --> 02:16.690
So now you next you have enabled guest check out so you can see we can allow the customers to check

02:16.690 --> 02:19.340
out without creating an account.

02:19.630 --> 02:26.490
So this is also important because some clients doesnt want to create an account in a website.

02:26.830 --> 02:36.040
They only want to buy something but as of course it is a good idea to force the users to create an account

02:36.550 --> 02:38.200
before making a purchase.

02:38.200 --> 02:40.090
Of course this is up to you.

02:40.090 --> 02:47.730
Normally I'd recommend to have these check so everyone can buy something from your store.

02:47.980 --> 02:54.810
Then you can see that you have four securer check out but you need SSL certificate.

02:54.920 --> 03:01.490
Then we have the chicle pages you have the card page you can change the page for the card and now so

03:01.500 --> 03:06.210
you have the checkout page the check betterway hear the term and conditions.

03:06.210 --> 03:13.930
So this is going to be important so let's say for example a page so that it's on your page and it's

03:13.930 --> 03:17.070
at their terms and conditions.

03:17.270 --> 03:19.220
And it says something like a great

03:22.230 --> 03:26.520
something like that something very simple and I'm going to publish these.

03:26.660 --> 03:34.200
So if I open these again and reload and if I change these terms and conditions and then we had something

03:34.200 --> 03:41.340
like 10 are conditions and save the changes on that check out if I had reload on the board and you will

03:41.340 --> 03:49.370
find these I have read and I said that there are certain conditions you can apply here and you can pick

03:49.380 --> 03:53.490
up or graters terms of course in that real web site.

03:53.560 --> 03:56.180
You have to create something better than these.

03:56.200 --> 03:57.270
This is how you can do.

03:57.280 --> 04:02.300
There are some conditions you can create that page and that's what we have the aimpoint.

04:02.310 --> 04:04.170
Everything here is going to be the.

04:04.550 --> 04:07.450
You wonder why don't we have the main gateways.

04:07.820 --> 04:11.400
And for example let's say you went to a bank transfers.

04:11.430 --> 04:13.790
So you can to here on direct bank transfer.

04:15.560 --> 04:17.700
Then you can disable the payment gateway.

04:17.800 --> 04:23.330
Of course this happens or this is up to you you can see that we have some added that really cash on

04:23.340 --> 04:26.860
the DeBerry paypal and of course you can also reorder these.

04:26.910 --> 04:30.910
They are going to be showing right here.

04:30.950 --> 04:33.920
So if I have Paypal fares and then reload

04:36.990 --> 04:44.630
you can see by this the first option and of course you can enable or disable some payment gateways right

04:44.630 --> 04:46.380
here.

04:46.450 --> 04:52.580
So we have the B a C S and you can see this is a bank transfer.

04:52.580 --> 04:54.720
You can add some action details.

04:54.860 --> 04:57.220
The details are going to be sent by email.

04:57.320 --> 05:03.230
When the user makes that purchase they are going to be added in the body of the e-mail.

05:04.240 --> 05:05.500
Then we have the checks payment.

05:05.520 --> 05:11.240
And of course also this information is going to be sent in that e-mail cash on the liberi out.

05:11.280 --> 05:16.420
So this is going to be sent in the e-mail then we have people express check out.

05:16.670 --> 05:24.150
I'm going to show you how to connect people expressing the upcoming Emilia's and we've had about Strype.

05:24.380 --> 05:26.310
So this is where are you out there.

05:26.330 --> 05:32.840
I can information for people in the strike and I'm going to show you how to do that at least for Paypal

05:32.840 --> 05:35.250
because this drive is not available in my country.

05:35.900 --> 05:42.180
At least for Paypal I'm going to show you how to connect your account in the environment for live or

05:42.180 --> 05:43.110
a sandbox.

05:43.130 --> 05:45.160
It's going to be at a very nice.

05:45.240 --> 05:46.790
So this is it for the check out.

05:46.890 --> 05:56.320
You can see also we have a bunch of options but normally all of them you can key you can keep the defaults.

05:56.360 --> 06:03.360
So next on what on the check in Arkansas e-mail IP is not really important at the moment.

06:03.490 --> 06:08.140
So we're going to see our phones and e-mails in the next weeks.
