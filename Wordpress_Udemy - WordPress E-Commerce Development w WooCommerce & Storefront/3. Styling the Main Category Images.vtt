WEBVTT

00:04.230 --> 00:12.030
So well can start working with these Shub like the worry section you can see that we have these and

00:12.040 --> 00:13.590
we're going to perform some changes.

00:13.590 --> 00:17.900
We're going to study these look like this one.

00:18.080 --> 00:24.260
You can see that we need to remove somebody who is very good to the Madigan's are smaller.

00:24.410 --> 00:30.500
They just had on call or have the separate or acute on the bottom and we need to remove the show by

00:30.500 --> 00:31.390
category.

00:31.400 --> 00:34.260
There is a lot of work we're going to finish this in this video.

00:34.460 --> 00:37.320
So we're going to remove the the grayscale.

00:37.580 --> 00:43.430
That was the example that I had developed on it to show you that you can make changes in the SS in the

00:43.430 --> 00:47.100
way of changes that this is going to reflect in your website.

00:47.360 --> 00:49.130
We're going to remove this part right here.

00:49.930 --> 00:56.430
So reload and you can see that hasn't been made these.

00:56.670 --> 01:00.840
And when I retune these what are one or more needed greyscale.

01:00.840 --> 01:02.040
What are these.

01:02.160 --> 01:05.680
What do I remove out so that rotate but instead of and rotate.

01:06.100 --> 01:09.440
And when I change from rotate the wrist.

01:09.980 --> 01:12.150
And what are going to remove these zero degrees.

01:12.150 --> 01:13.340
I want to get at one point.

01:13.350 --> 01:18.150
Wayne says he's going to increase only 10 percent.

01:18.190 --> 01:19.050
So what is going on.

01:19.050 --> 01:19.930
Relo Raheen

01:23.830 --> 01:25.530
Yeah we need all of these hands on

01:29.950 --> 01:36.070
we need to remove these in this case should be in the harbor and what are going out or more of these

01:36.090 --> 01:36.810
as well.

01:38.030 --> 01:40.850
Yes and then this should be a call of the final call.

01:40.900 --> 01:41.210
So

01:45.880 --> 01:53.900
relo and you can see that we have these mild scale recovery here.

01:53.910 --> 01:59.010
So you can make these be if you want 1.2 or something like that.

01:59.150 --> 02:05.670
The you are much you want to increase when you were in my case at one point.

02:05.730 --> 02:06.610
Is fine.

02:08.420 --> 02:11.720
So next we're not going to remove the margin that we have received.

02:13.110 --> 02:27.360
And I'm going to add and Malcolm and Reihan Salam page glories and rationing going to inspect these.

02:27.610 --> 02:34.450
So you can see whether they call this electorate wanting to write this case we're going to target these

02:34.530 --> 02:36.040
ally that we have here.

02:36.870 --> 02:45.220
And if it can really be selected by the ONLY of that we need is a part of that is even black.

02:45.300 --> 02:48.570
So we're going to select everything from here to here.

02:48.750 --> 02:58.470
We're going to copy the selector bases and then we're going out with 3.3 percent then we're going to

02:58.470 --> 03:09.210
float to the left in a Madigan's ride of 0.5 percent then what we're going to base again and what we're

03:09.220 --> 03:10.280
not there yet.

03:11.450 --> 03:23.090
Rokita when we had 100 percent save encloses RIDO and then you can see this is looking better as a matter

03:23.090 --> 03:32.760
of margin but we need to see if we have to on the top run on the bottom or going changes to the 3 percent

03:33.870 --> 03:35.790
sort of below.

03:35.950 --> 03:38.330
And you can see this is looking better.

03:38.590 --> 03:44.200
Of course this looks a little weird because you can see if we had the 3 percent and then we have a margin

03:44.200 --> 03:48.270
rate of 0.5 if we inspect these.

03:48.270 --> 03:58.090
The last item is when you will find that the last item you can see here on the stage.

03:58.590 --> 04:04.470
The last item has these Madian ratios so we can deal with the three and we have three categories right

04:04.470 --> 04:05.070
here.

04:05.340 --> 04:07.230
So this is going to be 99 percent.

04:07.320 --> 04:11.950
And then are in point fight in these two images.

04:12.210 --> 04:22.020
So that's going to be 100 percent in the case of the last one is the Mariinsky or so that's nice I think.

04:23.500 --> 04:30.400
You need to remove the mike and then when I beg these hane.

04:31.840 --> 04:37.620
You can see this in section title but we need to study at one level up which is the sections we're going

04:37.620 --> 04:42.480
to copy this class and write to

04:47.630 --> 04:48.690
maybe this one.

04:48.710 --> 04:50.560
The second sector is going to be fine.

04:50.610 --> 04:58.600
Sputtered from both categories and then we can envisage those who are going out to write you were going

04:58.600 --> 05:07.400
to display non say these and relo and then you can see that we get rid of that title but we're missing

05:07.410 --> 05:09.980
that so that the category is right on the bottom.

05:11.160 --> 05:14.900
We thought the glass full of H-2 same way.

05:16.290 --> 05:22.870
Section title is going to be this like the sort of relo And I you can see get rid of the part on the

05:22.870 --> 05:25.780
top but we have these stood up on the bottom.

05:27.670 --> 05:29.570
So if should take a look here.

05:29.710 --> 05:36.390
We need to style these what are going to see what classes is applied right here you can see it's called

05:36.560 --> 05:37.100
combers.

05:37.100 --> 05:38.420
Look at the titles.

05:38.470 --> 05:42.720
We're going to isolate that and we're already cabbie's.

05:42.730 --> 05:47.700
You can see on the table we have this edge to sort of get out of a coma H-2.

05:47.740 --> 05:56.130
And then we and then we base that combers slope category titles which are going at a low immediately

05:56.350 --> 05:58.230
after right after.

05:58.660 --> 06:07.220
So relo is looking better and of course you can play with these values to make them bigger if you want.

06:07.240 --> 06:11.430
You can add something like an edge to comer's.

06:11.430 --> 06:17.710
Look at retitling where going out you can see that we have this size right here 1.1 1 and so we got

06:17.710 --> 06:24.580
something like font size 1 point 2 m to make this a little bigger.

06:26.830 --> 06:28.470
When playing for him

06:35.910 --> 06:47.450
looks like this not picking the Assis Yet thing we need to write a much more specific selector right

06:47.450 --> 06:48.110
here.

06:49.250 --> 06:51.260
So we're going to copy everything from here.

06:53.130 --> 06:54.570
And page right here.

06:59.270 --> 07:01.230
So now you can save these and.

07:04.010 --> 07:04.890
Something like that.

07:04.900 --> 07:05.600
I like it.

07:05.750 --> 07:08.500
I really like the size.

07:08.580 --> 07:11.130
So this is looking really really nice.

07:11.130 --> 07:19.060
My opinion and I you can see that we have these as these nice effect we have this is that then this

07:19.060 --> 07:20.030
is looking great.

07:21.780 --> 07:26.490
So let's continue working in the next week and you can see that I skipped the section where we're going

07:26.490 --> 07:33.430
to skip these and where when I instead of reading advance because one feels better we're going to continue

07:33.430 --> 07:35.090
developing these.

07:35.100 --> 07:41.160
We're going to continue working with some not the.

07:41.380 --> 07:43.720
We're going to continue working with some more.

07:43.740 --> 07:51.720
Nate the goal that commerce provides and I'm going to show you these play brother looks and this description

07:51.720 --> 07:54.610
from a specific category in the next video.
