00:04.220 --> 00:07.180
So let's see you can a coupon for an them.

00:07.220 --> 00:08.380
When will combers.

00:08.420 --> 00:15.870
And then you can see we have coupons right here so inside of that coupon to sit on the top of coupon

00:17.720 --> 00:19.960
and you can tie that name right here.

00:20.000 --> 00:28.600
So we're going to have cowardness by going to something like that 20 percent of you know the orders

00:30.650 --> 00:35.120
and for here you can see we have these can type and see what percent percentage.

00:35.120 --> 00:36.710
So for example percentage.

00:36.750 --> 00:38.390
And we have about 20 percent.

00:38.450 --> 00:42.470
These come in you having your card at $100.

00:42.470 --> 00:50.030
The only person is going to be these kind of $20 that you can fix this guy and maybe you want to give

00:50.030 --> 00:52.480
a discount of $10.

00:52.490 --> 00:57.250
It doesn't matter if the user has $50 or $100.

00:57.440 --> 01:02.340
Play the coupon they are going to say $10 in both ways.

01:02.370 --> 01:04.370
And finally we have the fix.

01:04.680 --> 01:06.870
So fix it and they fix the problem.

01:06.900 --> 01:07.660
This can't.

01:07.710 --> 01:14.520
So maybe you can apply these come to a specific brokes Maybe you have some brokes that they are not

01:14.520 --> 01:17.960
being sell in the last months or weeks.

01:18.230 --> 01:20.850
And you can perform so on these cards too.

01:20.910 --> 01:24.390
That is specific brokes and not on the card.

01:24.390 --> 01:29.730
For example the fix it got in percentage This guns bought out of these guns.

01:29.820 --> 01:36.930
So the entire card in the case of these these will perform the viscount in a specific products in this

01:36.930 --> 01:40.000
case we want to use that person touch these called.

01:40.080 --> 01:46.080
So we're going to any person race you and I you can see we have a lot of reshipping.

01:46.280 --> 01:47.260
Check this box.

01:47.300 --> 01:49.500
The coupon grants free shipping.

01:49.760 --> 01:56.530
So you can create as a coupon for free shipping and you can add the expiration date right here.

01:58.110 --> 02:07.860
So maybe for a lounge and you can create a coupon maybe you can have one week or something something

02:07.860 --> 02:14.720
like this and what you want to publish they keep on AD So for example right here you can see that your

02:14.800 --> 02:19.300
search interest directions and you can see the kind of the spend.

02:19.390 --> 02:27.720
So you can for example at $100 and then you can apply these coupons and deny that the maximum.

02:27.840 --> 02:34.000
So that's a right that you can see that we have check this box if the coupon cannot be used in conjunction

02:34.180 --> 02:35.830
with other coupons.

02:35.830 --> 02:40.190
So maybe you have different coupons in your website bad.

02:40.830 --> 02:45.450
You only want that you can exchange only when coupon in this case.

02:45.450 --> 02:47.620
This one got her nest back 20.

02:48.030 --> 02:58.050
So you can check these and you can also see that we have check this box if the coupon sure should not

02:58.920 --> 03:00.670
apply to items on sale.

03:00.780 --> 03:07.220
So maybe you already have some guidance on said they are really really cheap and you don't want to have

03:07.290 --> 03:14.620
some extra discussions to have those pacy robes and of course you can apply this coupon to specific

03:14.620 --> 03:17.910
products or exclude some specific products.

03:17.960 --> 03:23.840
I play these coupons to some categories so as to scroll some categories everything you can't control

03:23.870 --> 03:24.370
right.

03:24.490 --> 03:27.020
You then you have to use such limits.

03:27.140 --> 03:35.990
You can for example I love the you said only to Jay-Z's once or two times or 20 on the might of times.

03:36.230 --> 03:37.140
It's up to you.

03:37.270 --> 03:42.990
And that's who you are if you want to apply these to all the items in the cart or the limit that a user

03:43.550 --> 03:50.630
Normally I keep this is the false day of using these coupons is that we can sell everything but maybe

03:50.870 --> 03:54.260
you have some rules maybe you don't want to.

03:54.560 --> 04:03.080
Maybe you want to add these cons to some specific products and so you only want to limit the usage of

04:03.080 --> 04:08.310
this coupon to only one client or one time per client.

04:08.570 --> 04:10.170
That's up to you.

04:10.220 --> 04:17.900
So all of these and you can see this is like the gold companies and up in the front and so we can apply

04:17.900 --> 04:20.750
this coupon and see this in action.

04:20.750 --> 04:28.730
So we're going up and the Stallworth's are going to take these Bukhara and they're going to add something.

04:28.760 --> 04:30.770
So we can see these.

04:31.030 --> 04:38.520
I don't know for rates year of the day that and you can see for example we have one candidate in four

04:38.530 --> 04:46.190
in one hundred and forty five dollars that you can click on coupon go and apply the coupon.

04:46.250 --> 04:51.630
So now you can see we have the discount savings plan in nine dollars.

04:51.650 --> 04:58.740
That's something nice and you can see we're saving a good amount of money in this way.

04:58.980 --> 05:02.220
You use that again probably to check out Mbaye that amount.

05:02.460 --> 05:03.720
That's something really nice.

05:04.500 --> 05:09.490
So a blog with the coupons you will find different rules right here something that you can apply.

05:09.620 --> 05:17.570
So play with the coupons you will find these really really powerful in looks like they think you know

05:17.570 --> 05:22.670
these are nurturers that you come face to play with these options are you having the coupons you will

05:22.670 --> 05:25.460
