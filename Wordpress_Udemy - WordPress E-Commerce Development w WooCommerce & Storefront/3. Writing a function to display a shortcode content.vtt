00:04.300 --> 00:07.090
So let's see if you can create a charcoal.

00:07.330 --> 00:14.080
It's really common that if you instill in wordpress they provide some articles that you can use for

00:14.080 --> 00:16.520
example contact forms and everything.

00:16.540 --> 00:20.040
They will create a shortcut that you can copy and paste.

00:20.140 --> 00:28.550
For example in the content area of a page or a blog entry so that you can create your own article.

00:28.630 --> 00:35.160
We're going to create a common creates and short code to display this later.

00:35.540 --> 00:38.740
Then we're going to get another quote COME IN WHAT DO NOT USE.

00:38.750 --> 00:47.530
And that's something I'd love to see is lighter so why don't I create a function and it's going to be

00:47.540 --> 00:47.740
there.

00:47.760 --> 00:58.680
Lucy SlideShare underscore charcoal and Kidwai are going to hook these into charcoal a little different.

00:58.870 --> 01:00.160
Then you add the name.

01:00.160 --> 01:02.240
The name is going to be the use that we added right.

01:02.240 --> 01:02.520
Yes.

01:02.530 --> 01:04.340
We're used to this is like that.

01:04.690 --> 01:08.490
And then the name of the function.

01:08.500 --> 01:12.070
So next we're going to have it go from there.

01:12.110 --> 01:19.660
Charcoals and you can see that we have this is that this is the way that you use these.

01:19.680 --> 01:30.470
So next about going up in the theme going up in there will be content themes that are in this bag for

01:30.490 --> 01:33.150
insurance.

01:33.340 --> 01:39.120
And if you remember we own you the scoop on that we have here is the section right here are going to

01:39.120 --> 01:45.310
select everything and we're going to it and we'll come and we're going to come in those lines save these

01:45.710 --> 01:49.590
and roll out the front end and you can see that we have these.

01:49.810 --> 01:57.440
We're going to click here on this section and for example when I remove these you see match

02:01.910 --> 02:04.600
remove the future match right here.

02:04.760 --> 02:07.870
And if you open the door this is like there.

02:08.070 --> 02:11.520
Copy these charcoal and paste right here.

02:11.630 --> 02:14.840
Now you can update and read all the front and

02:18.280 --> 02:22.710
and you can see that we have kilo from the charcoal is printed out so these welcome.

02:22.720 --> 02:29.600
We're going to remove these upcoming barriers but you can see Prince from charcoal.

02:30.040 --> 02:35.550
So now everything that we are in in these short code is going to be connected right here.

02:36.500 --> 02:50.410
So for example let's say that we have another line be back or Morganton and reload.

02:50.440 --> 02:52.630
You can see we've got something like this.

02:52.870 --> 02:55.840
And we can remove these with some success.

02:55.850 --> 03:05.990
So for example we can just bag these and we have these here and we have it in the home page so we can

03:05.990 --> 03:09.840
get something in this thread that's Yesus

03:13.060 --> 03:20.120
maybe here we can add something they call them and drearier and display.

03:20.140 --> 03:24.360
None Sordello these.

03:24.580 --> 03:29.250
And you can see them a couple of from my Sharikov and Morganton and everything is working.

03:29.250 --> 03:31.240
I suspect that.

03:31.350 --> 03:39.410
So this way we can continue working with our low Criseyde to display the entries.

03:41.260 --> 03:43.700
And we're going to continue with this in the next video.
