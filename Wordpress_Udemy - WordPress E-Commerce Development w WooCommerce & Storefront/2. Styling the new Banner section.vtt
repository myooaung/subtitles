WEBVTT

00:04.100 --> 00:06.170
So let's finish this section.

00:07.230 --> 00:13.630
We're going to style these and these have the functionality doesn't link to anything that's the idea

00:13.660 --> 00:14.410
of these.

00:14.490 --> 00:17.940
It's only when you are scrolling to see these messages.

00:18.300 --> 00:21.330
And then if you continue scrolling you will find the blog.

00:21.470 --> 00:28.310
We're going to use the blog as a marketing tool for this website but also it's going to be really important.

00:28.350 --> 00:35.830
I'm going to show you how to integrate the Reiffel post post type that comes in wordpress with combers.

00:35.970 --> 00:40.550
That's going to be really come on in your life as a developer.

00:40.600 --> 00:42.250
So let's finish these fears.

00:42.370 --> 00:43.960
So that's up in our project.

00:44.320 --> 00:53.660
And again I'm going to open these on the right and I think I'm thinking when I open Speedwriting and

00:53.670 --> 00:57.690
rescue.

00:57.910 --> 01:07.480
So what are going to have and we can see that we have these banners boil and then we have these that

01:07.530 --> 01:17.020
he going at age 3 and they're going to be using phone family in the break could have from family you

01:17.020 --> 01:18.340
can see this is a fun family.

01:18.340 --> 01:22.430
Laura So say it isn't Willow

01:26.190 --> 01:33.940
looking better but you can see it previously in the age 3.

01:34.050 --> 01:41.160
Uppercase one of them here I'm going to it in this forum and I'm going out and on.

01:41.280 --> 01:46.530
So we're going to remove that uppercase transformation that we added previously.

01:46.530 --> 01:48.950
Now you can see looking nice.

01:49.180 --> 01:55.700
And that's going to have formed wait for a candidate if you remember we added in the fortune that the

01:55.700 --> 02:01.310
HP dongle phones we added Laura at 400 and sent in Canada.

02:01.690 --> 02:04.280
So in this case they went to use the 400.

02:04.640 --> 02:05.260
Wait.

02:05.380 --> 02:10.380
So relo looking better I think.

02:10.510 --> 02:20.360
So we're going to have one size maybe at 3 a.m. and see how this looks and it's looking nice.

02:20.360 --> 02:22.910
We went big phone right here.

02:22.910 --> 02:26.070
So we're going either way the media on the screen.

02:26.460 --> 02:27.980
I man with

02:30.500 --> 02:33.600
760 B-cells.

02:33.660 --> 02:36.730
And again we're going to copy these based.

02:37.290 --> 02:44.830
It's going to be columns for an columns A.

02:44.950 --> 02:57.910
So again we're going to use float length and zoonotic with and maybe we want to use the 3.3 percent

02:58.530 --> 03:05.450
in a body and right when them we're going to copy these babies right here.

03:05.520 --> 03:12.760
Maybe it's going to be sixty six point six percent and we're going to remove these.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.880
So really you can see it's looking nice.

03:18.980 --> 03:25.580
And when we're in this month the base is looking in it's looking better but we need to we can make these

03:25.580 --> 03:26.310
better.

03:26.360 --> 03:28.900
For example I'm going to six or nine.

03:29.100 --> 03:34.800
And so is going to be center on the screen is looking nice you can see where to scroll down and then

03:34.800 --> 03:37.020
we find these message.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.290
That's nice if we make these bigger.

03:39.330 --> 03:40.390
I went to the ladies toilet.

03:40.400 --> 03:40.710
Right.

03:40.710 --> 03:49.320
So we're gonna have the media quality when I copy the selector page right here.

03:49.340 --> 03:52.600
We have another three six or nine in this case is meant to be.

03:52.610 --> 03:53.360
Right.

03:54.950 --> 04:07.190
So we don't look nice and maybe right here I can make this a little bigger maybe pinpoint for

04:10.300 --> 04:15.870
something that I've been looks closer to what we were expecting.

04:17.460 --> 04:19.900
And maybe we can increase the padding here.

04:19.960 --> 04:21.240
You're going to make these three

04:25.590 --> 04:27.720
it is looking better.

04:29.570 --> 04:31.430
So this is looking very nice being

04:34.400 --> 04:41.620
and for me this is Madlib you can see this is in response the and is looking great.

04:42.880 --> 04:48.150
So in the next video let let's see how we can raise there some things with advanced custom fields will

04:48.230 --> 04:50.220
display these more dynamically.
