00:04.580 --> 00:08.660
So next let's review that tax time that we have right here.

00:08.670 --> 00:11.690
And of course I'm another expert in taxes.

00:11.700 --> 00:16.600
I recommend that you check their taxes with a professional in taxes.

00:17.630 --> 00:21.950
So for example we have the tax options and you can see that we have two options.

00:22.220 --> 00:29.870
If you're going to enter price inclusive of tax or exclusive of tax so you can stay right here and when

00:29.870 --> 00:35.740
you saw these questions mounted you can overheat and you can give them information about these.

00:35.920 --> 00:41.140
Then for example we have the calculate dates based on the customer should now.

00:41.550 --> 00:47.280
Maybe you have your store in California and the client is from New York and you have to pay different

00:47.280 --> 00:48.180
taxes.

00:48.210 --> 00:51.760
So this is the way that you can collect those taxes.

00:51.780 --> 00:57.150
And the idea is that really not this sort of shipping knowledge is then you can carry that class for

00:57.150 --> 01:05.740
the shipping tax classes so you can you can charge taxes in the shipping and then you kept some of that

01:05.740 --> 01:06.110
option.

01:06.120 --> 01:10.100
So I think that the full stroke a grace you.

01:10.360 --> 01:16.690
So there you have this done that a rate for example right here that you can create a lot of different

01:16.690 --> 01:17.320
taxes.

01:17.350 --> 01:23.800
For example you have local taxes and you have state taxes and then you have federal federal taxes you

01:23.800 --> 01:29.800
can create all of them right here so you can create a table of taxes and they are going to be added

01:29.980 --> 01:32.630
automatically into your probe's.

01:32.830 --> 01:36.790
You can read those grades which were really really similar.

01:37.060 --> 01:40.840
And we also have this zero rate grades.

01:40.870 --> 01:48.190
I recommend that you check with a professional in taxes maybe you are rogues that you one maybe the

01:48.190 --> 01:55.630
pros that you went to said no income to pay taxes or maybe you are not charging in taxes and that's

01:55.630 --> 01:56.750
mandatory.

01:57.100 --> 02:02.800
So in order to avoid having problems with the law I recommend that you check out these with a professional

02:02.800 --> 02:03.560
in taxes.
