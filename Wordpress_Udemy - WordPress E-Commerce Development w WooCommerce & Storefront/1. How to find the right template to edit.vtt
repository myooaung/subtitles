So hard to find the right template that is printing something where commerce can be a little tricky

00:10.250 --> 00:14.380
and I'm going to show you the easiest way to find the correct template.

00:14.400 --> 00:20.270
So for example if I open the cover and I open the lid because then blue jeans and then we open combers

00:21.130 --> 00:25.440
you will find these templates folder and it contains a lot of different files.

00:25.500 --> 00:27.020
Funny Ray files.

00:27.120 --> 00:29.050
It's going to be a little complex.

00:29.490 --> 00:33.480
Thankfully there are some proteins that are going to make this easier.

00:33.510 --> 00:40.130
One of the most powerful proteins to something like this is combers

00:43.990 --> 00:50.940
and I mean are not new and then going to other newcomer's them play and sing and I said for commerce

00:50.960 --> 00:51.950
and play pipiens

00:55.930 --> 00:59.510
going to be is when you can see right here and we're going to install these

01:02.430 --> 01:11.290
and activate the blue once you activate the plug in you will you have to up and running and reload and

01:11.300 --> 01:16.130
you will notice that we have these messages in great that they look like an alert.

01:16.130 --> 01:20.930
So for example let's say you want to make some changes in the search word in the search box.

01:21.870 --> 01:23.950
You can see that say it's a template.

01:23.990 --> 01:31.200
It's just look search form if your pen for example will combers templates you will find these Prolixin

01:31.220 --> 01:32.050
from right.

01:33.790 --> 01:39.970
Another example if I just couldn't a little gray here for example in these categories you can see this

01:39.970 --> 01:41.340
one is called content.

01:41.440 --> 01:45.020
But I'll cut in again if you open these.

01:45.130 --> 01:50.530
You will find these files right here at and so you can read these messages.

01:50.530 --> 01:56.470
For example I can go over here now you can see this bowl with non-information and it will print their

01:56.480 --> 01:58.970
route for these for this file.

01:58.970 --> 02:01.040
You can see these applications ma'am.

02:01.090 --> 02:03.430
The dogs will combers all be content.

02:03.760 --> 02:09.970
Blue jeans Gomer's templates and look search form.

02:10.100 --> 02:15.140
So let's say that we want to make some changes in the product search form so we can for example up is

02:15.200 --> 02:21.170
fine and you can see that this template can be overridden by copying to your team commerce impro looks

02:21.280 --> 02:22.030
for.

02:22.400 --> 02:23.780
So we're going to copy this filename

02:26.470 --> 02:34.610
and then we're now up in teams Caterina's by newcomer's and we're going to out there to Roseta then

02:34.610 --> 02:37.540
we're going to copy the contents copy and paste.

02:37.580 --> 02:39.010
Now we can this one.

02:39.230 --> 02:42.840
And now we have a safe copy of this template.

02:42.860 --> 02:50.420
So for example if you skip this step in the next update of newcomer's you will miss everything.

02:50.420 --> 02:53.120
Never make some changes in this fight.

02:53.240 --> 02:56.940
You have to copy them in your team.

02:57.080 --> 03:04.810
So if I know here you can see these ISim blue collar that means we successfully Obery in the body and

03:04.820 --> 03:05.680
fine.

03:06.170 --> 03:11.370
So next let's say you can see it's this place called the research program.

03:11.510 --> 03:15.460
Let's say that you are selling services not products.

03:15.530 --> 03:22.170
Maybe you went up in these and right here on the input type search you can scroll to the right and you

03:22.170 --> 03:26.380
will find this place holder and it says Search brokes.

03:26.520 --> 03:31.330
Maybe you want to change these two search services or something.

03:31.350 --> 03:36.620
This is a safe way to make that change and you can say you we have search services.

03:36.810 --> 03:42.170
If you're selling services or reservations you can change that value right there.

03:42.450 --> 03:44.030
And this is the easiest way.

03:44.470 --> 03:48.750
And then next week we're going to continue making some changes to the search for what we're going to

03:48.750 --> 03:53.140
make some changes you've seen ceases to change the appearance of the search button.

03:53.280 --> 04:00.300
Once you're finished with them Platys you're connecting with the Brooklyn and activate again when you

04:00.300 --> 04:05.000
need to find the right template for certain sections of your website.
