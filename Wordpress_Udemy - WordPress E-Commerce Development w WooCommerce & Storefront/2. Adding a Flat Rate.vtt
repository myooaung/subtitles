00:04.610 --> 00:11.400
So now our shipping zones what are going to add some ship in methods to the United States.

00:11.400 --> 00:12.450
I'm going to click here on the

00:15.500 --> 00:17.990
at the bottom you can see that we have our shipping method.

00:18.170 --> 00:27.160
So for example let's say here you can take the cart and I'm going to take you and check out and from

00:27.160 --> 00:33.090
here we're going to scroll it a little and you can see what I have for example United States or I have

00:33.210 --> 00:36.550
another country let's say Spain and everything.

00:36.550 --> 00:40.830
And you can see that we are not charging the shipping.

00:41.340 --> 00:45.250
So let's start working with the United States and then the other should be in metal.

00:45.390 --> 00:49.990
From here you can see it like flat rate free shipping or look at pick up.

00:50.010 --> 00:57.400
So that's the flat rate for years now shipping and from here you can click it on any and you can have

00:57.400 --> 00:59.550
the name of title flat rate.

00:59.890 --> 01:03.100
You can decide if you want taxes here or not.

01:03.550 --> 01:10.610
And you can add the cost in this case and it's had $10 say changes and that's up and I get that check

01:10.610 --> 01:13.400
out Rydell.

01:13.440 --> 01:17.970
Now you can see for example if they open this band you can see that we have there are no shipping methods.

01:17.970 --> 01:24.090
We're going to fix that in the upcoming years but there's this Jay-Zs to the United States and now you

01:24.090 --> 01:31.030
can see we have 3 $10 but our limits for example is really come on.

01:31.180 --> 01:37.670
You can see that we only have one item but let's say that the U.S. is buying 20 of they they got that

01:37.860 --> 01:43.380
that said something like three because they're stock is three.

01:43.420 --> 01:49.660
You can see if I click here on a set checkout you can see that we're charging them.

01:49.810 --> 01:55.420
So maybe I will not charge based on the amount of probes that the U.S. has in the card.

01:55.690 --> 01:57.660
So you can open again the flat rate.

01:57.700 --> 01:58.820
You don't get it.

01:59.140 --> 02:04.290
And if you go over here on the question mark you can as you can see some examples.

02:04.300 --> 02:14.090
So for example you're going out then dimes in say square brackets you have granted the save the changes

02:14.650 --> 02:18.620
and relo.

02:18.730 --> 02:22.250
So now you can see the flat rate is still $2.

02:22.270 --> 02:28.350
So you can play with these values and you can decide how much you want to charge for shipping.

02:29.190 --> 02:30.510
So again I'm going to go over here.

02:30.510 --> 02:35.470
You can see that we have with the coast and right here in Sac is quite a racket.

02:35.470 --> 02:40.090
You know the bottom and so we have another shot called.

02:40.120 --> 02:49.210
So for example you can also charge ghost dimes and maybe you will not charge that 10 percent of the

02:49.660 --> 02:56.580
amount of money that this guy or this person is trying to purchase from their website.

02:56.600 --> 03:07.130
So it is really a lane and you can see the problem with the dollars where Chalion flattery of $3 of

03:07.140 --> 03:10.600
cards you can play with these values and you will have a better approach.

03:10.870 --> 03:16.810
So this is how you either flat rate your e-commerce Web site and we're going to continue working with

03:16.810 --> 03:24.240
these shipping zones and she'd been Mehta's that we have added in the next medius.
