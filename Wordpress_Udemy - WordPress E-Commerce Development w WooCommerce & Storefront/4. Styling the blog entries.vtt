WEBVTT

00:04.220 --> 00:06.270
So let's continue reading the section.

00:06.560 --> 00:09.650
And in this video we're going to style everything.

00:09.690 --> 00:13.770
And at the end of the video we will have something like these.

00:13.840 --> 00:18.600
So it's been already thought and I'm going to split these two right.

00:18.640 --> 00:19.700
Scroll to the bottom.

00:20.580 --> 00:22.280
And we're going to have you come in.

00:22.280 --> 00:29.170
We're going to have beach blog entries.

00:29.320 --> 00:35.420
And then when that's on MySpace so we can see read it so you can see that we added this page.

00:35.440 --> 00:42.260
BLOCK entries and this is going to be the pattern selector we're going either margin up and maybe 20

00:42.260 --> 00:43.250
pixels.

00:43.410 --> 00:47.850
Captain separationist and you can see that didn't work.

00:47.850 --> 00:50.970
For example if reichlich you don't inspect.

00:51.190 --> 00:54.480
And when I use plugged right here you can see that we have a problem here.

00:54.800 --> 01:01.310
If I go over here on the homepage blog entries is expanding into this ball yourself.

01:01.640 --> 01:08.480
And this is happening because this banner this Boyle has these floats and we didn't clear the floats

01:09.370 --> 01:16.900
when I use these but at this point and I've been at them and we're looking here for after here we have

01:16.900 --> 01:18.990
some clear fix that we can use.

01:19.230 --> 01:25.010
Yeah right here we have these line which says Come get the category and then we have this clear fix.

01:25.030 --> 01:34.730
So going out of that coma and going up and another selector after right here this will fix this problem.

01:34.740 --> 01:44.870
So this is a really common problem when you load your DBs into wheel AFAIK the rest of your code.

01:44.920 --> 01:49.610
So as you know these and you can see that we have this base

01:52.470 --> 01:57.300
and now the homepage block entry is not the spining to the top.

01:57.300 --> 02:00.640
So that's come on to fix that you can make.

02:00.690 --> 02:02.940
So let's continue working with these.

02:03.030 --> 02:11.140
Scroll to the bottom and from here on when I copy these next if you remember we have this on order that

02:11.220 --> 02:13.220
is what when I remove the bullet.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.340
Nice non Ingworth.

02:15.340 --> 02:22.870
So when I remove the Madian memory and Cyril save these and reload and we remove the margin and also

02:22.900 --> 02:23.890
the bullet.

02:23.890 --> 02:25.000
That's nice.

02:25.000 --> 02:33.190
So next we're going to copy this line and I want to play these three columns next to the other ones

02:33.190 --> 02:35.400
who are going to be acquainted right here.

02:36.440 --> 02:41.250
Media on the screen and mean grit.

02:41.380 --> 02:51.900
Seven hundred sixty eight pieces and what do I call these based in three U.S. ally and one another with

02:52.590 --> 02:56.430
30 percent and MADIGAN Right.

02:57.970 --> 03:02.970
What I'm curious is why not the little one right here where we're at three point five percent.

03:03.540 --> 03:08.220
And it's going to be float to the left and I went to either.

03:08.240 --> 03:17.420
So right here you get a line based the last child I went to remove the margin on the right and Mariinsky.

03:17.760 --> 03:25.260
So this way we will have three different lights with the percent and then we're going to have these

03:26.300 --> 03:30.960
7 percent because we are removing the margin on the right on the last item.

03:31.500 --> 03:34.380
So save these hand reload.

03:34.580 --> 03:39.240
Now you can see we have the three columns and it's looking better.

03:39.240 --> 03:41.300
So again we need to outsource here.

03:41.310 --> 03:51.520
I'm going to copy these and I need to have the again make a search for the BE CLEAR freaks.

03:51.890 --> 04:00.760
So we're going to have them right here taken out another comma and after I had so always when you're

04:00.770 --> 04:09.010
working with floats you have to clear your flops and right here you can see now the edge two is working

04:09.010 --> 04:14.520
great and the lights are working great Scott to have one of my gain.

04:14.710 --> 04:16.110
And let's continue working.

04:16.360 --> 04:21.220
So next for example if you take a look at into the sign and separation between these Tyrolean these

04:21.310 --> 04:28.470
images and what are going to be these bays right here and we cover a lie.

04:28.910 --> 04:35.560
So to prevent that these well or this electorate is throwing a lot I remove these and I'm going to target

04:35.570 --> 04:36.410
them.

04:36.500 --> 04:43.340
We only have one image to one of when I use these and I'm going to mark in bottom of one and save these

04:43.340 --> 04:45.680
and reload.

04:45.770 --> 04:47.860
Now you can see we have some separation here.

04:48.920 --> 04:56.630
So next for example I have these H2 and they have these in the title so we can copy these on page blog

04:56.660 --> 05:01.200
entries dot and then the title and what we're going to use.

05:01.200 --> 05:09.340
Fun sites where I'm born for AM and what are going to use from family and we're going to pass LaRocco

05:09.340 --> 05:11.020
my Sunseri.

05:11.820 --> 05:15.790
And finally I'm going out one way and this game is going to be non-candidate.

05:16.170 --> 05:21.250
So save this and reload and this is looking nicer.

05:21.600 --> 05:29.090
I'm going to have a text transform now because we have out of all that the variance with that text transform

05:29.110 --> 05:31.540
and look you can see now is looking better.

05:31.560 --> 05:35.790
This one contains a lot of text in the in the title but that's fine.

05:35.820 --> 05:36.960
Not every problem.

05:37.970 --> 05:44.560
So let's continue working now if you take a look at these and we have these entry contd so we can get

05:44.560 --> 05:54.930
that home page blog entries and 3 content and then we have their back up where we have these by the

05:54.970 --> 06:04.680
I mean on the bottom we have the canteen so we can use the selector to align left reload

06:09.140 --> 06:12.690
and Gracedieu we can have a lot of the

06:20.270 --> 06:22.700
because we didn't have that by there.

06:24.370 --> 06:31.000
Now because he's working the rate and if it looks like any of the sign and separation in these bath

06:31.000 --> 06:39.710
I mean and they can and then we have these indicate that there is one of these home page log entries

06:39.740 --> 06:41.310
and then we get it.

06:41.550 --> 06:53.620
And then when I bought them again I am save these Indranil and use this is looking better and of course

06:53.620 --> 06:58.980
you can see what you're seeing when embracing one embraces those who can cut these like on my right

06:58.980 --> 06:59.520
here.

06:59.820 --> 07:04.230
And apply that same line if you reload here.

07:04.400 --> 07:05.630
Nothing is going to change.

07:05.680 --> 07:06.780
It's looking great.

07:07.700 --> 07:15.350
Finally if you take a look here we have the the link and we are at these classical in 3-D ink so we

07:15.350 --> 07:23.060
can copy these again home page blog entries is way with Almayer's with all the resources and going out

07:23.360 --> 07:26.790
of it's going to be really similar to this one.

07:27.120 --> 07:36.680
So I think we can copy or cut these Komorowski so save these and reload run in.

07:36.920 --> 07:38.740
Now these read Mahdi's looking great.

07:38.870 --> 07:50.080
And then when I got the selector and I'm going to takes a line to the left say these I know now that

07:50.080 --> 08:02.660
so of these pleade block so save these and reload by the or the anchors are using display line and they

08:02.700 --> 08:10.290
have to have changes to display block plane display block is possible to align these two little.

08:10.430 --> 08:14.340
So now you can see this is looking better a lot better.

08:14.540 --> 08:17.270
For example the latest fall on the blog.

08:17.690 --> 08:19.610
I want to create more separation.

08:19.610 --> 08:21.440
You can see it really close here.

08:21.920 --> 08:23.290
So I'm going to scroll to the top.

08:24.710 --> 08:26.290
And then going I am embrace here

08:28.970 --> 08:31.760
reload.

08:31.870 --> 08:38.450
And yet if any of this is looking better we're going to copy these bays right here and could I have

08:38.480 --> 08:40.150
these.

08:40.560 --> 08:44.760
This section titled Why don't I call these.

08:44.800 --> 08:48.410
And I went for the American version of one point to him.

08:48.670 --> 08:50.300
So we had more separation here.

08:50.400 --> 08:56.970
So reload and yeah definitely it does look better if I can make these smaller and everything is going

08:56.970 --> 08:57.930
to be responsive.

09:02.680 --> 09:06.580
You can see this looking great.

09:06.760 --> 09:09.540
And you can click here and everything is going to work.

09:10.640 --> 09:13.550
Exactly as we made this big.

09:13.590 --> 09:15.120
So this is looking great.

09:15.350 --> 09:19.250
And they end up coming in because we're going to continue working with these block sections.

09:20.940 --> 09:27.000
We're on Amazon in the next video we're going to see how we can use made CIM to display a foreign Racheal

09:27.050 --> 09:29.300
on the bottom instead.

09:29.320 --> 09:32.120
Instead the farm like this one.
