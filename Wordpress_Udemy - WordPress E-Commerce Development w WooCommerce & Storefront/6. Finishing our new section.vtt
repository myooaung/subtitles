WEBVTT

00:04.150 --> 00:12.540
So just working with they created for these Web site and for this for the section and for example you

00:12.540 --> 00:18.580
can inspect right here and you will find that we have columns three columns nine so what don't going

00:18.580 --> 00:23.870
to start working with those select or so we're going to copy these.

00:24.010 --> 00:31.880
And before I start adding some code to those selectors I'm going to write me the equity on the screen

00:31.920 --> 00:41.780
and I mean with x 768 pixels and what are going on home page Conkey got they were.

00:41.810 --> 00:51.620
And we're going to have columns 3 and then we're going to pace again we're going to have columns 9 so

00:51.620 --> 00:59.620
filled for example the columns the week with 25 percent then it's going to flow to the left.

00:59.740 --> 01:08.460
And finally it's going to have a body and right of one the other ones into the with 75 percent and that's

01:08.520 --> 01:16.470
going to be float to the left so save these and reload and you can see this is looking nice.

01:16.480 --> 01:18.590
We have these on the left and these on the right.

01:19.610 --> 01:28.210
But you can see these Gropper the five is really really smart and we need to add something.

01:29.480 --> 01:30.950
We need to fix these.

01:30.950 --> 01:36.760
And this is really coming when you are working with laugh when you're working with floats.

01:37.010 --> 01:38.590
It's really come on that department.

01:38.660 --> 01:44.640
Elliman big capes and the Iberians is like this one.

01:44.660 --> 01:49.370
The good thing is that this is something that you can fix really really easily.

01:49.370 --> 01:51.200
So for example I'm going to copy these.

01:51.200 --> 01:54.050
The Baron is going to be the content right here.

01:54.470 --> 02:03.130
So we're going to copy and paste and rafted and I'm going out after and always when you are working

02:03.130 --> 02:09.470
with pseudo elements you have to have the content inside single quotes and then we're going to display

02:09.480 --> 02:12.600
table and then we're going to have a clear board.

02:12.600 --> 02:15.560
This is commonly known as a clear fix.

02:15.690 --> 02:23.320
So always when you're working with floats you have to clear the part in using these Disko that we have

02:23.320 --> 02:24.110
here.

02:24.480 --> 02:29.500
And this is what happens when you add on a clear view of floats.

02:29.520 --> 02:34.880
So if you're low right here now you can see that this is fixed.

02:35.280 --> 02:36.780
And this is look nice.

02:37.820 --> 02:46.650
So we're going to finish these and go back up with the selector and we're going to target these brogues.

02:46.820 --> 02:57.530
They are use U.S. and L.A. we add the glass broke so we're going to copy these these bad right here.

02:57.550 --> 03:00.970
Where are you seeing these companies compared to some good category.

03:01.580 --> 03:08.550
And then we're going to one page come kid category and I'm going at last

03:11.020 --> 03:15.100
Sophrony kid I'm going to have a map of the bottom.

03:15.200 --> 03:23.830
It's going to be Ciro and here that the one that is you'll see and I can close these the last child

03:23.920 --> 03:26.170
going at Madigan right.

03:26.330 --> 03:34.300
It's going to be is going to be important right here HATSELL so save these undernote and now you can

03:34.300 --> 03:37.390
see that this is looking really really nice.

03:37.390 --> 03:44.680
So of course we can make something here in the with the Madigan's with the margins and everything.

03:44.910 --> 03:50.330
You can see that we have these margins right here because 29 in a row of numbers maybe a ratio.

03:50.340 --> 03:56.770
We cannot wait to 3 percent in a margin right.

03:56.770 --> 04:00.460
Again 0.5 percent.

04:01.630 --> 04:06.980
And say these and reload and you can see he's looking great.

04:08.440 --> 04:15.310
And of course you can play with these values you can either do two that's going to be or percent right

04:15.310 --> 04:15.780
here.

04:18.840 --> 04:20.680
And get us looking nice.

04:20.700 --> 04:22.890
And since we added this in the media if I may.

04:22.890 --> 04:25.150
This is malheur.

04:25.230 --> 04:29.270
You can see that the content flow is really nice and we have something like this.

04:30.330 --> 04:38.180
So maybe right here we can add some myspace I scroll to the top here and another Margolin bottom of

04:38.300 --> 04:38.720
Wim

04:42.940 --> 04:46.480
you can see who has and separationist you can close these.

04:46.580 --> 04:49.260
And now you can see we have something like this.

04:49.290 --> 04:51.570
So this is looking really nice in my opinion.

04:51.900 --> 04:55.670
And this is the way that you work with something like this.

04:55.740 --> 05:00.620
First if you remember we added this function to the database.

05:00.960 --> 05:08.580
And here we're seeing a lot of different functionality comer's we are writing a hook then we're using

05:08.580 --> 05:11.280
the shortcuts that commerce provides.

05:11.290 --> 05:14.080
That is the complete list in this page.

05:14.370 --> 05:19.140
And then we're using some sense to make this look really really nice.

05:19.920 --> 05:22.770
Here you can see we have the Bronx in your country here.

05:23.180 --> 05:26.570
And this will help in the product category with computers.

05:26.690 --> 05:30.900
This will display all the categories and Rachida games.

05:31.020 --> 05:34.110
If I scroll to the top you can see that we upload a page.

05:34.170 --> 05:39.600
And when I select everything in here I'm going to click it on it and it will comments what I want to

05:39.600 --> 05:41.170
commend that line.

05:41.220 --> 05:45.130
Now you can reload and I you can see a couple of the Prague's.

05:45.290 --> 05:52.250
This was also the code I was showing that something that you can make with using filters started up

05:52.250 --> 05:53.810
and again the front end.

05:54.360 --> 05:58.710
And yeah definitely I think these these are 90 studies looking great.

05:58.710 --> 06:01.040
In my opinion of course.

06:01.210 --> 06:06.850
So in the next video you can see we have almost everything in the next video we're going to see how

06:06.860 --> 06:14.820
you can add something like these into your into the page and it's going to be right after the bestseller's

06:15.230 --> 06:15.910
right here.

06:16.050 --> 06:18.000
So let's see if you can do that in the next video.
