So this video we're going to have the last piece to finish this log in screen.

00:09.920 --> 00:11.550
And right now it is looking great.

00:11.640 --> 00:15.010

00:15.010 --> 00:19.550

00:19.570 --> 00:25.690
This will take you to the Word Press that that our Web site it will be a good idea to click here and

00:25.690 --> 00:31.390
take you to the to the home of the store or the Kamo of your website.

00:31.410 --> 00:34.730
So we're going to have a function function Catalina's back.

00:34.830 --> 00:35.700
Really.

00:39.270 --> 00:40.320
Oregon or something like that.

00:40.320 --> 00:41.520
And we're other action.

00:41.590 --> 00:47.910
This is called unsnarl that actually is a feeder because what we see and what don't actually is something

00:47.910 --> 00:49.900
that already exist.

00:50.040 --> 00:57.360
So I'm not learning on their score share your read copy and paste these

00:59.980 --> 01:05.090

01:20.650 --> 01:22.760
So or a screen is looking great.

01:22.780 --> 01:24.040
This is one of them.

01:24.190 --> 01:26.730
So the screen is looking great.

01:26.760 --> 01:32.590
Clients love when you make something like these changing the screen to something like this gives the

01:32.620 --> 01:38.150
client the feeling of something that is specifically done for them.

01:38.380 --> 01:42.700
So you can see it's looking great and the code was really easy to create.
