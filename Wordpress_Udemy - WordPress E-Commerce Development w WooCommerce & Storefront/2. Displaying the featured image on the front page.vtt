00:04.130 --> 00:11.280
Sundays with to remove this welcome message for example right here and you have to be logged in to see

00:11.280 --> 00:12.430
this vote on.

00:12.570 --> 00:19.710
You can click here on this section and you can remove the stakes.

00:19.910 --> 00:26.040
That is a welcome text of course if you decide you have something like this on you you can make the

00:26.040 --> 00:27.100
changes right here.

00:27.390 --> 00:34.830
In my case I went to these ladies good coupon we are launching this online store and we want to tell

00:34.830 --> 00:37.640
everybody that they can use this coupon.

00:38.130 --> 00:43.100
So instead of the match right here we're going to add this as a feature the match.

00:43.140 --> 00:49.860
We're going to click it on said Fitri match and then I'm going to upload that.

00:50.010 --> 00:55.860
So you can see in the course materials that I have provided on the brokes folder you will find this

00:55.860 --> 01:02.780
coupon that J-P so they can write to the media library and then said If you truly match then we're going

01:02.780 --> 01:11.840
out of the these and let's reload the front in so you can see that these displays a coupon buy.

01:11.870 --> 01:18.850
This is really weird because these are styling it has these tags on the top and they are it is a style

01:18.850 --> 01:21.450
and this is in this book chateau.

01:21.590 --> 01:25.720
Of course if you want to display the match here with this background.

01:25.790 --> 01:29.470
This could be something nice for you to design.

01:30.420 --> 01:37.420
In my case I went to remove everything and on the display they match with the coupon.

01:37.470 --> 01:44.410
So I went up and they're called and Racheal on the functions here what I to go write a small function

01:45.660 --> 01:51.040
that will remove these text this content and these will display the feature the match.

01:51.150 --> 01:59.520
So first if I click on simple show hooks and I do a show action hooks Fidge you will find that the home

01:59.520 --> 02:01.890
page is using this page.

02:01.930 --> 02:07.560
And so we need to remove this storefront underscore home page content.

02:07.740 --> 02:14.800
We are going up in are called and Rachel on the bottom I cannot remove.

02:15.200 --> 02:16.200
They can then

02:19.530 --> 02:26.130
can pitch Gunton text and display that feature match.

02:26.170 --> 02:32.590
So what going to write that function with one churn or in S by underscore home page content.

02:35.050 --> 02:43.680
And then we're going to hook these into the neat hook then we're going I bassis right here.

02:47.410 --> 02:50.000
And what going out on the site then.

02:50.280 --> 02:56.980
Are we going to remove these then we're going to remove action so we can get rid of these decks.

02:57.090 --> 03:00.330
And if you remember this is the homepage.

03:00.510 --> 03:01.320
This is the hook.

03:01.320 --> 03:07.060
So we're going to copy these says remove action than his home page complete.

03:07.280 --> 03:10.950
Remember in the second parameter is the name of their function.

03:10.950 --> 03:18.260
In this case it's a start from home page and so save these and I'm going to make this page right here

03:18.260 --> 03:19.160
so you can see better.

03:19.160 --> 03:22.700
They go on the list on the center of the screen.

03:23.530 --> 03:30.910
And reload received so you can see that we get rid of the tags but we also get rid of the match.

03:30.910 --> 03:34.820
I'm going to stop showing the actual books.

03:35.080 --> 03:41.960
So we need to find a way to display that image this image that we had in here on the feature you match.

03:42.010 --> 03:50.400
We're going to write another fun show and another one from betterness back underscore home page on those

03:50.590 --> 03:57.550
coupon and with uncuffed to hook these We're going to call this one right here.

03:57.650 --> 04:01.810
So we're going out our action homepage again.

04:02.770 --> 04:07.750
And you can page remember this this the page the current page of where this plane and then we're going

04:07.750 --> 04:11.200
to hook these right here.

04:11.390 --> 04:17.990
And remember the position if I click here on this show action hooks remember that the priority that

04:17.990 --> 04:25.220
we are setting here these 22 that the 40 is the position that this is going to be display.

04:25.360 --> 04:31.610
The bigger the number is the section is going to be display at the bottom.

04:31.790 --> 04:35.120
The manager the number is it's going to be displayed on the top.

04:35.300 --> 04:40.940
So we're going to stop showing actual crooks right here and we're going to bring these out.

04:40.980 --> 04:46.810
Then these storefront which contain glass then also.

04:46.850 --> 04:51.250
So we're going to use the same number the same priority.

04:51.270 --> 05:00.080
Now we're going to have a go right here and we're going out with the glass main content and we're going

05:00.080 --> 05:07.930
out closing the end break and I'm going out think they post dominated the post so it is a fun show and

05:07.970 --> 05:12.240
that WordPress provides to bring these features in much.

05:12.320 --> 05:14.290
So now we're going to reload again.

05:15.470 --> 05:22.520
And you can see that we have the coupon right here at Sofaer was using these hooks and these functions

05:23.180 --> 05:30.680
we removed that page content and then we were right or wrong function to display only the coupon that

05:30.680 --> 05:32.160
we have added right here.

05:32.630 --> 05:38.210
So we're going to continue practicing a lot with these kooks you don't have to worry for anything.

05:38.210 --> 05:44.280
The idea here is that you understand if you're comfortable with writing these functions and remove any

05:44.290 --> 05:50.180
actions and inactions and that's understand the priority the priority is the position where this is

05:50.180 --> 05:51.170
going to be printed.

05:51.440 --> 05:58.820
So for example if I had the right here these are going to be displayed on the bottom 40 is that a bigger

05:58.820 --> 06:02.630
number is going to send these to the bottom of the page.

06:05.340 --> 06:07.070
And maybe we can increase this badly

06:09.950 --> 06:17.190
here that it isn't the number that will display these in the correct position.

06:18.010 --> 06:24.240
So we need to have for example right here in the main content and then up in the stand that when I scroll

06:24.300 --> 06:25.470
a little right here.

06:26.680 --> 06:31.930
And I'm going to Page mean content and I'm going another matter thought maybe one of them might even

06:31.930 --> 06:32.970
bottom.

06:33.180 --> 06:40.290
So when Im sorry relo And I you can see we have some nice separation right here and maybe we can increase

06:40.290 --> 06:48.800
the number to two involved reload and you can see he's looking great.

06:50.390 --> 06:55.490
So in the next video we're going to continue working with this Web site.

06:55.530 --> 06:56.540
This is looking nice.

06:56.530 --> 07:00.330
We're going to start working with these categories that we have right here.

07:00.780 --> 07:06.660
We only have to make changes that display this the way that we need to.
