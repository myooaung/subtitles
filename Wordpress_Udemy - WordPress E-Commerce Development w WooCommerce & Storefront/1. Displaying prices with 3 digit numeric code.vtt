00:04.000 --> 00:08.290
So let's continue customizing the pages of these commers website.

00:08.650 --> 00:17.590
So for example you can see that in the previews adjustments combers settings for example and I'm going

00:17.590 --> 00:19.920
to close these.

00:19.970 --> 00:26.910
Here you can see that we have the base location and we have added the currency United States dollars.

00:27.580 --> 00:33.400
Bob for example if you opened the front page you can see that we have $5 fight right here.

00:33.740 --> 00:36.960
Fifty and then another is.

00:37.050 --> 00:45.450
So maybe a good idea to display the actual currency in the front and also the other day I was trying

00:45.450 --> 00:52.530
to buy something in the Internet and then I was thinking that it was the Mexican pestles.

00:52.890 --> 01:00.900
So when I was finishing the process I saw that it was in dollars and embezzlers it was a fair price

01:00.930 --> 01:03.240
but in dollars it was a lot of money.

01:03.630 --> 01:12.100
So if you're paying Wikipedia you will find that isso four thousand two hundred seventeen.

01:12.360 --> 01:17.700
And if you scroll a little you will find the codes for the currencies.

01:17.700 --> 01:26.950
So for example in the case of America the United States dollar you can see there is Usie.

01:27.030 --> 01:33.390
So for example in the case of Mexico the best choice in XP and we have no other options.

01:33.390 --> 01:39.530
So you can see this entry and then you will find the correct code for your website.

01:39.530 --> 01:42.580
And so here in Mexico you can see is it mixed in.

01:43.080 --> 01:50.550
So what you want obviously is the next to the $5 or $50 or the price that we have here on the website.

01:51.060 --> 02:00.360
So we're going up in our 8:00 hour going up and functions breaking out a common display currency in

02:00.430 --> 02:03.260
Trico.

02:03.360 --> 02:12.670
So we're going to go write a function can read us back on the score display you as the.

02:12.690 --> 02:18.370
This one takes two parameters the symbol and the currency.

02:18.960 --> 02:23.400
And of course these parameters you can name them whatever you want but when Commerce's Gallion this

02:23.390 --> 02:28.920
function they send to two arguments to the function of course.

02:28.920 --> 02:32.620
So we're going to have a filter in here today.

02:32.900 --> 02:39.650
It's called Commerce currency symbol.

02:39.710 --> 02:45.830
Then we pass this function and then we have the priority then and then the number of arguments we're

02:45.830 --> 02:46.330
passing.

02:46.330 --> 02:50.980
Those are going to raise.

02:51.000 --> 03:00.180
So for example if you have a go free and they call Bre the closing pretax and then just somebody bump

03:00.630 --> 03:06.970
symbol you can see why they were commers is sending in the symbol barabar.

03:07.350 --> 03:09.150
So you can reload right here.

03:10.290 --> 03:15.020
And you can see that we Cambanis then we have a dollar sign right here.

03:15.420 --> 03:18.210
To see but there is a large dollar sign.

03:18.540 --> 03:24.600
And that's if you send the currency you can save this and reload and you can see that we're passing

03:24.610 --> 03:37.280
you as the so we can remove these and we can pass symbol which is a dollar sign equals to currency

03:40.310 --> 03:43.260
and that to concatenate the value.

03:43.490 --> 03:46.430
And we're going to concatenate the dollar sign.

03:47.000 --> 03:55.700
Then we read through the symbol and we can save these and reload the front in and you can see that we

03:55.940 --> 04:02.360
use the $5 and we have you as the in all the drugs.

04:02.370 --> 04:08.220
So for example you can go here in one of these and this will happen and show us the race you use the

04:08.220 --> 04:11.680
$5 and that's in the front page scenes.

04:11.680 --> 04:15.760
We hook these into the currency symbol.

04:15.790 --> 04:18.160
These will propagate these forms.

04:18.250 --> 04:25.330
In all the different places where we're printing these prices are really simple Cosmin that we can make

04:25.330 --> 04:27.180
to our website.

04:27.250 --> 04:34.140
So let's continue in the next video in more more functions like this one to improve our Web site.
