WEBVTT

00:00.090 --> 00:04.680
So now that we have instead press what will start with commerce commerce.

00:04.710 --> 00:09.050
So we are going to curriculum prudence in that new info.

00:09.050 --> 00:13.360
How do you make assets for Wu Gomer's the world all the.

00:13.370 --> 00:15.450
M..

00:15.500 --> 00:18.030
So the original concept will come right.

00:18.160 --> 00:20.550
Then we click it on install now.

00:20.730 --> 00:22.640
So we're going to activate the program.

00:22.710 --> 00:25.700
We installed the plugin then active with the plugin.

00:25.790 --> 00:31.000
Once the plane is activated it's going to open this and this is called the wheezer.

00:31.320 --> 00:34.770
Maybe sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.

00:34.770 --> 00:42.590
So let me if you have this screen you can leave this open in the case that it didn't do anything and

00:42.590 --> 00:43.450
we're now open again.

00:43.470 --> 00:50.030
It'll be out mean and from here you can find these woodland that is grown there settled without.

00:50.310 --> 00:53.040
So click here and it's going to up in the hour.

00:53.130 --> 01:01.230
Sometimes it works and once you activate the plan to open the door with and sometimes it doesn't work

01:01.470 --> 01:02.170
really well.

01:02.990 --> 01:06.720
So if you are going to ask where your store is going to be based.

01:06.890 --> 01:12.690
So I'm from Mexico City and you know Mexico rescue you out there had it is in the US.

01:12.730 --> 01:19.820
In the case I read for example you are learning CAVU will commers work and you can have any data.

01:20.300 --> 01:29.510
So let me add something like and some other is right here in the CD and so they stayed.

01:29.600 --> 01:36.460
So I'm going to feel these values I'm going to have our other poster go from here.

01:36.540 --> 01:41.900
You can see we have what currency do you accept payments.

01:42.350 --> 01:49.400
So for example we can have United State Dollars or a Ross or Mexican or something like that is something

01:49.400 --> 01:50.670
that is really important.

01:50.870 --> 01:57.890
So for example if you add a United State Dollars in them for example you switch to another currency

01:58.480 --> 02:05.150
you have to update all the products that you have in your store to match the new prices for the new

02:05.150 --> 02:06.690
currency.

02:06.770 --> 02:16.930
One quick example for example if you're selling broke of $100 and then you switch the Mexican peso what

02:16.940 --> 02:19.800
Commerce is going to charge one Mexican pesos.

02:19.950 --> 02:21.680
So you need to update the values.

02:21.750 --> 02:23.200
Something really important.

02:23.580 --> 02:30.660
So I'm going to use United State Dollars as a kid you can select if you want to sell a physical brokes

02:31.080 --> 02:35.600
something like furniture or something like fridge or something like that.

02:35.970 --> 02:44.220
Or if you want to sell little brokes maybe emerges out our the wars movies or PBS something that is

02:44.220 --> 02:45.060
digital.

02:46.480 --> 02:50.950
You can outsource a check only for physical products or only for Deedat blokes.

02:50.950 --> 02:56.180
In my case and going to show you how to create physical and the adult products for you to start sort

02:56.200 --> 02:59.540
of like the first one and then going and check these value.

02:59.670 --> 03:01.180
So let me get it on let's go.

03:01.420 --> 03:07.630
So this is going to happen the next step in the interview with her right here you can Selek which payment

03:07.630 --> 03:14.510
options you are going to set in this case Paypal is going to be added and let me check this one because

03:14.510 --> 03:17.330
I I'm not going to be adding people I can get.

03:17.350 --> 03:24.910
I'm going to show you CO-2 out a PayPal in the upcoming medias and you can also select of late payments.

03:24.920 --> 03:31.310
So for example someone can pay you with a check but also send you the money through the bank or out

03:31.490 --> 03:38.420
so they can pay in person so you can so enable these so you can see this is going to install de-friend

03:38.930 --> 03:46.200
Bruijn so you don't continue in the case that you don't want to support of land payment.

03:46.200 --> 03:48.510
You can check they are their bodies.

03:48.510 --> 03:50.590
So next we have their shipping.

03:50.910 --> 03:59.310
So let's say that someone places an order this is how or how much you are going to charge for the shipping.

03:59.310 --> 04:00.570
There are two different options.

04:00.570 --> 04:03.630
Flat rate or free shipping in flat rate.

04:03.750 --> 04:10.460
So for example someone buys a television you are going to charge for example $20 for the shipping.

04:10.620 --> 04:12.740
Thats a flat rate.

04:12.750 --> 04:17.010
The other option in some stores offer something like this is free shipping.

04:17.160 --> 04:22.140
So for example you buy the television and they are going to send a television for free so you have to

04:22.140 --> 04:25.980
decide if are going to charge a flat rate income much.

04:26.030 --> 04:33.630
And so if you're going to support a free shipping this is great for Mexico because a added store in

04:33.630 --> 04:34.740
Mexico.

04:34.910 --> 04:40.710
For example let's say that you are selling something to another country you cannot for example a flat

04:40.710 --> 04:42.990
rate of guilty or something like that.

04:43.340 --> 04:44.220
And will commerce.

04:44.220 --> 04:51.780
For example let's say you want to sell only in your country you can disable that option in the options

04:51.780 --> 04:52.480
that we have.

04:52.500 --> 05:00.130
Once we finish installing recovers so we can recover also the units for weight and for dimensions.

05:00.180 --> 05:07.820
For example a phone carrier can decide which weight units are going to be display for the probe information.

05:07.830 --> 05:15.590
For example if we're selling a really big brokes something like TVs or something like furniture or 3H

05:15.600 --> 05:22.170
or something maybe you want to have kilogrammes or or if you're in the United States you cannot bounce

05:22.620 --> 05:24.770
if you are selling as Marlboro.

05:24.810 --> 05:27.860
Maybe you want to use grams or ounces.

05:28.020 --> 05:34.470
So this is something you going to be really important because if you are libe rate Lujan for example

05:34.470 --> 05:41.590
let's say that you if someone buys a fridge the shipping for a fridge is going to be more expensive

05:42.280 --> 05:48.660
than the shipping for television because they fridge weights more.

05:48.760 --> 05:53.770
So these values are going to be something important something that the pollution that you enable is

05:53.770 --> 05:59.170
going to read to give you the proper rate when when you add something like that.

05:59.170 --> 06:05.110
So let me ask you know around in this case and that's so cavalierly mentions is same as the last option

06:05.380 --> 06:11.030
if you're selling something really big you can that is meter or centimeters or millimeters.

06:11.350 --> 06:16.810
If you are in United State you cannot inchers or you are saying make is and we're not just for these

06:17.960 --> 06:18.630
and.

06:18.890 --> 06:22.080
If you don't continue.

06:22.480 --> 06:24.640
And then we kept some recommended options.

06:24.650 --> 06:28.540
We're going to be using a storefront for the rest of this course.

06:28.630 --> 06:35.260
ASTOLFO is by far the best team that you can Easterlin in your Commerce's store is a team that is the

06:35.260 --> 06:38.540
block by the creators of Commerce.

06:38.710 --> 06:42.610
It's really fast really easy to customize and it's really powerful.

06:42.610 --> 06:46.580
So we're going to check these if you have a matching account.

06:46.660 --> 06:47.930
You can also make.

06:47.940 --> 06:53.740
So let me click on continue then we get back I'm going to skip this because I'm not really a big fan

06:53.740 --> 06:54.280
of yet.

06:54.310 --> 06:57.880
I'm going to show you a cold blooded back in upcoming videos but not yet.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.660
And for Archita we have the D-N.

07:00.660 --> 07:05.820
And when I clicked on create uprose So this is going to open the way that you can create a product.

07:06.060 --> 07:11.250
So we have products right here you can see we have these new option is what's in there is going to be

07:11.250 --> 07:18.060
created when we when we install new comers I'm going to show you how everything works into this screen

07:18.810 --> 07:19.820
right here.

07:20.040 --> 07:22.070
You can see this sign you're a star.

07:22.090 --> 07:26.060
So I'm going to check the second option but I'm going to keep these when I check.

07:26.160 --> 07:34.290
So let me let's go and this is going to create some templates that Astolfo will need.

07:34.380 --> 07:43.320
Let me go back to appearance and we're now Pentiums because the next we're going to be using it 20:17

07:43.320 --> 07:44.730
So let me activities.

07:44.850 --> 07:49.920
So basically in the next 10 years we're going to use 20:17 because I'm going to show you how to create

07:49.920 --> 07:54.930
brokes and everything then we're going to activate it again and I'm going to show you how to customize

07:55.520 --> 07:57.440
Astolfo for the rest of the course.
