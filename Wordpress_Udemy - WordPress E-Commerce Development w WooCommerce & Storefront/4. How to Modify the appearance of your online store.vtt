00:04.400 --> 00:11.250
So little you have to modify the appearance of your comments website.

00:11.430 --> 00:19.140
The only three ways to change the appearance is using CCS using templates and hooks.

00:19.380 --> 00:26.220
Also with have they customize their bags the most powerful ways of these.

00:26.270 --> 00:29.760
See a system play tank works.

00:29.990 --> 00:33.960
So maybe you want to change the perience of your website.

00:34.160 --> 00:40.340
Maybe you want to change the decks or the font family maybe you want to reorder the elements on the

00:40.340 --> 00:41.420
screen.

00:41.480 --> 00:43.980
Maybe you want to either remove some data.

00:44.420 --> 00:45.450
Maybe you can.

00:45.530 --> 00:49.020
Maybe you want to bring in some extra information of the broke.

00:49.520 --> 00:55.060
Maybe you want to add some extra fields from the check out or you want to live on it's lighted in the

00:55.060 --> 00:56.180
home page.

00:56.200 --> 00:58.340
Everything is possible in newcomer's.

00:58.390 --> 01:04.210
So for example you will need CIRCE's if you want to change the size of your example the with or the

01:04.210 --> 01:06.530
side of an element.

01:06.970 --> 01:12.810
If you want to change colors maybe you want a smile transition or animation.

01:13.270 --> 01:18.070
Maybe when I change the font different from me or the color or do you want to change the color of the

01:18.070 --> 01:18.910
links.

01:19.000 --> 01:30.240
Everything is going to be possible with the SS and this code should be added in the TSA TSS we have

01:30.280 --> 01:31.740
templates also.

01:32.200 --> 01:38.800
So for example the templates contain the issue Demir they contain some CSA and they contain OutServe

01:38.820 --> 01:40.380
BHP.

01:40.540 --> 01:45.800
If you want to add some extra markup you should read these files.

01:47.530 --> 01:50.720
To modify these files you need to copy.

01:50.920 --> 01:55.120
They will commence templates and when I show you how to do this in this course.

01:56.070 --> 01:58.340
And finally will have the most powerful way.

01:58.590 --> 02:11.220
You seem Cookes the most advanced and powerful they come into Faber's so years they the most advanced

02:11.310 --> 02:13.120
and powerful way of everything.

02:13.160 --> 02:17.900
I will commers website is using hooks and they come in to Faber's.

02:17.940 --> 02:25.240
We have hooks for actions and we have hooks for filters.

02:25.440 --> 02:31.860
So for example lets review actions actions grown on specific events.

02:32.310 --> 02:40.370
So for example if the user base is the home page I want to bring in on his live there with special offers.

02:41.920 --> 02:51.020
And in the other hand we have filters and filters modify an element should be display on the screen.

02:51.020 --> 02:55.370
So for example the number of products but a column on this page.

02:55.370 --> 03:03.210
Maybe you went at 3 4 or 5 but rather expect a column or more.

03:03.430 --> 03:10.060
So we're going to modify or child team using these three ways in the next videos.

03:10.180 --> 03:15.490
There are several examples that we're going to have and I'm going to show you some of the most popular

03:15.490 --> 03:22.690
customisations that my clients ask for almost all the websites that I'm building for them.
