00:03.960 --> 00:11.500
Send these media we're not take a look GOOD us sell products and not sell products.

00:11.510 --> 00:13.490
So fears we're gonna have a problem.

00:13.650 --> 00:18.150
And you can see we have that back with 0 9.

00:18.410 --> 00:25.950
So we're going out with back with three so and so and to me is great here.

00:26.180 --> 00:30.160
So then we're going to copy this man's description and we're going to page right here.

00:30.620 --> 00:33.100
And you can see we have 12 ratios are going up well.

00:34.450 --> 00:36.510
And then select always right here.

00:36.760 --> 00:44.530
And also on the choose from the most used tax we're going to select is bath home on the top.

00:44.760 --> 00:51.850
You can click here and set the match and then when I click in that I can see it right here.

00:51.860 --> 01:02.340
So now we said the provi much and polish these that will back with three sticking up in these.

01:02.470 --> 01:03.670
And you can see everything is working.

01:03.670 --> 01:09.610
We have the name of the brother we have the prize we have the description and the quantity and everything

01:09.920 --> 01:14.830
for this great little you can see that we have that we're right here and this one saves $9.

01:15.010 --> 01:19.860
So we have one to well with $9 and we have another one with $12.

01:20.140 --> 01:24.880
So you can open these and click on it.

01:26.960 --> 01:33.030
Maybe you can make this a little more expensive because three hours for $12 and this one is one table

01:33.080 --> 01:40.380
for $9 where you are going to add 35 or something like that of course.

01:40.730 --> 01:43.360
I don't have any idea how much this goes.

01:44.540 --> 01:46.330
Bat For example now we have in the.

01:46.400 --> 01:48.670
Well these one that goes $9.

01:48.940 --> 01:50.850
And he quickly hit on the brother.

01:51.170 --> 01:52.970
You can see that we have upsets.

01:53.180 --> 01:55.060
And then we have grassroots.

01:55.070 --> 02:02.240
If you're over here on the question mark you can see that we ourselves are products which you recommend

02:02.300 --> 02:09.860
instead of the car and you're broke for example of products that are more profitable or better quality

02:09.920 --> 02:11.910
or more expensive.

02:12.280 --> 02:21.730
Their idea here is that you show up roll that is more expensive and where you can earn more money.

02:21.740 --> 02:28.110
So for example in this case we're going at all well and you can see we have to well back with three.

02:28.150 --> 02:31.620
So we're going to like this one and up.

02:32.110 --> 02:36.390
Then again I'm going up in the link brokes and Kid Recap curses.

02:36.670 --> 02:45.160
And if I go over here you can see Russels are brokes which you promote in the cart based on the current

02:45.160 --> 02:46.100
drug.

02:46.390 --> 02:50.080
So for example is this going to be a complementary product of the star.

02:50.440 --> 02:59.590
And we cannot become good because we want or stores to buy more things from our website.

02:59.720 --> 03:06.800
So now we have the obsolete set up to sit down with three and then we have the cross-sell they come

03:08.190 --> 03:11.500
are they Deeson and told

03:14.730 --> 03:21.440
and it's going to read these when I'm going out and these I can see we have the towel and you can see

03:21.440 --> 03:25.940
we have you may also like and this is the opposite approach.

03:26.360 --> 03:29.330
You can see how upset right here and now you can see Cup.

03:29.360 --> 03:31.020
You may also like.

03:31.340 --> 03:36.510
So they use that kind of scroll here and see these program and it's going to be like this one and it's

03:36.510 --> 03:40.850
going to work showing different options of course.

03:41.640 --> 03:46.100
So for example if they use sorites land right he hadn't got.

03:46.410 --> 03:53.580
And then Bukhara right here you can see that with have the cup and you can see how you may be interested

03:53.640 --> 04:02.610
in and make up you have the complementary pro or in this case they cross and probabl.

04:02.720 --> 04:08.240
So now you can see for example if they use it out to the cart and you can see we have something like

04:08.240 --> 04:08.730
this.

04:08.870 --> 04:10.740
So that's something really nice.

04:11.180 --> 04:18.620
So remember they're upset it broke some more expensive pro and the cross-sell pro.

04:18.950 --> 04:20.480
It's a complimentary approach.

04:20.720 --> 04:27.460
Something that we show to the user that will be a nice complement of the current probe.

04:28.260 --> 04:34.450
And then going out one right here and one of the that got Megan think we have to make these.

04:34.520 --> 04:36.090
So this is looking nice.

04:37.330 --> 04:42.370
If your bin brothers are here now you can see or a star has now 3 brokes.

04:42.460 --> 04:44.360
So that's something really nice.

04:44.380 --> 04:45.940
So let's continue in the next video.
