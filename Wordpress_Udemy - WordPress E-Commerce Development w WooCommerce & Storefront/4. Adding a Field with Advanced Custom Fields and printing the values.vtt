00:04.130 --> 00:11.660
So let's add some extra fields with advanced custom fields to display a subtitle right here and also

00:11.660 --> 00:12.970
our new tab right here.

00:13.190 --> 00:25.230
We're going up in custom fields and not new says something a single brokes and here on the post we're

00:25.240 --> 00:27.040
going to change these two broke.

00:27.190 --> 00:34.680
This is the post type for all the bollocks in the commerce and I'm going to change these first and that

00:34.780 --> 00:35.710
would be metal.

00:35.730 --> 00:38.440
And this is based on our preference.

00:38.550 --> 00:45.710
So we're going out to fields and subtitle and play da real name.

00:45.730 --> 00:46.440
It's going to be days.

00:46.460 --> 00:47.720
That's fine.

00:47.720 --> 00:56.240
And I want to close this one and it's another one so I'll have the and we're going to use I think file

00:56.240 --> 01:05.020
is going to be the better Feg feel for that I believe you Angua are when I return the file you are right

01:05.020 --> 01:05.790
that's fine.

01:05.810 --> 01:11.220
We're going to close this and polish these video and polish these fields.

01:11.710 --> 01:16.470
So next we're going to click on the product in the comp kit or any pro that's fine.

01:18.490 --> 01:26.900
And you can see that we have singer brokes and we have the fields you can change the display.

01:26.910 --> 01:37.930
Where do these fields are going to play and the position you're you cannot make by and they reload in

01:37.930 --> 01:39.350
other fields or on the top.

01:39.520 --> 01:43.670
So for example that said somebody here in the in the subtitle.

01:43.920 --> 01:48.290
We're going to add something like everything you need.

01:49.670 --> 01:51.290
To an

01:54.180 --> 02:04.400
at home is that they are going to have today that you can bet on the materials and the brothers you

02:04.400 --> 02:12.360
will find Abilio that and before you actually can raggedly these to the media library.

02:12.710 --> 02:14.410
And we're going to isolate these fine.

02:14.700 --> 02:23.990
So now you can see we have a subtitle and we have a review of the DS and let's go back.

02:24.270 --> 02:27.240
Relo these Nothing is going to change.

02:27.240 --> 02:32.140
We need to play in these you see hooks and we're going to hit on simple hooks.

02:33.400 --> 02:40.610
And in my case I went to bring these right after the you can see that we have a single product summary

02:40.700 --> 02:42.780
and we have that dialogue right here.

02:44.160 --> 02:47.120
On the rating five.

02:47.250 --> 02:55.450
So why don't I copy these this action and what are going up in order to find.

02:57.130 --> 03:09.540
And that's a display as subtitle in single brokes and I'm going to have some myspace right here so you

03:09.540 --> 03:13.750
can see in the center of the screen Fanshen Caterina's spa.

03:14.160 --> 03:16.200
These play subtitle

03:18.610 --> 03:25.470
single brother going up an action in this case.

03:25.620 --> 03:31.890
And what are going to pass these function and their priorities between 5 and 10.

03:31.890 --> 03:41.580
So let's add something makes six echo some of the items here so save these and the stopwatch stop showing

03:41.600 --> 03:45.410
Cookes and you can see we have supplied are here.

03:45.430 --> 03:46.350
That's nice.

03:47.060 --> 03:50.620
Here we're going to do exactly the same that we did before.

03:50.660 --> 03:51.490
What now.

03:51.820 --> 03:53.900
Global Post.

03:54.140 --> 04:03.870
And then we're going to have on the or we can subtitle equals to get feel.

04:04.080 --> 04:08.800
This is the fortune that comes with advanced cost of this debris field.

04:09.220 --> 04:13.470
And we have title we pass up on.

04:13.600 --> 04:18.440
And then we pass that boss state so you can use the.

04:18.560 --> 04:30.610
And then we can that's something that can make it or H-3 subtitle and close the HD so save this and

04:30.610 --> 04:39.510
up in the forenent and you can see Nokia everything you need to and at home is by the sweat of an hour

04:39.520 --> 04:51.370
something like last saw Dayrell you understand that's Jasus I'm going to stop Titan anyone who takes

04:51.370 --> 04:54.920
the last Florham well known and I'm going to make their phone a little smaller.

04:54.940 --> 05:02.170
So one size point nine Im YEM sameas Henry lothe.

05:02.340 --> 05:06.500
Now you can see this is looking better and of course we can change z.

05:06.590 --> 05:09.400
Maybe you can make this a little bigger one point to him

05:12.210 --> 05:13.630
and that's looking better.

05:13.650 --> 05:21.790
You can see everything you need to learn at home is the so you can easily add more fields with advanced

05:21.790 --> 05:26.350
custom fields and bring them in your single page.

05:26.410 --> 05:33.900
Also take a look at the hooks and if the find the priority to display them whatever you want.

05:34.220 --> 05:38.050
So in the next video let's see how you can bring you in on your top.
