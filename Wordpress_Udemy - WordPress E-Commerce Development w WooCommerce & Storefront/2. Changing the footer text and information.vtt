00:04.020 --> 00:11.870
So before we start working with the CCS I want to show you how you can change this section on the bottom.

00:11.870 --> 00:18.130
So for example if you don't simple show books again scroll to the bottom you can see that we have our

00:18.140 --> 00:21.600
whole group here that CES all from former.

00:21.720 --> 00:26.390
And we have the stuff from Krait and on the board.

00:26.420 --> 00:32.510
We have started from after for what are going to use after Forder to this play.

00:32.550 --> 00:34.030
They're design like this.

00:34.130 --> 00:41.410
You can see that we have this color and again it's expanding to take all the content or all the width

00:41.800 --> 00:42.840
in the window.

00:43.720 --> 00:54.460
So for some going up and the functions of the HP and you're going to have to remove the food combers

00:54.990 --> 01:06.800
for and create a new one so we're going to either function that are us back food for if we're going

01:06.800 --> 01:14.930
to add action in what are going to hook these into neat doing what are going up as these one and we're

01:14.930 --> 01:21.130
going to remove action and we're going to remove from a storefront for it.

01:21.380 --> 01:26.750
If you remember that's the hook that we saw previously did we have a styrofoam folder.

01:26.890 --> 01:29.920
And we went to remove this great.

01:30.050 --> 01:30.970
So what.

01:31.040 --> 01:33.910
And then we have this story from Craig.

01:34.090 --> 01:39.670
We're going to run this at 20 so save these riddles.

01:39.720 --> 01:45.870
Now you can see that we remove that section and I want to add this into the from after that.

01:46.170 --> 01:53.180
So here I am another new action or action and it's going to be a storefront after Forder For example

01:53.190 --> 02:00.620
here we cannot Caterina's new food text something like that of course.

02:00.860 --> 02:05.060
And then you can as a new priority.

02:05.100 --> 02:06.340
We need to write these functions.

02:06.340 --> 02:07.470
Why don't I try here.

02:07.470 --> 02:08.090
Function

02:10.620 --> 02:22.410
and from here on Gonna I'm going to add some BHB ickle deep class and we're going to celebrate but this

02:22.470 --> 02:27.710
is going to be the Veep and we're going to use this glass to type this content.

02:28.950 --> 02:29.980
Clothes are.

02:30.950 --> 02:34.260
And here we're going to take home.

02:34.490 --> 02:40.890
And if they get a kick in the sand we have these decks our Treasury set Why don't I use or writes We

02:40.970 --> 02:47.730
Serap and then we're going to use an entity copy for the copyright symbol that we have here.

02:48.320 --> 02:55.700
And then we can have that get blocked Imphal we can use one of the variables that comes in wordpress

02:55.790 --> 02:59.850
we can pass the name in the name of that Web site.

02:59.910 --> 03:05.530
Then we add some MySpace and then we concatenate the value and then we went to print.

03:05.560 --> 03:06.820
There's the date.

03:07.010 --> 03:12.850
In this case we went to bring the year and we can make this dynamically taking the value from the cerebellar

03:12.870 --> 03:18.750
if we can get the date and pass the Y in uppercase to display the current year.

03:18.830 --> 03:25.180
So save these and reload to the bottom.

03:25.350 --> 03:29.290
And now you can see I'm going to stop showing Hooke's.

03:29.470 --> 03:34.930
Now you can see that we have all right you said guardedness back on store 2007.

03:35.810 --> 03:37.330
So that's looking nice.

03:37.430 --> 03:41.210
And in the next video I'm going to show you how to style these.

03:41.570 --> 03:43.500
And this is looking great in my opinion.
