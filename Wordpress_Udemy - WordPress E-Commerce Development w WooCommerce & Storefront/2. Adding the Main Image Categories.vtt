00:04.040 --> 00:06.520
You can see here we have these Shub by category.

00:06.530 --> 00:12.220
This is added to my storefront and we're going to see how you can add these images.

00:12.320 --> 00:20.500
So let's open a can of Wordpress and I'm going I click on Brother X and then we have categories right

00:20.500 --> 00:20.840
here.

00:20.890 --> 00:22.300
So we're going to click here.

00:24.320 --> 00:31.810
And for here you can see we have a match and then we have candle's guides of some kids and downwards.

00:32.120 --> 00:40.610
So we're going up and these guys seem PBF and from here you can click you on thumbnail in opera or as

00:40.910 --> 00:44.080
much so we can select the next match up with.

00:44.270 --> 00:46.750
And we use these image and update

00:49.410 --> 00:55.830
then we're going up in categories again and we have the come kids we're going to click on it and let's

00:55.830 --> 00:59.110
review if we are more split up will emerge.

01:03.190 --> 01:04.370
They like this one.

01:05.500 --> 01:13.800
What I'm going to say here and we're going to these much and use this to match and update again.

01:15.360 --> 01:21.000
Finally we're going to click on categories and we're going to get you on this because I know that that

01:21.000 --> 01:22.010
was right here.

01:23.320 --> 01:26.690
There's Lance so you can upload these.

01:26.710 --> 01:29.640
Maybe I won't I will use the other ones.

01:29.650 --> 01:31.130
These go under here.

01:31.180 --> 01:33.090
I really like this one are blah.

01:33.130 --> 01:35.290
This is very crazy.

01:35.740 --> 01:39.010
So use that much and update.

01:39.220 --> 01:47.670
So then you can go below the front end and you can see we have the guides the kids and the towers.

01:48.040 --> 01:54.690
So you can click on concretes and it will take you to the category page.

01:54.760 --> 01:55.660
That's nice.

01:56.670 --> 02:04.370
And of course this is a store front in the next video so we're going to continue working with combers.

02:04.410 --> 02:11.040
There is a world chap there where we're going to see how you can customize a storefront but now you

02:11.040 --> 02:16.260
can see our Web site looks more like the online store.

02:16.400 --> 02:17.980
Thanks to these theme.
