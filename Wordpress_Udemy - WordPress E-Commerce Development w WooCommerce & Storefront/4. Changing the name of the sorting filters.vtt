00:04.190 --> 00:11.850
Chandra Levy we have these filters so let's see for example how you can make a change in the names of

00:11.850 --> 00:12.720
these filters.

00:12.720 --> 00:19.570
For example this one sort by newness So let's see how you can make a change to a more descriptive name

00:20.560 --> 00:25.720
and we're going to here a comment that's on MySpace on the bottom so you can see these in the center

00:25.960 --> 00:26.810
of the screen.

00:27.620 --> 00:34.350
Anybody going out to change field their name and we're going to want you on the Internet by.

00:34.350 --> 00:37.080
This is the prefix for all the fortunes of this team.

00:37.620 --> 00:40.110
And then we're going to have new brokes viral

00:45.320 --> 00:48.380
and we're going to add a filter at it right here.

00:48.680 --> 00:55.170
And these are running on the hook global commerce underscore catalog.

00:55.370 --> 00:56.180
All of that by

00:58.990 --> 01:03.680
and then where the commanding lead is the name of this function.

01:03.720 --> 01:11.440
So we have another Acoma in what are going around these hot Brierty or for the priority B are these

01:11.460 --> 01:16.320
when will work in this case and when I run these later.

01:16.530 --> 01:20.000
So we can we can override that main.

01:20.520 --> 01:26.610
So in this case we're going to pass the order by and of course remember that you can pass whatever you

01:26.610 --> 01:27.780
want to right here.

01:28.260 --> 01:41.060
But this takes one parameter so you can use a called 3 equil Bre embattled dump these body or by and

01:41.150 --> 01:42.540
I show you something.

01:42.730 --> 01:44.490
They say these and reload

01:47.420 --> 01:52.670
and now you can see that the badges from the Commerce catalog are there by our bodies.

01:52.670 --> 01:59.510
So we have an array with six positions and they are the key in the Baddoo the menu ordinances is the

01:59.600 --> 02:02.150
default sort in you can see right here.

02:02.210 --> 02:03.620
Well it should be right here.

02:03.710 --> 02:06.560
And then they sold by popularity.

02:06.590 --> 02:14.420
And we have here in there and the date sort by newness here you can see I'm passing order by in passing

02:14.420 --> 02:25.060
on another's bad for example you can add some to make sure that me and pass them here and reload and

02:25.060 --> 02:32.680
this will work because we're passing we need to pass something when commerce executes these they pass

02:32.980 --> 02:34.090
a variable right here.

02:34.120 --> 02:41.790
And this is the way that BHB you can for example buy the same arguments and bring where the bodies are

02:42.400 --> 02:51.320
in that function that WordPress commerce Commerce's using that more BHB related stuff than WordPress.

02:51.610 --> 02:57.830
Most of the frameworks and solutions you simply will have something like these.

02:57.850 --> 03:06.550
So what's going on is normally you will have very walls with a more descriptive name so why not remove

03:06.550 --> 03:07.980
these.

03:08.000 --> 03:14.620
Now you can see that we had the date so we have an app or that by date.

03:14.700 --> 03:17.430
The way that you access this value you can see an array.

03:17.630 --> 03:25.130
So we have data right here and we're going to add new brokes fears.

03:25.400 --> 03:32.390
So it's a more descriptive name no problems fears than sort of by newness and then we're going to retune

03:33.590 --> 03:36.400
we override the body and then we're not doing that.

03:37.780 --> 03:45.700
Order By now you can save these and result and you can see the difference something and we have new

03:45.700 --> 03:47.460
products we use.

03:47.620 --> 03:54.300
So you can click here and you can see the new brokes are going to show and feed us I'm going to I'm

03:54.300 --> 04:00.400
going to come in this line so I'm going to say like everything you do on your own maybe I'm going to

04:00.480 --> 04:01.300
comment.

04:02.440 --> 04:03.420
So reload these

04:11.110 --> 04:12.260
up and show up.

04:12.530 --> 04:20.380
Now you can see is working bad you can see that we change these filters using these function.
