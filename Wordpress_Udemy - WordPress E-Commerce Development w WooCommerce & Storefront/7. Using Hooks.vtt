00:04.280 --> 00:12.180
Soulish review the most powerful way to modify your online store in commercial using sinkhole.

00:12.570 --> 00:14.280
What do whenever you see hooks.

00:14.490 --> 00:16.440
That means actions and filters.

00:16.680 --> 00:19.290
So we did that to instead of Pluton right here.

00:20.200 --> 00:24.700
Well we don't have to install the Brillion But these Breanne is going to mean it's going to make this

00:25.060 --> 00:29.520
easier to modify and understand the hooks better.

00:29.830 --> 00:33.800
So what do you think are simple show hooks

00:38.140 --> 00:39.530
and is going to be this one.

00:39.820 --> 00:48.590
So let's use this theme and activate it team so you can see and start it.

00:48.750 --> 00:50.550
So that's really all right here.

00:51.360 --> 00:57.370
And you will find any with them raking in some bushel hooks you can see how we can show actual cubes.

00:57.660 --> 01:01.640
And that's what we capture action show action and feed hooks.

01:01.980 --> 01:03.490
First when I started working.

01:03.490 --> 01:06.450
We show actual cooks who are going to click here.

01:07.850 --> 01:12.140
And you can see a bunch of different cooks available.

01:12.260 --> 01:19.910
So you're seeing this for example and you can see this one that looks with a darker green.

01:19.980 --> 01:24.380
If I look over here you can see we have priority and at the bottom is the name of the function.

01:25.170 --> 01:31.560
So in this case for example this highest priority then not only has one function attach but you will

01:31.560 --> 01:35.180
find some of then with several functions.

01:35.610 --> 01:42.330
So for example this one this single Prolog's summary you can see that it contains a bunch of different

01:42.330 --> 01:51.600
hooks attach so you can see a priority 5 probably read 10 20 30 40 50 and 60.

01:52.040 --> 01:59.210
So let's play with these what we're doing here is to rearrange the price we're going to add this price

01:59.690 --> 02:00.410
on the top.

02:00.490 --> 02:05.990
So it's going to be priced then the name of the brother.

02:06.240 --> 02:14.250
And what we're going to see is global commerce single pro Samadi so you can copy the.

02:14.430 --> 02:17.690
And we can stop them shall we.

02:18.210 --> 02:24.160
So that's a big break in what are going up in the fortunes that BHP are going to pick up in the BHP

02:24.260 --> 02:32.090
that it's really important that you only go up and BHP tax you don't have to close that BHP that's right

02:32.090 --> 02:32.620
now.

02:32.720 --> 02:34.250
So what kind of move action.

02:34.250 --> 02:37.650
This is the way that you work with these hooks.

02:37.870 --> 02:44.400
So you can see it right here with Gomer's single comer's underscores single on the score Ruddock's summary

02:45.070 --> 02:46.740
then we're going out of a coma.

02:47.150 --> 02:53.780
And again I'm going to show actual Cookes because I forgot and right here you can see that we have this

02:53.780 --> 02:54.580
price.

02:54.650 --> 02:59.980
I'm I'm pretty sure that this is the fortune that Princie that price.

03:00.340 --> 03:01.550
So we're going to copy these

03:09.320 --> 03:10.020
and we're going to.

03:10.020 --> 03:16.090
These are more action than we have with the new Coke and then we're going to go out.

03:16.160 --> 03:17.180
Went of them.

03:17.560 --> 03:23.370
These cases will combers template single price and what Gone going to the movies.

03:24.530 --> 03:30.670
So relo and we're going to stop showing Hooke's.

03:30.680 --> 03:36.710
You can see the red it remove action then we'll commit a single probe to the summary the section rates

03:37.070 --> 03:44.590
and then we add it and then we remove the single price so you can see now that price is gone solutio

03:44.590 --> 03:53.620
to that of these Let's have something like an action what are going to be these end page rates you.

03:53.650 --> 04:00.790
So for example one really important thing here is to show actual cooks for example on the products tomorrow

04:00.790 --> 04:07.010
you can see it will have priority five 10 20 30 40 50 60.

04:07.010 --> 04:14.930
The key here is for example the low and the low is the number in the priority is the content is going

04:14.930 --> 04:17.680
to be printed fears so.

04:18.040 --> 04:24.310
So for example the title you can see we have computers here on the top and you can see contains a priority

04:24.310 --> 04:26.660
of fight so we can play with those values.

04:26.660 --> 04:33.820
For example it's an action right here and we're going to copy these thing where that command so we can

04:33.820 --> 04:39.640
add the commanders Singler Bryce and then you can a parameter.

04:39.790 --> 04:46.300
So for example if it went up bring the price before that died or you can either number between 1 and

04:46.300 --> 04:50.390
5 Any number that is lower than 5.

04:50.810 --> 04:54.460
We'll bring the price about the title.

04:54.470 --> 04:58.020
So we're going out for a few.

04:58.030 --> 05:01.640
So now we can go over here and stop showing kooks.

05:01.810 --> 05:07.240
Now you can see we have the price and then we have the title and you can see it will come from the team

05:07.250 --> 05:13.660
and went up in the simple and it's going to be right here.

05:13.780 --> 05:17.150
We need to remove that within the.

05:17.220 --> 05:22.310
So now you can see we have that price and then we have the title.

05:22.370 --> 05:23.820
So let's continue playing with these.

05:23.820 --> 05:27.810
For example if I remember this Comcast is priority five.

05:28.070 --> 05:29.570
If we have priority six

05:34.530 --> 05:38.520
again and when I show actual kooks again.

05:38.670 --> 05:40.430
So for example the next one

05:45.290 --> 05:48.090
These are two cards on the priority 30.

05:48.290 --> 05:56.360
So we're going at something like 85 and then stop showing Hawkster here and you can see that now the

05:56.360 --> 06:03.290
price is going to be printed below the the cap and you can see right here.

06:03.300 --> 06:10.260
So once you find your way with these hooks it's going to be really really powerful in a really easy

06:10.260 --> 06:14.620
way to customize your wool combers website.

06:15.030 --> 06:17.420
So next we're going to click on shop.

06:17.460 --> 06:19.940
You can see at the moment we're printing five products.

06:20.070 --> 06:23.990
That's the same amount of brokes that we have.

06:24.240 --> 06:25.300
Or brokes that.

06:25.320 --> 06:32.330
So you can see for your panel brokes you can see we only have five but let's say that you went to a

06:32.330 --> 06:35.930
show on the three brothers page.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.550
So what are going to add a field there.

06:37.560 --> 06:39.540
So I do another fun show on fears.

06:39.760 --> 06:49.790
So what going to watch on Fuse brokes ph and then we're going up past brokes and then I feel that I

06:49.790 --> 06:58.750
feel that and this is going to run on the Lou underscore shop on this Corbat page knowing what are going

06:58.750 --> 07:04.100
to copy these function and what are going to set up priority of 20 by the fall.

07:04.120 --> 07:10.980
This is probably not then and since we are right in that we need to either priority higher than the

07:10.980 --> 07:12.990
default which is then.

07:13.300 --> 07:20.010
So we're going to have brokes equals to let's say that we went to bring only three and then we were

07:20.030 --> 07:21.160
at the pros.

07:21.160 --> 07:22.200
So we're changing.

07:22.200 --> 07:30.280
And Robert riving these new shop are page and we're telling hey we want to put in only three brokes

07:31.000 --> 07:32.740
in order to win that battle.

07:33.190 --> 07:38.350
So really all right here and there you can see that we have three and we have these pagination.

07:38.420 --> 07:42.930
You can be here and this is going to bring the rest of the products.

07:43.490 --> 07:48.370
So this is how you can work with actions and feel they're seeing all comers.

07:48.650 --> 07:51.080
So maybe you are asking how is possible.

07:51.160 --> 07:54.220
How is possible that you know that this is working.

07:54.270 --> 08:02.510
Shopper page Well fears you cannot always the simple show cooks and show action and filters but all

08:02.530 --> 08:08.060
of these facts are available in the docks of Gomer's.

08:08.100 --> 08:14.140
My goal with this course is to show you how to customize your restore and how to work with these field

08:14.160 --> 08:17.950
there's templates in.

08:18.480 --> 08:22.980
And by the end of the cores we'll have better on this.

08:23.010 --> 08:31.140
Understanding how these works you can customize completely an online store in the next video Sangli

08:31.140 --> 08:37.650
not show you a lot of customization that you can make using these three different techniques.

08:39.360 --> 08:45.750
So hopefully you learn everything that you need to know about filters there's templates and Seus.
