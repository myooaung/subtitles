00:04.080 --> 00:12.430
And what are going up in the goes in race you are going to have Global Post again and we're going to

00:12.430 --> 00:22.760
create a cold related products related products is going to be Kwan's to get field and we need the field

00:25.050 --> 00:31.730
in these wonderful products we produce and then we pass the ball ivy.

00:31.990 --> 00:39.300
So this way in the friend and the friend blog entries we're going to excite griller a program that we

00:39.300 --> 00:47.640
need the next For example I'm going to have a call three aunts and enclose a Capri.

00:47.740 --> 00:58.900
When I buy Dom these bodies related products and say Deeson relo the front and and you can see that

00:58.900 --> 01:05.930
we have an array with two positions where ratling Davies 14:9 and then you can see here on the feeds.

01:05.970 --> 01:12.670
Granted granted there are impulse DAVIES That's because on the charcoals included in commerce.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.860
You have these charcoal and it takes these.

01:16.870 --> 01:19.570
This is what I'm going to use these.

01:19.610 --> 01:23.540
So next what they're going to go now remove these working.

01:23.550 --> 01:26.500
We're going to have a need for stateman.

01:26.890 --> 01:33.810
We're going to have an Eve if Roulette prose contains something we're going to execute the following

01:33.810 --> 01:34.340
code.

01:35.500 --> 01:45.810
And I'm going have broke Ivey's equals three yawing join is a BHP function that will convert an array

01:45.990 --> 01:48.220
into any string.

01:48.290 --> 01:53.450
That's exactly what we are looking forward to going out and related products thing with the comma and

01:53.450 --> 01:56.640
then we are separator which is going to be a comma.

01:57.290 --> 02:02.510
So next we're going to have for example echo broke this Greedo.

02:02.510 --> 02:06.800
Now you can see we have 14:9 and then and this is sadness 3.

02:06.980 --> 02:14.150
So that's exactly what we're are looking for then we're going to close BHB and up and BHB again right

02:14.150 --> 02:22.140
here because I'm going to add so much demand in the sense of personal preference I mean the right the

02:22.280 --> 02:28.450
like these what we want out of the related products this way we can target these with a sense in case

02:28.440 --> 02:36.530
that we need to then we're going to have an H2 to we're gonna have at Glasgow's section title in going

02:36.530 --> 02:40.330
out related problems like this.

02:40.410 --> 02:51.120
We're in great innings Latona of BHB gold echo and I use the function dush article and we're going to

02:51.120 --> 02:52.580
copy this article right here.

02:52.590 --> 02:57.870
We're going to compare these and inside quotes we're going to paste this right here.

02:58.350 --> 03:04.890
Finally we're going to replace these ideas and then going out to single quotes to that to concatenate

03:04.890 --> 03:05.680
the value.

03:05.920 --> 03:10.240
And past broke Ivey's like this.

03:10.250 --> 03:19.620
So now you can say these and read all the front in and now you can see a little brokes.

03:19.640 --> 03:21.260
We have two problems right here.

03:23.300 --> 03:28.810
So for example let's say that I remove these when we only have one roulette at blokes who are going

03:28.820 --> 03:30.660
to say this and reload again.

03:32.470 --> 03:36.080
And then you can see we only have 1 broke.

03:36.200 --> 03:38.400
So you can change the number of columns here.

03:38.540 --> 03:43.360
So let's add something like columns equal to 8.

03:43.910 --> 03:47.550
And you can see this will be a little bigger.

03:47.580 --> 03:55.770
So this is nice because for example if I go back and see this up in the home page and I'm going to get

03:55.820 --> 04:02.390
up in the other and they we're going for example and these my search you can see we have the blog entry

04:02.400 --> 04:08.220
where you can add some balls right here and I read the post and get on the ball and you can see that

04:08.220 --> 04:10.230
we have related problems.

04:10.260 --> 04:16.640
And every time you are more prologues they are going to be this right here so that's up and these women

04:16.640 --> 04:26.990
for example are and these essentially you add up the and or the old and you can see we have two pros

04:26.990 --> 04:27.570
right here.

04:28.610 --> 04:36.680
So doing these greit in some blog entries in the in the products that you are actually marketing is

04:36.680 --> 04:38.820
going to be a great tool.

04:38.960 --> 04:45.640
This way you are describing that the plug and at the end you have a low end you are alone in your visitors.

04:45.920 --> 04:49.840
Two of the items into the card that's something really nice.

04:50.790 --> 04:53.680
So let's continue working in the next video with this website.
