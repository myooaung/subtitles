00:04.870 --> 00:12.620
So let's review the basics of e-commerce or everything that you should keep in mind before launching

00:12.620 --> 00:16.950
your own store.

00:17.150 --> 00:26.540
If you want to sell physical problems such as books or electronics or clothing or shoes furniture or

00:26.690 --> 00:30.980
computers you have to be aware of the shipping cost.

00:31.070 --> 00:40.510
Always keep in mind that shipping cost the module to handle shipping is Bondra in almost all e-commerce

00:40.630 --> 00:41.750
solutions.

00:41.930 --> 00:46.790
But there are things that you have to keep in mind when you're creating your own store.

00:46.910 --> 00:51.850
You should define if the shipping is going to be for example fix.

00:51.890 --> 00:53.170
So let's say $20.

00:53.180 --> 00:59.630
You know the order is also based on the weight or amount of brokes.

00:59.680 --> 01:03.070
So if this shipping is going to be free or free.

01:03.290 --> 01:12.260
If the user buys at least $50 or $50 or $100 or something like that these options are available in almost

01:12.290 --> 01:16.290
all e-commerce solutions.

01:16.540 --> 01:26.750
If you're selling digital brogues for example music or movies games images software illustrations courses

01:26.780 --> 01:30.980
and more you can saw this has a bundle.

01:31.380 --> 01:41.830
So selling that bundle is like Grubin works with other similar products so they can be sold subscriptions

01:42.550 --> 01:44.420
monthly or yearly or something like that.

01:44.410 --> 01:50.950
So for example if you're sitting in a photoshop course you can charge the users by month and they will

01:50.950 --> 01:54.890
have access to the courts.

01:54.950 --> 02:01.220
So we need to see the difference between a self-caused that site or an e-commerce solution.

02:01.280 --> 02:07.580
Maybe you made a search on the Internet and you find that you can create the online stories C-Leg with

02:07.580 --> 02:11.610
services like Wordpress dot com or Shopify.

02:11.610 --> 02:17.720
But let's see the difference between a self-caused that site with combers and an e-commerce hervÃ© solution

02:18.800 --> 02:23.800
so very simple to sell across that site could be a combers Web site.

02:23.810 --> 02:30.030
All right so there are other options like press the shop or Magento it's start to configure previously

02:30.180 --> 02:39.850
with your own payment methods and your brogues and this that on us whether you have contracted in the

02:39.850 --> 02:46.780
other hand e-commerce solutions are services that your contract which will be paid monthly or a yearly

02:47.650 --> 02:52.240
and Gwen's you paid you're going to start adding products and selling them.

02:52.340 --> 02:55.780
Some examples are Shopify or weeks.

02:55.820 --> 02:58.920
So were present to come.

02:59.010 --> 03:06.150
So the Bross of self-hosted site is that you have access to a source code and you can make changes in

03:06.150 --> 03:10.080
the design to achieve exactly what you want.

03:12.340 --> 03:20.480
You can access the customer data an answer you can modify the purchase procedure and how everything

03:20.490 --> 03:25.960
should work in your Istar the costs of a self-hosted site.

03:26.620 --> 03:32.690
Normally it will require technical knowledge which you will learn in this course at least for commerce

03:34.380 --> 03:39.250
but surely it takes more time to lounge because you can't do either of the produce you have to add the

03:39.250 --> 03:46.090
images and everything you can to set up your payment gateway to configure the cost in the main everything.

03:48.230 --> 03:58.200
And task such as maintain and backups updates should be done by or says so that throws a funny commercial

03:58.340 --> 04:05.650
solutions such as Gurpreet that come weeks or Shopify Guadalupe you're going to start adding products

04:05.650 --> 04:11.030
and selling them and so not technical knowledge required.

04:14.490 --> 04:21.650
Backups and security I don't buy the service provider but please double check these.

04:21.660 --> 04:27.610
If you decide to use this options so they can solve an ecommerce service solution.

04:28.730 --> 04:39.230
You have to pay monthly or yearly and the plans can go from $29 per month to two hundred ninety nine

04:39.230 --> 04:40.660
dollars per month.

04:42.180 --> 04:44.770
And if you're just starting That's a lot of money right.

04:46.030 --> 04:52.270
So a lot of stores will share the same template that really come on because the creators of these solutions

04:52.870 --> 05:01.630
Normally they create a template and they have thousands of clients and usually come one that some clients

05:02.020 --> 05:04.650
share the same template.

05:04.850 --> 05:10.700
They are limited and normally they share common functionality but it's really hard to have a special

05:10.700 --> 05:11.580
solution.

05:11.870 --> 05:17.180
Maybe you want to make some changes and you will find that it's really really hard to make those changes

05:17.240 --> 05:18.330
or impossible.
