WEBVTT

00:04.450 --> 00:10.580
So let's add some in-style into these main navigation and fit the curriculum to the side you can see

00:10.580 --> 00:18.410
that the bar is just discovered that we have right to so far as we're going out and going at right click

00:20.410 --> 00:25.400
and we're looking and I'm going to explain the code right here so you can see that we have these Zied

00:25.400 --> 00:28.140
with the classes start from primary navigation.

00:28.590 --> 00:36.150
So we're going to complete this class and I'm going to come and rescue main navigation

00:40.660 --> 00:46.440
and then I have some MySpace and I'm going to have the background color.

00:46.460 --> 00:48.020
So we're going to use a color

00:51.070 --> 00:56.230
and I'm going to copy these color save these and reload

01:01.050 --> 01:13.060
and you can see we have the right looking nice.

01:13.110 --> 01:17.200
So then you can see for example in the design the bar is a little smaller here.

01:17.400 --> 01:20.180
The bat is bigger or talent.

01:20.190 --> 01:27.320
So if we go right here you can see in the anchors we have some palindrome that we're going to scroll

01:27.330 --> 01:27.800
a little.

01:27.810 --> 01:30.500
And here is this selector.

01:30.620 --> 01:42.080
So we're going to copy the insane and you can see the unit of measurement in the Stefani's M and we

01:42.080 --> 01:49.740
want to remove this a little so we can use the arrow right here or we can remove some values.

01:49.760 --> 01:56.640
So for example I'm going to have and point eight something like these.

01:58.880 --> 02:01.200
And maybe 973 fine.

02:01.620 --> 02:07.840
So Point 9 am is going to be a top and bottom and that one is going to be left and right.

02:08.020 --> 02:09.190
So you can copy these

02:12.100 --> 02:17.920
and reload and you can see these only change the menu.

02:17.990 --> 02:22.880
But on the right we have also we have a similar problem so we're going to inspect these and you can

02:22.880 --> 02:29.880
see this is going to be a select site for contents and we can open the other selectors are in the camera

02:29.920 --> 02:31.980
hip and page right here.

02:32.060 --> 02:40.020
Save this and reload and there you can see this Mahdi army brigade combat on the top.

02:40.130 --> 02:51.040
So that's nice and so I know I find in this class it's a little complex you can use the the inspectors.

02:51.060 --> 02:58.220
So make sure that you are using for example Cranmore fire folks they are really nice tools that you

02:58.230 --> 03:03.290
can inspect the elements and find the selectors on the right.

03:03.510 --> 03:07.250
And this says that is apply it to that items.

03:08.270 --> 03:14.440
So this would make it easier the way you work with Nicole.

03:14.450 --> 03:20.490
So for example I'm going to inspect and I'm going to copy the selector.

03:20.490 --> 03:25.750
You can see this one is beore by the pad on the top.

03:25.780 --> 03:34.090
They all lie there on the world is a little darker so the section that is solid or darker is a current

03:34.090 --> 03:36.390
selector.

03:36.510 --> 03:45.540
They are out in color and this is a color that for example the rest is another selectors but it's not

03:45.540 --> 03:50.240
the current selectors we're going to copy these only the section on the bottom

03:53.610 --> 03:55.260
and I'm going to piece right here.

03:56.830 --> 04:01.390
And I'm going to add some properties and when I've got a lot of white it's going to be eight takes and

04:01.390 --> 04:09.960
then when I fly these important daying that takes the knots from it's going to be uppercase and then

04:09.960 --> 04:17.250
when either form the weights in candidate to make these Bolduc if one side says something like 1 am

04:18.050 --> 04:20.340
I say these old

04:23.210 --> 04:27.890
and you can see de-select are different we need to apply these to the to the other ones.

04:28.160 --> 04:33.050
So we need to find the selector on the click here and you can see them right here.

04:33.050 --> 04:34.970
So we're going to go with the selector.

04:34.970 --> 04:41.370
All of these are going to be everything from here and then going out of that coma base everything.

04:41.370 --> 04:44.350
And you can see we have some commander and I'm going to integrate here.

04:45.250 --> 04:49.670
And right here of course if you find these a little complex I'm going to make this hobby level in the

04:49.670 --> 04:54.340
car the selectors and everything I make all and I can see who's looking better.

04:55.860 --> 04:59.840
Have something we're going to change cell phone size in the next few years.

05:00.850 --> 05:05.680
And I'm going to make this a little bigger maybe 1.2 M

05:09.980 --> 05:11.490
is looking better I think.

05:12.700 --> 05:18.190
You can see that there are sub menus and it all we're using these are going to use their Pinkel that

05:18.190 --> 05:19.070
we have right here.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.560
So in that case

05:24.210 --> 05:31.500
I'm going I don't shop and make sure that you select this ally that we have here.

05:32.850 --> 05:37.350
And then we're going to cover this and then we're going to click you don't call her.

05:37.480 --> 05:41.980
So this will display a menu and you can click.

05:42.090 --> 05:50.840
You can click on the menu and you can see we had background color right here so we can copy these main

05:50.880 --> 05:52.010
de-select arrested

05:55.320 --> 06:01.730
and you can page right here and we're going to use that back and I'm color and we're going to copy these

06:02.420 --> 06:05.210
being called that we have on the top.

06:05.210 --> 06:06.700
Save these and reload

06:09.300 --> 06:12.880
and you can see we have the pink color.

06:12.970 --> 06:13.680
I went to change.

06:13.700 --> 06:19.920
And so these are two white on the same menu.

06:19.940 --> 06:25.310
Then I click on and then we're going up and the anger and you can see that we have the selector right

06:25.310 --> 06:26.330
here on the right.

06:26.570 --> 06:28.530
So again we're going to copy everything.

06:29.490 --> 06:31.120
Is going to play it right here.

06:31.130 --> 06:38.950
It's one and comma and then we're going to Basie's so save the center lane.

06:38.950 --> 06:45.880
Now you can close this shop and you can see her candles and guides in PBF home gets downwards and my

06:45.880 --> 06:52.540
account in my opinion this looks they look a little bigger I'm going to change these two branches to

06:52.560 --> 06:57.140
one am yes and these will work.

06:58.440 --> 07:04.890
Know for example on the right you can see we have the day items this robin looks fine.

07:04.890 --> 07:05.920
In my opinion.

07:06.060 --> 07:12.450
Marosi that cease fire items and you can see it's really hard to read the color and the opacity that

07:12.450 --> 07:13.710
is how I play it right there.

07:14.010 --> 07:22.910
So you can use again the developer tools and inspect it and you will find these Hispan that count.

07:23.000 --> 07:32.390
And frankly you can copy these based Angua are going to have a the the we're going to change about it

07:32.410 --> 07:36.900
when so bassy goes from 0 to 1.

07:38.600 --> 07:40.350
Americans have something like this.

07:41.430 --> 07:51.510
Opacity when and maybe it's a plane and all the styling because it's in you can see better but it's

07:51.510 --> 07:54.300
hard to see where you can see the phone with the candidate.

07:54.300 --> 08:00.610
We're going to change that file and wait 400 make a little ball there.

08:02.240 --> 08:03.770
And now this looks a little better.

08:03.860 --> 08:09.640
One hundred forty five and that got 5 items and this section looks nice.

08:09.740 --> 08:11.700
I really like these.

08:11.700 --> 08:14.590
So now we have started the menu.

08:15.080 --> 08:21.310
For example if this is Mallare you can see in the movie version this looks really weird.

08:22.400 --> 08:34.610
So here for example we can a the equity or the media on the screen and men get 768 boxes and we're going

08:34.610 --> 08:36.220
to wrap up all of these.

08:36.440 --> 08:38.260
So I've got everything right here.

08:39.370 --> 08:42.140
And page right here.

08:42.170 --> 08:51.960
So this is stylin that we are going to be applied only for certain candidates big sense in large screens.

08:52.040 --> 08:53.640
So now we can't load.

08:53.870 --> 08:56.140
Nothing is going to change by that for me.

08:56.140 --> 09:01.390
The smaller they start in is not right here and you can see the menus working fine.

09:02.970 --> 09:09.540
So in the next video on the show you start the mobile menu to add some stylin and bring these menu with

09:09.820 --> 09:15.070
a different color or same for once in a very different alignment right here.
