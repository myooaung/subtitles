00:04.350 --> 00:08.820
So let's see it on the checkout because you can remove one of these fields.

00:08.850 --> 00:15.440
This has really come up and we're going to see if you can remove for example these fun field sort of

00:15.490 --> 00:20.280
up in the flood insurance and here are some comments.

00:20.590 --> 00:24.990
That's a MySpace and then going out or more.

00:25.250 --> 00:35.170
The fun few from choc'late another function we're going to call these one guardedness back check out

00:35.470 --> 00:41.520
fields and what we're going to feed their.

00:41.630 --> 00:48.280
This one is called Catalina as combers Wu Gomer's underscore.

00:48.350 --> 00:51.820
Check out fields you've got to go out.

00:51.820 --> 00:53.540
These are nest by chicken feed.

00:54.490 --> 00:58.050
We need to pass which is a priority.

00:58.360 --> 01:04.430
And in these when we need to pass the fields and that's you can see we're passing when you can use one

01:04.450 --> 01:07.790
here or not by the fall this is one.

01:08.010 --> 01:16.620
This is one so of an echo free eco pretty used to see the contents of the variable water out by the

01:16.630 --> 01:17.350
dump.

01:18.770 --> 01:29.080
These save these up in the Rosset and reload now you can see we have a really really big array of rights

01:29.080 --> 01:29.830
you.

01:29.830 --> 01:33.860
So these Wankel things everything from the checkout.

01:34.020 --> 01:39.060
There is something important here that you can see we have on our rate with four positions.

01:39.060 --> 01:47.480
So they have some are raised in say another race for example we have the building scrod.

01:47.640 --> 01:53.660
You will find all the rain grow a little more.

01:53.670 --> 01:59.760
We have Shippen so they cover between information and then the shipping information.

01:59.760 --> 02:08.430
If you scroll a little more you will find the acold and that's the order that.

02:08.520 --> 02:16.090
So for example let's say that you want to remove the building and then we're looking for the phone you

02:16.090 --> 02:21.730
can see that we kept building first name if we want to remove these or last name these values we have

02:21.730 --> 02:24.190
the company going to be out of Atlanta.

02:24.190 --> 02:29.750
That is two city wittedness state that both locals.

02:29.970 --> 02:32.070
The fundraising.

02:32.260 --> 02:34.960
So everything is right here in these fields.

02:35.940 --> 02:44.770
So if you remember if you to move something from an IRA you use onset and we're going to use FiOS I'm

02:44.770 --> 02:51.620
going to ask for the top three being and then say that reading we have the Fonz.

02:51.660 --> 03:01.640
And that means meeting fun race you can be fun and we get rid of that in the Chicos for so what you

03:01.640 --> 03:05.490
get out of it of the fields we have already removed that.

03:05.590 --> 03:07.950
And then what we went to and everything.

03:08.000 --> 03:16.170
Cirilo these you can see face grown you can see that I remove the fun but there is a problem here because

03:16.170 --> 03:19.110
you can see we have this blank space.

03:19.110 --> 03:25.630
So again if I add something like Echo 3 Nicole Richie

03:28.560 --> 03:30.020
embattled don't they.

03:30.030 --> 03:33.600
Balios or if he is you can say this and relo.

03:35.390 --> 03:37.120
You will find something directing here.

03:37.130 --> 03:39.260
So I'm going to give it up.

03:39.320 --> 03:43.230
You can see for example these beat him Fiers name has a class right here.

03:44.180 --> 03:52.250
He says farm roll Farina's and you can see that median last name because he's from Grove last form Grove-White

03:53.190 --> 03:53.990
grow white.

03:54.080 --> 03:58.040
So and it's inspect these and see what's happening.

03:58.050 --> 04:05.450
I'm going I write this spec on the C code for example I'm going to inspect these so called here and

04:05.450 --> 04:10.600
you can see that we're using this glass form grow form grow white.

04:10.640 --> 04:16.430
We need to apply these to the molasses so if I play these email address you can see that this one is

04:16.450 --> 04:20.160
disinform grow last and from Grove.

04:20.300 --> 04:23.470
And again if I scroll to the top the e-mail

04:27.020 --> 04:31.060
billion emails you can see that the class is row last.

04:31.110 --> 04:38.900
We need to change these when I change these to form grow white to one of these so raise it I'm going

04:38.920 --> 04:42.680
to remove these fields.

04:42.740 --> 04:44.180
What are you seeing building again

04:47.980 --> 04:52.810
and is that building even building score.

04:52.840 --> 05:01.580
Eamon and what have an X glass is a really big array with that of three in there.

05:01.630 --> 05:02.720
Are going to.

05:02.900 --> 05:04.080
You're not getting deposits.

05:04.110 --> 05:05.100
It's an array.

05:05.200 --> 05:09.950
You can see that we have glass in the cabinet Racinet Gladys.

05:10.320 --> 05:16.020
You need to these you see an array and I use form grow white.

05:16.190 --> 05:19.950
So now you can save these Gussie's and relo

05:22.910 --> 05:27.970
and then you can see that the Malotte of this is sticking with something nice.

05:28.100 --> 05:33.740
And if you run into these problem now you can see how you can solve these in this BVI show your code

05:33.750 --> 05:38.360
to remove or fill in the next we are going to show you a whole lot of extra fields.

05:38.360 --> 05:44.450
So for example if you want to receive some extra information of the of your visitors you can use that

05:44.450 --> 05:44.980
technique.
