00:04.450 --> 00:06.460
So let's finish the article.

00:06.490 --> 00:11.890
You can see that we have trouble cut category and then what this play in they category come kids here

00:11.890 --> 00:16.010
between the quotes and the glossy and square brackets.

00:16.050 --> 00:17.250
I'm going out there.

00:17.290 --> 00:18.140
Beach.

00:18.400 --> 00:26.170
And if they get a hit in the sand we're printing for you on the Web site and in the sanguine interpreting

00:26.260 --> 00:32.610
three of them are going at three right here save the changes and we'll

00:35.600 --> 00:39.660
know you can see we only got three for example.

00:39.660 --> 00:48.280
You can also order these they way that you went to for example and when I order ordered by price save

00:48.300 --> 00:55.270
this and relo and you can have 50 then and two and three.

00:55.360 --> 00:59.290
But remember we added a probe that was twenty eight dollars.

00:59.310 --> 01:00.650
And it's not been printed.

01:01.500 --> 01:02.660
Well you can order that.

01:02.680 --> 01:08.690
So for example we can order there are these I send them and gloat

01:12.080 --> 01:15.940
or send them.

01:16.100 --> 01:20.450
Now you can see if it does or descendant.

01:20.540 --> 01:22.610
Now we have the most expensive right here.

01:22.640 --> 01:24.470
And then we have 50 and then we have them.

01:24.830 --> 01:30.820
So if you have send it's like is going to bring these but it's going to start from here.

01:31.180 --> 01:33.590
A cheaper one than the other.

01:33.740 --> 01:39.740
And then they is going to ignore the most expensive one because we've had only four products in this

01:39.740 --> 01:40.520
category.

01:41.600 --> 01:45.880
So this is some of the adjustments that you can make.

01:45.890 --> 01:47.510
So finally before we finish.

01:47.510 --> 01:50.730
You can see that I added columns to read right here.

01:50.860 --> 01:57.220
So right here I'm going to add one final value is going to be called Gollum's equals and I'm going to

01:57.390 --> 01:59.350
have nine right here.

02:02.530 --> 02:12.440
So if I had reichlich and inspect these you can see that we have columns three and one half columns

02:12.450 --> 02:14.210
nine.

02:14.270 --> 02:21.200
So in the next video we're going to start working with some success and make some adjustments to this

02:21.280 --> 02:22.470
these correctly.
