00:04.540 --> 00:06.820
So let's continue working with this example.

00:07.250 --> 00:14.820
And if a kid in the sign you can see that we have three products from the come kids that we want to

00:14.820 --> 00:21.390
display right here and of course if we're if I already have some experience with wordpress you may remember

00:21.390 --> 00:28.940
that we have a fun show on our class called the where the query is a way that you can equate it to databasing

00:28.980 --> 00:34.000
Wordpress and of course that way you can use it right here.

00:34.140 --> 00:42.370
That is really common that people want to display same prose from a specific category.

00:42.450 --> 00:48.400
So in the short coating really with Google maps you will find a lot of use for shortcuts.

00:49.380 --> 00:55.310
So for example we had race in products and you can use these if you really have experience with wordpress.

00:55.310 --> 01:00.510
A lot of routines use these kind of shortcuts that you can copy and paste into Wordpress and display

01:00.510 --> 01:07.110
some specifics like a contact form as Leydet a menu and everything.

01:07.260 --> 01:13.200
So we can use a shortcut based Pacific browes words would have fit feature brokes we have specific broke

01:13.200 --> 01:21.270
if you want to display these products you can pass these to display some specific products if you want

01:21.270 --> 01:29.780
to either i brother in the car by default you can use these Halsell and then we have this product category.

01:29.790 --> 01:37.440
So for example you can use broad category to display a specific probe you only pass the name of the

01:37.440 --> 01:39.330
category so we're going to copy these.

01:39.390 --> 01:40.950
And this is charcoal.

01:41.070 --> 01:46.390
They diea of the shark code is to be used for example right here on the Hill.

01:47.830 --> 01:51.160
You come Basie's right here and that something they come

01:54.540 --> 01:55.180
and up the

01:59.060 --> 02:00.430
so you can be that post

02:07.910 --> 02:10.700
comforted some pleural blue right.

02:11.040 --> 02:18.170
It's so relo and you can see that we have some comforts right here.

02:19.360 --> 02:25.650
So the idea of the shark goes is that they are to use for example the poster pages.

02:25.700 --> 02:32.090
So this is the idea of using these code but they are really come and wordpress provides a function to

02:32.090 --> 02:34.870
use that charcoals into your code.

02:35.690 --> 02:41.630
So right here we're going at the HP and the function is called do underscore charcoals

02:46.580 --> 02:54.310
sure go and then incensing because we're by the name of the Shergill in this case it's comfits

02:58.170 --> 03:00.210
and we need to echo these values.

03:00.330 --> 03:06.640
A.I here so we can reloading in the front in.

03:06.850 --> 03:12.170
And you can see that we have the brother of it maybe you can see in the design we have three different

03:12.170 --> 03:15.050
products and this is Sunday printing one.

03:15.050 --> 03:21.860
If you open the categories right here come kids you will find that is it only has one broke.

03:22.010 --> 03:28.550
So we need to have at least two more programs to continue working with the design in the next video

03:28.550 --> 03:33.330
we're going to have two more probes that made this look a little better.
