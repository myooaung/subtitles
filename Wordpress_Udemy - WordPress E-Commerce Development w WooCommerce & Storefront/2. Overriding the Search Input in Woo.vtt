00:04.810 --> 00:12.110
Need to make changes in the opinions of the search in book you can see for example if I read something

00:12.110 --> 00:17.350
like that well you can't you cannot click in this one.

00:17.540 --> 00:22.040
So the magnifying glass thing work and what are going to create are wrong.

00:22.150 --> 00:25.420
And that's what we're going to change the opinions for these input.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.970
So here's what I'm gonna open teams up in the style that's uses we're gonna write some SEUS is right

00:32.970 --> 00:41.220
here and I'm going to change these two search butan.

00:41.450 --> 00:51.030
And when I inspect these you can use the inspector to identify this electoral race you for example you

00:51.030 --> 01:01.010
can see that on Blagg we have the site search so we can copy these and paste racist.

01:01.020 --> 01:05.460
So what are going to Outhwaite going to remove that background color or as you can see some gray we're

01:05.460 --> 01:14.610
going to change that to transpire and save these and reload so you can see we remove the color then

01:14.610 --> 01:19.800
you can see with the border and that's been printed using our bookshelves.

01:19.830 --> 01:25.650
What's going to change bookshelves to not to remove that border that now we can get rid of the water

01:25.750 --> 01:30.220
that next on line to our border.

01:30.620 --> 01:37.030
And I'm going to add to bits some solace in what I'm going to use the same color the pink color.

01:37.350 --> 01:48.030
One is to A and no and you can see we have the water like these next.

01:48.050 --> 01:50.600
For example I'm going to use border radius.

01:50.740 --> 02:00.780
So we're want to use one of them up left radios in the pieces in their bottom left radios 20 pixels.

02:00.780 --> 02:08.300
So save these and Ryno this is going to give us these border right here right here.

02:08.680 --> 02:10.930
Next I want to remove the magnifying glass.

02:11.140 --> 02:16.720
So if I inspect these you can see that this is before element.

02:16.780 --> 02:21.610
So we can copy these impales right here.

02:22.090 --> 02:24.320
And we're going to have these plate none.

02:24.340 --> 02:29.450
So these will remove these from the from the search area and you can see looking nice.

02:29.860 --> 02:36.490
And finally you can see that here on the first peg right here we have a lot of weariness based on the

02:36.490 --> 02:37.240
length.

02:37.300 --> 02:43.510
So I want to remove that and I went up in and I'm going to have one am and I'm going I said this is

02:43.510 --> 02:46.540
important so read all of these

02:50.490 --> 02:54.190
and then you can see we removed that area on the left.

02:54.190 --> 02:55.680
So this is looking nice.

02:55.740 --> 02:59.340
Next I want to bring in the magnifying glass with a button.

02:59.400 --> 03:05.850
So right here we have this impot to meet and you can see here we have these yeses applied fears what

03:06.010 --> 03:09.830
could be the selector pays.

03:11.190 --> 03:11.960
So MySpace

03:16.190 --> 03:22.840
and we're going to you can see here we have keep you from movies you can see we have this search.

03:23.180 --> 03:28.010
So we're going to use clip on set and this will remove the clip number.

03:29.860 --> 03:33.950
And you can see now we have the next I'm going inspect this again.

03:34.330 --> 03:45.430
I want to place the search button on the right so when I use right zero you can see here we have left

03:45.430 --> 03:49.600
zero so we need to change that left out.

03:50.640 --> 03:57.910
So now we can save this under load you can see we place these on the right say next I want to change

03:57.910 --> 04:04.100
the background color and break it I'm going to have background color and I'm going to use the same color

04:04.100 --> 04:04.680
as the water that

04:07.350 --> 04:11.940
Ryno and you can see this is looking nice.

04:11.980 --> 04:16.750
Next I want to make this a little bigger because you can see here we're missing some space.

04:16.810 --> 04:21.380
I'm going to add a kite 100 percent and reload.

04:24.260 --> 04:28.040
So this is looking nice instead of having this search tags.

04:28.160 --> 04:31.950
I went to bring out the magnifying glass that xes on.

04:31.970 --> 04:33.570
Awesome.

04:33.590 --> 04:39.720
For example if I open the search form that we saw in the video you can see that we have these inputs

04:39.730 --> 04:46.070
submit and this print in the Valley will search right.

04:46.510 --> 04:52.570
The main difference between an input should meet and a boat on so it is that they input submit on only

04:52.570 --> 04:53.920
printed text.

04:53.920 --> 04:59.650
If you use a button you can print and imagine an icon or something as well.

04:59.920 --> 05:03.760
So we're going to put them then.

05:04.030 --> 05:05.070
And then when it closes.

05:05.110 --> 05:14.800
Remove this then when we're done close in time that requires the opening and closing dock to copy system

05:14.800 --> 05:17.180
in page right.

05:19.030 --> 05:24.000
You fairly low key here you can see that the color is your friend.

05:24.120 --> 05:26.610
The magnifying glass is there but the car is different.

05:26.610 --> 05:31.410
And that's happening because we chance butan you can see here we have input and killed a chance to work

05:31.400 --> 05:32.020
on.

05:32.160 --> 05:36.630
So we need to change these to put on you save this and relo

05:41.190 --> 05:43.490
so you can see that color is fine.

05:43.510 --> 05:46.980
Now bloodworm is in the position.

05:47.060 --> 05:53.540
The problem is that the position absolute and the top and left and everything was carried from previews

05:53.810 --> 05:55.100
selectors.

05:55.160 --> 06:05.640
So we need to out position absolute top zero outsole and relo.

06:05.730 --> 06:12.900
So now you can see we have a new search and you search simple and this looks a little nicer so you can

06:13.910 --> 06:14.790
come get.

06:15.110 --> 06:19.050
Then click it right here and he's going to work.

06:19.050 --> 06:21.350
So this is how you make changes in these.

06:21.870 --> 06:25.860
And remember that you can also change the placeholder and everything.

06:25.860 --> 06:29.090
This was a nice example of something that can be done.

06:29.100 --> 06:31.620
You've seen them play and see is this.
