WEBVTT

00:04.190 --> 00:08.130
So let's extend the section this week.

00:09.210 --> 00:11.010
Anguish are going great.

00:11.080 --> 00:12.880
Leakin speed right.

00:14.150 --> 00:20.920
So we can see better the they shot the man in the glasses with this Jasus.

00:21.160 --> 00:29.050
So that says something like features with icons.

00:29.060 --> 00:31.810
So for example you can see that we have a long feature of wreckin.

00:31.820 --> 00:34.310
We're going to use this as a bad unselected.

00:34.700 --> 00:37.740
And again if you open my style guide of the color.

00:37.800 --> 00:45.190
I went to use this as a background color I use background color say these and below and then you would

00:45.190 --> 00:46.610
see something really nice.

00:47.680 --> 00:54.280
So you can see that this is the kind of fool with these glasses that have glows fears.

00:54.310 --> 00:58.690
And then we open them then at least call for food.

00:58.990 --> 01:00.370
We have something like these.

01:00.580 --> 01:02.120
So that's something really nice.

01:02.350 --> 01:11.460
If you want to use this technique in other themes make sure that you check the closing and opening box.

01:11.780 --> 01:16.450
Otherwise when may I ask you to design if you don't open and close.

01:16.460 --> 01:19.190
They excite Debes the Union.

01:19.810 --> 01:24.170
And so the classis the closet is really really important.

01:24.950 --> 01:30.380
So let's continue working and then I'm going out home features and then we're going to use the selector

01:30.380 --> 01:32.670
of these called.

01:32.870 --> 01:34.780
So we're going to do something really nice.

01:34.790 --> 01:37.380
We're going to find a play.

01:37.470 --> 01:46.590
But when I use flex and then we're going to like slow we're going to use flex flow and we're going to

01:46.590 --> 01:49.760
use wrapper.

01:49.890 --> 01:54.630
So what we want to use fluxbox to align these are exactly what we need are low

01:58.030 --> 02:05.620
and you can see each of these is the stack next to the other one that's nice and when you're working

02:05.620 --> 02:14.950
with flex you need to add severa graphic sex seems flexibles is not fully supported in all the browsers

02:14.980 --> 02:19.560
or the support is really different from browser to browser.

02:19.570 --> 02:21.060
We need to add something else.

02:22.070 --> 02:24.650
Sort of play.

02:25.190 --> 02:30.080
Some call some browsers require that these has Webcke Bogues.

02:30.590 --> 02:38.670
And so you can copy these in space all that is required of these has fled where Keith Lex or they are

02:38.810 --> 02:41.130
required of these sites in mass

02:45.400 --> 02:47.050
in Flake's books.

02:49.660 --> 02:57.430
Then we have this play Flexo you can see we have for the friend this place and then our flex.

02:57.470 --> 03:08.600
So again flex flow we need to have four of them and the first one is going to be Webcke baulks Orient.

03:08.610 --> 03:13.910
Second one is going to be web get baulks direction

03:18.170 --> 03:22.890
and what it did when is wept.

03:24.930 --> 03:26.620
Flake's flow.

03:27.020 --> 03:32.660
And then we have also a mass flux flow.

03:32.760 --> 03:34.670
That's not something that we need.

03:34.710 --> 03:43.620
When you are working with Flexo looks and then we're going to have this call for maybe this co-features

03:44.410 --> 03:45.430
bage race.

03:45.830 --> 03:49.800
What we're going to have columns for.

03:49.870 --> 03:51.960
So you can see how codons for you.

03:52.420 --> 03:55.290
And in this case I'm going either way with 100 percent.

03:55.350 --> 03:58.250
This is going to be for the mobile devices.

03:58.350 --> 04:03.080
What are going to change the color to white sort of when I use a lot of ifs.

04:03.330 --> 04:11.670
When you do that seeks at least doing what I want to thinks a line it's going to be centered on the

04:11.670 --> 04:20.670
decks so you can say these and reload and they can with 100 percent but you can see that color is white

04:20.680 --> 04:21.810
and looking nice.

04:24.500 --> 04:35.100
And what are going to add these inside I mean equity social media on the screen and mean with forehanded

04:35.200 --> 04:36.370
and maybe Beezus

04:40.160 --> 04:41.810
what are going to be the selector

04:46.280 --> 04:59.110
and again what are going to be these flex is and then what are going to change with the the 3.3 percent

04:59.530 --> 05:03.220
save these and reload.

05:03.320 --> 05:05.260
So now you can see is looking nice.

05:05.420 --> 05:09.990
Now all of them have next to each other and they are taking that 3.2 percent.

05:09.980 --> 05:11.150
When you seem flexible.

05:11.470 --> 05:13.310
I mean this is Malheur right here.

05:13.310 --> 05:15.080
They are taking 100 percent.

05:15.080 --> 05:18.570
So we have these media Querrey looking nice.

05:18.640 --> 05:23.080
Definitely we need to add something else.

05:23.080 --> 05:28.510
Were going to be the selector outside of the media Aquarion going out anchor.

05:28.770 --> 05:36.400
I die for the ink they can use font size 3M and thats what are going out there.

05:36.400 --> 05:37.410
MADIGAN Right.

05:37.890 --> 05:51.500
Of one im and the last piece of this is going to be the features columns for barograph and the margin

05:51.500 --> 05:55.180
is going to be so you save these and see how this works.

05:57.220 --> 06:03.800
And you can see now we have the bigger icons and everything is looking nice when we were on Amazon we

06:03.800 --> 06:11.060
had to add something else race on the media Aquarium when I use just the file containing what are going

06:11.060 --> 06:20.630
to center maybe when we can make these that he him that he and this is looking nice or just the fat

06:20.630 --> 06:28.160
content with center of these better centering that excellence in or.

06:28.390 --> 06:33.400
And what Amazon would need to add something is because you can see the bar at this bar he drew from

06:33.400 --> 06:48.220
his mug and race you on the features we can add something like a body when am and Ciro Cirilo maybe

06:48.300 --> 06:59.050
something before 3:00 3M is the nice BAEHR bigger bar.

06:59.990 --> 07:10.490
And they went to have somebody on the bottom so are another Madigan board on when relo my a you can

07:10.500 --> 07:16.820
cover a lot of separation you can see between the banner and the rest.

07:16.870 --> 07:25.060
So we have these when these speak receive these Gunton area you can see that we have a lot of separation

07:25.060 --> 07:25.270
right.

07:25.280 --> 07:32.360
That is one of the these and if they get a kid in their body you can see that we have a bunch of different

07:32.360 --> 07:33.140
classes.

07:33.240 --> 07:41.250
These guys are going to use Come in Canton area and I'm going out of you bought them Cyril Cirilo these

07:42.880 --> 07:50.480
and we remove some is maybe when I can increase these Madigan bottom three so we can have some balance

07:50.570 --> 07:52.030
maybe the same amount.

07:52.070 --> 07:55.190
And this year maybe 2.8.

07:55.720 --> 07:56.860
So it'll be fine.

07:57.630 --> 07:59.840
Yes looking better.

07:59.890 --> 08:07.890
And finally we need to give the last adjustment maybe despite going up here year going either for the

08:07.940 --> 08:15.850
size of two AM Cirilo and maybe something as matter.

08:15.860 --> 08:21.480
One point to him or maybe a little bigger one for him.

08:21.490 --> 08:29.360
You're going to have the beer stack and this will force the break in a few of these up in the front

08:29.420 --> 08:33.390
and you can see that this is working better.

08:33.390 --> 08:34.530
It's looking great.

08:37.830 --> 08:39.270
And Richard I'm going to

08:42.770 --> 08:43.610
a with

08:51.460 --> 08:51.910
low

08:55.920 --> 08:57.560
and it is looking better.

08:57.590 --> 09:06.760
Anything you can add up and maybe you're going to buy it right here on the left when M. by the end dryads

09:06.770 --> 09:15.100
on one am Serino these this is looking better.

09:15.120 --> 09:21.700
I think so for me this is my dad and soon to be the last is that you can see we can add some separation

09:21.700 --> 09:22.850
and on the bottom.

09:23.250 --> 09:24.260
So rationing going out.

09:24.300 --> 09:31.660
Margin Boerum and that tomorrow morning is going to be here.

09:31.710 --> 09:38.180
So we need to reset that value so you can see who has inspirational kittens looking nice if we make

09:38.180 --> 09:39.170
these bigger.

09:39.410 --> 09:42.190
We remove that Madigan ball.

09:42.250 --> 09:44.640
So this is it for this section.

09:44.650 --> 09:51.800
You can see this as a more complex example of something that can be done with combers you have free

09:51.800 --> 09:58.280
shipping in a lot of secure payments Cortona refunds in every all of the.

09:58.330 --> 10:06.620
So the next step for these and we need to add some block post is going to be this section right that

10:06.640 --> 10:10.060
we have here the latest from the blog.

10:10.470 --> 10:11.280
We're going to see.

10:11.280 --> 10:15.350
Or you can I subscribe to the newsletter and then finish with the forward.

10:15.670 --> 10:21.040
So there is a lot of work to do in the home page but this is looking really very nice.
