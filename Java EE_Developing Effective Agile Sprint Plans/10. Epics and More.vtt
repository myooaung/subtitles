00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:04.444
Many times user stories can be grouped or clustered together

2
00:00:04.444 --> 00:00:07.926
since they have a very common theme or domain,

3
00:00:07.926 --> 00:00:10.200
and we call these epics.

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.668
An epic is a big unit of work that has one common objective.

5
00:00:13.668 --> 00:00:18.374
An epic is still a feature or a custom request or business requirement,

6
00:00:18.374 --> 00:00:21.610
but at a higher, more abstract level.

7
00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:22.403
Here's an example.

8
00:00:22.403 --> 00:00:25.730
Earlier, we talked about a user story for a student to find,

9
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.016
select, and enroll in a course.

10
00:00:28.016 --> 00:00:31.249
Well, there are dozens of user stories around student enrollment,

11
00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:37.065
and hence, a good epic would be a more encompassing one called manage enrollment.

12
00:00:37.065 --> 00:00:39.252
Now let's see a more detailed example.

13
00:00:39.252 --> 00:00:42.548
Here's an example I'm calling manage enrollment.

14
00:00:42.548 --> 00:00:46.090
This epic covers the viewpoints of students and administration.

15
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.323
As the term epic connotates,

16
00:00:48.323 --> 00:00:52.562
an epic is a story with more context and embellishment.

17
00:00:52.562 --> 00:00:55.140
Or another way to look at it would be to further refine the

18
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.926
epic with more context and description.

19
00:00:57.926 --> 00:00:59.407
Every quarter,

20
00:00:59.407 --> 00:01:03.592
the registrar prepares for the beginning of the next academic quarter.

21
00:01:03.592 --> 00:01:05.926
Six weeks before the beginning of the next quarter,

22
00:01:05.926 --> 00:01:09.620
classes are open so the students can, in fact,

23
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:10.165
enroll.

24
00:01:10.165 --> 00:01:14.642
During this time students enroll, the cashier manages payments,

25
00:01:14.642 --> 00:01:17.278
the enrollment supervisor audits enrollment activity,

26
00:01:17.278 --> 00:01:20.933
and the registrar tracks the performance of cashier,

27
00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:22.159
student services,

28
00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:27.096
and enrollment operations through a variety of reports and tracking mechanisms.

29
00:01:27.096 --> 00:01:31.141
So, as you can see, an epic usually takes a form of a narrative,

30
00:01:31.141 --> 00:01:34.076
covering a broad set of related features.

31
00:01:34.076 --> 00:01:37.606
Certainly, epics take much more than one sprint to complete.

32
00:01:37.606 --> 00:01:41.395
They cover an extended period of time, of course.

33
00:01:41.395 --> 00:01:45.402
Think of an epic of the summary of many user stories.

34
00:01:45.402 --> 00:01:50.968
This helps you better understand the context of those user stories.

35
00:01:50.968 --> 00:01:53.317
Now let's take this epic and break it down in just a

36
00:01:53.317 --> 00:01:55.517
few user stories as an example.

37
00:01:55.517 --> 00:01:57.199
For the epic manage enrollment,

38
00:01:57.199 --> 00:02:00.057
let's illustrate just a few of its user stories

39
00:02:00.057 --> 00:02:02.699
that would be within its context.

40
00:02:02.699 --> 00:02:09.135
As a student, I can search for, find, and select classes so that I can enroll.

41
00:02:09.135 --> 00:02:10.102
As a student,

42
00:02:10.102 --> 00:02:15.503
I can view my currently enrolled classes so that I can drop a class.

43
00:02:15.503 --> 00:02:22.152
As an administrator, I can open a class so that students can sign up and search.

44
00:02:22.152 --> 00:02:23.379
As department staff,

45
00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:28.015
I can view the class roster so that I can review class

46
00:02:28.015 --> 00:02:30.902
enrollment attributes such as discounts,

47
00:02:30.902 --> 00:02:32.065
dates, etc.

48
00:02:32.065 --> 00:02:34.973
This is a real-world example.

49
00:02:34.973 --> 00:02:37.090
As we work through with the product owners,

50
00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.387
we actually subdivided the epics and then clustered the associated user stories.

51
00:02:42.387 --> 00:02:47.072
It turned out that later in our project we broke down managed enrollment into

52
00:02:47.072 --> 00:02:51.021
student enrollment and enrollment administration epics.

53
00:02:51.021 --> 00:02:54.160
We even left a higher-level kind of super epic for

54
00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.196
managed enrollment for context.

55
00:02:56.196 --> 00:02:57.729
Now for a point of view.

56
00:02:57.729 --> 00:03:00.993
Here's my point of view on product owners and backlogs.

57
00:03:00.993 --> 00:03:05.074
I do want to emphasize the product owner may not have a

58
00:03:05.074 --> 00:03:09.069
clue of just what a user story is, let alone an epic.

59
00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:12.175
You may want to mentor and coach the product owner so

60
00:03:12.175 --> 00:03:14.139
that they can write them better.

61
00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:18.553
But in my experience, product owners are not always eager for this option.

62
00:03:18.553 --> 00:03:23.033
You may need to decide as a member of the development team to rephrase

63
00:03:23.033 --> 00:03:26.341
the product owner's terminology into user stories,

64
00:03:26.341 --> 00:03:29.773
and then present them back to the product owner for

65
00:03:29.773 --> 00:03:32.426
validation and potential clarifications.

66
00:03:32.426 --> 00:03:35.707
For product owners that are not interested in writing their own user stories,

67
00:03:35.707 --> 00:03:39.181
this option may be the best course of action for you.

68
00:03:39.181 --> 00:03:42.929
Or, based on interviews and discussions with the product owner,

69
00:03:42.929 --> 00:03:46.956
you write the user stories from the very beginning and then run them by the

70
00:03:46.956 --> 00:03:50.818
product owner to ensure that they are correct and accurate.

71
00:03:50.818 --> 00:03:52.343
Now backlogs evolve.

72
00:03:52.343 --> 00:03:56.238
The earliest representation of the backlog may be a bit crude,

73
00:03:56.238 --> 00:03:59.629
fuzzy, and not very well-understood set of requirements.

74
00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:03.483
Then it evolves as the product owner and the team

75
00:04:03.483 --> 00:04:10.000
move through the Agile process. Now let's check out some good traits of developer tasks.
