00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:04.264
Velocity means the speed of something in a direction.

2
00:00:04.264 --> 00:00:09.555
In our case, it means the amount of work a team can produce in a single sprint.

3
00:00:09.555 --> 00:00:10.398
Velocity, therefore,

4
00:00:10.398 --> 00:00:14.911
equals the total points for fully completed user stories in a sprint.

5
00:00:14.911 --> 00:00:17.733
Velocity is the key to sprint planning.

6
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:21.196
Velocity-driven sprint planning is based on the premise that the

7
00:00:21.196 --> 00:00:25.049
amount of work a team will do in the coming sprint is roughly equal

8
00:00:25.049 --> 00:00:27.509
to what they've done in prior sprints.

9
00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:31.165
This will help us predict the amount of work or story points we can deliver,

10
00:00:31.165 --> 00:00:36.000
and we will see velocity in action later in this module. Now let's check out timeboxing.
