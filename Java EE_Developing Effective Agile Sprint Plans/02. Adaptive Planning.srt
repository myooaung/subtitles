00:00:01,134 --> 00:00:02,035
Avoiding problems,

2
00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:05,748
or an alternative title for this section may be

3
00:00:05,748 --> 00:00:07,496
avoiding problems in the first place.

4
00:00:07,496 --> 00:00:13,079
So we will discuss a variety of topics to better prepare you ahead of time.

5
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:16,664
Organizational culture verses adaptive planning.

6
00:00:16,664 --> 00:00:18,299
So what does that mean?

7
00:00:18,299 --> 00:00:21,685
As we know, Agile and Scrum are based on adaptive planning.

8
00:00:21,685 --> 00:00:24,178
That's been our norm for a while now.

9
00:00:24,178 --> 00:00:27,420
We are always making little course corrections as needed

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,103
with each and every sprint and release.

11
00:00:30,103 --> 00:00:32,862
But do organizations understand this approach?

12
00:00:32,862 --> 00:00:33,555
Does yours?

13
00:00:33,555 --> 00:00:36,327
Many do not or may give lip service.

14
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:40,814
That is their commitment is expressed in words, but not backed by actions.

15
00:00:40,814 --> 00:00:42,641
Organizational cultures.

16
00:00:42,641 --> 00:00:44,612
They are all different and varied.

17
00:00:44,612 --> 00:00:45,703
What is yours like?

18
00:00:45,703 --> 00:00:48,943
Most do not have any form of adaptive planning.

19
00:00:48,943 --> 00:00:51,950
Agile, Scrum, lean manufacturing,

20
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:54,624
and all the rest have been around for a very long time,

21
00:00:54,624 --> 00:00:57,767
but not all companies embrace these approaches.

22
00:00:57,767 --> 00:01:00,860
Management wants budget and schedule upfront and early or

23
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,519
they may not even approve your project.

24
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:05,961
Now, I think this is a good thing.

25
00:01:05,961 --> 00:01:08,625
Management is doing their job by allocating and

26
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:11,492
managing limited company resources.

27
00:01:11,492 --> 00:01:14,317
Typically, executives want concrete plans,

28
00:01:14,317 --> 00:01:18,189
deliverables, and milestones throughout the project's lifecycle.

29
00:01:18,189 --> 00:01:20,489
So the project manager, technical leader,

30
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:24,418
or the leader of the self-directed team will still need to

31
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:27,723
have the necessary business documents, reports,

32
00:01:27,723 --> 00:01:30,668
and statuses for your collective leadership,

33
00:01:30,668 --> 00:01:33,490
that is managers and executives.

34
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:36,262
So you should not snub your Agile nose at your organization.

35
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:41,636
I have seen this at times from Agile purists, and that is very disrespectful.

36
00:01:41,636 --> 00:01:44,014
Senior management is running the company.

37
00:01:44,014 --> 00:01:47,339
They have budgets, schedules, milestones, timelines.

38
00:01:47,339 --> 00:01:50,426
Please respect your organization's culture and methods.

39
00:01:50,426 --> 00:01:55,630
You may need to adapt your behavior to match theirs.

40
00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:00,034
Striving to work within your organization's culture might mean presenting

41
00:02:00,034 --> 00:02:04,040
artifacts to the executives while running an Agile project.

42
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,830
This is not an easy endeavor for most Agile and

43
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,066
sprint teams that I have observed.

44
00:02:09,066 --> 00:02:11,620
The team is focused on delivering working software,

45
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,883
not status in upper management.

46
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:15,386
That is why I like, at times,

47
00:02:15,386 --> 00:02:18,887
to have a project leader on the team to provide the

48
00:02:18,887 --> 00:02:21,816
communication conduit to management,

49
00:02:21,816 --> 00:02:25,292
thus allowing the engineering team to do what they do best,

50
00:02:25,292 --> 00:02:27,062
and that's write great software.

51
00:02:27,062 --> 00:02:29,654
That is why having a solid product vision,

52
00:02:29,654 --> 00:02:33,776
roadmap, and release plans, which are regularly updated,

53
00:02:33,776 --> 00:02:37,017
is essential to show your executives just what you're doing.

54
00:02:37,017 --> 00:02:40,579
Those artifacts tend to be more understandable to executives,

55
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:43,430
and be sure to include budgets, schedules,

56
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,143
and feature milestones.

57
00:02:45,143 --> 00:02:47,897
Please note every company is different,

58
00:02:47,897 --> 00:02:52,422
so the point of this slide is to make you aware of the potential

59
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:55,511
circumstances which may affect your Agile projects.

60
00:02:55,511 --> 00:02:59,085
So reflect for a moment where your organization is relative to

61
00:02:59,085 --> 00:03:01,787
the topics and issues we discussed here,

62
00:03:01,787 --> 00:03:06,039
and think about how you might adapt and relate your agile work in a

63
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:15,000
more effective way to your organization's management. This is important to your success in your Agile and Scrum projects.
