The Burnup Chart: Assessing your Sprint.

2
00:00:03,386 --> 00:00:07,970
I am sure you've heard of the term burndown, but I like the term burnup instead.

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:10,898
Both forms of the burn chart would be fine to use.

4
00:00:10,898 --> 00:00:13,388
It's just that burnup sounds better to me.

5
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:18,364
A burnup chart provides a bird's-eye view of the project's progress,

6
00:00:18,364 --> 00:00:21,843
or the releases progress, and also, of course,

7
00:00:21,843 --> 00:00:23,141
the sprint's progress.

8
00:00:23,141 --> 00:00:29,178
Burnup shows the aggregation of completed story points over a period of time,

9
00:00:29,178 --> 00:00:32,545
and burndown shows the remaining story points for a

10
00:00:32,545 --> 00:00:34,736
sprint or release or project.

11
00:00:34,736 --> 00:00:36,041
Why is burnup important?

12
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:40,581
It shows a quick and easy way to determine the health of the sprint,

13
00:00:40,581 --> 00:00:43,332
that is, how well are we doing?

14
00:00:43,332 --> 00:00:46,935
Metrics of the burnup are tied to the unit of measure for the sprint,

15
00:00:46,935 --> 00:00:50,182
which may be, of course, story points, which I like,

16
00:00:50,182 --> 00:00:52,970
could even be hours, or another metric you may be using.

17
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:59,159
So at the end of the sprint, the burnup value is the velocity of that sprint.

18
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,507
Let's see an example.

19
00:01:00,507 --> 00:01:03,785
Many automated tools allow you to simply click and get to

20
00:01:03,785 --> 00:01:07,073
see the burnup or down chart by sprint, release,

21
00:01:07,073 --> 00:01:08,507
or full project.

22
00:01:08,507 --> 00:01:10,155
Let's go through an example.

23
00:01:10,155 --> 00:01:12,804
Here we are starting the sprint day one.

24
00:01:12,804 --> 00:01:17,638
This sprint's backlog has three user stories: 7, 2, and 1.

25
00:01:17,638 --> 00:01:20,312
The next column is the points, which total the 44 points,

26
00:01:20,312 --> 00:01:24,698
and the third and last column called Done are all 0s since

27
00:01:24,698 --> 00:01:27,633
this is the first day of the sprint.

28
00:01:27,633 --> 00:01:30,140
Below, you will see a simple chart which summarizes our sprint,

29
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:36,351
and since we are just getting started, the burnup for week 1 and 2 are 0s,

30
00:01:36,351 --> 00:01:38,972
and our sprint goal is 44.

31
00:01:38,972 --> 00:01:43,319
Now we are in day five, or the end of the first week, of a two-week sprint.

32
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:46,170
We have completed user story 1, which is 10 story points,

33
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:51,110
so the total for the week is 10 completed points.

34
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,171
That would be represented in this chart.

35
00:01:53,171 --> 00:01:56,089
Week 1 is 10 points.

36
00:01:56,089 --> 00:02:00,608
Now we are on the last day, day 10, of the 2-week sprint.

37
00:02:00,608 --> 00:02:03,802
We have completed user story 7, which is 22 points,

38
00:02:03,802 --> 00:02:07,890
so the total for the sprint is 32 completed points.

39
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,473
That would be represented in this chart where week 1 is 10 points

40
00:02:11,473 --> 00:02:16,533
and week 2 is the aggregate total of 32 points.

41
00:02:16,533 --> 00:02:17,877
And let's see just what happened.

42
00:02:17,877 --> 00:02:21,786
Our velocity for this sprint is 32 story points.

43
00:02:21,786 --> 00:02:24,363
So we can see that our sprint goal was 44 points,

44
00:02:24,363 --> 00:02:27,419
but our sprint result was only 32 points,

45
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:29,128
12 points shy.

46
00:02:29,128 --> 00:02:29,616
No worries.

47
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:33,602
And here are some reasons why we may be short of our goal.

48
00:02:33,602 --> 00:02:35,327
The team may be too aggressive.

49
00:02:35,327 --> 00:02:37,438
The business domain may be complicated,

50
00:02:37,438 --> 00:02:39,601
so it took more time to figure things out.

51
00:02:39,601 --> 00:02:43,942
The team may be new to Agile and Scrum or just be new to each other.

52
00:02:43,942 --> 00:02:46,287
That is the team may be Scrum experienced,

53
00:02:46,287 --> 00:02:48,305
but just don't get to know each other.

54
00:02:48,305 --> 00:02:49,337
What to do next?

55
00:02:49,337 --> 00:02:53,325
Well, you might set your target to 32 points for the next sprint,

56
00:02:53,325 --> 00:02:57,747
or I would set your target to the revised average velocity of the

57
00:02:57,747 --> 00:03:01,778
release you are in or the last couple of releases.

58
00:03:01,778 --> 00:03:05,130
Do your retrospective, see what improvements you could make.

59
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:08,114
And don't forget, your sprint cadence will vary,

60
00:03:08,114 --> 00:03:16,000
and it's not perfect, and that is totally fine and normal. Now let's put all of this together with an example.
