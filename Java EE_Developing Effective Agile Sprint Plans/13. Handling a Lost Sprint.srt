00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:02,615
Handling a lost sprint.

2
00:00:02,615 --> 00:00:03,682
Sometimes life happens,

3
00:00:03,682 --> 00:00:07,096
and you realize mid-sprint you have nothing to demonstrate to

4
00:00:07,096 --> 00:00:09,397
the product owner for the upcoming demo.

5
00:00:09,397 --> 00:00:12,101
Then the sprint is declared a lost sprint.

6
00:00:12,101 --> 00:00:13,226
Well, what to do?

7
00:00:13,226 --> 00:00:14,351
Roll back the code,

8
00:00:14,351 --> 00:00:18,327
but you can likely just keep the sprint moving forward for the next sprint.

9
00:00:18,327 --> 00:00:20,636
Use your last velocity moving forward,

10
00:00:20,636 --> 00:00:24,141
not the velocity of this spring since it's dead on arrival.

11
00:00:24,141 --> 00:00:25,926
Inform your product owner.

12
00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:28,451
Now, this could be a tough conversation,

13
00:00:28,451 --> 00:00:33,004
so clearly convey your rationale as to why this sprint is lost.

14
00:00:33,004 --> 00:00:35,616
Focus on your sprint review and retrospective on what

15
00:00:35,616 --> 00:00:38,028
happened and how you will move forward,

16
00:00:38,028 --> 00:00:42,261
and also discuss how you can avoid this situation in the future.

17
00:00:42,261 --> 00:00:44,262
Now this should only happen rarely.

18
00:00:44,262 --> 00:00:46,223
If it happens more than you think it should,

19
00:00:46,223 --> 00:00:50,103
then something is wrong, maybe seriously wrong.

20
00:00:50,103 --> 00:00:53,042
Seek out other Agile and sprint experts in your company

21
00:00:53,042 --> 00:00:54,998
or maybe external consulting firms,

22
00:00:54,998 --> 00:01:03,000
and see if they can provide insights and recommendations. Make your process course corrections, and move forward.
