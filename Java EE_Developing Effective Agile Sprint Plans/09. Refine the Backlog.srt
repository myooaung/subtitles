1
00:00:01,284 --> 00:00:03,120
Step 1 - Refine the Backlog.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,534
The complete product backlog should always be available for

3
00:00:05,534 --> 00:00:07,612
any release in sprint planning exercises.

4
00:00:07,612 --> 00:00:12,414
The release 3 backlog is simply a subset of the complete backlog.

5
00:00:12,414 --> 00:00:16,079
Revisit the release product backlog to ensure the list is still accurate,

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,511
remove items to be placed in a future release,

7
00:00:18,511 --> 00:00:20,408
or remove some altogether.

8
00:00:20,408 --> 00:00:22,820
What we are left with are the items for the second

9
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,476
sprint in release 3 for this example.

10
00:00:25,476 --> 00:00:28,674
Always focus on the user stories and features that provide

11
00:00:28,674 --> 00:00:32,542
the highest business value at the lowest cost at this

12
00:00:32,542 --> 00:00:34,715
point in time in the project.

13
00:00:34,715 --> 00:00:37,448
Now let's go through in detail the potential outcomes

14
00:00:37,448 --> 00:00:39,751
of refinement and considerations.

15
00:00:39,751 --> 00:00:41,865
There may be some leftover items from sprint 1,

16
00:00:41,865 --> 00:00:43,944
and here's how you may disposition them.

17
00:00:43,944 --> 00:00:48,187
Add them back to sprint 2, place them back on the release 3 backlog,

18
00:00:48,187 --> 00:00:50,620
place them back on the whole product backlog,

19
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:54,294
or maybe the item is just not required, so remove it.

20
00:00:54,294 --> 00:00:59,161
Now, for the sprint 2 backlog, which are the originally planned items.

21
00:00:59,161 --> 00:01:01,941
Maybe place some back on release 3 backlogs since

22
00:01:01,941 --> 00:01:03,538
they're no longer that important.

23
00:01:03,538 --> 00:01:05,095
Place back on the product backlog.

24
00:01:05,095 --> 00:01:06,877
Maybe they're even less important.

25
00:01:06,877 --> 00:01:08,340
Or they aren't needed at all,

26
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,168
so we're going to go ahead and remove them completely.

27
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:17,000
Okay, so now we have a pretty good list of items for the sprint. Now let's make some estimates.
