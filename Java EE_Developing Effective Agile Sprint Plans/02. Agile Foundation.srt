1
00:00:01,358 --> 00:00:06,323
In this section, we will discuss the Agile foundation and the participants.

2
00:00:06,323 --> 00:00:06,883
In business,

3
00:00:06,883 --> 00:00:11,323
a lifecycle is the process of managing the entire lifecycle of a product,

4
00:00:11,323 --> 00:00:15,098
and in our case, software, from inception through engineering,

5
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:16,992
design, and manufacturer.

6
00:00:16,992 --> 00:00:20,688
First, Agile delivers software incrementally and iteratively.

7
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:23,890
Incrementally means we have an incremental process in which

8
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,830
software is developed and delivered in parts.

9
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:31,424
Each part, or increment, represents a completely working piece of functionality.

10
00:00:31,424 --> 00:00:33,777
The size of the increment is not really important,

11
00:00:33,777 --> 00:00:38,269
but an increment is a fully coded and tested piece of software.

12
00:00:38,269 --> 00:00:40,666
Now an iterative process is one that makes progress

13
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:42,566
through successive refinement.

14
00:00:42,566 --> 00:00:44,218
For example, in the first iteration,

15
00:00:44,218 --> 00:00:47,848
we have a web page that you can search for courses at a university with

16
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:51,752
maybe only three filters and four columns of data returned.

17
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:54,869
And maybe in the next iteration we have a few more complex

18
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:58,331
filters and more course attributes that is columns.

19
00:00:58,331 --> 00:01:00,911
Value-driven verses plan-driven.

20
00:01:00,911 --> 00:01:05,441
Agile is often referred to as a value- driven approach as opposed to the

21
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:08,455
traditional Waterfall approach that is plan-driven.

22
00:01:08,455 --> 00:01:09,053
Hence,

23
00:01:09,053 --> 00:01:13,761
iterations need to provide value verses an arbitrary planning day

24
00:01:13,761 --> 00:01:16,735
forcing features that may not provide needed value.

25
00:01:16,735 --> 00:01:17,844
Also with Agile,

26
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:22,670
the value of features drives the order of work to be developed and delivered.

27
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:25,775
Items with the most value, as determined by the business,

28
00:01:25,775 --> 00:01:27,875
are prioritized the highest.

29
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:31,133
And the Agile values, based on the Agile Manifesto,

30
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:35,531
drive the way the work itself is performed.

31
00:01:35,531 --> 00:01:41,255
Most importantly to me is for you to be flexible and adaptable at all times.

32
00:01:41,255 --> 00:01:45,491
Nothing that I'll be discussing in this course is cast in concrete.

33
00:01:45,491 --> 00:01:49,209
Life and software development is not that simple.

34
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:50,799
With these foundations in mind,

35
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,981
they will act as the underpinnings of an Agile project.

36
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:57,456
And as with all projects, they have a lifecycle.

37
00:01:57,456 --> 00:01:58,982
Let's explore.

38
00:01:58,982 --> 00:02:02,678
A process group denotes a collection of one or more processes.

39
00:02:02,678 --> 00:02:07,826
With traditional project management, we had five process groups: initiation,

40
00:02:07,826 --> 00:02:11,355
planning, execution, performance and monitoring,

41
00:02:11,355 --> 00:02:13,058
and lastly, closure.

42
00:02:13,058 --> 00:02:16,628
Now let's check out the Agile/Scrum process groups on the next slide.

43
00:02:16,628 --> 00:02:19,402
With Agile, there are four process groups.

44
00:02:19,402 --> 00:02:22,079
The first is the project, the overall container,

45
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:26,154
if you will, of the activities of this Agile effort.

46
00:02:26,154 --> 00:02:28,150
Next, projects have releases.

47
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:32,886
That is a project we've made up of a series of product releases.

48
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:33,370
Next,

49
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:37,347
there are multiple iterations per release just as there

50
00:02:37,347 --> 00:02:39,430
are multiple releases per project.

51
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:43,928
Also in Scrum terminology, an iteration is known as a sprint.

52
00:02:43,928 --> 00:02:46,600
I will use them interchangeably in this course.

53
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,649
Lastly, daily work,

54
00:02:47,649 --> 00:02:52,630
which is what the team does every day with an iteration or a sprint.

55
00:02:52,630 --> 00:03:01,000
Several days of work make up an iteration or sprint. Now let's check out the participants and their roles and expectations.
