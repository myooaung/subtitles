1
00:00:01,084 --> 00:00:05,744
The daily standup, or the daily scrum, as it known within the Scrum methodology,

2
00:00:05,744 --> 00:00:10,208
is an important and vital event within the Agile and sprint frameworks.

3
00:00:10,208 --> 00:00:11,969
The daily standup, or scrum,

4
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:15,984
is a 15-minute timeboxed event for the development team.

5
00:00:15,984 --> 00:00:18,743
The daily scrum is held every day of the sprint.

6
00:00:18,743 --> 00:00:24,234
And also, in extremely critical times, there could be a second one midday.

7
00:00:24,234 --> 00:00:26,550
When it is crunch time, I like a midday scrum,

8
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,894
and I might timebox it at just maybe 5 to 8 minutes.

9
00:00:29,894 --> 00:00:33,000
The daily scrum is held at the same time and place

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,260
each day to reduce any confusion.

11
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:40,826
The daily scrum optimizes team collaboration and performance by reviewing,

12
00:00:40,826 --> 00:00:44,980
checking, examining their work since the last daily scrum,

13
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:48,715
and forecasting upcoming work for that day.

14
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:51,009
This activity enables open, honest,

15
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:54,377
and safe discussions and communicates to ensure that

16
00:00:54,377 --> 00:00:57,793
everyone knows what's going on, or for that matter,

17
00:00:57,793 --> 00:00:58,947
not going on.

18
00:00:58,947 --> 00:00:59,329
Next,

19
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:02,915
the development team uses the daily scrum to inspect

20
00:01:02,915 --> 00:01:05,011
progress towards the sprint goal.

21
00:01:05,011 --> 00:01:09,190
Every day the development team should understand how it intends to

22
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:13,347
work together as a self-organizing team to accomplish the sprint

23
00:01:13,347 --> 00:01:16,104
goals and create the anticipated increment,

24
00:01:16,104 --> 00:01:20,055
that is working software by the end of the sprint.

25
00:01:20,055 --> 00:01:23,546
This is a key meeting to inspect and adapt.

26
00:01:23,546 --> 00:01:26,196
Through communication and collaboration,

27
00:01:26,196 --> 00:01:30,200
the team will be able to adapt, that is make adjustments,

28
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,114
maybe switch assignments, brainstorm any blockers,

29
00:01:33,114 --> 00:01:34,098
seek help,

30
00:01:34,098 --> 00:01:38,895
or have any questions answered by later reaching out to the product owner.

31
00:01:38,895 --> 00:01:42,671
Remember, the product owner is typically not at the daily scrum.

32
00:01:42,671 --> 00:01:46,051
But if it works for you occasionally, well, do it.

33
00:01:46,051 --> 00:01:49,418
Cadence or pace, if you will, of the daily standup.

34
00:01:49,418 --> 00:01:52,473
The structure of the meeting is set by the development team and

35
00:01:52,473 --> 00:01:56,226
certainly can be managed in different ways as long as it focuses

36
00:01:56,226 --> 00:01:59,235
on progress towards the sprint goal.

37
00:01:59,235 --> 00:02:01,181
Here's how it would typically go.

38
00:02:01,181 --> 00:02:05,702
What did I do yesterday that helped the development team meet the sprint's goal?

39
00:02:05,702 --> 00:02:10,478
For example, I completed user story X and began user story Y.

40
00:02:10,478 --> 00:02:15,010
What will I do today to help the development team meet the sprint goal?

41
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:19,834
For example, I will continue working on user story Y.

42
00:02:19,834 --> 00:02:23,056
Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the

43
00:02:23,056 --> 00:02:25,220
development team from meeting the sprint's goal?

44
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,351
For example, at this time, no,

45
00:02:27,351 --> 00:02:30,200
as long as Mary completes the database design task.

46
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:35,863
Note that I ended my statements with a phrase to meet the sprint goal.

47
00:02:35,863 --> 00:02:37,112
It may sound redundant,

48
00:02:37,112 --> 00:02:41,026
but this is important since it reinforces and focuses

49
00:02:41,026 --> 00:02:44,116
the discussion on the sprint outcomes.

50
00:02:44,116 --> 00:02:47,316
If any issues or questions are identified that would not

51
00:02:47,316 --> 00:02:49,248
fit into the daily standup's timebox,

52
00:02:49,248 --> 00:02:53,019
the development team or team members may meet immediately after

53
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:57,300
the daily scrum for more detailed discussions or to adapt or

54
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,422
re-plan the rest of the sprint's goals.

55
00:02:59,422 --> 00:03:06,000
So, as we work through our sprint, how are we doing towards our goal? How do we know?
