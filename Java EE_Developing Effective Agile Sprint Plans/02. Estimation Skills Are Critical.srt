1
00:00:01,364 --> 00:00:02,408
Estimation, velocity,

2
00:00:02,408 --> 00:00:07,048
and timeboxing are three critical concepts that need to first be

3
00:00:07,048 --> 00:00:09,675
understood before we dive into release planning and,

4
00:00:09,675 --> 00:00:12,186
in particular, iteration or sprint planning.

5
00:00:12,186 --> 00:00:15,878
I will be referring to these topics later in this module as I show

6
00:00:15,878 --> 00:00:18,276
you examples of release and sprint planning.

7
00:00:18,276 --> 00:00:23,467
To be clear, solid estimating skills are vital to the Agile team's productivity,

8
00:00:23,467 --> 00:00:25,753
reliability, and predictability.

9
00:00:25,753 --> 00:00:30,263
Reliable estimates enable a team to predict how much value

10
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:32,926
can be delivered in a certain time period,

11
00:00:32,926 --> 00:00:35,419
such as a release or iteration.

12
00:00:35,419 --> 00:00:39,201
Predictability enables reliable delivery.

13
00:00:39,201 --> 00:00:43,063
So if an Agile team can reliably predict what it can do in a timebox,

14
00:00:43,063 --> 00:00:46,311
then the team can more reliably predict what it might be able

15
00:00:46,311 --> 00:00:48,512
to deliver over several timebox sprints,

16
00:00:48,512 --> 00:00:51,927
or iterations, or releases, or for that matter,

17
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:52,852
an entire project.

18
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:55,023
Yes, estimation is critical.

19
00:00:55,023 --> 00:00:58,534
Now let's see how quality estimation adds value to the

20
00:00:58,534 --> 00:01:00,842
release in sprint planning process.

21
00:01:00,842 --> 00:01:03,361
The time it takes your team to make estimates may seem

22
00:01:03,361 --> 00:01:05,934
like overhead or non- value added work.

23
00:01:05,934 --> 00:01:07,103
On the contrary.

24
00:01:07,103 --> 00:01:11,608
Estimating provides considerable value for several reasons.

25
00:01:11,608 --> 00:01:13,565
One, determining cost.

26
00:01:13,565 --> 00:01:16,721
That is how much effort or resources will it take.

27
00:01:16,721 --> 00:01:18,926
Two, establishing prioritization.

28
00:01:18,926 --> 00:01:22,681
Estimates are used to support the prioritization process and thus

29
00:01:22,681 --> 00:01:25,755
contributes to delivering value to the business.

30
00:01:25,755 --> 00:01:28,712
And three, scheduling and commitment.

31
00:01:28,712 --> 00:01:31,114
The ability to commit to near-term deliverables.

32
00:01:31,114 --> 00:01:31,859
For example,

33
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:36,882
backlog items in an iteration or sprint is the key to building a reliable,

34
00:01:36,882 --> 00:01:38,419
agile environment.

35
00:01:38,419 --> 00:01:42,194
Now in order to estimate, you need a unit of measure.

36
00:01:42,194 --> 00:01:44,341
Here are a few options.

37
00:01:44,341 --> 00:01:48,090
Ideal days, in other words, how long would it take you,

38
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,618
and only you, with no interruptions to get something done,

39
00:01:51,618 --> 00:01:56,695
and you have all the tools or whatever you need fully available.

40
00:01:56,695 --> 00:02:02,063
Ideal hours are just like ideal days, except hours with no interruptions,

41
00:02:02,063 --> 00:02:05,085
and again, all the tools and support you need is available.

42
00:02:05,085 --> 00:02:08,007
Another unit of measure is story points.

43
00:02:08,007 --> 00:02:10,588
They are quite common and recommended.

44
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:13,036
Story points are a unit of measure for expressing the

45
00:02:13,036 --> 00:02:16,542
overall size of an effort of a user story,

46
00:02:16,542 --> 00:02:18,222
feature, or task.

47
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:22,289
The number of story points chosen is influenced by complexity,

48
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:24,912
uncertainty, risk, volume, and work.

49
00:02:24,912 --> 00:02:25,612
And plus,

50
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:31,196
they're very personal to you and your perception of what it would take to go do.

51
00:02:31,196 --> 00:02:32,634
Now everyone understands hours,

52
00:02:32,634 --> 00:02:36,725
so it may be easier to start with a unit of measure of hours since

53
00:02:36,725 --> 00:02:40,293
story points can take a little time to get used to.

54
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:42,586
So use a model that everyone understands,

55
00:02:42,586 --> 00:02:46,564
seems easy to apply, and try and use throughout the project.

56
00:02:46,564 --> 00:02:49,495
But if the story point scale does not seem to be working,

57
00:02:49,495 --> 00:02:51,216
then, by all means, change it.

58
00:02:51,216 --> 00:02:53,318
Remember, we are agile.

59
00:02:53,318 --> 00:02:55,623
Now let's look at some choices for story points.

60
00:02:55,623 --> 00:03:00,773
First, determine the story point model your team will use throughout the project.

61
00:03:00,773 --> 00:03:04,792
Those choices could be simple story points that people just

62
00:03:04,792 --> 00:03:08,006
think of and conceive their own relative values.

63
00:03:08,006 --> 00:03:10,533
Typical agile estimating uses abstract values,

64
00:03:10,533 --> 00:03:14,169
which are based on a scale to determine relative values.

65
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:22,481
For example, an exponential scale begins at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128.

66
00:03:22,481 --> 00:03:27,505
So those are the only potential values in estimating a story's number of points.

67
00:03:27,505 --> 00:03:32,906
Or maybe a Fibonacci scale: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100.

68
00:03:32,906 --> 00:03:37,646
Again, those are the only potential value in estimating a story's points.

69
00:03:37,646 --> 00:03:41,636
Estimates are relative to you and not the full team.

70
00:03:41,636 --> 00:03:45,868
They are what you believe is your interpretation of abstract effort.

71
00:03:45,868 --> 00:03:53,000
We will talk more about story points later in the module. Next, how many story points can your team deliver?
