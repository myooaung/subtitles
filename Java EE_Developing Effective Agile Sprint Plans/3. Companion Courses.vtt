00:00:00.797 --> 00:00:03.801
I would like to quickly suggest several companion courses

2
00:00:03.801 --> 00:00:07.605
that can enhance your overall Agile, Scrum,

3
00:00:07.605 --> 00:00:10.924
and soft skill capabilities.

4
00:00:10.924 --> 00:00:15.235
You might want to consider the course, Best Practices for Project Estimation.

5
00:00:15.235 --> 00:00:18.690
We talked about the critical importance of estimation in sprint planning,

6
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.116
so this course would give you more background and

7
00:00:21.116 --> 00:00:27.253
knowledge of estimation techniques, as well as agile estimation.

8
00:00:27.253 --> 00:00:30.025
Everything we've talked about in this entire course has an

9
00:00:30.025 --> 00:00:33.264
underpinning and requirement for strong and dynamic

10
00:00:33.264 --> 00:00:36.495
leadership and communication skills, so check out the course,

11
00:00:36.495 --> 00:00:41.668
Leadership and Communication Skills for Software Engineers.

12
00:00:41.668 --> 00:00:43.698
Now if you are still in both worlds,

13
00:00:43.698 --> 00:00:46.216
some Agile and some traditional project management,

14
00:00:46.216 --> 00:00:49.548
this companion course may be very helpful for you.

15
00:00:49.548 --> 00:00:54.244
I have seen that many companies are doing a sort of blend of the two approaches,

16
00:00:54.244 --> 00:00:56.886
Agile and traditional in the same project even.

17
00:00:56.886 --> 00:01:00.378
So if you need to learn more about the traditional project management approach,

18
00:01:00.378 --> 00:01:04.126
you might want to check out this course as well.

19
00:01:04.126 --> 00:01:08.421
Nothing gets done today and done well without great teams of people.

20
00:01:08.421 --> 00:01:15.000
If you have any leadership or management role within your organization, this course may be very helpful indeed.
