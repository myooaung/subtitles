1
00:00:01,343 --> 00:00:04,288
Step 0 - Preparing for Sprint Planning.

2
00:00:04,288 --> 00:00:07,029
First, assemble the team of the product owner,

3
00:00:07,029 --> 00:00:10,547
Scrum Master, or dev lead, and the dev team.

4
00:00:10,547 --> 00:00:13,683
Next, you need access to the backlogs, of course.

5
00:00:13,683 --> 00:00:16,283
In this example, we are in release 3, and hence,

6
00:00:16,283 --> 00:00:19,476
the release 3 backlog would be available for the planning team,

7
00:00:19,476 --> 00:00:21,912
but you will need to have the entire backlog available in

8
00:00:21,912 --> 00:00:24,193
case you need to move things around.

9
00:00:24,193 --> 00:00:28,678
Business is dynamic, and so priorities and stories are bound to change.

10
00:00:28,678 --> 00:00:32,004
It is very important to review the outcome of the last

11
00:00:32,004 --> 00:00:33,876
sprint's retrospective and review.

12
00:00:33,876 --> 00:00:36,975
And if the last sprint was the last sprint within the last release,

13
00:00:36,975 --> 00:00:40,797
then also review the release retrospective and review the release feedback.

14
00:00:40,797 --> 00:00:47,000
So now we have the three main elements to move forward with our planning. Now let's look at the next step.
