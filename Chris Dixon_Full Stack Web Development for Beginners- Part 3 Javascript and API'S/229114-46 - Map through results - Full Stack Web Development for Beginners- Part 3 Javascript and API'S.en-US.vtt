00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:05.010
We now we have the data which we need to create our song

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.840
listening inside of the main container of the index file.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.435
Let's go to the index.html,

00:00:12.435 --> 00:00:16.125
inside this main section we have left in place

00:00:16.125 --> 00:00:20.115
one song listening and we can use this as a guide.

00:00:20.115 --> 00:00:25.740
We're going to be looping through all the results which we get back from our API and then

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.635
construct a new article section just like this one for each song results.

00:00:31.635 --> 00:00:34.170
We'll create all these same elements using

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.870
JavaScript inside of the final debug section of our premise.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.775
Therefore, we know we have the data which we need to work with

00:00:42.775 --> 00:00:48.705
so let's begin by commenting out this console log from the script.

00:00:48.705 --> 00:00:51.210
Let's go down to here,

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.690
comment this out and then we can store data.results, inside the constant.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.180
Let's copy data.results from here and we set

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:10.800
a constant called artists and set this to data.results.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:17.460
Now we can go ahead and use map to loop through each one of these results. Blow here.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:24.975
Again still within the final.end section we're going to return artists,

00:01:24.975 --> 00:01:29.650
which is our constant just here.map.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.720
Now for each result we get we want to construct a new song.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.630
To do this we need to create our elements.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.164
Back over in the HTML,

00:01:42.164 --> 00:01:43.710
which we've seen before.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.305
First we need to create a article which is a rapper,

00:01:47.305 --> 00:01:49.475
we need to create an image elements,

00:01:49.475 --> 00:01:52.324
we need two sets of P elements,

00:01:52.324 --> 00:01:55.865
one for the artist name and one for the song name.

00:01:55.865 --> 00:01:59.425
Then we also need to construct a audio player,

00:01:59.425 --> 00:02:03.735
which is going to play the first 30 seconds of each song.

00:02:03.735 --> 00:02:08.180
We know how to do is already by using creates elements.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.485
Let's begin by doing this now in the script.

00:02:11.485 --> 00:02:13.925
In side of our map,

00:02:13.925 --> 00:02:15.530
we can say const.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.130
Let's first start with the article,

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.950
answer this to be document.createElement

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.145
and the elements we want to create is the article.

00:02:30.145 --> 00:02:34.320
Let's duplicate this and this one is going to be

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.750
the artist and this time it's going to be P elements.

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.290
One little trick when we're creating multiple variables

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.355
is rather than adding the constants keyword each time,

00:02:49.355 --> 00:02:53.770
instead we can remove this and just separate these with a comma.

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.875
Just like that. Then below our artists we can copy this,

00:02:58.875 --> 00:03:02.975
paste it again and this one is going to be for the song.

00:03:02.975 --> 00:03:06.350
The song name is also a P element too.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.680
Now that's our [inaudible] song,

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.415
which is going to be import the image,

00:03:11.415 --> 00:03:16.920
and for this will cause once a image elements just make as img.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.790
Now after the image,

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.130
we also need to create our audio elements.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.405
Then finally, we also want to create a source elements and this is going to be

00:03:30.405 --> 00:03:32.710
the audio source which is passed in to

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.875
the audio player with the file path of the music we'll want to play.

00:03:36.875 --> 00:03:41.270
Then for the final one, let's call this audioSource,

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.685
and this can be source,

00:03:45.685 --> 00:03:48.515
and with the comma from the ends.

00:03:48.515 --> 00:03:54.670
Now we have our six elements created using JavaScript and stored inside the constants.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.855
We can now set the inner HTML for these text elements.

00:03:58.855 --> 00:04:01.430
We've got two different text elements here.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.435
We want to set the inner HTML.

00:04:04.435 --> 00:04:08.780
We also want to set the source for the image and audio elements too.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.520
Let's do this just below our constants.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.120
Now for each results we get back,

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.455
the information is stored inside this result variable.

00:04:17.455 --> 00:04:19.740
First of all, let's do a quick console.

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:22.730
log and check out the information which is returned

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.515
back to us and stored inside of results.

00:04:26.515 --> 00:04:30.045
Get that saved and then over to the console.

00:04:30.045 --> 00:04:33.960
Now we can see for each song we can open this up and

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.335
find out all the information which is associated with each song.

00:04:38.335 --> 00:04:42.645
Starting with the artist we want to grab the artist's name,

00:04:42.645 --> 00:04:44.190
if we open up this object,

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:49.840
we can see the artist's name is stored in a property called artist's name.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.335
If I could leave this console. log in just for a moment you may need this soon.

00:04:55.335 --> 00:05:00.390
Let's begin by selecting the artist, so artists.

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.265
inner HTML.

00:05:02.265 --> 00:05:05.895
Inside these P elements we're going to add the name of the artist.

00:05:05.895 --> 00:05:09.855
We know we can access this with result and then.

00:05:09.855 --> 00:05:17.570
artist's name, which you've seen inside the console from here.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.720
Next up we can also add to the inner HTML for the song name,

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:28.945
which again is between the P elements stored inside its constant called song, so song.

00:05:28.945 --> 00:05:33.290
inner HTML this time is equal to result.

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:38.625
If we go back over to the browser we want to grab the song name,

00:05:38.625 --> 00:05:45.750
so if we scroll down we can see this song name is stored inside of track name.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:51.555
That track name inside here then the image source,

00:05:51.555 --> 00:05:56.380
so img.source is equal to result.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:00.555
I'm going to grab the artwork associated with the song,

00:06:00.555 --> 00:06:04.920
so let's go for artworkUrl100,

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.260
and this relates to the size,

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.495
so this is a 100 pixels wide.

00:06:09.495 --> 00:06:13.935
I'm just going to copy this, and paste this in.

00:06:13.935 --> 00:06:17.075
I mentioned before that we're going to have

00:06:17.075 --> 00:06:21.244
a audio player and this audio player is going to play a preview,

00:06:21.244 --> 00:06:24.155
which is the first 30 seconds of the song.

00:06:24.155 --> 00:06:29.395
We can find this audio preview if we scroll down to preview URL.

00:06:29.395 --> 00:06:33.150
Scroll down. We have interest here.

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:38.600
As this is the link which is passed in from Itunes to the preview which you want to play.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.555
We can add this preview URL to the audioSource.

00:06:42.555 --> 00:06:46.710
Let's do that now, so audioSource and

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:53.190
then.source is going to be equal to result as we've seen before.

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:56.020
This is preview URL,

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:06.055
also when working with HTML audio elements for this to appear on the screen

00:07:06.055 --> 00:07:08.600
we also need to add the controls attribute

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.730
too otherwise we won't see anything to click on on the screen.

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:17.705
To do this underneath the audioSource we can select the audio player,

00:07:17.705 --> 00:07:21.450
and then we can use.setAttribute.

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:26.105
The name of the attribute we want to add is controls,

00:07:26.105 --> 00:07:27.860
and this doesn't have a value,

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:30.125
so can leave an empty string.

00:07:30.125 --> 00:07:32.885
Now we can answer these elements to be a child,

00:07:32.885 --> 00:07:38.830
elements of the article rather just like we have with the example just here,

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:41.070
so back over to our script.

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:44.270
We need to append our artists, our image,

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:50.420
our song and also the audio to be a child of the article. Let's go down.

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:52.870
I can also remove this console.log.

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:56.060
We have our article stored at the top here,

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:57.905
which is in article elements.

00:07:57.905 --> 00:08:01.655
All these elements are going to be a child of this article.

00:08:01.655 --> 00:08:06.655
Below here we can say article.appendChild,

00:08:06.655 --> 00:08:13.055
and then inside here we can start passing our child elements first of all is the image,

00:08:13.055 --> 00:08:16.340
and let's paste this in three more times.

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:19.600
We also want to add to the artist,

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:25.305
the song and also the audio elements.

00:08:25.305 --> 00:08:31.980
Then finally we also need to append the audioSource as a child of the audio elements.

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:36.570
Let's select the audio.appendChild,

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:42.765
and this is going to be the audioSource. Add this in.

00:08:42.765 --> 00:08:47.710
Great. Now we have an article with all the child elements inside.

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:48.970
We now need to go ahead,

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:51.725
and add this article to the main container.

00:08:51.725 --> 00:08:54.970
The main container is this main section here with

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:59.275
the ideal songs and this is going to contain all of our articles,

00:08:59.275 --> 00:09:01.340
which we have in the results.

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.480
Back over to our scripts.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:09.145
To do this we need to store all this reference to the main section inside of a constant.

00:09:09.145 --> 00:09:12.000
Let's do this at the top.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.050
Just after our map we can say const,

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:19.290
and we can call it song container,

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:24.615
and set this to documents.getEementsById,

00:09:24.615 --> 00:09:28.350
the Id we want to grab was songs,

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:31.780
so let's match this up with this section here.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:36.110
Great. Now we'll have the songContainer we just want to

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:39.245
add all of these articles to this container,

00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:46.880
so down to the appendChild section we can select the songContainer again.

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:51.320
appendChild, and then pass in each available article.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.915
Now if everything has gone well,

00:09:53.915 --> 00:09:59.330
we should see our song articles for each song returned by the API,

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:02.810
get that saved and close this below

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:09.315
the browser and there we go we now see our song data from the API.

00:10:09.315 --> 00:10:15.665
We can also remove our demo one from before that should be this article

00:10:15.665 --> 00:10:22.395
from inside of here bring this up then reload.

00:10:22.395 --> 00:10:26.535
Great. Let's see how this is looking inside of the developer Tools.

00:10:26.535 --> 00:10:29.530
Right-click and inspect.

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:36.085
Here we have the main section from before with the Id of songs,

00:10:36.085 --> 00:10:40.070
if we open up nested inside here we have all of

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:44.495
our articles for each song which had been returned from our API.

00:10:44.495 --> 00:10:50.475
We can open up our article and see all the elements which are added using a pen child.

00:10:50.475 --> 00:10:52.724
First of all, we have the image,

00:10:52.724 --> 00:10:55.920
we have the P elements with the artist's name,

00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:00.650
P elements with the song title and then we have our audio player.

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:04.915
If we're opening up nested inside is the audioSource,

00:11:04.915 --> 00:11:09.300
which we added go back to the script we added

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:15.165
this audioSource as the child to the audio elements and that's what we see just here.

00:11:15.165 --> 00:11:19.430
Also we can see the controls attributes which were added to.

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:21.325
If we remove this,

00:11:21.325 --> 00:11:26.325
let's go back up comment out the setAttributes,

00:11:26.325 --> 00:11:32.410
and then reload, we can see we don't have any audio players now on the screen.

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:36.970
I should move this and add this back in.

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:42.425
Good. Congratulations if this is all working for you.

00:11:42.425 --> 00:11:45.530
You successfully pulled in API data from

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:50.375
an external source this is a big part of our projects now done.

00:11:50.375 --> 00:11:51.660
In the next video,

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:53.490
we'll make use of this search bar,

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:57.635
so we could type in our search term to allow us to search for different songs,

00:11:57.635 --> 00:12:03.120
rather than hard coding in a search term into the URL which is going here.
