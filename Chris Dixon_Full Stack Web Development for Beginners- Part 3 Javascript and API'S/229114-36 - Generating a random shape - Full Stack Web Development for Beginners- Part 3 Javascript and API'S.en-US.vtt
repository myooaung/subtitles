00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.514
In the last video, we added an array of shape objects.

00:00:04.514 --> 00:00:09.420
Now we need a way of randomly selecting one of these shapes from our array.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.325
I'm going to add this to a function called select random shape.

00:00:14.325 --> 00:00:15.960
Back over to our script,

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.980
we can now remove the console log from the last video and then the set a bay

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.210
constant for our function called selectRandomShape.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.000
This is going to be a ES6 array function.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.350
Set this up just like this.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.720
Well, now we can select any of these array items just

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.180
above by the index number. Let's give this a go.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.235
Let's set up a constant called randomShape and

00:00:44.235 --> 00:00:50.290
set this equal to our shapes array and select one of the index numbers.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.350
Do a console log.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.840
Check if this is working okay with the value of a random shape.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.275
In fact, we'll call this randomSelection,

00:01:00.275 --> 00:01:04.970
just to be a bit more clear. Console log this.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.635
Then for this to run,

00:01:06.635 --> 00:01:08.920
we need to call it by its name.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.570
So selectRandomShape, the parentheses.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.630
Now this should run inside the console.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.600
Open it up, reload.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.520
We have a spelling mistake,

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.700
so this should be shapes.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.855
Refresh. Now we're selecting one of our objects.

00:01:31.855 --> 00:01:34.955
Rather than hard coding in a number,

00:01:34.955 --> 00:01:37.550
we want them to be selected randomly.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.415
To do this, we can generate a random number,

00:01:40.415 --> 00:01:42.715
like we have seen previously.

00:01:42.715 --> 00:01:44.745
If we go over to our code,

00:01:44.745 --> 00:01:47.615
this array has 10 objects.

00:01:47.615 --> 00:01:49.820
Arrays also begin at zero,

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.830
so we need to generate a random number between zero and nine.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.630
Let's start this in side of our function.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.305
Let's store this in a constant.

00:02:01.305 --> 00:02:03.990
I'll call this randomNum.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.025
We already know how to do this with Math.random.

00:02:08.025 --> 00:02:11.860
Remember, this will create a random number between zero and one.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.450
Zero was included but one actually isn't,

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.390
so will only go to 0.999.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.000
You'll see premises after this.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.090
To create this random number to be between zero and nine,

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.660
first thing we need to do is multiply

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.395
this random number by the length of our shapes array.

00:02:30.395 --> 00:02:38.460
So shapes.length. Then we can round this number down with Math.floor.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:44.265
Right at a start use Math.floor and then open up the brackets,

00:02:44.265 --> 00:02:48.875
and then we can close this off right at the very end of the shapes.length,

00:02:48.875 --> 00:02:51.310
semicolon at the end.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.110
Just blow this, let's do a second console log

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.000
and then we can output the value of our random number.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.660
Just check this is working okay, as at the same.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.150
Refresh. It says 0, 7,

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:14.285
6, 2, and so 8, there's a 9.

00:03:14.285 --> 00:03:16.460
This all seems to work in okay,

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.760
we don't get anything higher than nine and will also have zero.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.510
This seems to be working completely fine.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.255
Now we've got it, this random number between zero and nine.

00:03:26.255 --> 00:03:31.025
We can replace the hard-coded number from before for our array.

00:03:31.025 --> 00:03:33.035
Rather than selecting number 1,

00:03:33.035 --> 00:03:35.665
let's select our random number.

00:03:35.665 --> 00:03:37.920
Remove the console log from both two,

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.065
we don't need this anymore.

00:03:40.065 --> 00:03:42.735
Give that a "Save" and then over to the console.

00:03:42.735 --> 00:03:44.675
Now if we keep refreshing,

00:03:44.675 --> 00:03:49.470
we should see a different object from our array each time.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.580
Great, so just to finish this video off,

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.935
I'm going to change this console log.

00:03:54.935 --> 00:03:58.055
We don't need to log to the console, and instead,

00:03:58.055 --> 00:04:04.610
just return this randomSelection.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.185
This will return the value so we can use it later.

00:04:08.185 --> 00:04:12.395
Good. This is an important part of this project, taking care of.

00:04:12.395 --> 00:04:15.770
Next, we going to use this random objects and assign it

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.480
to our variables of shape 1 and shape 2,

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:26.040
and also repeat this process every second to keep showing different shapes to compare.
