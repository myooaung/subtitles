00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.705
We're now going to look at using JavaScript functions.

00:00:03.705 --> 00:00:06.810
Functions are really important and they assume FIN,

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.535
which you use a lot when working with JavaScript or programming in general.

00:00:11.535 --> 00:00:14.445
A function is a block or a snippet of code,

00:00:14.445 --> 00:00:16.710
which we can call when required.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.685
You can think of it as a task or a set of tasks which are contained inside this function.

00:00:23.685 --> 00:00:28.665
We can then call this function each time we want to run the code within.

00:00:28.665 --> 00:00:31.920
These functions are also reusable.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.295
We have some code you want to repeat multiple times,

00:00:35.295 --> 00:00:38.370
we can package a code into a function.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.205
Let's get started of in our functions starter file,

00:00:42.205 --> 00:00:45.915
which you've opened up the sidebar is number 13.

00:00:45.915 --> 00:00:50.905
Then down to our scripts we have empty script to get started with.

00:00:50.905 --> 00:00:54.635
We define a function with the function keyword,

00:00:54.635 --> 00:00:58.600
followed by the name we want to give it, such as hi.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.175
This name is completely up to us,

00:01:01.175 --> 00:01:03.950
but try to choose something descriptive.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.559
Then we add to the brackets afterwards,

00:01:06.559 --> 00:01:08.990
which are also known as parentheses.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.155
Then we add a set of curly braces afterwards,

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:14.075
and I want to hit enter.

00:01:14.075 --> 00:01:16.160
Then within these curly braces,

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.935
we can add the code which you want to run,

00:01:18.935 --> 00:01:20.435
one we call a function.

00:01:20.435 --> 00:01:21.740
For a simple example,

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.275
we can just add alert.

00:01:24.275 --> 00:01:26.330
Then inside of here,

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.960
just some text off hi from function.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.469
We can add as many lines of code as we want inside this function,

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:39.080
although it's often good to not overload

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.590
the function and just keep it to warn related task.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.725
This section here won't do anything as of yet,

00:01:45.725 --> 00:01:48.230
as we've only declared this function.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.905
This is why it's sometimes referred to as a function declaration,

00:01:51.905 --> 00:01:54.115
or a function definition.

00:01:54.115 --> 00:01:55.910
To actually run this code,

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.600
we want to call this by the function name of hi,

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.655
followed by the parentheses and the semicolon.

00:02:03.655 --> 00:02:06.755
This is often called invoking a function.

00:02:06.755 --> 00:02:10.309
Now if we save and then open this in the browser,

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:13.295
we now get our code run from inside,

00:02:13.295 --> 00:02:17.005
which is our alert of hi from function.

00:02:17.005 --> 00:02:20.400
We can also call this function as many times as we

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.725
want by repeating the same function code.

00:02:23.725 --> 00:02:26.375
If we copy this and paste it in below,

00:02:26.375 --> 00:02:30.350
we should now see the alert problem twice.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.240
Says our first one,

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.725
click okay, and then our second alert just afterwards.

00:02:36.725 --> 00:02:40.660
This function can contain any codes which we like.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.720
If we went up to the top and added a empty div.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.009
All the fact will go for the p elements and we'll keep this empty,

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:52.075
first add an id of texts.

00:02:52.075 --> 00:02:55.190
We could use this function to go ahead and change

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.510
the inner HTML of our text elements here.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.875
Down inside the function body,

00:03:00.875 --> 00:03:06.950
we know how to do this with a document dot get element by id.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.490
The id is text, which we have here.

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:17.540
Then we can set the inner HTML of all p elements to be

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:25.530
a text string of texts from function with a semicolon at the end.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.750
Now if we remove one of these function calls,

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.880
save, and then over in the browser we get our alert,

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.570
and then our text from function.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.715
This type of function is called a name function,

00:03:40.715 --> 00:03:44.720
simply because we add a name just like we have done here.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.260
There is also an anonymous function too.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.795
This is where we don't give the functional name,

00:03:50.795 --> 00:03:54.025
instead we can assign this function to a variable.

00:03:54.025 --> 00:04:00.410
We can remove the name and just keeping these parentheses just after the function,

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.440
and then we can add a variable.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.115
Let's call this the anonymous function,

00:04:07.115 --> 00:04:10.820
and set the value equal to this function here.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.330
We can then call it by its name of anonymous function,

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.030
so replace hi with this,

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.295
followed by the parentheses,

00:04:19.295 --> 00:04:25.940
reload and their is our alert and also the texts from function is still working.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:32.705
Both ways will do a similar thing by running the code inside of these braces just here.

00:04:32.705 --> 00:04:34.190
There is a difference though,

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.700
and we'll look at what this is seen when we look at

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.610
hoisting but for now let's move on to the next video,

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.550
a look at function arguments.
