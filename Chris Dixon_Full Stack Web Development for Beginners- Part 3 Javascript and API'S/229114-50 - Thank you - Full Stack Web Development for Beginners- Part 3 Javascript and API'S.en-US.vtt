00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
Congratulations on reaching the end of this course.

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.380
I hope you are now a lot more comfortable using JavaScript and working with API data.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.720
We started at the very beginning,

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.435
taken a look at JavaScript basics,

00:00:15.435 --> 00:00:19.575
such as FL statements, operators, strings,

00:00:19.575 --> 00:00:23.340
and variables, then we moved on to how we can

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.555
manipulate the DOM to add interactivity to our projects,

00:00:27.555 --> 00:00:31.005
functions, and how we could work with events.

00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:36.794
We covered arrays, different ways to loop over data and objects,

00:00:36.794 --> 00:00:41.845
all while reinforcing what we've learned with some fun projects.

00:00:41.845 --> 00:00:46.460
Finally, we start things off by working with APIs, promises,

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.995
and fetching data, all while building a

00:00:49.995 --> 00:00:54.390
strong ,find app or everything you've learned into practice.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.050
Remember this is just the third part of this course,

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.075
so be sure to check out the next part to gain a deeper knowledge

00:01:02.075 --> 00:01:06.800
and learn everything you need to know to build Fullstack applications.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.760
Bye for now, and I will see you in the next part of this course.
