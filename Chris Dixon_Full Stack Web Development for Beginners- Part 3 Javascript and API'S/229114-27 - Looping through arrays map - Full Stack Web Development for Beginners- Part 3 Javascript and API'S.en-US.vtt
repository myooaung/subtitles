00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.765
Let's begin by going over to our empty starter,

00:00:03.765 --> 00:00:06.495
which this time is number 24.

00:00:06.495 --> 00:00:10.335
This was a pretty similar example to what we looked at in the last video.

00:00:10.335 --> 00:00:12.645
We have our div, which is empty,

00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:14.985
then we have our animals array.

00:00:14.985 --> 00:00:17.505
Also we have a second array,

00:00:17.505 --> 00:00:20.010
which is our animals set to upperCase,

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.445
which is created using this forEach loop.

00:00:23.445 --> 00:00:27.030
Now we're going to look at another way of looping through arrays,

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.920
which is called map.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.220
First, I want to quickly show you something which will help you

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.595
see the difference between map and forEach.

00:00:35.595 --> 00:00:42.385
If we go ahead and remove the upperCaseName array and place,

00:00:42.385 --> 00:00:46.345
assign the result of the forEach to a variable.

00:00:46.345 --> 00:00:52.650
Let's say var upperCaseNames

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:58.165
and set this to be our animals.forEach.

00:00:58.165 --> 00:01:03.250
Now let's simplify this example by removing the index number.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.810
Remove the second value from inside here,

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.380
remove the contents from this function.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:18.005
Then we can simplify this function by simply returning the animals array.toUpperCase.

00:01:18.005 --> 00:01:23.435
Just like that. Now all we're doing is looping through our original array,

00:01:23.435 --> 00:01:27.499
running a function which will return our animals in upperCase,

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:30.115
and then store them inside this variable.

00:01:30.115 --> 00:01:36.620
This returns diamond ends the execution of the function and then returns the new value.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.300
Now we scroll across,

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.265
we can see this upperCaseNames here,

00:01:40.265 --> 00:01:42.080
which has been up on to the screen.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.050
Now refer to this variable just here.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.380
If we save this and then reload the browser,

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.710
we get the value of undefined.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.135
Just hold onto this for now and we'll talk about this more in a moment.

00:01:56.135 --> 00:01:58.940
However, if we change the forEach,

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.810
this time to be map,

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.985
so remove the forEach keyword from here,

00:02:03.985 --> 00:02:06.605
change this to be.map.

00:02:06.605 --> 00:02:08.905
This time if we refresh,

00:02:08.905 --> 00:02:12.965
we now see the values of our array in upperCase.

00:02:12.965 --> 00:02:16.725
This is a key difference between forEach a map,

00:02:16.725 --> 00:02:19.945
only using map will return a new array.

00:02:19.945 --> 00:02:24.730
Basically, forEach will loop all of the items and do something with them,

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.450
such as making them upperCase and pushing them to a new array,

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.250
or even a database.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.165
Map will also loop over the items and do something with them,

00:02:34.165 --> 00:02:38.800
but it also returns a new array with the transformed items,

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.060
which will have access to by storing them inside of this variable.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.995
Just as a final thought,

00:02:44.995 --> 00:02:50.255
we could also make this function shorter by using the esc auto function.

00:02:50.255 --> 00:02:54.940
Just after.map, we can remove this function keyword

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.220
here and keep our animal and use the arrow.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.535
Just like that. Refresh and our array still works.

00:03:05.535 --> 00:03:08.935
Also remember, if we only have one parameter,

00:03:08.935 --> 00:03:14.915
which we have here, we can even remove the parentheses and make it even shorter.

00:03:14.915 --> 00:03:19.725
Reload the browser and everything still works fine.

00:03:19.725 --> 00:03:23.095
I hope this makes sense for law of purposes,

00:03:23.095 --> 00:03:26.215
map and forEach are interchangeable.

00:03:26.215 --> 00:03:30.870
You will need to use map when you want a new array returned.
