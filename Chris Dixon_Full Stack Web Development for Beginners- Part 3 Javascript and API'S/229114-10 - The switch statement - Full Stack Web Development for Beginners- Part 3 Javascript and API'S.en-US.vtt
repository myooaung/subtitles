00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.070
Welcome back. For this video,

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.845
head over to section 8 of our starter files,

00:00:04.845 --> 00:00:06.885
which is for the switch statement.

00:00:06.885 --> 00:00:11.265
This is the final type of conditional statements which we're going to cover.

00:00:11.265 --> 00:00:16.995
In a way, switch does a similar job to the If/else statements, we've already looked at.

00:00:16.995 --> 00:00:22.005
But the difference is what it can check against as many conditions as we want.

00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:27.720
Then we add a break statement to break out with the switch once a match is found.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.610
Let's give this a try in our switch statement section of the starter code.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.830
Down in between this scripts.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.770
Let's begin again with the variable.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.305
I'm going to set this feed food.

00:00:40.305 --> 00:00:42.795
This can be any food we wants.

00:00:42.795 --> 00:00:45.240
Let's start with eggs.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.760
We then create a switch statement.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.185
The syntax is similar to the if statements.

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:53.480
Inside of the brackets,

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.630
we add the condition that we want to test against.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.300
We want to check the food variable.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.460
Inside the switch statement we can add

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.125
various cases to check if they match this food variable.

00:01:06.125 --> 00:01:08.840
First of all, let's add a case.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.335
We'll say pizza. This checks if pizza matches this variable.

00:01:14.335 --> 00:01:16.830
If it does, we adds a colon

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.475
and then we could declare on the next line what we want to do.

00:01:20.475 --> 00:01:23.355
Let's simply do a console.log.

00:01:23.355 --> 00:01:32.025
Then we'll say pizza is awesome. Just like that.

00:01:32.025 --> 00:01:35.160
Then we can add the break keywords.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.610
We add break to break out with the switch statements,

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.290
if this is a match.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.930
If it's not, it then moves on to the next case.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.020
Let's add a new case here.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.415
Then we can check a second condition. Lets say eggs.

00:01:50.415 --> 00:01:52.580
If this is a match, we then want to do a

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:58.570
console.log to display the message of, "Eggs are awesome."

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.120
Then we're at the break keyword again just afterwards.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.870
Let's add one more case.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.780
This time we'll add bacon,

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.900
colon and then a console.log.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.300
Lets say, "Bacon is awesome."

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.375
Once more break out with the statements.

00:02:24.375 --> 00:02:28.920
That's our switch statements altogether there. Just a recap.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.335
We're creating a variable called eggs.

00:02:31.335 --> 00:02:34.905
We are then checking for matches inside a switch statements.

00:02:34.905 --> 00:02:37.425
If the case of pizza is a match,

00:02:37.425 --> 00:02:40.165
we then prints out the text our pizza is awesome.

00:02:40.165 --> 00:02:42.350
If it is, with then break out with

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.820
a statement and we don't check any the extra cases below.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.380
If it's not a match,

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.905
which isn't in this case,

00:02:48.905 --> 00:02:53.795
then it moves down to eggs and then displays the text of eggs are awesome.

00:02:53.795 --> 00:02:55.565
But this time because it's a match,

00:02:55.565 --> 00:02:58.780
we will break out of the switch statement.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.385
Therefore, it won't even check this next one.

00:03:02.385 --> 00:03:06.425
Let's give that save and reload the browser,

00:03:06.425 --> 00:03:10.830
open up the console, and now we'll go.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.135
Eggs is a match, therefore we get the text of eggs are awesome.

00:03:15.135 --> 00:03:18.830
What do we do if none of these cases are a match?

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.960
For this, we add a default which acts as a fallback.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.225
Right at the very bottom,

00:03:25.225 --> 00:03:27.115
I'm going to add default.

00:03:27.115 --> 00:03:31.070
Then just after this we can add a console.log.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.020
Then for the text, let's say,

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.675
"I love." Then add a space.

00:03:36.675 --> 00:03:39.295
Then we can add to the name of our food.

00:03:39.295 --> 00:03:41.290
With a semicolon at the end.

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.685
Save that and then reload the browser.

00:03:43.685 --> 00:03:47.530
We still get a text of eggs are awesome because we have a match.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.690
However, if we go up and change this food to be anything else, such as cheese.

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.165
Which won't match any of these three cases.

00:03:57.165 --> 00:04:00.135
Therefore, the default will kick in.

00:04:00.135 --> 00:04:03.435
Reload. There we'll go.

00:04:03.435 --> 00:04:05.160
We've got a text of, I love.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.030
Then we pass in the variable of food, which is cheese.

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.025
Note in this default case we've left out break keyword,

00:04:13.025 --> 00:04:15.980
because it's at the end of the switch statement.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.830
We can add this default anywhere we want,

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:23.695
but remember to also use a break if it's not at the very end.

00:04:23.695 --> 00:04:26.900
We can also change things around a little to.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.304
If we wanted to same outcome for a multiple cases,

00:04:30.304 --> 00:04:32.525
we can just combine them like this.

00:04:32.525 --> 00:04:34.294
Let's say after pizza,

00:04:34.294 --> 00:04:36.605
we can add a second case.

00:04:36.605 --> 00:04:39.760
Let's go for pasta,

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.200
again with the colon afterwards.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.925
Now if the case of food matches pizza or pasta.

00:04:47.925 --> 00:04:51.490
We can then say, "I love Italian."

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.185
So save. Let's keep this as cheese for now.

00:04:58.185 --> 00:05:03.280
We'll get the fall back and if we change this to be pasta.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.895
Reload. I love Italian.

00:05:08.895 --> 00:05:14.700
Then pizza and we still get, I love Italian.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:20.090
With switch statements we can also go on with as many cases as we want.

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.420
Now it's time to move on to building a little game to

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:27.350
put the things we've learned in this section into practice.
