00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.855
We've learned that if statements check if a condition is true,

00:00:03.855 --> 00:00:06.975
then else catches all of the cases.

00:00:06.975 --> 00:00:10.455
There is a first case we can use called else if.

00:00:10.455 --> 00:00:13.455
We use else if to check a new condition,

00:00:13.455 --> 00:00:15.825
if the first condition is false.

00:00:15.825 --> 00:00:18.105
We can use it like this.

00:00:18.105 --> 00:00:21.375
So inside of our nested if else statement,

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:23.955
I'm going to add an else if statement.

00:00:23.955 --> 00:00:27.975
So just after this opening, set of curly bases,

00:00:27.975 --> 00:00:30.580
let's add else if,

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.080
and then open and close a new set of curly braces,

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.720
pushing the last else statement to the end.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:45.275
Inside of here, we can add some more brackets to check if a condition is true.

00:00:45.275 --> 00:00:51.150
So let's say if craving is equal to Chinese.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:57.050
So again, we're checking if the variable is equal to hungry.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.730
So let's set this to true.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.515
If it is, then moves onto this nested block here.

00:01:02.515 --> 00:01:06.200
So first of all, it checks if craving is equal to pizza,

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.350
then it will run this alert here.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.475
If not, the second condition of else if,

00:01:11.475 --> 00:01:15.270
will then run, and this time we can do an alert.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:23.115
So let's say this time give me Chinese, just like that.

00:01:23.115 --> 00:01:27.100
If pizza or Chinese is not the value of craving,

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.970
this else statement will run at the end, saying,

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.000
"let's get some food." So save that.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.325
So now our craving is Chinese.

00:01:35.325 --> 00:01:38.520
We should now see the text of give me Chinese.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.890
Let's try a few more options.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.390
If we change this to pizza, we get pizza,

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.580
and if we change this to be something different,

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.745
let's say chicken, refresh.

00:01:53.745 --> 00:01:55.170
We have a fallback saying,

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.640
"let's get some food."

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.240
Also just to be clear,

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.280
we have this else if block,

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.470
nested inside these if statements.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.905
But it worked perfectly fine to if not nested.

00:02:05.905 --> 00:02:08.065
Before we finish off this video,

00:02:08.065 --> 00:02:12.675
I want to show you a few logical operators which you'll find useful.

00:02:12.675 --> 00:02:15.820
Logical operators may sound complex,

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.125
but they are simply and or not.

00:02:20.125 --> 00:02:23.200
So let's comment out this example and take a look at

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.730
these common sign all the code from before,

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.830
leaving in the two variables.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.120
So let's say if hungry,

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:45.190
then and with the two ampersands, craving is pizza.

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:51.280
Then we can add our alert from before saying, "give me pizza."

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.565
So now we'll check in if two statements are true.

00:02:55.565 --> 00:03:00.920
So we're checking if hungry is true and also if craving is equal to pizza.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.490
Let's change this to pizza and see what happens.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.105
Refresh. There is our alert.

00:03:08.105 --> 00:03:13.050
If we close this down and change either one of these to be false,

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.410
we don't see the alert pop up.

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.195
Let's try the other way around.

00:03:18.195 --> 00:03:20.740
Let's change this to be chicken.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.170
Again, both of these conditions need to be true for this code to run.

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.770
If we only want one of these conditions to be true, so for example,

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.815
if we're hungry or craving is on food,

00:03:32.815 --> 00:03:34.565
then we can run this code.

00:03:34.565 --> 00:03:38.110
So rather than both of these conditions needing to be true,

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.415
we can run this code if only one evaluates the few.

00:03:42.415 --> 00:03:45.070
We can do this with the or operator,

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.125
which is the two pipes, just like that.

00:03:48.125 --> 00:03:54.070
Now we only have one of these conditions evaluated to true, which is hungry.

00:03:54.070 --> 00:04:00.320
So save, refresh, and now the alert works.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.300
So if you look at and all,

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.395
the last one I want to show you is the not operator.

00:04:06.395 --> 00:04:10.265
This is the exclamation mark which we looked at earlier.

00:04:10.265 --> 00:04:14.435
We looked at this using the if statement to check if something is not equal.

00:04:14.435 --> 00:04:17.915
So let's take this all section off, there and here,

00:04:17.915 --> 00:04:22.315
even hungry, then we can add an exclamation mark inside here.

00:04:22.315 --> 00:04:25.940
So if not hungry or if this means false,

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.860
then we'll get the alert.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.609
So first of all, let's save and then refresh.

00:04:31.609 --> 00:04:33.610
We don't see anything.

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.690
However, if we change this to be false and then run the code,

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.400
we now see the alert.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.725
So this basically does the opposite,

00:04:42.725 --> 00:04:45.080
so here we're saying if not hungry,

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.845
which is false, then run this code inside of here.

00:04:48.845 --> 00:04:55.080
So this is it now for if else and also else if along with logical operators.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.249
I hope that makes sense and not too overwhelming.

00:04:58.249 --> 00:05:01.130
Remember, a lot of this just takes practice,

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.460
and we'll get a lot more as you progress through this course.
