00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.545
Welcome to full stack web development for beginners.

00:00:04.545 --> 00:00:09.000
This course is designed to take you from a beginner to a web developer,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.024
capable of not only building front end user interfaces of a website,

00:00:14.024 --> 00:00:18.510
but also design and build the back end to interact with too.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.050
So who am I?

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.000
My name is Chris and I will be your instructor for this course.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.550
I'm a web developer and also the producer of lots of tutorials teaching

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.205
thousands of students the skills they need to build websites and applications.

00:00:35.205 --> 00:00:38.760
This course is the third part in the full series,

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.965
where we will continue to build on everything from the first two parts of this course.

00:00:43.965 --> 00:00:46.485
This course is all about JavaScript,

00:00:46.485 --> 00:00:50.875
APIs, and working with external data sources.

00:00:50.875 --> 00:00:55.805
We begin by looking at JavaScript basics and flow control.

00:00:55.805 --> 00:01:01.310
This will give you an introduction to the basics of the JavaScript programming language,

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.845
including rounding things off with a Dragon Slayer project.

00:01:05.845 --> 00:01:11.195
Then we continue our JavaScript journey by looking at DOM manipulation,

00:01:11.195 --> 00:01:14.720
functions and events, and then finishing off

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.135
the section with another mini project to give you some more practice.

00:01:20.135 --> 00:01:22.445
We then move on to loops,

00:01:22.445 --> 00:01:26.650
arrays, objects, and regular expressions.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.325
Don't worry if you are unsure of what all this means is yet.

00:01:31.325 --> 00:01:33.305
We will cover everything you need to know,

00:01:33.305 --> 00:01:36.245
and then build a fun shape matching game.

00:01:36.245 --> 00:01:38.480
See how it all fits together.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.935
We finish of this course by building a song find application.

00:01:42.935 --> 00:01:46.605
This is where things really began to get interesting as we cover

00:01:46.605 --> 00:01:50.525
APIs and fetching data from external sources.

00:01:50.525 --> 00:01:52.970
Here will connect to the iTunes library.

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.255
We search for some data which we can go ahead and use in our projects.

00:01:58.255 --> 00:02:05.720
We also even look at some next generation JavaScript features from ES6 and beyond.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.230
All while explaining things in a straightforward,

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:11.015
simple to understand way,

00:02:11.015 --> 00:02:13.625
which even beginners will understand.

00:02:13.625 --> 00:02:19.495
Along with reinforcing things with some fun yet challenging projects along the way.

00:02:19.495 --> 00:02:22.985
Hope you're all excited to learn about JavaScript and

00:02:22.985 --> 00:02:27.000
APIs in the third part of this course.
