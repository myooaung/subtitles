00:00.280 --> 00:05.670
This lecture we're going to create the book pages that go between our book covers.

00:05.670 --> 00:07.550
So let's go ahead and get started.

00:07.560 --> 00:12.320
The first thing we want to do is we want to go ahead and add a new layer above all of our other layers.

00:12.510 --> 00:18.750
Then using my rectangular marquee tool on the select a rectangle out just like this then I'm going to

00:18.750 --> 00:20.140
go ahead and select the color.

00:20.160 --> 00:24.780
So I'm going to grab this color but make it a little bit lighter so it's sort of a yellowish maybe actually

00:24.780 --> 00:26.480
come down to the ellos.

00:26.610 --> 00:28.600
So there's my color number right there.

00:28.710 --> 00:29.320
OK.

00:29.400 --> 00:31.960
And then I'm going go ahead and fill the shape in.

00:31.990 --> 00:37.010
Next I'm gonna go ahead and grab a darker version of this color and come up into my greens.

00:37.020 --> 00:39.950
So it's a little bit more of a color from the shadows.

00:40.050 --> 00:42.440
Hit OK then using my brush tool.

00:42.450 --> 00:46.500
I'm going to go ahead and making sure that I still have my rectangular selected.

00:46.530 --> 00:48.600
So I can't paint outside of it.

00:48.600 --> 00:53.460
I'm going to paint some lines through here that are going to be my book pages.

00:53.460 --> 00:54.630
So I'm a click up here.

00:54.750 --> 00:58.240
Hold down shift and then I can paint a straight line all the way through.

00:58.560 --> 01:03.160
So again you want to click and you can print a line all the way through.

01:03.480 --> 01:07.170
Now if you don't click again what will happen is if you come back up to here and then you hold down

01:07.170 --> 01:08.070
shift and pain again.

01:08.070 --> 01:10.640
It's going to paint that line all the way across there.

01:10.980 --> 01:13.820
So you want to make sure that you click once before you do that.

01:13.860 --> 01:17.900
Or another way of getting around this is if you paint down here well then you don't have to cook again

01:17.910 --> 01:23.050
you can just click here and then paint across here because it will connect these two lines together

01:23.430 --> 01:26.100
except you can't see it because it's often to your document.

01:26.310 --> 01:31.520
So as long as you're zigzagging back and forth from top to bottom you should be fine.

01:43.180 --> 01:45.690
Now these don't have to be perfectly spaced out.

01:45.730 --> 01:48.840
It's actually better if they're not perfectly spaced out.

01:48.840 --> 01:54.010
Next let's go ahead and grab an even darker color and we're going to come down into oranges and make

01:54.010 --> 01:55.690
this a little bit more saturated.

01:55.830 --> 01:56.640
OK.

01:56.800 --> 02:01.240
Using my brush tool and I'm going to wring my bra size up just a little bit and I'm going to paint at

02:01.240 --> 02:02.680
30 percent opacity.

02:02.680 --> 02:06.510
I'm going to go ahead and paint along the edges of some of these lines in here.

02:06.690 --> 02:08.970
I want to bring that bar size up just a little bit more.

02:09.070 --> 02:15.770
So I want to paint along the edge just like that and this is just going to be creating a little bit

02:15.800 --> 02:21.340
of a cast shadow from some of these groups of pages because in between each one of these lines there's

02:21.380 --> 02:22.980
more than just one page.

02:23.030 --> 02:26.810
It's just that these are kind of the groups of all the pages if you've ever looked at a book you'll

02:26.810 --> 02:32.460
notice that there are sort of groups together and then stapled together and then sewn into the spine.

02:32.690 --> 02:36.710
So that's basically what each one of these are and we want to create a little bit more of a realistic

02:36.710 --> 02:38.910
look by adding some Shatto in there.

02:54.670 --> 02:58.960
Next let's go ahead and select our original book page color.

02:59.020 --> 03:03.820
And then we're going to grab an even lighter version of that so maybe about there come a little bit

03:03.820 --> 03:05.490
more towards our yellow's.

03:05.530 --> 03:09.040
So it's a little bit more saturated and we actually might make it a little bit lighter.

03:09.190 --> 03:12.300
So but there should be good but I'll go ahead and paint.

03:12.340 --> 03:17.170
And I'm still painting at 30 percent of Pasotti I'm going to go ahead and paint some lines across here

03:17.170 --> 03:18.410
for highlights.

03:37.680 --> 03:43.420
You can also go in there and hand paint in a few little lines on top of your and start layering in on

03:43.420 --> 03:44.260
that opacity.

03:44.260 --> 03:49.630
That way we just get a little bit more texture in these book covers maybe the edges of these books are

03:49.630 --> 03:51.360
tattered or they're ripped.

03:51.400 --> 03:54.420
And so we might be getting a little bit more texture in there.

04:04.220 --> 04:04.640
All right.

04:04.640 --> 04:05.220
Perfect.

04:05.240 --> 04:10.670
So now we have all of our book pages what we want to do now is we want to go ahead and use the Transform

04:10.670 --> 04:16.070
Tool on this layer and we're going to go ahead and first shrink it down a little bit maybe two about

04:16.070 --> 04:19.340
there will probably get shrunk down more but for now that should be good.

04:19.490 --> 04:21.440
We're going to go ahead and rotate this.

04:21.710 --> 04:26.330
And we want to rotate it to a 90 degree angle and you can do that by holding down the shift and rotating

04:26.330 --> 04:30.340
until it looks about straight and it'll click right into place.

04:30.560 --> 04:33.290
Then we want to go ahead and drag this down to about here.

04:33.350 --> 04:35.700
We're going to go and shrink that down a tiny bit more.

04:35.900 --> 04:39.320
So it's about the size of our book now going to go ahead and hit enter.

04:39.440 --> 04:43.910
So now we have about the size and the placement of where we want this are going to go out and drag this

04:43.940 --> 04:45.430
underneath this layer.

04:45.440 --> 04:47.830
So now I can actually place it in there.

04:48.110 --> 04:50.400
So then turn Transform Tool back on.

04:50.420 --> 04:52.500
Right clicking and coming to distort.

04:52.700 --> 04:57.230
We're going to go ahead and move these corners to the correct position until we get this looking the

04:57.230 --> 04:58.440
way we want it.

04:58.460 --> 05:01.250
So I'm going to move that to up there.

05:01.280 --> 05:06.100
Move this out to here and move this one out here.

05:07.250 --> 05:09.050
I think something like that should look good.

05:09.060 --> 05:11.230
We'll go ahead and enter.

05:11.240 --> 05:11.660
Great.

05:11.660 --> 05:13.840
So now we have those book pages in there.

05:14.000 --> 05:20.090
I can also go ahead and use my lasso tool to cut off a little bit of this edge over here because the

05:20.090 --> 05:22.240
line isn't necessarily straight.

05:22.250 --> 05:25.550
It's a little bit wider over here than it is over here.

05:25.550 --> 05:27.770
So go and hit delete.

05:28.100 --> 05:30.670
I think that works much better now.

05:30.680 --> 05:36.080
Also what we want to do is we want to go ahead and add in a little bit more of a textured edge on the

05:36.080 --> 05:37.550
edge of our book pages.

05:37.550 --> 05:38.660
So it looks more realistic.

05:38.660 --> 05:44.930
So using my research we're going to go ahead and just start erasing out some lines like this and that

05:44.930 --> 05:53.790
just starts to add in a little bit more of some shape on the edge of those pages.

05:54.140 --> 06:00.920
And in fact what you can do is you can even curve this in a little bit because you'll see a lot of the

06:00.920 --> 06:06.310
times if you look at reference books actually curve and on the pages.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.420
I think it has something to do with the binding.

06:08.420 --> 06:14.600
I'm not sure but I think it makes our book look more interesting and we can go ahead and read our race

06:14.670 --> 06:21.770
and all of those little sheafs so that each page looks like an individual page.

06:28.110 --> 06:28.420
All right.

06:28.440 --> 06:29.060
Great.

06:29.120 --> 06:31.710
So then zoom out and see how that looks awesome.

06:31.710 --> 06:34.050
I think that looks pretty darn good.

06:34.050 --> 06:38.670
Now lastly what I want to do is I want to go ahead and add a shadow on these pages being cast from the

06:38.670 --> 06:40.070
top cover.

06:40.140 --> 06:43.580
The way I'm going to do this is I'm going to switch up to my top cover layer.

06:43.710 --> 06:46.910
I'm also noticing that this got messed up a little bit when we erased it.

06:46.950 --> 06:51.990
So what I'm gonna do is just select this color here and I'm just going to brush in a little bit more

06:51.990 --> 06:54.520
of a shape in there to help that out.

06:54.930 --> 06:57.200
And then I'm going to come back to creating my shadow.

06:57.390 --> 07:00.950
So the way we're going to create a shadow is by a whole known control or command.

07:00.960 --> 07:07.560
If you're on a Mac select the shape of your top book cover by clicking the thumbnail then I'm going

07:07.560 --> 07:13.890
to go ahead and add a new layer underneath my book cover layer above my pages player then using the

07:13.890 --> 07:14.670
color black.

07:14.670 --> 07:19.800
I'm going to go and fill that in and sensus underneath our book cover you can't see it yet but once

07:19.800 --> 07:24.660
I use my grab a move tool and use the arrow keys on a keyboard to nudge this down I'm going another

07:24.660 --> 07:25.690
down to about there.

07:25.710 --> 07:30.990
Now you can see our shadow next to what we need to do is we need to go ahead and cut off these edges

07:31.260 --> 07:33.680
that aren't above our book pages.

07:33.810 --> 07:38.970
So I'm going to go ahead and select my book page shape and then I'm going to go ahead and hit Control

07:38.970 --> 07:39.320
shift.

07:39.360 --> 07:45.510
I invert the selection and then hit delete to delete away all of those edges that we don't want.

07:45.530 --> 07:48.760
So now we have a nice shadow in there on our book pages.

07:49.020 --> 07:53.100
And lastly what I want to do is I'm going to bring down the opacity and I'm going to bring it down to

07:53.100 --> 07:59.800
about 95 percent then using my erase tool and I'm going to switch over to a soft edged brush to do this.

07:59.820 --> 08:03.750
I'm going to go ahead and erase away these edges at 20 percent opacity.

08:03.750 --> 08:08.040
So I'm just going to erase right along the bottom edge just to soften that a little bit so it's not

08:08.040 --> 08:09.870
such a hard edge.

08:09.900 --> 08:10.560
Perfect.

08:10.590 --> 08:14.100
Now let's go ahead and zoom out and see how that looks.

08:14.100 --> 08:16.570
I think it looks pretty dang good.

08:16.590 --> 08:18.720
That brings us to the end of this lecture.

08:18.780 --> 08:24.000
So in this lecture we went ahead and we created the pages for our book as well as a cast shadow from

08:24.000 --> 08:29.350
the top surface of our book in the next lecture we're going to go ahead and create some ornate iron

08:29.370 --> 08:34.290
work for our book as well as a gem that's going to go on the top surface.

08:34.350 --> 08:38.630
I really hope you enjoy this lecture and I'm looking forward to seeing you in the next one.
