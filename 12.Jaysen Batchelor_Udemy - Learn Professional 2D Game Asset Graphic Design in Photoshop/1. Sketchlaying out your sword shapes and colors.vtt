00:00.800 --> 00:05.590
All right in this section of the course we're going to build a really cool sort of asset.

00:05.640 --> 00:07.490
So let's go ahead and get started.

00:07.770 --> 00:15.810
So I have a document and the size of it is 10 80 by 1920 and the resolution is set to 150.

00:15.810 --> 00:21.420
Now I want to go ahead and add a new layer above this and use this layer to do my sketch on.

00:21.450 --> 00:28.020
So switching over to my paintbrush tool I'm going to go ahead and just start sketch now what I want

00:28.020 --> 00:29.190
my sword to look like.

00:29.190 --> 00:33.200
So I'm going to start out with the bud of my sword.

00:33.240 --> 00:39.640
So I think I'm going to have it rectangular like so and then I might add a little bit more detail like

00:39.640 --> 00:42.120
a bottom piece and a top piece

00:44.890 --> 00:46.360
something like that.

00:46.720 --> 00:53.340
And this might be a little bit too small something to bring up the size just a little bit and then ominous

00:54.150 --> 00:55.200
paint in the handle

01:01.400 --> 01:06.620
and I'll paint it in the guard.

01:08.590 --> 01:16.140
I think go have a curve up like this.

01:16.250 --> 01:17.820
I remember this doesn't have to be perfect.

01:17.820 --> 01:23.220
This is going to be your guide for creating the actual shapes that make up your swords so don't worry

01:23.230 --> 01:28.030
if this isn't perfect you just want to get those basic shapes out.

01:28.410 --> 01:29.840
Then we'll add the blade in.

01:29.970 --> 01:32.710
I think I just want the blade to be a straight blade

01:40.030 --> 01:42.510
something like so for it cool.

01:42.520 --> 01:43.540
So now we have our sketch.

01:43.540 --> 01:46.670
Let's go ahead and move that to the center of our page.

01:46.690 --> 01:50.200
I'm also going to add a little bit of detail in there just so I know what we're going to be doing.

01:50.200 --> 01:56.260
So I think I have a line going straight up like so to divide the two planes on this sword blade and

01:56.260 --> 02:00.840
then over here we're also going to have this wrapped in leather straps.

02:01.270 --> 02:03.630
So great.

02:03.640 --> 02:06.930
Now let's go ahead and start building the sheeps for the sword.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.540
Someone at a new layer.

02:08.860 --> 02:14.200
And on this new layer I'm going to start with this part of the handle because that's going to be behind

02:14.320 --> 02:15.640
everything else.

02:15.700 --> 02:22.060
So I'm going to use my marquee tool and I'm going to make a rectangular selection like so then I'm going

02:22.060 --> 02:29.620
to go ahead and fill that in and I'm going to fill it in with almost like a reddish Violet and I'm going

02:29.620 --> 02:36.580
to grab my collar from somewhere about here a little bit darker some down there should be good not go

02:36.580 --> 02:38.080
ahead and fill that in.

02:38.080 --> 02:44.350
Next I'm going to use my Transform Tool to first pull this down so it's level and then I'm going to

02:44.350 --> 02:47.060
turn on my warp transform.

02:47.200 --> 02:48.270
So I'll turn that on.

02:48.310 --> 02:54.740
And now I'll drag that to that corner and I'm just going to get this into its correct shape.

03:08.710 --> 03:11.440
Then we can go ahead and hit enter next.

03:11.450 --> 03:14.100
Let's work on the blood of our sort.

03:14.290 --> 03:16.900
So I want to add a new layer above this.

03:16.900 --> 03:19.370
And first I'm going to create this shape right here.

03:19.390 --> 03:24.820
So just using my rectangular tool I'll go ahead and create that and then I'm going to fill that in with

03:24.820 --> 03:26.040
a dark gray.

03:26.050 --> 03:30.430
Someone come to summer about here and I'm going to come more towards my blues.

03:30.430 --> 03:34.110
So somewhere in there that I had OK and fill that in.

03:34.150 --> 03:35.890
Now add a little bit more shape to it.

03:35.920 --> 03:40.320
So use my Transform Tool going to go ahead and work that.

03:40.450 --> 03:43.780
I just want to bring the bottom area and just the tiniest bit.

03:43.780 --> 03:48.260
Same with this bottom area and same on the top.

03:48.310 --> 03:53.500
This is just to give it a little bit more of an interesting shape than just a rectangle that we can

03:53.500 --> 03:55.140
go ahead and hit enter.

03:55.180 --> 03:57.070
Now these two are not lined up very well.

03:57.070 --> 04:03.390
So what I'll do is I'll grab this and I'll move it over until it's clicks into the center like so.

04:03.460 --> 04:07.520
Next I'm going to add this piece that goes on top so I add a new layer above this.

04:07.560 --> 04:11.200
These are my rectangular marquee tool or make a selection like so.

04:11.590 --> 04:14.390
And then I'll fill that in with my gray.

04:14.890 --> 04:18.580
And then I'll use my grab move tool to get that into the center.

04:18.580 --> 04:21.300
Now let's go ahead and move up to the guard.

04:21.400 --> 04:27.110
So add a new layer and I'm going to first add this piece of the guard.

04:27.630 --> 04:31.440
So fill that in with gray and then make sure that that's centered.

04:31.690 --> 04:34.180
So I'm pretty sure I'm good right there.

04:34.390 --> 04:41.050
Then using my lasso tool I'm going to go ahead and click and basically trace out the shape that I've

04:41.050 --> 04:42.400
drawn here.

04:51.050 --> 04:59.120
And then I can go ahead and come down and reconnect that like so then I'm going to add a new layer.

04:59.120 --> 05:03.750
So this is on its own separate layer and I'll fill that in with the dark gray.

05:03.950 --> 05:08.810
Next I'm going to make a copy of this but rather than copying belayer what I'm going to do is I'm going

05:08.810 --> 05:14.210
to copy that image on the same layer so the switch over to my Graben move tool then holding down alt

05:14.270 --> 05:16.000
on my keyboard for option.

05:16.010 --> 05:21.200
If you're on a Mac I'm going to go ahead and click and drag that and that allows me to make a copy of

05:21.200 --> 05:23.450
that on the same layer.

05:23.550 --> 05:32.090
Next I'm going to go ahead and select that and turn on my Transform Tool and then flip that horizontal

05:32.950 --> 05:33.970
enter.

05:34.100 --> 05:38.780
And now I can go ahead and drag that over and move it into place just like so.

05:39.230 --> 05:42.870
Let's go ahead and turn off our background sketch to see how this looks so far.

05:42.950 --> 05:43.610
Great.

05:43.610 --> 05:45.620
Everything is looking pretty symmetrical.

05:45.680 --> 05:48.200
Now we can go ahead and move on to the blade.

05:48.200 --> 05:52.660
So I'm going to add one new layer and I'm going underneath this handle right here.

05:52.670 --> 05:57.890
It's going to be the very bottom layer and the handle is actually going to be very easy to create.

05:57.890 --> 06:03.670
All we have to do is use our Lasso tool and we're going to come straight up by holding down shift.

06:03.800 --> 06:08.760
And once we get up here to this point all we're going to do is we're just going to trace that out.

06:08.950 --> 06:14.800
So tool remember to use really small winds to get that curve in there.

06:15.500 --> 06:21.990
And then we're just going to come straight down like so and then we're going to fill that in with a

06:21.990 --> 06:22.500
blue.

06:22.590 --> 06:28.410
So I'm going to come into my blues probably want summer about here and I'm in that range in my blues

06:28.840 --> 06:29.670
head OK.

06:29.940 --> 06:31.720
And then I'm going to fill that in.

06:32.220 --> 06:38.430
Then I'm going to go ahead and grab that with my old key or Option key and drag the copy over.

06:38.430 --> 06:47.490
Then I'm going to select it transform it and flip it horizontal then I can go ahead and move that into

06:47.490 --> 06:50.610
place and get it all lined up.

06:50.670 --> 06:51.220
Great.

06:51.360 --> 06:57.450
Now let's go ahead and turn off our background sketch and make sure that blade is lined up so it's not.

06:57.630 --> 07:01.930
So what we need to do is first we need to merge these two layers.

07:02.190 --> 07:06.990
So now that blade is one layer and then we need to drag this over until it lines up correctly.

07:06.990 --> 07:08.820
So right there is perfect.

07:08.820 --> 07:09.370
All right.

07:09.450 --> 07:11.510
That brings us to the end of this lecture.

07:11.580 --> 07:16.350
So in this lecture you learn how to draw your sword and then you learn how to lay out the colors and

07:16.380 --> 07:17.900
the shape for it.

07:17.910 --> 07:21.990
Remember that you want to make everything on separate layers because when we go in there we're going

07:21.990 --> 07:27.570
to be painting on clipping layer masks and so we want to be able to paint individually on each part

07:27.570 --> 07:29.220
with a sword.

07:29.220 --> 07:32.460
Thanks for watching this lecture and I look forward to seeing you in the next one.
