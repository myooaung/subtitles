00:00.750 --> 00:05.580
All right now let's get to the fun part of this project which is painting the blade.

00:05.610 --> 00:10.910
So before we do that let's select all of our layers that make up the guard of our sort.

00:12.180 --> 00:14.400
And let's put those into a folder.

00:14.570 --> 00:19.980
And now it's come down to our swerd layer and we'll add a new layer above that and create a clipping

00:19.980 --> 00:21.030
mask out of it.

00:21.960 --> 00:23.410
Now we can begin painting.

00:23.450 --> 00:28.160
So the first thing we want to do is we want to select this blue color here and then we want to find

00:28.190 --> 00:32.150
a little bit more of a saturated version of that and a little tiny bit darker.

00:32.360 --> 00:34.340
So there should be good.

00:34.340 --> 00:37.660
And then we're going to OK then we're going to go ahead and start brushing that in.

00:37.660 --> 00:43.250
At 20 percent opacity or going to brush down to the bottom and slowly get less and less we'll just continue

00:43.250 --> 00:44.600
to do that over and over again.

00:45.230 --> 00:46.630
But we get it looking the way we want.

00:55.530 --> 01:01.700
Next I'm going to go ahead and re select my base color and I'm going to make it a little bit more saturated.

01:01.740 --> 01:05.260
And this are going to make a little bit more lighter so about there should be good.

01:05.520 --> 01:08.800
I'm going to go ahead and paint some of that in.

01:08.830 --> 01:10.660
So right here in the middle of my sword

01:18.600 --> 01:24.120
great now you can hardly see any difference but there is difference there there's more texture and there's

01:24.330 --> 01:25.370
more blues in there.

01:25.380 --> 01:30.330
So it makes a lot more interesting to the eye and your subconscious picks it up.

01:30.360 --> 01:33.610
Next we're going to go ahead and start painting with more of an aqua color.

01:33.630 --> 01:36.670
Someone come into my AACo blues somewhere around there should be good.

01:37.020 --> 01:38.730
And I'm going to make this really light.

01:38.740 --> 01:42.260
So somewhere in there and then we can go ahead and start painting.

01:42.390 --> 01:49.590
So I'm going to paint this top area like so and I'm not actually going to bring my brush capacity down

01:49.590 --> 01:55.280
to 10 percent because I want it to be even lighter and I can go ahead and start painting this in

02:07.760 --> 02:12.110
and then I'm going to grab a little bit even more of an aqua someone to come down into my Aquas make

02:12.110 --> 02:13.830
this a little bit more saturated.

02:14.180 --> 02:18.020
I'm going to paint just a little bit more aqua and they're just make this look more interesting

02:22.980 --> 02:24.370
perfect next.

02:24.420 --> 02:31.780
Let's go ahead and grab some solid white and we're going to paint down this edge of our sword just like

02:31.780 --> 02:38.300
so now if you're having a hard time painting that straight line you can go ahead and click and then

02:38.300 --> 02:42.350
hold down shift and then come down to here and then you're just going to need to blend this area in

02:42.350 --> 02:44.330
a little bit more at the bottom.

02:44.330 --> 02:48.290
But we're just going to go ahead and paint in this half of our sort.

02:48.290 --> 02:48.910
White.

02:48.980 --> 02:52.940
And so starting at the top area it's going to be a solid solid white.

02:53.030 --> 02:56.890
And as it gets lower on the sword it's going to start blending in with the blue.

02:57.440 --> 02:59.890
So I can bring my brush capacity back up to 20 percent.

02:59.890 --> 03:06.320
Now I can start blending this in actually I'm going to bring it back down to 10 percent so I can blend

03:06.320 --> 03:08.030
it better down here.

03:12.360 --> 03:15.430
And then the further up we go we can keep turning up the brush capacities.

03:15.420 --> 03:27.500
Now you have at 40 percent and I'm just going to start filling stuff at.

03:27.670 --> 03:30.990
Now we can go ahead and slip this mid color start painting with that.

03:31.030 --> 03:37.300
And I'm also painting with this color 40 percent opacity and that helps blend it in and select the next

03:37.300 --> 03:38.670
one and the next color.

03:41.630 --> 03:49.280
And then select this color here and blend that and great Next I'm going to go ahead and grab this more

03:49.460 --> 03:50.670
aqua of blue.

03:50.750 --> 03:54.890
I'm going to go ahead and start painting that down here and I might even just lighten that just the

03:54.890 --> 03:56.950
tiniest bit will come up to about there.

03:57.380 --> 04:00.570
And I'll start painting with that down here.

04:00.740 --> 04:05.530
I'm going to put my brush rapacity back to 10 percent and then we want to start blending that in so

04:05.540 --> 04:07.280
that we can select our base color.

04:07.680 --> 04:12.830
They're blending that in down here blending the all the way up into the white

04:15.890 --> 04:20.410
and then we might grab our white again and start blending that white into that blue

04:24.460 --> 04:30.250
must continue to do this all the way down till we get it blended correctly I think that's pretty good.

04:30.250 --> 04:32.040
MCGRATH This way up here.

04:32.040 --> 04:35.040
Go ahead and paint this edgin a little bit better.

04:35.250 --> 04:37.710
And then I got a little bit of white over this edge.

04:37.710 --> 04:40.390
We don't want that so many gladdens like my blue.

04:40.390 --> 04:45.880
Go ahead and paint over that few times like so great.

04:45.880 --> 04:49.930
All right so now we have the base for our sored reflection.

04:50.080 --> 04:52.500
Next I'm going to add a little bit more highlight onto this side.

04:52.540 --> 04:55.030
So when I select my right aqua color.

04:55.030 --> 05:01.150
I'm just going to paint some of that in so I'm painting it almost right into the middle and I'm kind

05:01.150 --> 05:03.510
of leaving out these edges so they're a little bit darker.

05:05.690 --> 05:07.630
And then we can grab this Durka blue color.

05:07.660 --> 05:09.920
You paint a little bit on top of that.

05:10.070 --> 05:12.640
Just to give it a little bit more texture.

05:17.390 --> 05:18.090
Cool.

05:18.350 --> 05:23.420
Next to what we want to do is we're going to grab our weight again and then bring our brush opacity

05:23.510 --> 05:27.050
up to 50 percent going to bring our size down.

05:27.050 --> 05:31.250
Now I'm going to go ahead and paint this metal line.

05:31.250 --> 05:35.300
It's like so much going to bring my brush opacity down to 30 percent

05:38.550 --> 05:41.190
I'm going to paint the all the way down just like so.

05:41.520 --> 05:48.130
And then right here I'm going add sort of a little divot in our sword blade.

05:48.220 --> 05:52.640
So paint it like so and then we're going to come back in here and add a little bit of shadow and there

05:56.540 --> 05:59.990
continue continue coming all the way down to the bottom.

06:01.590 --> 06:06.610
Now my line got a little bit off it's not centered right now but that's OK.

06:06.810 --> 06:10.140
You can work a little bit harder to make sure your line stay centered.

06:10.140 --> 06:12.160
But for now I'm just going to leave it like that.

06:15.760 --> 06:22.280
And we just want to paint it all the way down the middle and we don't want it to just be one hard line.

06:22.400 --> 06:26.570
You wanted to have a little bit of a wispy brush look and we want it to blend a little bit into our

06:26.570 --> 06:27.260
blues.

06:27.380 --> 06:33.370
So it's not just a hard hard line paint in this highlight here.

06:33.470 --> 06:39.020
And then we're going to paint in the edges of our sword so we can go and zoom out so you can see better.

06:39.030 --> 06:45.620
I'm going to paint in this edge of our sort with white all the way up till we get to about there and

06:45.620 --> 06:53.810
then we'll just continue to do this back and forth layering it until we get it to a solid white.

06:54.170 --> 06:58.260
And you can also add a few lines coming in like so just to make it look more interesting.

06:58.340 --> 06:59.910
Little scratches and stuff.

07:15.350 --> 07:16.230
Let's do the same thing.

07:16.230 --> 07:19.700
On the other side we'll just begin to paint that in.

07:19.900 --> 07:23.130
And as it gets into this white area we don't have to follow it all the way up

07:47.940 --> 07:49.160
awesome next.

07:49.200 --> 07:55.700
Let's go ahead and add in a few more scratches onto our swards so I might add one down here.

07:55.960 --> 07:58.430
Might make that a little bit lighter.

07:58.650 --> 08:03.200
And then I might also add one right here going across this.

08:03.410 --> 08:09.380
And then I might add one or shear and again they don't have to be super prominent.

08:09.410 --> 08:11.060
They can be pretty light.

08:11.060 --> 08:13.780
Next we're going to go ahead and select our darkest blue color.

08:13.790 --> 08:18.350
Someone to grab this color right here and then I'm going to start painting in on these scratches and

08:18.350 --> 08:19.280
divots.

08:19.280 --> 08:24.380
So I'll zoom in there and I'm going to bring my brush opacity up to 50 percent and I can start painting

08:24.380 --> 08:24.710
that.

08:24.710 --> 08:28.700
And then we can paint one end or right here.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.560
So we're going to put it on the top side since the light is going to be coming from the top.

08:32.690 --> 08:38.610
So we want the highlight to be on the bottom of our scratches.

08:39.290 --> 08:40.410
The show this guy

08:44.120 --> 08:46.540
and we can paint the shadow up here on this guy.

08:46.540 --> 08:57.270
Also next we're going to grab an even darker color something to grab my blue Darkon that and then I'm

08:57.270 --> 09:02.200
going to go ahead and start painting in darker shadows.

09:04.100 --> 09:08.800
Just like so you can add a little bit in there also.

09:09.050 --> 09:14.060
We can add definitely some in here because the blue used is almost the same exact blue as what's already

09:14.060 --> 09:14.880
down here.

09:17.510 --> 09:23.690
And then we'll come up to here paint a little bit into their perfect.

09:23.930 --> 09:28.700
Next we're going to add a few little divots in the edges of our sword.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.420
So I'm going to add one right here and up here.

09:31.730 --> 09:34.310
So let's zoom in there and using our darker blue color.

09:34.310 --> 09:35.660
We'll go ahead and paint that in.

09:35.690 --> 09:41.180
So I'm just going to paint in a dark spot like so and you can bring your brush rapacity up to 100 percent

09:41.240 --> 09:41.940
to do this.

09:45.610 --> 09:50.290
So there's one and the other one is going to be up here and I'm going to make this a little bit more

09:50.290 --> 09:50.950
saturated.

09:50.950 --> 09:54.470
Just make a little bit more intense next to this White.

09:54.600 --> 09:56.740
We go ahead and paint one right there.

10:01.290 --> 10:04.820
Now it kind of has a curve to it and I don't want that someone like my white.

10:04.830 --> 10:07.230
Go ahead and kind of paint that curve out.

10:07.230 --> 10:09.210
Nick you had slept this blue again.

10:09.500 --> 10:16.630
Can you get back in there and get rid of some of that curved grape.

10:16.630 --> 10:17.770
I like something like that.

10:18.640 --> 10:19.600
Perfect.

10:19.600 --> 10:26.590
Now let's come back over to this divot and we're going to go ahead and paint in that bottom highlight

10:26.590 --> 10:27.270
right there.

10:30.340 --> 10:37.580
And we can also add a little bit of highlight on top so you might see how that looks awesome.

10:37.580 --> 10:38.050
All right.

10:38.090 --> 10:43.590
Now let's go ahead and change your background color to gray so we can have and see what this looks like

10:43.590 --> 10:46.730
with a neutral color awesome.

10:46.750 --> 10:47.320
Pretty good.

10:47.320 --> 10:53.070
So he had a really kind of transforms the way the sword looks because really when you're on a background

10:53.070 --> 10:57.220
in a game it's not really going to probably be white it's probably going to have colors and different

10:57.220 --> 10:58.150
values.

10:58.210 --> 11:04.060
And so by adding a neutral color like a middle gray that really shows you what your piece of artwork

11:04.090 --> 11:07.390
looks like on a neutral background.

11:07.390 --> 11:12.490
Now if you wanted to take it a step further let's say that this sword is given to your player while

11:12.490 --> 11:13.450
they're playing the game.

11:13.510 --> 11:18.510
So they stumble upon it a whole screen comes up and it fills the screen and says you get this sword.

11:18.520 --> 11:19.660
And it shows the sword.

11:19.930 --> 11:21.960
Maybe you want it to look more dramatic.

11:21.970 --> 11:28.150
And so what you can do is we can go ahead and select all these layers make a copy of them that we're

11:28.150 --> 11:33.340
going to merge those layers together and then we can take all these other layers and put them into a

11:33.340 --> 11:38.920
folder so we have those back up then we can go ahead and turn that folder off and coming back up to

11:38.950 --> 11:40.780
our flattened layer.

11:41.080 --> 11:44.430
We can go ahead and come to effects and do afterglow.

11:44.670 --> 11:47.230
And you can add a really cool outer glow to that.

11:47.230 --> 11:48.720
So let's select a color.

11:48.910 --> 11:50.290
This orange looks pretty nice.

11:50.320 --> 11:54.350
Might try a different version of it or we might even try Yellow.

11:54.370 --> 11:55.720
I think orange looks pretty good.

11:55.870 --> 11:56.910
OK.

11:57.190 --> 11:59.100
And then we can bring the opacity up.

11:59.120 --> 12:00.390
See how that looks.

12:00.740 --> 12:06.670
A little bit too much so maybe it out there and we can change the size.

12:06.670 --> 12:07.840
We can do whatever we want.

12:07.920 --> 12:10.160
And so that just makes it look a lot more interesting.

12:10.300 --> 12:11.860
And a lot more dramatic.

12:12.040 --> 12:14.840
Once you have that set the way you want you can go ahead and hit OK.

12:15.160 --> 12:18.280
And now you are Assa is complete.

12:18.280 --> 12:20.400
I hope you guys enjoyed making this sword.

12:20.560 --> 12:21.450
I did.

12:21.460 --> 12:25.830
Now your assignment is to create this sword and you can change it up however you want.

12:25.840 --> 12:30.020
You can change the colors and keep the same shape or you can completely change the shape.

12:30.310 --> 12:35.290
If you really feel confident in yourself you can go ahead and create a sword made out of completely

12:35.290 --> 12:39.820
different materials such as wood or GEMS whatever you want.

12:39.820 --> 12:44.260
Thanks for watching this lecture and I really look forward to seeing your art work in the Q&amp;A section

12:44.290 --> 12:45.630
of the course.
