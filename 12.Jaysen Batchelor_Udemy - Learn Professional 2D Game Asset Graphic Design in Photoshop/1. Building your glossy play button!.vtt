00:00.750 --> 00:05.790
Right welcome to the bonus section of the course in this section of the Course I'll be adding bonus

00:05.790 --> 00:07.950
sections as time goes on.

00:07.980 --> 00:11.710
For now we're just going to be creating an animated play button.

00:11.790 --> 00:14.120
So let's go ahead and get started.

00:14.130 --> 00:18.300
So the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to create the button and then I'm going to create the

00:18.300 --> 00:21.310
second frame with that button so it can be animated.

00:21.330 --> 00:26.330
Once we've done that we'll create a sprite for it so that way you can actually use it in your game.

00:26.550 --> 00:32.130
So first what we want to do is we want to come over here to our shape tool and we want to select the

00:32.130 --> 00:37.250
rounded rectangle tool and we're going to go ahead and make a shape just like so.

00:38.710 --> 00:46.840
Next let's go ahead and turn off the stroke and turn on the fill and we want to fill it with a gradient.

00:46.840 --> 00:49.000
Now we want to go from dark to light.

00:49.150 --> 00:51.460
So we're going to go ahead and switch these colors around.

00:51.490 --> 00:55.210
So we're going to change this to our main color which is going to be a purple.

00:55.210 --> 01:01.000
So when it comes over in here and then come into my purple or violets and then I'll go ahead and hit

01:01.030 --> 01:01.920
OK.

01:02.350 --> 01:08.390
Then we want to change our white color to a black grit.

01:08.420 --> 01:11.970
Now we want to change the roundness of our edges.

01:11.990 --> 01:17.000
So right now it's at 30 pixels and we want to change that to make it.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.300
So it's completely rounded like a pill.

01:19.310 --> 01:25.610
So I get to go ahead and type in 70 in there enter and it would only let us round it to 57 pixels which

01:25.610 --> 01:27.790
is fine but that's as far as it can be rounded.

01:27.950 --> 01:30.070
So now we have a perfect pill.

01:30.160 --> 01:32.860
Next let's go ahead and add an effect to this layer.

01:32.880 --> 01:39.540
So now come down to my effects and I'm going to add a bevelled an embossed edge.

01:39.540 --> 01:48.590
Now let's go ahead and turn down the depth to about there and then let's turn down the size to about

01:48.950 --> 01:50.710
10 pixel should be good.

01:51.140 --> 01:56.840
Then I'm just going to leave the opacity for my highlight 81 percent and the opacity for my shadow at

01:56.840 --> 01:59.190
70 percent and I'll go ahead and hit.

01:59.210 --> 02:00.660
OK.

02:00.760 --> 02:01.040
All right.

02:01.040 --> 02:03.660
So now we have the basic set up for our button.

02:03.680 --> 02:05.780
Now this is going to be a glossy button.

02:05.870 --> 02:08.290
So we want to add a highlight on here.

02:08.510 --> 02:11.330
So the way we're going to do that is by copying our shape.

02:11.510 --> 02:17.180
So Poppy the layer and then we're going to go ahead and turn off the effects by hitting that icon next

02:17.180 --> 02:18.340
to effects.

02:18.800 --> 02:21.710
And then we want to change the color of our shape.

02:22.010 --> 02:26.750
So I'm going to go ahead and come up here to where it says Phil and this will only show up if you have

02:26.760 --> 02:28.070
your shape tool selected.

02:28.070 --> 02:32.750
So if this isn't at your top bar go ahead and select your shape tool and then you'll be able to change

02:32.780 --> 02:33.550
your fill.

02:33.590 --> 02:38.880
So I'm going to select that and I'm going to fill it in with a solid color and where you want white.

02:38.900 --> 02:44.930
So I'm going to come into my color picker and select a white gripped next to what we want to do is we

02:44.930 --> 02:48.020
want to use our Transform Tool to shrink the shape down.

02:48.110 --> 02:54.080
So going to go control T and then going to go ahead and shrink down holding down shift to keep its portions

02:54.440 --> 02:57.110
and holding down to shrink it from the center.

02:57.110 --> 03:04.300
And I'm going to shrink it to about that size then I want to shrink it upwards like so so it gets squashed.

03:04.480 --> 03:05.630
So about there should be good.

03:05.690 --> 03:08.970
Maybe just the tiniest bit more too about there.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.840
Well hit enter next.

03:10.850 --> 03:16.160
Let's go ahead and use the grab and move tool and the arrows on our keyboard to nudge this up towards

03:16.160 --> 03:16.740
the top.

03:16.910 --> 03:19.630
But we still want to leave a little gap right there.

03:19.910 --> 03:23.340
And this is going to create the glossy effect for us now.

03:23.360 --> 03:27.830
Right now it looks glossy but the way we're going to make it look even more glossy is by bringing down

03:27.830 --> 03:28.630
the opacity.

03:28.640 --> 03:29.890
So it looks transparent.

03:29.990 --> 03:33.970
So we'll bring down that opacity on that layer to a bout.

03:34.400 --> 03:36.540
Let's bring it to about 13 percent.

03:36.650 --> 03:37.810
That looks good.

03:37.910 --> 03:38.630
Great.

03:38.630 --> 03:41.820
Now let's add some reflections to the corners of our button.

03:41.990 --> 03:47.630
So I'm going to go ahead and add a new layer above this layer and then I'm gonna zoom in there and using

03:47.630 --> 03:52.280
my brush tool and making sure I'm on a hard edged brush like this one right here.

03:52.330 --> 03:58.990
I'm going to go ahead and paint in Ixo and painted it one out there and I'll do the same on the other

03:58.990 --> 03:59.290
side.

03:59.290 --> 04:02.430
So paint a little line like so and then add a dot.

04:02.800 --> 04:06.090
You can also add a second dot on the other side that's smaller.

04:06.160 --> 04:12.070
So maybe a little bit too small so you can add one like that and that just makes it looks a little bit

04:12.070 --> 04:13.830
more interesting.

04:13.840 --> 04:14.190
Great.

04:14.230 --> 04:17.050
So now we have our button now.

04:17.080 --> 04:19.540
This reflection on top is looking a little bit too small.

04:19.540 --> 04:24.780
So going to come back down into that layer turn on my Transform Tool and holding down old.

04:24.820 --> 04:26.440
So it stretches from the center.

04:26.580 --> 04:31.570
I'm going to go ahead and pull it over like so and I'm also going to bring it up just a little bit more

04:32.030 --> 04:33.550
than I enter.

04:33.550 --> 04:33.880
All right.

04:33.880 --> 04:35.830
That looks better to me.

04:35.830 --> 04:39.960
Next we want to add our text in so that I'm going to come to my text.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.610
Which by the way is the letter T on your keyboard.

04:42.640 --> 04:47.530
If you want to know what the hockey is and then I'm going to go ahead and add a new layer above this

04:48.310 --> 04:54.020
and click to start my text and then I'm just going to type out play now.

04:54.030 --> 04:57.540
I already have my text set to the correct typeface.

04:57.900 --> 05:02.430
The font is called OCR a s t d.

05:02.530 --> 05:04.400
And you can go ahead and search that up here.

05:04.410 --> 05:06.600
It's included with Photoshop.

05:06.810 --> 05:12.360
Next sort of want to do is I want to add a bevelled and embossed effect to my text so I don't come down

05:12.360 --> 05:16.510
to effects but I need to switch out of my text tool to do this.

05:16.560 --> 05:22.800
And then I can come down to my effects and then we're going to come up to Bevil and emboss and rather

05:22.800 --> 05:28.650
than bevelling and embossing it from the inner like we had on our gem button we're going to go ahead

05:28.680 --> 05:36.780
and select Pellow and boss and what that does is it makes it look like it's actually embossed into the

05:36.780 --> 05:38.490
button itself.

05:38.490 --> 05:42.300
Next I'm going to go ahead and play with my settings so I can play with my depth.

05:42.630 --> 05:49.680
So I'm going to put that about at 200 percent and then I can also play with the size someone to bring

05:49.680 --> 05:50.560
that down.

05:52.440 --> 06:03.910
To about 13 pixels and then I'm going to play with the softness and I'm going to put that at about let's

06:03.910 --> 06:05.280
say nine pixels.

06:05.350 --> 06:10.120
I think that looks good and I'm going to go ahead and leave my settings down here the same way we've

06:10.120 --> 06:11.120
always had them.

06:11.150 --> 06:15.450
So 80 percent from a highlight and 70 percent for my shadow.

06:15.760 --> 06:16.590
Let's go ahead and hit.

06:16.620 --> 06:18.640
OK great.

06:18.790 --> 06:21.830
So now we have the first frame for our button.

06:22.060 --> 06:26.530
So this is what the button would look like if it's not being pressed now we need to create the next

06:26.530 --> 06:29.150
frame for when the button is being pressed.

06:29.410 --> 06:33.370
So I'm going to go ahead and select all my layers except for my background layer and I'm going to put

06:33.370 --> 06:34.650
those into a folder.

06:35.020 --> 06:38.360
I'm going to call this EF 1.

06:38.610 --> 06:41.700
Enter then I'm going to copy this folder.

06:41.790 --> 06:45.810
And on this new folder I'm gonna call it too because it's going to be framed too.

06:45.990 --> 06:48.660
And then we're going to go ahead and open that up.

06:48.750 --> 06:53.680
Now the first thing we want to add is we want to add our text someone to come to my text and I'm going

06:53.680 --> 07:00.000
to turn off my devil and boss effect because in this next frame it's just going to be completely glowing

07:00.060 --> 07:02.840
and it's going to be so bright that you won't even see the bevel.

07:02.850 --> 07:07.400
And in Boston is of the text so let's add a new effect.

07:07.740 --> 07:12.610
And we're going to add an outer glow then we're going to select our color.

07:12.630 --> 07:15.680
So I'm going to select our purple that we have down here.

07:15.930 --> 07:18.760
But I'm going to make it completely saturated like so.

07:18.860 --> 07:19.900
OK.

07:20.310 --> 07:26.400
And then we can go ahead and play with our setting so I have my opacity set to 100 percent and I'm going

07:26.400 --> 07:28.870
to bring the size down so we can see it better.

07:29.070 --> 07:30.810
So probably about there.

07:31.410 --> 07:36.290
And then we can upload the speed but I'm going to leave that out for pixels.

07:36.630 --> 07:39.890
I'm going to actually look at my color just a little bit so you can see it better.

07:39.900 --> 07:41.330
So about there should be good.

07:41.550 --> 07:42.880
OK.

07:43.010 --> 07:43.590
All right.

07:43.590 --> 07:44.740
I think this looks good.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.080
Let's go ahead and hit.

07:46.110 --> 07:47.370
OK.

07:47.580 --> 07:50.870
Next we want to add a glow to our entire button.

07:51.000 --> 07:57.570
So I'm going to come down here to my pillows shape and I'm going to select that shape and then I'm going

07:57.570 --> 08:03.160
to add a new layer above it then I'm going to select our original purple color.

08:03.330 --> 08:09.300
I'm going to go ahead and fill that in like so and then I'm going to come up to filter then come down

08:09.300 --> 08:10.240
to blur.

08:10.360 --> 08:15.260
We're going to use our guanine blur once again and then we can play with that.

08:15.300 --> 08:16.720
See where we like it.

08:16.840 --> 08:24.630
And I like it about at 24 25 pixels then we can go ahead and hit OK and then I'm going to bring down

08:24.630 --> 08:28.910
the opacity on that layer so we can still see some of the stuff behind it.

08:28.920 --> 08:32.690
But we so want it pretty bright so I'm going to bring it to about there.

08:33.180 --> 08:34.290
Perfect.

08:34.290 --> 08:34.560
All right.

08:34.590 --> 08:36.720
So now we have our second frame.

08:36.720 --> 08:42.480
Let's go ahead and close this folder up and we can see what this switch between the two frames will

08:42.480 --> 08:42.960
look like.

08:42.960 --> 08:47.220
By clicking this here this is what it would look like before it was pressed.

08:47.250 --> 08:49.880
And then when it got pressed it would turn to this.

08:50.310 --> 08:51.060
All right.

08:51.060 --> 08:53.640
That brings us to the end of this lecture.

08:53.670 --> 08:57.620
So in this lecture you learn how to make the two frames for your button.

08:57.810 --> 09:01.890
You also learn how to create this really cool glossy effect for your button and you learn how to make

09:01.890 --> 09:05.950
your lettering look like it's embossed into your actual button.

09:05.970 --> 09:11.000
Now in the next lecture we're going to go ahead and set up a frame animation to see how this plays.

09:11.100 --> 09:15.830
And then we're going to create a straight XI out of them so you can use them in your games.

09:16.110 --> 09:19.400
Thanks for watching and I look forward to seeing you in the next lecture.
