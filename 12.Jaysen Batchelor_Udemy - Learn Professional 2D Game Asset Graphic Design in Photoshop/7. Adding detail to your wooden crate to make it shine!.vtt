00:00.580 --> 00:03.950
All right let's go ahead and add in that detail.

00:04.180 --> 00:10.860
So first off I'm going to merge these two layers together so my clipping mask and my Karaite select

00:10.870 --> 00:12.320
both those and merge.

00:12.550 --> 00:14.240
So that's one layer.

00:14.260 --> 00:17.810
So now we're going to be able to mess around with this a blue shadow.

00:18.070 --> 00:22.230
Next I'm going to go ahead and select my dark blue shadow from this side.

00:22.720 --> 00:27.500
And what I'm going to do with this is I'm going to use that to create the nailheads on my crate.

00:27.520 --> 00:33.730
The reason why I'm using this blue color is because when you use the same colors in an asset it tends

00:33.730 --> 00:36.590
to pull it all together and make it look nicer.

00:36.880 --> 00:40.620
So I'm going to go ahead and add that in there.

00:40.960 --> 00:45.890
And they're there too far over.

00:46.360 --> 00:51.640
And the reason why it painted them like ellipses rather than circles is because we're looking at it

00:51.640 --> 00:52.720
from an angle.

00:52.930 --> 00:56.550
And so they're going to get squashed because of perspective.

00:56.650 --> 00:59.650
Next I'm going to go ahead and grab a little bit lighter version of this.

00:59.740 --> 01:03.640
So maybe up there I'll go ahead and paint.

01:03.650 --> 01:09.700
And on top of that like so they're on there and a little bit right there.

01:09.940 --> 01:11.790
Perfect next.

01:11.830 --> 01:16.090
Let's go ahead and wrestle at this dark shadow color on the blue side.

01:16.550 --> 01:22.310
Let's go ahead and paint in our nails on this side.

01:27.690 --> 01:30.930
And then we're going to go ahead and select a lighter version of that.

01:30.930 --> 01:33.650
So it's colors here.

01:33.930 --> 01:36.620
Go ahead and paint that in just like so.

01:36.860 --> 01:42.090
Now these may seem like tiny little details that nobody will notice but trust me this is what's going

01:42.090 --> 01:46.160
to differentiate your artwork and make it look better than everybody else's is.

01:46.200 --> 01:49.170
The tiny little details next.

01:49.190 --> 01:52.840
Let's go ahead and add in those cuts and scrapes.

01:52.850 --> 01:58.430
So what I'm going to do is to select my dark shadow colors here and then I'm gonna go ahead and shrink

01:58.430 --> 02:04.190
my brushes down as small as possible and I'm going to pick some places where I want these cuts and gashes

02:04.190 --> 02:06.760
to be so when I put one right here

02:09.500 --> 02:14.180
I just want them to be basically straight lines that kind of come to more of a point so they can start

02:14.180 --> 02:16.900
out fatter and then come to a point.

02:17.170 --> 02:25.610
I'm also going to add one or two here and this one is actually going to travel across to the other side

02:25.670 --> 02:33.200
like so perfect and then I might add one out here on the outside.

02:35.760 --> 02:38.230
And then look at some on the other side too.

02:38.310 --> 02:43.950
But we're going to select our dark blue color because that's the shadow color on our shadow side.

02:44.790 --> 02:54.810
So what they're looking at here you can also hold down shift and click in another spot to get that straight

02:54.810 --> 02:55.570
line.

02:58.620 --> 03:00.910
And maybe you will add one more up here.

03:05.290 --> 03:06.220
So right there.

03:06.220 --> 03:07.780
This will be a little bit faster.

03:07.940 --> 03:09.350
Perfect.

03:09.350 --> 03:12.460
Next what we want to do is we want to select or highlight color.

03:12.530 --> 03:17.480
So coming over here I'm going to select this color right there and we want to make sure that we select

03:17.480 --> 03:19.600
the highlight color that's nearest to it.

03:19.730 --> 03:24.920
That way it's going to look more natural and not stand out as much as if we were to take this brighter

03:24.920 --> 03:26.980
colors here and highlight to this.

03:27.260 --> 03:33.740
So make sure you use the highlight color nearest to the cut and they're going to highlight the bottom

03:33.740 --> 03:40.370
side of cut because that's the side that would be getting hit by the light just like so let's do the

03:40.370 --> 03:41.340
same for other one.

03:41.390 --> 03:50.290
So we'll select this highlight color here go and add that highlight an and whenever it goes across sort

03:50.290 --> 03:55.480
of one of these would grains you can kind of leave some of that highlight out as it would probably not

03:55.480 --> 04:00.370
be showing up because I would be going down into the crack of the wood grain.

04:00.970 --> 04:04.340
Let's go ahead and add this to the other parts.

04:04.430 --> 04:06.250
Add it to this underside.

04:06.250 --> 04:07.530
Same here.

04:09.940 --> 04:13.080
You saw how I kind of skipped that area.

04:13.120 --> 04:15.250
That goes down into the grain.

04:15.290 --> 04:16.240
Now let's do this.

04:16.350 --> 04:22.090
So we're just going to select our highlight color in there.

04:50.510 --> 04:51.010
Great.

04:51.110 --> 04:54.440
Lastly what we want to do is want to go ahead and blend this edgin.

04:54.440 --> 04:56.570
So it's not such a hard line.

04:56.750 --> 05:01.910
So what I'm going to do is I'm gonna go ahead and select this color and then use my brush tool and putting

05:01.930 --> 05:04.550
my brush opacity at 30 percent.

05:04.640 --> 05:10.610
I'm going to go ahead and brush in along the edge like so and then I'm going to select this color that

05:10.610 --> 05:11.540
we got out of that.

05:11.600 --> 05:12.720
The mid color.

05:12.920 --> 05:16.800
And then I'm going to bring my Bursch opacity back up to 100 percent.

05:16.830 --> 05:22.920
Now I can paint over that edge like so and that's going to give me a nice blend between those two colors.

05:35.280 --> 05:40.590
As we get up here to this area what we want to do is we want to select sort of this darker shadow color

05:41.090 --> 05:46.910
and then we're going to bring our brush opacity back down to 30 percent paint right there the most select

05:47.000 --> 05:48.600
this mid color.

05:49.040 --> 05:55.190
Then come back to our brush tool bring our brush capacity back up to 100 percent and then continue to

05:55.190 --> 05:55.820
paint that in

06:08.390 --> 06:11.740
Awesome our wooden crate looks pretty dang good.

06:12.170 --> 06:14.330
You should be very proud of yourself.

06:14.330 --> 06:19.400
Now let's go ahead and see you this out so that you can share it to the Q&amp;A section of the course.

06:19.400 --> 06:25.970
So I'm going to go ahead and turn off this frame right here and I've already turned off my background

06:25.980 --> 06:31.820
drawing and then I'm going to grab my crop tool which has this tool right underneath my lasso tool.

06:31.820 --> 06:34.850
So I'm going to go ahead and click that.

06:34.880 --> 06:38.020
So I click it and now I can grab these corners.

06:38.280 --> 06:39.610
I can drag them in like so.

06:39.620 --> 06:43.860
And crop this image to the correct size.

06:43.880 --> 06:48.220
So right about there should be good square head and hit enter.

06:48.530 --> 06:52.770
Now once you've done this I want you to go ahead and save this as a Photoshop document.

06:52.910 --> 06:54.150
So you don't lose your work.

06:54.320 --> 06:57.110
But then I also want you to save it out as a J.

06:57.140 --> 07:04.100
The way you save it as a JPEG is by coming up to file save as and then you're going to come down here

07:04.100 --> 07:10.120
to so save as type and you're going to change that from a photoshop file to a j peg.

07:10.280 --> 07:12.130
Or you can save it as a P G.

07:12.140 --> 07:13.640
It doesn't really matter.

07:13.640 --> 07:15.810
Let's go ahead and hit save.

07:16.760 --> 07:17.570
Awesome.

07:17.810 --> 07:19.010
So once you've saved this.

07:19.010 --> 07:22.520
Go ahead and share it to the Q and A section of the course.

07:22.580 --> 07:26.620
I'm super excited to see your work and thanks for joining me in this lecture.
