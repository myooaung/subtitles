00:00.580 --> 00:03.760
All right let's go ahead and build our gem.

00:03.960 --> 00:07.480
So the first thing we're going to do is we're going to add some color toward gem.

00:07.530 --> 00:13.860
So let's go ahead and select the shape that makes up the gym background which is the one with the gradient

00:13.920 --> 00:14.580
on it.

00:14.580 --> 00:19.660
So go ahead and select that shape on the layer and then we're going to add a new layer above that.

00:19.710 --> 00:23.010
And on this layer we're going to go ahead and fill it in with whatever color we want.

00:23.010 --> 00:28.920
Our gem to be so in this case I want my gym to be an awkward blue so I'm going to come into my blues

00:29.010 --> 00:32.360
and I don't want to make this completely saturated but some are but there should be good.

00:32.550 --> 00:36.460
And then I'm to go ahead and fill that in next.

00:36.480 --> 00:41.130
Let's go ahead and change the blunt mode on this layer from normal to overlay.

00:41.550 --> 00:47.100
And then if you want to adjust your color to the exact color you want turn on your hue and saturation

00:47.130 --> 00:50.490
panel by hitting control you or command you.

00:50.750 --> 00:55.930
And then you can go ahead and change the color by dragging the hue across this bar.

00:55.970 --> 00:57.740
So if you want to yellow or orange.

00:58.070 --> 00:59.900
But I'm going to keep my blue.

00:59.900 --> 01:03.800
You can also play with the saturation Meinzer and pretty saturated but that's what it would look like

01:03.800 --> 01:06.410
at full saturation less saturation.

01:06.430 --> 01:08.230
But I'm going to keep it about where I'm at.

01:08.390 --> 01:10.500
And you can also play with the lightness and the darkness.

01:10.550 --> 01:14.010
So I might actually bring mine down just a little bit darker.

01:14.180 --> 01:15.000
OK.

01:15.470 --> 01:16.500
Great.

01:16.550 --> 01:22.340
Next let's add in our highlights so I'm going to add a new layer above this and then I'm going to switch

01:22.340 --> 01:29.720
over to the color white and then I want to make sure I'm on a soft edged brush so I'm on this brush

01:29.720 --> 01:30.690
right here.

01:31.130 --> 01:36.110
And then I'm going to bring my bra size up like so to about that size and I'm going to start painting

01:36.110 --> 01:37.030
in my highlight.

01:37.040 --> 01:42.320
I also want to bring my brush opacity down to 10 percent so I had the number one on my keyboard and

01:42.320 --> 01:48.500
then I can start painting right here just like so once I get a big area painted in like so I'm going

01:48.500 --> 01:53.960
to bring my brushes down a little bit more and then I can continue painting in that area then I'll bring

01:53.960 --> 01:56.200
it down a little bit more and continue painting.

01:56.520 --> 02:00.360
And that I'll bring me down just a little bit more and continue painting.

02:00.380 --> 02:00.950
Great.

02:00.950 --> 02:03.330
So we wanted to be a pretty soft edge.

02:03.470 --> 02:07.970
Next let's go ahead and move down here to this bottom area and we're going to go ahead and paint around

02:07.970 --> 02:13.920
the edge like so and we'll just keep doing that until we get another nice highlight down here.

02:19.230 --> 02:21.600
And I have this coming around a little bit too far up.

02:21.610 --> 02:26.080
So don't go ahead and switch over to my race to make sure you're on a soft edge brush also.

02:26.380 --> 02:28.950
And I'm going bring my brush past my brush size down.

02:28.970 --> 02:31.030
I'm going to go ahead and erase away some of that.

02:31.040 --> 02:37.490
Like so now lastly I'm going go ahead and switch back over to my brush and put my brush capacity at

02:37.490 --> 02:43.700
100 percent and I'm going to go ahead and paint in a spot like so because I want that to be my main

02:43.700 --> 02:46.330
highlight point on my jewel.

02:46.340 --> 02:46.800
All right.

02:46.820 --> 02:50.140
Creating a jewel for this project is that simple.

02:50.240 --> 02:54.080
And you can see when we zoom out it looks pretty dang realistic.

02:54.080 --> 02:59.060
Now we can also play around once again what the coloring down here so we can hit control you and we

02:59.060 --> 03:01.980
can change that color to see what it looks like with those highlights now.

03:02.270 --> 03:07.190
But I'm going to keep it at my original color and I might darken a little bit more and bring up the

03:07.190 --> 03:09.620
saturation somewhere about there.

03:09.860 --> 03:12.480
OK great.

03:12.500 --> 03:14.540
That brings us to the end of this lecture.

03:14.720 --> 03:18.790
So in this lecture you learn how to create the highlights and the color for your jewel.

03:18.800 --> 03:25.010
You also learn how you can use your hue and saturation panel to adjust the colors of your gem in the

03:25.010 --> 03:25.720
next lecture.

03:25.760 --> 03:29.690
We're going to go ahead and place some objects inside of our gem.

03:29.720 --> 03:32.800
Thanks for watching this lecture and I look forward to seeing you in the next one.
