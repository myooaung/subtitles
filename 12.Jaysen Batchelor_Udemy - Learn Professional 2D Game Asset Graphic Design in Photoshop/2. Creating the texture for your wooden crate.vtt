00:00.510 --> 00:05.980
In this lecture we're going to go ahead and create the texture for our Krait.

00:06.150 --> 00:09.410
Now this is going to be a very simple texture to create.

00:09.630 --> 00:14.310
And after we create this texture and apply it toward drawing We're going to go ahead and get into more

00:14.310 --> 00:18.530
advanced texture creation and we'll fly that toward a crane also.

00:18.570 --> 00:24.180
So you're going to get a taste for two different styles of texture in this section of the course.

00:24.450 --> 00:26.420
So let's go ahead and jump right in.

00:26.490 --> 00:31.360
The first thing we want to do is we want to create a new document seven new document here that's 800

00:31.380 --> 00:33.990
pixels by 800 pixels.

00:33.990 --> 00:38.370
And the first thing we want to do is add a new layer then using my Markee.

00:38.460 --> 00:43.570
I'm going to go ahead and create a rectangle like so.

00:43.590 --> 00:48.720
Now what this rectangle is for is we're going to create the individual planks that are going to make

00:48.720 --> 00:50.940
up our wooden crate.

00:50.970 --> 00:54.680
So the first thing we want to do is we want to select our color.

00:54.990 --> 01:03.420
So I'm looking at my color picker and I'll come into my purple's and I'm going to come down about there

01:03.900 --> 01:06.420
and we want it to be pretty saturated.

01:06.840 --> 01:07.750
OK.

01:08.040 --> 01:12.760
This is going to be our shadow color and shadow colors tend to be the saturated.

01:12.930 --> 01:17.400
So let's go ahead and fill that rectangle in next what I'm going to do is I'm going to find my highlight

01:17.400 --> 01:17.930
color.

01:18.300 --> 01:24.240
So my highlight color is going to be sort of an orange color.

01:24.270 --> 01:32.010
This is also going to be pretty saturated but not as saturated as my purple but there should be good.

01:32.080 --> 01:39.450
Then let's go ahead and create a new layer and fill this in with our orange color and then we can go

01:39.450 --> 01:42.710
ahead and use or Transform Tool to shrink that down.

01:42.750 --> 01:47.460
Remember to hold down shift to keep its portions and in this case we actually don't want to keep the

01:47.460 --> 01:49.900
portions we want it to become a little bit skinnier.

01:49.920 --> 01:56.010
Otherwise we're not going to keep the same distance between the edges on the top and the side.

01:56.010 --> 01:56.890
So let's go ahead and head.

01:56.970 --> 01:57.940
OK.

01:58.380 --> 02:02.000
Now we use the arrow keys on a keyboard to nudge that into place.

02:02.040 --> 02:08.420
And what we're looking for is we're trying to get it into the center great.

02:08.430 --> 02:13.560
Now you may be wondering why are we using sort of this orange ish pinkish color and this purple to create

02:13.620 --> 02:14.750
a wooden crate.

02:14.940 --> 02:20.010
Well a lot of the times it's a lot more interesting to use colors that are a little bit different than

02:20.010 --> 02:21.790
what you would normally see.

02:21.810 --> 02:27.480
Also the reason for the outline on our wood which is going to be shadow the reason why it's going to

02:27.480 --> 02:34.110
be purple is because like we said before we want our shadows to be cool colors and the more vibrant

02:34.140 --> 02:38.680
and exaggerated they are the more interesting your artwork is going to look.

02:39.180 --> 02:42.930
Next what we're going to do is we're going to merge these two layers together.

02:46.190 --> 02:48.590
And then we're going to copy this layer.

02:48.710 --> 02:51.870
So now we have two next.

02:51.890 --> 03:00.740
Let's go ahead and create a wood textured so I'm going to come in and I'm going to select a black then

03:00.740 --> 03:01.670
using my brush too.

03:01.700 --> 03:06.220
I'm going to go ahead and start painting in some wood grain on a new layer.

03:08.170 --> 03:11.290
Like the.

03:11.920 --> 03:17.320
Now if you don't know what green looks like or you're having a hard time envisioning it go ahead and

03:17.320 --> 03:21.300
do a google search for woodgrain and use that as a reference.

03:21.310 --> 03:28.750
It's very important to use reference when you're creating artwork all the greatest artists use reference.

03:28.750 --> 03:32.770
So just remember whenever you're in doubt go ahead and look at some reference

03:40.580 --> 03:48.230
for the most part woodgrain is going to be very random looking.

03:48.310 --> 03:51.270
So do not worry about it being perfect by any means.

04:00.790 --> 04:03.220
Get that will do the same for the other side.

04:43.680 --> 04:45.390
Now we're going to be reusing these.

04:45.420 --> 04:47.680
And I think this not right here or this.

04:47.680 --> 04:52.920
I it's going to be way too prominent and recognizable when we reuse this plank of wood.

04:53.010 --> 04:55.140
So I'm going to redo this area right here.

04:55.170 --> 04:56.450
So just taking my soul.

04:56.490 --> 04:57.590
Go ahead and erase that

05:03.730 --> 05:07.720
and just go ahead and brush in something a little bit less noticeable.

05:21.480 --> 05:23.700
So great.

05:23.700 --> 05:27.670
Now I know this isn't looking very good but we're going to do something to it here in a second.

05:27.690 --> 05:29.590
That's going to make it look amazing.

05:29.880 --> 05:36.320
So what we're going to do first is we're going to go ahead and merge these two planks of wood together.

05:36.480 --> 05:42.810
So now those are one and then we want to go ahead and select the shape on our layer by holding down

05:42.810 --> 05:43.520
control.

05:43.530 --> 05:48.730
Or if you're on a Mac you're going to hit command and then clicking your thumb nail on the layer and

05:48.990 --> 05:55.560
see if we get this dotted line going around are shapes we're going to do now is we're going to invert

05:55.560 --> 05:56.370
the selection.

05:56.370 --> 06:00.480
So at the moment we have selected the inside of these planks.

06:00.480 --> 06:05.260
We want to select this outside area so we're going to hold down control shift I.

06:05.490 --> 06:09.470
And now you can see that just swapped it to this outside white area.

06:09.480 --> 06:13.330
You can tell because there's a dotted line around the outside of your document.

06:13.860 --> 06:16.720
And if you're on a Mac it's going to be command shift.

06:16.780 --> 06:23.280
I and the reason why we wanted to flip this is because we want to delete this black area that's sticking

06:23.280 --> 06:25.330
off the edges of our planks.

06:25.380 --> 06:31.680
So now if we go ahead and switch up to our top layer which has a woodgrain on it we can go ahead and

06:31.680 --> 06:32.340
hit delete.

06:32.340 --> 06:34.000
Now get rid of all of that.

06:34.320 --> 06:35.280
Great.

06:35.430 --> 06:38.820
Now what we're going to do is we're going to copy this layer.

06:38.880 --> 06:40.460
So go control J.

06:40.950 --> 06:46.620
And then we're going to bring up our human saturation panel by hitting control you or command you if

06:46.620 --> 06:47.580
you're on a Mac.

06:48.000 --> 06:53.930
And now what we can do is we can change the saturation the lightness and the hue of our layer.

06:54.060 --> 07:00.920
What we want to do is we want to change our black to white then we'll go ahead and hit OK.

07:01.560 --> 07:03.870
So we solve our black one underneath.

07:03.870 --> 07:08.240
Next what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and take our black and we're going to nudge it

07:08.250 --> 07:15.950
over one pixel like so then we're going to take our white Nejad over one pixel in the opposite direction.

07:16.320 --> 07:20.830
Next we're going to go ahead and take our white layer and drag underneath the black layer.

07:20.880 --> 07:25.910
This way it gives us more of a crack Canyon sort of effect next.

07:25.950 --> 07:32.880
Let's go ahead and merge these two layers together and then we have a little bit sticking off the edges

07:32.880 --> 07:34.570
because we noticed him over.

07:34.590 --> 07:40.860
So what we want to do now is we want to select a shape once more for our Plank's invert that selection

07:40.860 --> 07:43.860
by hitting control shift eye or command shift.

07:43.860 --> 07:48.750
If you're on a Mac then we'll go ahead and hit delete and you couldn't really see it because it's being

07:48.750 --> 07:50.060
covered up by the dotted lines.

07:50.070 --> 07:54.330
But that just took care of the little bit that was sticking out the edges.

07:54.330 --> 08:01.710
Next what we're going to do is we're going to change our blend mode from normal to overlay and then

08:01.710 --> 08:09.570
we're going to bring our capacity down to about 62 percent.

08:09.570 --> 08:10.580
Great.

08:10.710 --> 08:15.850
So now we have our two wooden planks next what we want to do is we want to start moving these into our

08:15.850 --> 08:16.620
document.

08:16.830 --> 08:22.050
So first let's merge both these layers together so that it's easier to bring these over into her other

08:22.050 --> 08:23.600
document.

08:23.610 --> 08:28.560
Next I'm going to go ahead and select one of these with my marquee tool then I'm going to copy it by

08:28.560 --> 08:30.320
hitting Control-C on my keyboard.

08:30.330 --> 08:32.240
Or if you're on a Mac it's going to be command.

08:32.350 --> 08:36.120
See I'm going to come back in toward drawing file.

08:36.120 --> 08:38.430
And let's go ahead and paste that in.

08:38.490 --> 08:44.660
By having control VI or command vi then we're going to use a transform tool to shrink that down.

08:45.150 --> 08:50.060
And the first thing we want to do is we want to make this back part of our wooden crate.

08:50.060 --> 08:55.260
So this area and these triangles is going to be the back part where we have slats of our board is going

08:55.260 --> 08:59.720
to crossed now our light source is going to be coming from the top.

08:59.940 --> 09:05.800
So we want to make sure that we have this high light edge on our woodgrain on this side.

09:06.000 --> 09:10.050
If it's on the other side it's going to look like the light source is coming from the bottom.

09:10.440 --> 09:16.060
So let's go ahead and put that into place and we're going to hold down shift and shrink it down.

09:16.110 --> 09:18.970
We hold down shift to keep his portions.

09:19.020 --> 09:24.420
Then once we get it to the right spot in size we'll go out and hit enter and then let's do the same

09:24.420 --> 09:31.860
thing again with our other wooden plank caesium and Marki to go ahead and select that copy it and paste

09:31.860 --> 09:33.420
it.

09:33.480 --> 09:35.910
Now we can go ahead and shrink that down.

09:36.050 --> 09:41.370
So turn on transform tool and do like we did before with our other plank.

09:41.640 --> 09:44.360
Let's rotate it.

09:44.620 --> 09:48.900
Make sure that you have your highlight on the bottom side of your crane.

09:51.230 --> 09:57.060
Get it lined up and remember to hold down shift as you shrink it to keep its portions.

09:57.760 --> 10:01.430
And once we get into place although I did hit enter.

10:01.690 --> 10:05.860
And then let's go ahead and merge these two layers together.

10:06.970 --> 10:11.680
Now I'm noticing that the crack between each one of these boards is not dark enough.

10:11.890 --> 10:15.160
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and zoom in there.

10:16.490 --> 10:21.700
Then I'm going to select this purple and I'm going to grab a really dark version of it.

10:21.710 --> 10:24.450
So somewhere down here should be good.

10:24.630 --> 10:26.100
And switching over to my brush tool.

10:26.150 --> 10:32.990
And I'm making sure that I'm on my pencil tool right here and then shrinking my brush size down to one

10:32.990 --> 10:40.340
pixel on a click there and then hold down shift and comes straight across it like so now I'm going to

10:40.340 --> 10:46.850
do this once more just to darken it a little bit more and then I'll do the same thing for the bottom

10:46.850 --> 10:47.670
side here.

10:47.690 --> 10:53.900
So a click track of crossed click and drag across it.

10:57.180 --> 11:04.290
Let's go ahead and copy these two by selecting them copying them and then we're going to drag it up

11:04.290 --> 11:04.950
like so

11:07.870 --> 11:12.900
now we need one more appears so I'll just go ahead and copy another one in.

11:13.530 --> 11:17.430
Then I'm going to bring down the opacity on the Slayer up here where it says opacities.

11:17.430 --> 11:21.060
I'll bring that down to about 40 percent.

11:21.060 --> 11:21.750
Doesn't really matter.

11:21.750 --> 11:27.780
We just want to see the drawing behind it so we know where to cut this off at which we'll be right there.

11:27.840 --> 11:33.150
So we'll hit delete and that can bring the opacity back up on that layer.

11:33.180 --> 11:34.310
Great.

11:34.320 --> 11:37.230
Now let's go ahead and merge all these layers together.

11:37.530 --> 11:41.400
So I'm going to select them all and merge them.

11:41.400 --> 11:43.320
So now that's one layer.

11:43.350 --> 11:48.480
Next what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and copy this layer and then we're going to drag

11:48.480 --> 11:50.380
the copy over like so.

11:50.760 --> 11:55.280
So now we just want to apply this to our box just like we did before with her drawing.

11:55.410 --> 12:00.960
So we're going to turn on our Transform Tool right click and come to distort and then we're just going

12:00.960 --> 12:09.090
to drag each one of these corners into the corners of our drawing like so and so now we're texture has

12:09.090 --> 12:11.580
conformed to the correct perspective.

12:11.580 --> 12:13.350
Let's go ahead and hit enter.

12:14.540 --> 12:19.940
Let's go ahead and do this for other surface so we're going to come back down to this layer and we'll

12:19.940 --> 12:21.720
go ahead and copy it.

12:22.000 --> 12:29.920
I will drag that copy over and we'll line it up then use the Transform Tool and distort.

12:30.670 --> 12:32.840
We'll bring that up to that corner.

12:33.070 --> 12:36.970
Just get everything into the correct position.

12:50.500 --> 12:51.060
Perfect.

12:51.160 --> 12:51.810
Let's go in.

12:52.060 --> 12:53.330
Enter now.

12:53.350 --> 12:55.230
Let's go ahead and grab the sleigh right here.

12:55.240 --> 12:58.420
The hands are drawn on it are going to drag the underneath all these.

12:58.600 --> 13:00.360
So you can see what's going on.

13:00.400 --> 13:00.720
All right.

13:00.760 --> 13:03.310
This is looking pretty good in the next lecture.

13:03.310 --> 13:08.710
We're going to go ahead and create the outside frame and the criss crossing planks and then we're going

13:08.710 --> 13:13.450
to add a little bit of dimension to those and then we'll also add some light and shadow to our crate

13:13.450 --> 13:15.820
to make it look a lot more realistic.

13:15.820 --> 13:16.940
Thanks for watching this lecture.

13:16.960 --> 13:19.250
And I look forward to seeing you in the next one.
