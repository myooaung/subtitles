WEBVTT

00:00.750 --> 00:05.830
All right before we get painting on our Saward we want to make sure that everything looks good to us.

00:06.060 --> 00:11.820
So as I was looking at this between lectures I thought that the sword looked a little bit too skinny

00:12.060 --> 00:15.100
and I thought this bottom part of the sword looks too big.

00:15.210 --> 00:20.730
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to first transform this layer that my blade is on and I'm just

00:20.730 --> 00:24.600
going to stretch it out like so and holding down old While I do that.

00:24.600 --> 00:26.930
That's going to stretch it out on both sides.

00:27.060 --> 00:28.980
So I'm going to stretch it out to about.

00:28.980 --> 00:30.000
There should be good.

00:30.030 --> 00:30.980
Maybe one more.

00:30.990 --> 00:32.240
See how that looks.

00:32.280 --> 00:32.770
All right.

00:32.800 --> 00:35.340
Delex get to enter then.

00:35.370 --> 00:38.290
I'm going to shrink my handle down and my butt down too.

00:38.340 --> 00:39.940
So I'm going to go find those layers.

00:40.000 --> 00:40.830
Sozzi.

00:41.040 --> 00:48.030
There's one of them and then that one that I'm going to select all of those trim a Transform Tool on

00:48.960 --> 00:54.310
and hold down shift and all at the same time to shrink it from the middle and also shrink it in proportion.

00:54.330 --> 00:57.710
So shrink it to right about there should be good.

00:58.230 --> 01:03.720
And I'm going to stretch it up like so because I want my handle to still be as long as it was before

01:04.520 --> 01:06.660
and I might drag that down a little bit.

01:06.660 --> 01:07.040
All right.

01:07.050 --> 01:07.420
Great.

01:07.440 --> 01:09.460
Let's enter.

01:09.570 --> 01:10.050
Perfect.

01:10.050 --> 01:12.520
I like that shape much better.

01:12.520 --> 01:14.340
Now let's go ahead and get painting.

01:14.400 --> 01:16.590
So we're going to start with the blood of the sword.

01:16.620 --> 01:20.320
Someone to go find my bottom layer for that which is that guy.

01:20.610 --> 01:24.560
And I'll add a new layer above that and then I'm going to Right-Click and turn that into a clipping

01:24.560 --> 01:25.650
layer mask.

01:25.920 --> 01:29.980
Then I can go ahead and zoom in there and begin to paint.

01:30.090 --> 01:35.960
So I'm going to grab the color white because our metal is going to be completely silver.

01:36.120 --> 01:38.650
And so we're going to use white as a base highlight color.

01:39.050 --> 01:43.780
Then I'm to bring my brush opacity down to 20 percent and then I'll begin painting.

01:43.950 --> 01:48.570
So I'm going to start by adding a highlight to this top area like so because the light would probably

01:48.570 --> 01:55.760
be hitting it would be seen just the very ledge of that then I'm going go ahead and add another layer

01:55.760 --> 01:59.630
on top of that like so to really start bringing in that silver color.

01:59.900 --> 02:05.180
And what we want to do from here is since this is going to be cylinder shaped We want the highlight

02:05.180 --> 02:08.480
to be in the middle to be the brightest and the further out it goes.

02:08.480 --> 02:09.690
It needs to get darker.

02:09.890 --> 02:15.710
So I'll start out here like so coming right up to the edge Maleev in a little bit of a dark area on

02:15.710 --> 02:21.830
the edge and then I'm going to add another one a little bit further in and I'll keep doing this.

02:21.840 --> 02:24.880
And if you miss a few spots like I did back there that's fine.

02:24.960 --> 02:27.560
That's just going to add more texture to your artwork.

02:31.680 --> 02:36.220
Now we want to keep doing this until this middle area is basically as white as it can be.

02:36.360 --> 02:39.390
And we can add a little bit more on the outer edge area.

02:42.050 --> 02:46.550
So just like so now I think I got that outer edge area a little bit too dark.

02:46.710 --> 02:51.040
So go ahead and slide my dark gray and paint a little bit of that back in.

02:51.650 --> 02:57.560
And then I might add a little bit of a shadow down here and a little bit of texture just because it

02:57.560 --> 03:00.900
may be reflecting the top surface of this piece of metal.

03:01.010 --> 03:03.940
So that's why we're adding that in then.

03:03.980 --> 03:08.480
Let's go ahead and select white and we're going to repaint in this top area.

03:08.510 --> 03:08.810
So

03:12.820 --> 03:13.360
perfect.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.390
Now let's move down to the bottom area.

03:15.760 --> 03:24.340
So I'm going to add some paint in Mike so I might add a little bit more in like so and then there's

03:24.350 --> 03:28.650
going to be a little bit of a shadow being cast from this large piece of metal on top of it.

03:28.670 --> 03:32.320
So I'm going to start adding paint in right in the middle like so.

03:32.510 --> 03:36.740
So we're not going have a shadow on this bottom part because as it turns into the bottom it's going

03:36.740 --> 03:38.360
to create a little bit more of a shadow.

03:38.390 --> 03:41.090
And we're also going to have less light underneath here.

03:41.090 --> 03:43.610
Like I said that because there's going to be a cast shadows.

03:43.640 --> 03:48.260
So that's why we're only painting through this middle area and then we want to start painting in the

03:48.260 --> 03:51.390
center only and really start making that white

03:55.100 --> 03:55.800
grid.

03:55.980 --> 04:01.290
Now I got these edges a little bit to light again so I'm going to go and slide my dark gray color and

04:01.290 --> 04:02.250
start painting that in

04:06.990 --> 04:07.260
next.

04:07.260 --> 04:10.690
You don't want to do is I want to grab a darker version of this gray.

04:11.040 --> 04:17.060
So come down to about there and I might add a little bit more shadow underneath here.

04:17.130 --> 04:20.430
Now we're going to add a little bit of rust to our sword.

04:20.520 --> 04:25.740
So I'm going to come into my colors and I'm we're first going to start off with sort of an orange ish

04:25.740 --> 04:27.960
red color and we're going to make it really bright.

04:27.960 --> 04:30.150
So somewhere in there.

04:30.670 --> 04:31.740
OK.

04:31.950 --> 04:35.760
Then using a brush tool and still being at 20 percent opacity.

04:35.760 --> 04:41.290
We're going to go ahead and start painting in this bottom area like so.

04:41.300 --> 04:45.070
So that's our first layer of the rust color.

04:45.060 --> 04:49.140
Now let's go ahead and switch back in there and let's come a little bit more towards the yellowish oranges

04:49.350 --> 04:53.440
and we're going to bring this down a little bit darker and a little bit more saturated.

04:53.660 --> 04:54.360
OK.

04:54.680 --> 05:01.680
And we're going to brush a little bit more of that in.

05:02.640 --> 05:06.240
And then lastly we're going to grab an even darker version of that.

05:06.240 --> 05:07.410
So some are way over here.

05:07.410 --> 05:14.040
More saturated and way more darker than I'm going to bring my brush opacity up to 80 percent and I'm

05:14.040 --> 05:17.590
going to go ahead and paint in some small spots down here like so.

05:17.930 --> 05:21.810
And that Brown might be a little bit too dark so I'm going to light in that a little bit more about

05:21.810 --> 05:22.740
there.

05:22.760 --> 05:25.000
I'm hoping that in.

05:26.000 --> 05:26.580
Cool.

05:26.580 --> 05:30.600
So that just adds a little bit more texture and something a little bit more interesting to look at.

05:30.600 --> 05:33.990
When you look at the sword it gives a lot more character.

05:33.990 --> 05:38.430
Now let's go ahead and move on to this part of the sword so I'm going to come up to that layer which

05:38.430 --> 05:41.220
is this one right here and I'll add a new layer above that.

05:41.250 --> 05:47.370
Right click and create clipping mask that I'm going to switch back over to my right color.

05:48.310 --> 05:50.000
And then will start off with the top part.

05:50.020 --> 05:52.090
So will add a highlight across there.

05:54.860 --> 05:58.240
And then we can go ahead and start adding in the center area.

05:59.940 --> 06:05.220
So the more interesting brushstrokes you can do and the more squealy it looks and whatever the more

06:05.220 --> 06:06.890
interesting your painting is going to look.

06:06.890 --> 06:12.780
So I do suggest that you try to keep it relatively messy even though you still want it to look realistic.

06:12.810 --> 06:14.990
You also want it to have that painting style.

06:15.030 --> 06:17.720
So it's OK if you keep it pretty messy.

06:45.450 --> 06:47.730
Then I'm going to go ahead and Reesa like this.

06:47.740 --> 06:53.000
Dirk gray and I'm going to go ahead and start painting some of that shadow back onto my edge.

06:53.460 --> 06:53.970
So

06:57.320 --> 07:01.210
great then I'm going to go ahead and select my rust color.

07:01.250 --> 07:07.370
So I'm going to come into my reddish oranges come up to about there and then I'll go ahead and start

07:07.370 --> 07:09.720
painting that I'm on the bottom.

07:22.620 --> 07:23.350
It's like so.

07:23.370 --> 07:27.810
And then we'll grab a little bit darker version of that maybe a little bit more towards the yellows

07:28.510 --> 07:35.740
and go ahead and paint that and.

07:36.060 --> 07:39.450
And then I'm going to go ahead and grab that even Durka version of that.

07:39.510 --> 07:44.190
Somewhere in there and then put my brush opacity at 80 percent.

07:44.190 --> 07:49.920
I'm going to go ahead and paint in those little small rust spots and I can even bring my brush opacity

07:49.920 --> 07:55.290
down to 40 percent to get some that are a little less strong.

07:57.780 --> 07:58.970
Great.

07:58.980 --> 08:02.730
Now let's go ahead and continue painting this and working with it until we get it looking the way we

08:02.730 --> 08:03.540
want.

08:03.540 --> 08:07.310
So what I'm going to do first is I'm going to select this mid color right here.

08:07.530 --> 08:11.520
Then switching back over to my brush and putting my brush opacity at 100 percent.

08:11.520 --> 08:16.980
I'm going to go ahead and kind of paint that area and with a solid gray color I'm going to go ahead

08:17.010 --> 08:20.920
and select the next light color and I'll go ahead and paint that area.

08:20.930 --> 08:27.620
And so on both sides I'm going to select this color over here and paint in this area.

08:28.490 --> 08:33.200
And this just makes it look a lot more like paint rather than painting with transparence you're painting

08:33.200 --> 08:39.560
with opaque colors and that gives a lot more of a realistic painting look then I can go ahead and do

08:39.560 --> 08:40.280
the same down here.

08:40.280 --> 08:46.040
So it's like that color paint some of that and then I'm to go ahead and like this Sturk gray color and

08:46.040 --> 08:52.940
paint my Greyback in on the edge and I put my brush rapacity at 20 percent and I might paint a little

08:52.940 --> 08:55.160
bit more into these bottom areas like so

08:59.690 --> 09:00.800
awesome.

09:00.860 --> 09:04.760
Now I'm going to switch back over to my white and kind of blend this in just a little bit more with

09:04.760 --> 09:07.080
my brush being at 20 percent.

09:08.340 --> 09:12.930
Perfect And lastly I want to go ahead and add that white back in at the top.

09:12.930 --> 09:20.100
So when I put my brush at 80 percent and I'll go ahead and paint that back in just like so I might have

09:20.100 --> 09:21.090
a little bit come down the edge.

09:21.090 --> 09:27.300
Also next let's switch back down to the layer that we were painting before and we're just going to add

09:27.300 --> 09:29.550
a few more touches and highlights.

09:29.900 --> 09:31.530
So still does using my white brush.

09:31.530 --> 09:38.000
I'll just add those in and then I might grab some of these mid colors and then putting my brush at 100

09:38.010 --> 09:38.560
percent.

09:38.610 --> 09:44.270
I'll go ahead and paint some of those colors in just to give it some more opaqueness.

09:44.280 --> 09:48.140
Let's go ahead and zoom out and see how that looks.

09:48.150 --> 09:50.650
I think we could use a little bit more shadow underneath here.

09:50.670 --> 09:55.850
I'm going to go ahead and zoom in and on the Slayer I'll go ahead and select this dark gray color.

09:55.850 --> 10:02.760
Go ahead and paint some of that in like so then I'm going to go ahead and select this demagoguery color

10:02.820 --> 10:08.700
and I may add that back in right there and I might add some of that more dark gray on these edges.

10:08.820 --> 10:12.480
And also along the bottom pretty my brush capacity at 20 percent.

10:12.480 --> 10:17.070
I'll just paint some of that as we get a little bit more of a shadow on that bottom area and I might

10:17.070 --> 10:19.690
add a little bit more shadow on this edge also.

10:20.010 --> 10:25.530
And right there and then I think the rust is a little bit too much on the top part.

10:25.530 --> 10:28.640
So don't go and switch over to that layer like my white.

10:28.680 --> 10:34.170
Go ahead and sort of blend that and more down here towards the bottom.

10:43.980 --> 10:44.870
Great.

10:45.100 --> 10:48.900
And we have this really cool metal look for the butt of our sort.

10:49.120 --> 10:51.020
So let's zoom out and see how that looks.

10:51.750 --> 10:52.830
Perfect.

10:52.830 --> 10:55.340
Now let's go ahead and paint the handle for a sword.

10:55.380 --> 10:57.890
So let's zoom in there find that layer.

10:57.990 --> 11:00.180
So come down sit right there.

11:00.230 --> 11:04.300
Well add a new layer above it and you create a clipping mask.

11:04.500 --> 11:08.490
Then I'm going to go ahead and select this color we have there and I'm going to find a lighter version

11:08.490 --> 11:09.340
of that.

11:09.750 --> 11:15.660
And I'm also going to make it a little bit warmer but coming up just a little bit more towards my reds.

11:15.660 --> 11:19.680
And then we can go ahead and use or paint brush and at 20 percent opacity I'm going to go ahead and

11:19.710 --> 11:24.000
paint in some large areas where I want each band to be.

11:24.000 --> 11:28.830
And these are the bands that are going to be wrapped around the handle

11:33.290 --> 11:33.900
grit.

11:34.110 --> 11:36.030
Now let's go ahead and keep layering those.

11:36.030 --> 11:39.040
And we want the center just like the metal part to be the lightest part.

11:39.050 --> 11:43.210
And as it gets more to the edge it's going to round around our form.

11:43.340 --> 11:55.340
And so it's going to get more Shatto.

11:55.850 --> 11:58.260
Also the light source is going to be coming from the top.

11:58.280 --> 12:03.200
And so we're going to add a little bit more highlight on the top of each one of these drapped

12:18.610 --> 12:19.250
grit.

12:19.330 --> 12:24.020
Now let's go ahead and switch over to even the lighter version of this.

12:24.020 --> 12:28.230
So somewhere about there maybe just the tiniest bit more towards the Reds.

12:28.400 --> 12:29.190
Okay.

12:29.630 --> 12:33.490
And then we're going to go ahead and bring a burst size down and we're going to mostly paint on this

12:33.500 --> 12:35.240
top area like so

12:46.900 --> 12:50.410
we're going to leave this area out because it's going to have a cast shadow on it.

12:50.410 --> 12:52.830
So right about here and up.

12:52.900 --> 12:57.080
You're not going to see any highlights so I might add a little bit of a highlight right there.

12:57.190 --> 12:59.680
But everything about that is not going to get any more highlight.

13:16.080 --> 13:16.250
Right.

13:16.450 --> 13:17.160
Great.

13:17.200 --> 13:20.490
Next let's go ahead and grab a really highlight highlight color.

13:20.500 --> 13:25.420
So I'm going to come way up here and then I'm gonna come way more into my oranges.

13:25.480 --> 13:27.870
I want this to almost be a peach color.

13:28.120 --> 13:33.160
Maybe a little bit more towards the saturated side and a little bit down towards the Reds somewhere

13:33.160 --> 13:34.500
about there.

13:34.510 --> 13:37.750
Now I'm going to go ahead and start painting those highlights in.

13:39.280 --> 13:46.970
And that's still not really saturated enough for me so I'm gonna straight that color even more perfect.

13:47.050 --> 13:49.420
Let's go ahead and start painting with that.

13:49.420 --> 13:50.800
I think that looks much better.

14:05.370 --> 14:07.720
Then let's scrub this middle color right there.

14:07.740 --> 14:12.770
And lots of light and that little bit because I think we need to more highlight in there.

14:12.820 --> 14:16.800
It's a little bit too dark and we're not giving it enough for someone to go ahead and start painting

14:16.800 --> 14:17.790
that in like so

14:29.200 --> 14:34.340
next I'm going to grab shadow collars and grab our Made color or background color.

14:34.390 --> 14:39.340
I'm going to bring that down so it's even darker maybe a little bit more towards the purples then we're

14:39.340 --> 14:45.360
going to go ahead and start brushing with that brush along these edges like so.

14:45.420 --> 14:47.150
Also add a shadow up here.

14:47.150 --> 14:50.280
Like I said there's going to be a drop shadow so we can add that in right now.

14:53.810 --> 15:00.590
We might add a little bit shadow around here and then we're going to bring some of that shadow into

15:00.680 --> 15:03.430
these creases on both sides.

15:07.820 --> 15:08.480
Perfect.

15:08.600 --> 15:14.630
Then I'm going to go ahead and grab this peach highlight color and I'm just going to add one last really

15:14.630 --> 15:17.680
bright highlight for that summer about there.

15:17.690 --> 15:22.910
And I'm going to put my brush capacity at 50 percent and I'll go ahead and paint in a really bright

15:22.910 --> 15:25.290
one on top of each one of these.

15:25.380 --> 15:26.090
It's like so

15:33.530 --> 15:38.750
now we can go ahead and select these colors and start painting with them at 100 percent opacity so I

15:38.750 --> 15:43.360
might fill in that area and that area with the color same with there and there.

15:43.500 --> 15:45.680
Then I selected this middle color.

15:45.800 --> 15:51.770
Paint this area and again this is just to make it look more like a real painting.

15:59.410 --> 16:03.170
And then down here at the bottom areas are going to go ahead and select that mid color.

16:03.180 --> 16:11.740
So like right there then I'll go ahead and paint that in there just to blend that in a little bit more.

16:11.740 --> 16:15.230
Now we can add a few more things to make it a little bit more interesting and we can add more texture

16:15.230 --> 16:20.950
in there by painting lines like so you know kind of getting more into the shadows with the lighter colors

16:20.980 --> 16:24.900
and then grabbing the shadows and getting more into the lighter colors with those colors.

16:24.990 --> 16:25.470
So I'm

16:28.590 --> 16:30.000
just a little bit more interesting.

16:30.220 --> 16:33.290
All right that brings us to the end of this lecture.

16:33.360 --> 16:38.230
So in this lecture you learn how to paint the butt of your sword and the handle of your sword.

16:38.250 --> 16:43.500
So just remember it's just like when we painted our other hand-painted assets that you want to start

16:43.500 --> 16:48.960
with your darker colors and then you want to start layering those up with highlighted colors.

16:48.960 --> 16:50.190
Thanks for watching this lecture.

16:50.220 --> 16:52.260
And I look forward to seeing you in the next one.
