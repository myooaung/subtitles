00:00.780 --> 00:05.920
In this lecture we're going to go ahead and create some cross road graphics.

00:05.970 --> 00:09.400
Now you probably already familiar with cross roads.

00:09.420 --> 00:13.020
It's one of the top games in the App Store right now.

00:13.020 --> 00:15.820
Now if you're not familiar with Crossroads that's OK.

00:15.930 --> 00:21.180
All you need to understand about it is that it's a game that utilizes cubes the entire game is made

00:21.180 --> 00:24.440
out of cubes and has very basic lighting.

00:24.810 --> 00:29.180
The shadowing is very basic and the colors are completely solid.

00:29.550 --> 00:32.390
So let's go ahead and jump right in and get started.

00:32.700 --> 00:38.240
So the first thing you need to do is you need to download this background template that I have right

00:38.250 --> 00:39.020
here.

00:39.120 --> 00:42.070
This is an isometric grid that I created.

00:42.090 --> 00:45.660
Now isometrics is just another type of perspective.

00:46.110 --> 00:51.150
If you remember when we went over to point perspective to point perspective uses two points off in the

00:51.150 --> 00:54.170
distance that your lines connect to.

00:54.420 --> 00:56.600
So let me demonstrate what I'm talking about.

00:56.650 --> 01:03.990
So when I have a new layer above my grid and using my brush to bring down a brush to the black.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.650
Go ahead and draw on cube.

01:05.850 --> 01:11.940
So you would have your center line right through the middle like so then these two lines right here

01:11.940 --> 01:15.090
would connect off in the distance somewhere over here.

01:16.790 --> 01:17.680
Right.

01:17.810 --> 01:20.360
And that's how you would create the perspective for the cube.

01:20.600 --> 01:22.450
This is a realistic perspective.

01:22.490 --> 01:27.690
Now unlike one point to point perspective isometric perspective never occurs in real life.

01:28.010 --> 01:33.710
It's more of a perspective in theory and so the way it works is rather than having your two lines connect

01:33.710 --> 01:35.410
off at a distance point.

01:35.870 --> 01:41.720
You make your line go straight across like so and the other line goes straight a clot crossed and parallel

01:41.720 --> 01:42.550
to it.

01:42.650 --> 01:45.490
So these lines are never going to connect.

01:45.500 --> 01:48.170
This is what isometric perspective is.

01:48.410 --> 01:56.180
So basically your cube would be right here the side would come over like so and you top would be right

01:56.180 --> 01:59.490
there and that would be an asymmetric cube.

02:00.020 --> 02:04.160
Now this is what we're going to be creating in this lecture is an isometric cube.

02:04.340 --> 02:10.600
Once we create one cube we can use that cube over and over again to create any type of asset we want.

02:10.610 --> 02:13.560
It's kind of like building with Legos but in Photoshop.

02:13.640 --> 02:14.470
Really really cool.

02:14.480 --> 02:15.990
And I think you'll like it.

02:16.010 --> 02:17.890
So let's go ahead and get started.

02:18.060 --> 02:23.870
I want to go ahead and delete the slayer then I'm going to add a new layer above this so I'm going to

02:23.870 --> 02:28.430
zoom in there just so a little bit so I can see what's going on just a little bit better.

02:28.520 --> 02:33.830
And what I want to do is you see my lasso tool and go ahead and click race here.

02:33.880 --> 02:37.010
Now I'm also making sure I'm on my polygon a lasso tool.

02:37.250 --> 02:42.440
So once you've clicked on a point you can come up four of these triangles or you can think of them as

02:42.440 --> 02:43.100
diamonds.

02:43.100 --> 02:48.080
I like to think of them as diamonds because they're the flat face of the top of my cube or the bottom

02:48.080 --> 02:49.020
of my cube.

02:49.400 --> 02:55.940
So I might come straight up holding down shift so I get a perfectly straight line maqam up one two three

02:56.190 --> 02:57.320
four.

02:57.500 --> 03:01.690
Next let's go ahead and come over for it this way diagonally.

03:01.700 --> 03:03.940
So one two three.

03:04.070 --> 03:10.700
We might have to go off the page a little bit for a click and making sure that I stay right on top of

03:10.700 --> 03:13.520
that line that I'm going come straight down for.

03:13.540 --> 03:16.100
So one two three four.

03:16.170 --> 03:22.800
Well done shift to get a perfectly straight line and then I'm can connect it all the way back over here.

03:24.650 --> 03:25.280
Perfect.

03:25.280 --> 03:27.960
So now we have the first face of our cube.

03:28.400 --> 03:30.120
Let's go ahead and fill that in.

03:30.140 --> 03:36.280
So I'm going to select a light gray color somewhere in the middle between the white and the middle for

03:36.290 --> 03:40.250
a summer about their minimum to fill that in.

03:40.280 --> 03:43.100
Next we're going to go ahead and copy this later.

03:43.130 --> 03:44.950
So hit Control J.

03:45.110 --> 03:49.220
And then we're going to drag that layer over and using my transform to.

03:49.250 --> 03:52.480
I'm going to go ahead and flip that horizontally.

03:52.700 --> 03:59.660
And now this will play as the other face or cube or here you can use the air piece on a keyboard to

03:59.660 --> 04:01.690
nudge it more into place.

04:02.240 --> 04:02.780
So

04:05.900 --> 04:09.200
next what we want to do is we want to add more of a shadow to the side.

04:09.230 --> 04:14.090
So I'm going to bring up my hue and saturation by biting control you or command to you if you're on

04:14.090 --> 04:15.040
a Mac.

04:15.260 --> 04:18.370
And then we're going to darken that just a little bit to about.

04:18.380 --> 04:19.690
There should be good.

04:19.970 --> 04:20.910
OK.

04:21.260 --> 04:23.800
Next we're going to make another copy of this layer.

04:23.810 --> 04:25.640
So we're going to hit Control J.

04:25.970 --> 04:29.310
And we can drag this new copy up here.

04:29.690 --> 04:30.670
You can rotate it

04:34.280 --> 04:37.230
it then we can get that into position.

04:37.920 --> 04:39.440
Now it's been cut off right now.

04:39.450 --> 04:42.940
So what I'm going to do is I'm gonna drag that down because we don't want it to be cut off.

04:43.020 --> 04:49.870
Until then I'm going to select all of my squares and I'm going to bring the size down

04:53.020 --> 04:56.440
to about there so it will fit well and enter.

04:56.440 --> 05:02.430
Now I can come back up here and drag the sky into place and I'll zoom in there and using my arrow keys

05:02.440 --> 05:06.220
or nudge it into place that fits perfectly.

05:09.180 --> 05:10.170
Perfect.

05:10.170 --> 05:12.670
Now you'll notice here that we're getting this little weird corner.

05:12.690 --> 05:14.740
So all I have to do is come back down to that layer.

05:14.760 --> 05:17.360
And using my razor I'll just erase that away.

05:17.550 --> 05:22.860
Now this may not be the perfect way to do it but the thing to remember when creating artwork is it's

05:22.860 --> 05:23.790
not about the math.

05:23.820 --> 05:25.240
It's about how it looks.

05:25.260 --> 05:30.320
So as long as it looks good and nobody notices it it will be completely fine.

05:30.320 --> 05:33.780
It's come down here and a race this little corner piece.

05:33.900 --> 05:34.860
Great.

05:34.850 --> 05:39.630
Next let's come back to that layer we just created and we're going to bring up its human saturation

05:39.720 --> 05:41.490
and this time we want to lighten up.

05:41.490 --> 05:43.960
So this is going to be the top of our cube.

05:44.120 --> 05:50.190
We want it to be the lightest surface so I'm going to bring it up almost to the whites so just right

05:50.190 --> 05:51.820
about there plus 85.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.950
Ok cool.

05:53.970 --> 05:55.600
So now we have our cube.

05:55.860 --> 06:01.950
Let's go ahead and merge all these layers together and then I want to get this lined up with the correct

06:01.950 --> 06:03.750
size of my grid.

06:03.780 --> 06:07.020
So I'm going to bring this right down into this corner down here.

06:07.200 --> 06:12.540
So once I get that into the corner what I can do is I can go ahead and use my transform to once again

06:13.170 --> 06:17.030
I can shrink this down until I get it to line up with my grid.

06:17.070 --> 06:17.600
Again

06:26.380 --> 06:26.960
perfect.

06:27.040 --> 06:29.170
So now you see it lines up down here in this corner.

06:29.170 --> 06:30.440
It lines up in that corner.

06:30.460 --> 06:32.870
That corner this corner in that corner.

06:32.980 --> 06:33.680
That's what we want.

06:33.700 --> 06:38.040
Let's go and enter the reason why we wanted to resize it to fit our grid again.

06:38.060 --> 06:43.050
Is it just going to help us get things lined up when we're creating our assets.

06:43.120 --> 06:45.010
That brings us to the end of this lecture.

06:45.010 --> 06:50.620
So in this lecture you learn how to create a three dimensional isometric cube in Photoshop.

06:51.040 --> 06:56.140
In the next lecture we're going to go ahead and build a tree asset from crossing roads.

06:56.140 --> 06:59.530
Thanks for watching this lecture and I look forward to seeing you in the next one.
