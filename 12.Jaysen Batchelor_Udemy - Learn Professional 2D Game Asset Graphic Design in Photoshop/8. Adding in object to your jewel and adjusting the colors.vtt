00:00.660 --> 00:04.310
All right let's go ahead and add an object into our button.

00:04.500 --> 00:08.310
So the first thing we're going to add into it is we're going to add a symbol.

00:08.310 --> 00:14.090
So maybe this is a button that is representing a symbol or type of power for your character.

00:14.190 --> 00:16.660
So let's go ahead and create a new layer.

00:16.680 --> 00:20.250
And this new layer is going to be underneath our green layer.

00:20.670 --> 00:25.740
And then we're going to stick with our color white and then we want to grab a brush tool that has more

00:25.740 --> 00:27.070
of an interesting texture.

00:27.120 --> 00:32.940
So maybe a brush tool like this one right here.

00:33.040 --> 00:33.920
Maybe not that one.

00:33.960 --> 00:35.920
Maybe something like that might be interesting.

00:36.060 --> 00:36.870
See how that looks.

00:37.050 --> 00:38.340
That's pretty cool.

00:38.340 --> 00:38.570
All right.

00:38.580 --> 00:42.140
Let's bring a brush size down and what we're going to do is we're going to paint our symbol.

00:42.150 --> 00:47.010
So I think my symbol is just going to come straight down like here and you can play around with what

00:47.010 --> 00:48.490
type of symbol you want to do.

00:48.660 --> 00:56.710
There's no right or wrong symbol you can do whatever you need for your game.

00:56.750 --> 01:02.130
So just something like So then I might add a line going through like that and then maybe a spot like

01:02.130 --> 01:02.980
that.

01:03.120 --> 01:03.920
Cool.

01:04.020 --> 01:05.490
That's a pretty cool symbol.

01:05.490 --> 01:06.040
Next.

01:06.090 --> 01:08.780
Let's go ahead and add a glow to that symbol.

01:08.850 --> 01:11.440
So I'm going to add an effects to that.

01:11.490 --> 01:19.260
I'm going to come up to outer glow and then I'm going to change my color to this aqua blue and I'm going

01:19.260 --> 01:23.450
to get completely saturated then I'm going to hit OK.

01:24.090 --> 01:26.280
And then I can play around with my opacity.

01:26.400 --> 01:32.870
So I think I'll leave that at about 80 percent 77 percent.

01:33.300 --> 01:35.290
And then we can change our speed.

01:35.670 --> 01:39.420
So I'm going to bring that down all the way to zero percent because I don't want very much speed with

01:39.420 --> 01:41.730
that I want it to be pretty soft on the edges.

01:41.750 --> 01:43.810
You can also play around with the size.

01:44.370 --> 01:46.290
And I think I want it to be pretty small.

01:46.320 --> 01:51.750
So we get that really nice tight glow around it and then we can go ahead and hit.

01:51.840 --> 01:53.280
OK.

01:54.390 --> 01:59.030
And let's go ahead and shrink it down just a little bit so that we can see it better in the center.

02:00.030 --> 02:01.440
Then I'll recenter it.

02:01.590 --> 02:10.270
So and I think what actually looked better a little bit more over like this.

02:10.290 --> 02:12.420
Now let's go ahead and add some particles in there.

02:12.460 --> 02:18.670
So if I switch back over to my brush tool and I select a round brush like this one right here with a

02:18.670 --> 02:22.050
hard edge I can go at head and add in some particles in there.

02:22.090 --> 02:27.490
So I'm going to bring my bar size really small and I'm going to put my brush opacity at 40 percent and

02:27.490 --> 02:32.320
I'm just going to add a couple of little dots in there like so and these might just be small little

02:32.560 --> 02:36.750
magical Pardoe particles that are coming off of our symbol.

02:37.060 --> 02:40.660
And I can bring my bra size up and do it a couple of larger ones.

02:43.630 --> 02:49.950
Then I'm going to bring my brush opacity to 80 percent and I'll bring my brush size down and I'll add

02:49.950 --> 02:53.680
a couple of those and also I can paint in some larger ones too.

02:53.820 --> 02:58.320
Right along those edges that just makes it look a little bit more interesting.

02:58.320 --> 03:02.550
So if you ever have a close up of your button they'll have something really interesting to look at and

03:02.550 --> 03:05.540
they'll be a lot of detail in there.

03:05.550 --> 03:11.750
Now let's go ahead and create two more gems that we can put different objects in and change the colors.

03:11.760 --> 03:17.130
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to come up to image and then come down to canvas size and then

03:17.220 --> 03:20.410
I'm going to change the width to 300 pixels.

03:20.430 --> 03:22.490
So we're going to multiply that by three.

03:22.530 --> 03:24.490
So we can add two more in there.

03:24.870 --> 03:29.490
And I believe the high that 600 and then this little dot right here I want to bring this over to the

03:29.490 --> 03:30.400
left side.

03:30.420 --> 03:36.080
That way it adds it to my right side of my page and then my background color.

03:36.120 --> 03:40.440
I'm going to go ahead and click that little box and select this background color right here.

03:40.440 --> 03:43.790
So it creates that same background color all the way across.

03:44.030 --> 03:44.840
OK.

03:45.030 --> 03:46.080
And now we can go ahead and hit.

03:46.110 --> 03:47.070
OK.

03:47.580 --> 03:53.190
Now let's go ahead and take all of our layers and put them into a folder and then we're going to copy

03:53.190 --> 03:59.490
that folder to times then we're going to grab our first copy and we'll drag it over like so we want

03:59.490 --> 04:04.740
to drag that right into the center of our document and then we're going to grab one and drag that over

04:04.740 --> 04:05.350
like so.

04:05.370 --> 04:09.810
And we want to get that so that it's equally spaced out and you can tell because you'll get that little

04:09.840 --> 04:12.050
arrow in between each one.

04:12.070 --> 04:13.820
Now let's start with this middle one.

04:13.880 --> 04:19.140
I'm going to come back down to that layer and open up the folder and we can start off by changing the

04:19.140 --> 04:19.560
colors.

04:19.580 --> 04:25.140
So I'm going to come in to my color layer and I'm going to turn on my hue and saturation panel and now

04:25.140 --> 04:26.930
I can go ahead and play with that color.

04:27.120 --> 04:32.140
So I think this one I want it to be.

04:32.590 --> 04:34.790
Let's try it more of a green.

04:34.890 --> 04:43.170
So maybe about there and let's play with the lightness and darkness see what we can get out of that.

04:43.350 --> 04:44.690
I think about where it is good.

04:44.710 --> 04:45.670
So go ahead and hit.

04:45.690 --> 04:50.170
OK then we're going to come down to the layer that has our symbol on it and we're going to go ahead

04:50.200 --> 04:52.120
and delete that.

04:52.210 --> 04:55.740
Now let's go ahead and open up our potions file.

04:55.750 --> 05:01.120
So I already have Openreach here and I've already shrunken down my potion and I'm going to go ahead

05:01.150 --> 05:09.600
and copy that and paste it in where my original symbol used to be.

05:09.770 --> 05:11.220
And now I can put that potion in there like.

05:11.230 --> 05:18.250
So I enter and it's getting a really weird green tent because it's underneath the green layer.

05:18.250 --> 05:22.750
So what we can do is we can drag the above the green layer and will no longer have that problem but

05:22.750 --> 05:27.490
we'll still get that highlight over it so it will look like it's inside of the gem.

05:27.490 --> 05:29.070
Now let's do our last one.

05:29.350 --> 05:34.750
So I'm going to go ahead and close this folder and I'll open up my last folder and I'm going to come

05:34.750 --> 05:41.040
into my color layer and turn on the shoe and saturation panel and let's go ahead and play that color.

05:41.290 --> 05:44.140
So this one I think I want it to be a red.

05:44.200 --> 05:48.020
It's more of a purple so I'm going to bring it back a little bit to about there.

05:48.230 --> 05:50.620
You'd be a little bit more towards the orange side.

05:50.830 --> 05:52.190
I like the red side better.

05:52.480 --> 05:53.630
So will do right there.

05:53.890 --> 05:57.290
Let's also play with the lightness and darkness to see how we like that.

05:57.310 --> 06:02.290
So if I'm going to bring up the lightness I'm also going to want to bring up the saturation so I bring

06:02.290 --> 06:04.160
that to about there but I don't really like that.

06:04.180 --> 06:08.280
I'm going to leave all at zero and then I'm going to go ahead and hit.

06:08.290 --> 06:09.390
OK.

06:10.120 --> 06:16.030
Next let's go ahead and delete that symbol layer and then we're going to go ahead and open up our source

06:16.030 --> 06:22.870
document and we can go ahead and copy this paste it into here.

06:23.090 --> 06:24.710
Now shrink that down.

06:25.050 --> 06:25.590
So

06:31.550 --> 06:34.850
we can also rotate this and make it look a little bit more interesting.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.860
Go ahead hit enter and we can also add the effect back to the edge of her sword.

06:39.890 --> 06:46.640
So we're going to come down to effects come to our glow and let's go ahead and select the color we want.

06:46.640 --> 06:50.320
So I think I want more of a blue blues I come into my baby blues.

06:50.510 --> 06:51.560
OK.

06:51.890 --> 06:59.940
And maybe bring my opacity up to 100 percent and then maybe bring my size up a little bit larger but

06:59.940 --> 07:00.920
there will be good.

07:01.140 --> 07:02.110
OK.

07:02.310 --> 07:03.330
Great.

07:03.450 --> 07:07.590
Now we can also make our potion stand out a little bit more if we add a shadow behind it.

07:07.590 --> 07:11.260
Some of the clothes this folder open up that full there again.

07:11.340 --> 07:14.280
Come to my potion layer and add an effects to it.

07:14.280 --> 07:16.440
And I'm going to add a drop shadow.

07:16.710 --> 07:18.390
Let's see how that looks.

07:18.470 --> 07:18.770
All right.

07:18.780 --> 07:20.770
The way I have it set up right now looks good.

07:20.820 --> 07:22.680
We can play with the opacity a little bit.

07:22.710 --> 07:28.090
But I think where the opacity is good we can change the size but I'll leave it about where it is.

07:28.110 --> 07:30.370
So going to leave all my settings just like this.

07:30.630 --> 07:31.890
And it hit OK.

07:32.130 --> 07:37.490
And you see if we turn off that drop shadow that drop shadow makes it stand out a lot more.

07:37.530 --> 07:40.010
That brings us to the end of this project.

07:40.110 --> 07:42.750
I hope you enjoyed creating these GM buttons.

07:42.750 --> 07:46.160
Thanks for watching this lecture and I look forward to seeing you in the next one.
