00:00.750 --> 00:05.660
All right let's go ahead and create a semi truck now before we do that.

00:05.670 --> 00:09.350
We're going to select all of our layers that make up our tree.

00:10.140 --> 00:14.580
And then we're going to go ahead and put those into a folder then we're going to turn that off so it's

00:14.580 --> 00:15.740
out of our way.

00:16.160 --> 00:16.580
All right.

00:16.620 --> 00:20.340
So the first thing we want to do with our semi truck is build the body.

00:20.400 --> 00:25.500
So starting on my layer with my cube I'm going to go ahead and make a copy of that and then I'm going

00:25.500 --> 00:30.570
to take that copy and drag it over like so and I'm going to shrink it down.

00:35.360 --> 00:36.630
But there should be good.

00:37.040 --> 00:39.280
You can make it whatever size you like.

00:39.320 --> 00:41.240
I'm going to go ahead and hit enter.

00:41.240 --> 00:41.870
Perfect.

00:42.660 --> 00:47.730
Next we're going to make a copy of this letter and I will drag that over.

00:47.750 --> 00:50.450
We want it to be behind that box.

00:50.450 --> 00:54.050
And this is going to be the back part of our semi truck so this will be the front.

00:54.050 --> 00:55.250
This will be the back.

00:55.280 --> 01:01.850
Now we want this to be higher than the front part of our semi truck so we're going to put it about there

01:02.780 --> 01:08.320
then we're going to go ahead and make a copy of that and drag the underneath and move it back like.

01:08.330 --> 01:13.670
So this is going to be the back half of our semi truck with zoom in there and using our arrow keys on

01:13.670 --> 01:21.740
our keyboard we can go ahead and nudge that end up over till we get it lined up perfectly great next.

01:21.740 --> 01:26.600
What we want to do is we want to make the bottom part of our semi truck back.

01:26.720 --> 01:29.310
And this is where the wheels are going to be attached.

01:29.330 --> 01:35.600
So let's go ahead and merge these two cubes together I can select both those and merge.

01:35.600 --> 01:42.290
So now those are one layer and then I'm going to make a copy of that layer and drag it underneath.

01:43.040 --> 01:47.810
So now I have a second one underneath there with this layer what I'm going to do is I'm going to shrink

01:47.810 --> 01:49.830
it down using my Transform Tool.

01:50.060 --> 01:55.400
And as I shrink it I'm going to hold down shift and old to keep us from portions and to keep it centered.

01:55.670 --> 02:04.880
So shrink it down to about there enter and then I'm going to nudge that up using my arrow keys.

02:04.910 --> 02:08.660
So I'm up to about that point.

02:08.660 --> 02:09.490
Perfect.

02:09.500 --> 02:13.250
Next we're going to add in some detail on the front part of our truck.

02:13.370 --> 02:18.530
So let's zoom in there and what we're going to do is we're going to come down to this original cube

02:18.980 --> 02:22.600
make a copy of that layer and drag it out like so.

02:22.640 --> 02:28.780
And we want it to be at the very top of all our other one and then we're going to shrink that down using

02:28.780 --> 02:34.890
a Transform Tool and will shrink it down to about that size should be good.

02:34.930 --> 02:40.380
Maybe just the tiniest bit larger there might enter next.

02:40.390 --> 02:44.680
Let's go ahead and make a copy of that and we'll drag that over like so.

02:44.680 --> 02:50.470
Get it lined up and we want to pull it underneath that one that we want to get rid of that little gap

02:50.470 --> 02:51.780
in there.

02:51.790 --> 02:52.810
Great.

02:52.810 --> 02:54.960
Now let's make one more copy of that.

02:54.970 --> 02:56.300
So control J.

02:57.110 --> 03:04.550
Try and over get it lined up and then try to get underneath pushed into place with her.

03:04.550 --> 03:06.690
Eric he's perfect.

03:06.690 --> 03:10.270
Now let's go ahead and take all these layers and merge them together.

03:10.620 --> 03:13.060
So now that's all one layer.

03:13.320 --> 03:17.870
Next we want to center this along cube within this bigger cube.

03:17.910 --> 03:22.170
So right now we're a little off centered and you can tell because the distance between here and here

03:22.230 --> 03:24.540
and the distance between there and there is different.

03:24.540 --> 03:26.810
So we needed to go more this way.

03:26.850 --> 03:30.460
So I'm just going to take my arrow keys and I'll not do that over like so.

03:30.630 --> 03:33.840
But as I nudged over it's not really going to be moving diagonally.

03:33.930 --> 03:35.570
It's going to be moving horizontally.

03:35.580 --> 03:40.250
And so I need to also push up with my Archy's to get it back towards the back.

03:40.410 --> 03:47.520
So something like So should work then let's go ahead and make a copy of this letter and we'll go ahead

03:47.550 --> 03:48.810
and move that in.

03:48.940 --> 03:50.420
And we want this one to be in front.

03:50.490 --> 03:53.150
The way it is now than using my Transform Tool.

03:53.170 --> 03:59.030
I'll go ahead and shrink that down to a boat that size what enter.

03:59.340 --> 04:01.970
And then I'm going to move that over into a place like.

04:02.010 --> 04:06.200
So we want it to line up just like that.

04:06.360 --> 04:11.040
I'm going to go ahead and make a copy of that and drag it over to the other edge and then we need to

04:11.040 --> 04:13.220
drag that layer underneath.

04:13.380 --> 04:20.340
And if we want to make sure that this edge over here gets lined up perfect.

04:20.350 --> 04:25.570
All right so now we have the top piece of our semi truck next we want to add a side view mirror.

04:25.900 --> 04:31.540
So I'm going to go ahead and make a copy of this cube down here and then I'm going to go ahead and drag

04:31.540 --> 04:35.780
that out like so and then I get to shrink that down.

04:35.780 --> 04:41.570
So we want it to be pretty small somewhere around this size.

04:41.670 --> 04:47.390
We're going to put it about in the middle of our cube on this side.

04:47.610 --> 04:49.260
So somewhere about there should be good.

04:49.380 --> 04:53.740
Then let's go ahead and make another copy of this and we're going to drag it over.

04:54.740 --> 04:58.540
So and then we can merge those two layers together.

05:01.590 --> 05:03.640
So novels are one layer.

05:03.930 --> 05:07.930
Lastly we want to go ahead and add the wheels in on our semi truck.

05:08.130 --> 05:12.580
So before we do that I'm going to nudge this whole thing down just a little bit more.

05:12.780 --> 05:19.290
So I'm going to select all of my layers and then I'm going to use my arrow keys to push it down just

05:19.290 --> 05:23.720
like so I want it to be a little bit closer so the wheels can touch the ground more easily.

05:24.030 --> 05:28.990
Then I'm also going to push this back part of the semi truck a little bit closer towards this cube.

05:29.190 --> 05:34.770
So I'm going to select everything that's a part of that back part of the semi truck.

05:34.940 --> 05:41.370
So both those and I'm moving both in like so a little bit more down because we want to make sure that

05:41.370 --> 05:45.360
this bottom part of my truck in this bottom part line up.

05:45.360 --> 05:47.570
Now let's go ahead and add in those wheels.

05:47.580 --> 05:51.110
So there's going to be one wheel on the front part and two wheels on his back part.

05:51.330 --> 05:54.810
So don't come down to my cube make a copy.

05:54.990 --> 05:56.370
Drag that out.

05:56.520 --> 06:01.640
And we want to shrink this damn pretty dang small.

06:01.650 --> 06:04.790
So somewhere around there that will be about the size of our tire.

06:05.160 --> 06:10.010
And then we want the bottom of our tired to line up with this horizontal line right here.

06:10.310 --> 06:13.080
So let's go ahead and enter and get that wind up.

06:14.400 --> 06:15.530
Great.

06:15.540 --> 06:19.940
Now let's go ahead and copy the Slayer move it over like.

06:19.940 --> 06:25.280
So I want to try to get the same distance between here and here as there is over here.

06:25.280 --> 06:27.920
So right about there looks good next.

06:27.950 --> 06:32.660
Let's go ahead and use our arrow keys to push that up so it lines up but this diagonal line.

06:33.110 --> 06:36.960
And then let's go ahead and make one last copy of the Slayer.

06:37.020 --> 06:39.370
I'm going to drag it over here like so.

06:39.700 --> 06:43.780
We want it to be a little bit towards the back.

06:44.040 --> 06:45.450
So there should be good.

06:45.740 --> 06:46.580
Perfect.

06:46.580 --> 06:49.930
Now we want to merge these shapes together so they're all one shape.

06:49.940 --> 06:54.830
So with this guy that we just place we're going to go ahead and drag this small cube We just placed

06:54.910 --> 06:59.610
up towards our main body piece and we'll select both those and merge them together.

06:59.610 --> 07:01.330
So now those are one layer.

07:01.400 --> 07:04.800
Now we have a cube turned on back here that we're using to copy from.

07:04.800 --> 07:07.120
So I'm going to turn that off so you can see what I'm doing.

07:07.130 --> 07:10.220
So now that's all one layer right there.

07:10.220 --> 07:15.860
Next we need to merge the bottom part of our Samite back part of the semi-truck with the wheels.

07:15.860 --> 07:20.660
So I'm going to go ahead and select all those layers and merge them and we can turn that off and you'll

07:20.660 --> 07:22.600
see that's all one layer now.

07:22.910 --> 07:27.980
Now lastly what we want to do is we want to add in our shadows so we're going to have a cast shadow

07:27.980 --> 07:32.590
on this bottom part right here from the top part of our semi truck and we're also going to have a cast

07:32.600 --> 07:34.090
shadow on the ground.

07:34.310 --> 07:36.280
So let's go ahead and create those.

07:36.470 --> 07:39.640
So first let's create the cast shadow from our semi truck.

07:39.890 --> 07:45.440
So I'm going to go ahead and select the shape of that layer then I'm going to add a new layer underneath

07:45.440 --> 07:49.670
it and fill it in with the color black.

07:50.060 --> 07:56.070
Next let's go ahead and nudge that down using our arrow keys so nudge it down to about there.

07:56.210 --> 08:00.910
Now a good thing to make note about is that this corner here doesn't line up with that one.

08:01.070 --> 08:05.160
But when the shadows being cast on it it needs to line up with this bottom corner.

08:05.300 --> 08:10.340
So I'm going to go ahead and grab it and move it over so that corner lines up with the bottom corner.

08:10.550 --> 08:15.470
And now we can go ahead and right click our layer and convert it into a clipping mask so it gets clipped

08:15.470 --> 08:22.050
off over here and then will bring down our opacity to 25 percent perfect.

08:22.070 --> 08:27.920
Now there should be cast shadows on these wheels but because they're going to be solid black you won't

08:27.920 --> 08:31.180
see them anyways so we're not going to worry about them next.

08:31.190 --> 08:35.560
Let's add that cash on the ground being cast from the entire truck.

08:35.780 --> 08:41.150
So what I'm going to do is on the come down below all my layers and add a new layer then using my lasso

08:41.220 --> 08:45.590
to go ahead and draw a shape straight down from this line.

08:45.830 --> 08:50.750
So and this is just to make sure that I'm completely lined up and on the ground.

08:50.780 --> 08:56.660
So I want to be straight down from there when I'm to come all the way down to here you know come all

08:56.660 --> 09:01.070
the way up to here and just guesstimating about where that's coming down from.

09:01.430 --> 09:08.390
Click there and then come straight up like so then we can reconnect that and then we're going to fill

09:08.390 --> 09:11.680
that in with the color black.

09:12.100 --> 09:14.850
Now this is incorrect over here and over here.

09:14.860 --> 09:16.480
So now we're going to fix that.

09:16.510 --> 09:21.120
The only reason why we went straight up like I said is to line up with where the truck is.

09:21.190 --> 09:26.140
Now we can go ahead and click from that corner come all the way back and we're trying to stay in line

09:26.200 --> 09:29.240
with this line or here or Also if any of these lines.

09:29.260 --> 09:36.370
So we just want to make sure that we're in line with those and can go ahead and click and we'll click

09:36.370 --> 09:39.560
around like this and that will delete.

09:39.910 --> 09:44.200
Let's do the same thing over here so we'll click there and trying to say lined up with this line right

09:44.200 --> 09:48.570
here or with that line right there just eyeballing it.

09:49.040 --> 09:55.750
So probably about there and then we can go ahead and connect that and delete perfect.

09:55.770 --> 09:57.360
Now we have the ground shadow.

09:57.390 --> 09:59.700
Let's go ahead and turn the opacity down.

09:59.700 --> 10:04.890
Now like I said before the ground shadow is actually going to be darker than other shadows because the

10:04.890 --> 10:11.460
truck is so close to the ground so we're going to leave it at 50 percent.

10:11.460 --> 10:12.050
All right.

10:12.150 --> 10:14.270
That brings us to the end of this lecture.

10:14.340 --> 10:18.810
So in this lecture you learn how to build an entire semi truck out of cubes.

10:18.930 --> 10:22.750
And then we were able to add the shadows and the ground shadow to that.

10:23.190 --> 10:26.200
Thanks for watching and I look forward to seeing you in the next lecture.

10:26.280 --> 10:27.990
We're going to be coloring this truck.
