00:00.850 --> 00:06.730
Parent in this lecture we're going to go ahead and add in these light refractions onto a bottle.

00:06.730 --> 00:11.290
So if we look at a reference over here you see this blue and dark gray area on the bottle.

00:11.460 --> 00:16.240
What that is is that's a light being refracted into the glass and around the bottle.

00:16.240 --> 00:18.700
So let's go ahead and paint that in first.

00:18.730 --> 00:24.250
We want to add a new layer that's underneath our highlight layer but above our liquid contents layer

00:24.670 --> 00:29.780
so the layer we're on right now has that shadow and that's the very top layer of our liquid contents.

00:29.800 --> 00:31.790
And the next one is our glass highlight.

00:31.810 --> 00:34.450
So we're going to add a layer right in between those.

00:34.450 --> 00:38.220
Next we're going to go ahead and select this blue in here.

00:39.310 --> 00:40.770
That's its color right there.

00:40.810 --> 00:45.880
So it's almost an aqua green then we're going to go ahead and start painting in.

00:45.970 --> 00:51.760
So using my brush with a soft edge and bringing my brush opacity down to about 2 percent we're going

00:51.760 --> 00:57.780
to go ahead and start painting in any areas that we see now should be blue and you're going to have

00:57.840 --> 01:03.630
this blue area anywhere where the glass is really close to each other and you can see the glass on the

01:03.630 --> 01:04.230
other side.

01:04.230 --> 01:10.530
So for example right here when you look at this glass the glass on the other side of it is really close

01:10.530 --> 01:11.050
to it.

01:11.130 --> 01:13.890
And so it's going to create that blueness seam with over here.

01:13.980 --> 01:18.990
But you're seeing the blue part because there's also glass as curves around right on the other side.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.090
So you're seeing two layers of glass and that's what's creating the blue.

01:23.360 --> 01:24.900
Go ahead and keep filling us and

01:54.160 --> 01:54.690
great.

01:54.710 --> 02:00.350
So once we have our soft layer in now we can go ahead and shrink our brushes down a little bit more

02:00.650 --> 02:04.020
and bring a brush opacity up to 4 percent.

02:04.040 --> 02:07.520
We can go ahead and really start adding that in.

02:07.630 --> 02:10.440
And I always remember you can always take away and add more.

02:10.460 --> 02:13.600
So don't be too worried about messing things up.

02:27.630 --> 02:30.600
So here's a really good example of where I went a little too much.

02:30.630 --> 02:32.660
Over here there's not really much blue.

02:32.670 --> 03:03.690
So I can go ahead and take my race tool and erase got away.

03:03.780 --> 03:04.270
All right.

03:04.290 --> 03:09.150
Next we're going to go ahead and grab a little bit lighter version of this so we'll come up like so

03:09.330 --> 03:12.840
I'm going to come a little bit more towards my blues the summer of out there.

03:13.080 --> 03:17.130
We're going to go ahead and add a little bit of this and just make it a little bit more interesting

03:17.130 --> 03:18.840
so it's not just one color blue

03:22.960 --> 03:25.980
I'll bring my brush opacity down back to 20 percent

04:02.280 --> 04:04.620
now I'm kind of losing my curve right here.

04:04.620 --> 04:09.240
Someone to go ahead and switch over to my race tool again and go ahead and erase a little bit of that

04:09.240 --> 04:16.750
away until I start to introduce that curve back in.

04:16.960 --> 04:21.220
And I also want to thin it out a little bit starting to get to wide and I want it to be thinner

04:45.490 --> 04:49.600
great now I want to introduce a little bit darker of a color.

04:49.870 --> 04:52.860
So you see in here we got a little bit more darker of a blue.

04:52.900 --> 04:57.820
So I'm going to select this color down here and then I'm going to darken that so bring that down to

04:57.820 --> 05:02.310
about there using my brush to I'm going to go ahead and start painting that darker color.

05:05.540 --> 05:23.530
I'm still at 20 percent opacity so I can really start layering this in.

05:23.850 --> 05:25.700
Now that's still not dark enough for me.

05:25.710 --> 05:30.810
So I'm going to go ahead and select an even darker version of that paint a little bit of that in

05:34.690 --> 05:37.950
going to add a little bit of this on this edge also.

05:41.600 --> 05:43.810
So and then a little bit over here to

05:48.960 --> 05:53.160
now I'm noticing up here at the top of my bottle it's a little bit more blue than Aqua.

05:53.190 --> 05:59.340
So I'm going to go ahead and select my mid color and then I'm going to select a more blue version of

05:59.340 --> 06:05.310
that so I'll come up to about there and maybe make it a little bit more saturated and then I can go

06:05.310 --> 06:06.730
ahead and start painting Adam

06:18.400 --> 06:22.470
now I'm noticing that down here at the bottom we're kind of losing this edge on our bottle.

06:22.490 --> 06:26.870
So I'm going to switch back up to my highlight layer and then using my race tool.

06:26.860 --> 06:36.870
I'm going to go ahead and sort of erase that back in.

06:36.940 --> 06:41.870
And lastly I want to introduce a little bit more of an aqua color down here.

06:42.130 --> 06:47.800
So I want to switch back down to my blue layer and then I'm going to grab more of an aqua color and

06:47.800 --> 06:50.040
I want it to be pretty saturated and pretty bright.

06:50.050 --> 06:51.550
So probably about there.

06:51.850 --> 06:57.940
And I'm going to go ahead and paint that in in this area like so not just introduces a little bit more

06:57.940 --> 07:00.190
of an interesting color in there.

07:00.190 --> 07:03.370
I'm also noticing along the bottom of this edge of our stand.

07:03.470 --> 07:08.170
It's there's not really any highlight so I'm going to come back up to my highlight layer and using my

07:08.170 --> 07:15.010
raise to I'll go ahead in a raceway this bottom area and expose the dark area

07:29.060 --> 07:29.380
now.

07:29.420 --> 07:35.600
Lastly we want to add a nice white haze to our bottle because when you look at glass it tends to make

07:35.600 --> 07:37.880
things a little bit lighter when you look through them.

07:37.880 --> 07:42.530
And in areas like this right here and this right here it's going to be completely transparent which

07:42.530 --> 07:43.880
will be unnatural.

07:43.910 --> 07:49.390
So let's go ahead and add a new layer and we're going to add this below our blue layer.

07:49.670 --> 07:52.770
So that way our white haze doesn't cover any of this blue.

07:52.840 --> 07:55.230
We want it to cover this transparent area.

07:55.250 --> 07:58.160
And also some of this yellow liquid.

07:58.370 --> 08:03.110
So we're going to go ahead and select our bottle shape and then we're going to fill that in with the

08:03.110 --> 08:04.820
color white.

08:04.880 --> 08:08.100
Next we're going to go ahead and bring that opacity down.

08:08.150 --> 08:13.200
We're going to bring it down really low probably to about five percent.

08:13.220 --> 08:13.860
Perfect.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.860
So now that just adds that extra haze.

08:15.860 --> 08:19.340
So if I turn that layer off you see there's a tiny little difference.

08:19.580 --> 08:25.070
Now lastly what I want to do is I want to add a new layer above this and using my brush tool and making

08:25.070 --> 08:27.140
sure I'm on a soft edged brush.

08:27.140 --> 08:29.750
I'm going to bring that brush size up quite a bit.

08:29.780 --> 08:33.870
I'm going to add one big highlight right here like so.

08:34.070 --> 08:38.520
And I have my brush opacity down to 20 percent so it just barely adds it in.

08:38.990 --> 08:39.500
All right.

08:39.500 --> 08:41.690
That brings us to the end of this lecture.

08:41.720 --> 08:44.770
So in this lecture you learn how to add this blue area in.

08:44.840 --> 08:47.110
That makes your glass look a lot more realistic.

08:47.210 --> 08:52.190
And all it is is it's just a fraction of the image and that's coming from behind it and it's traveling

08:52.190 --> 08:54.850
through the glass and coming out the other side.

08:55.220 --> 08:56.050
Thanks for watching.

08:56.060 --> 08:58.210
And I look forward to seeing you in the next lecture.
