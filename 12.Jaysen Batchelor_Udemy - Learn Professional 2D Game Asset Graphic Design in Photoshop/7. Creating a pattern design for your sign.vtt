00:00.450 --> 00:07.140
All right we're going to add a cool zigzag design to the top and the bottom of our wood piece.

00:07.260 --> 00:09.850
So we need to create a new document first.

00:09.870 --> 00:13.920
So we're going to go new and or document is going to be pretty small.

00:13.920 --> 00:23.340
So let's start off with 400 by 100 pixels and if we need to go smaller we can.

00:23.520 --> 00:28.560
So the first thing we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and grab our Lasso tool and we're going

00:28.560 --> 00:32.340
to go ahead and click here and click down here.

00:32.340 --> 00:34.940
Click here and click down.

00:34.970 --> 00:39.100
We're just going to create a simple zigzag effect.

00:40.630 --> 00:42.680
And once we get over here we don't have enough room.

00:42.690 --> 00:47.460
So what we're going to do is we're just going to end it there and come all the way back and connect

00:47.460 --> 00:48.870
it.

00:48.970 --> 00:51.530
Next we're going to go ahead and fill that in with white.

00:51.580 --> 00:54.660
But make sure you're on a new layer.

00:54.880 --> 00:56.050
Fill that in.

00:56.990 --> 01:01.670
Now we can go ahead and turn this background off because we don't really need to see it.

01:01.770 --> 01:05.000
And then we're going to use our crop tool to crop our document over.

01:05.030 --> 01:09.080
So it comes right to the edge of our third point.

01:09.080 --> 01:09.860
Great.

01:09.860 --> 01:13.100
Next what we want to do is we want to shrink this down just a bit.

01:13.100 --> 01:14.840
Somebody is my Transform Tool.

01:14.910 --> 01:17.620
I'm going to push it up like so.

01:17.740 --> 01:21.350
The reason for that is because behind it we're going to add some green painting.

01:21.520 --> 01:27.550
So I'm going to add in a new layer and then using my paint brush and I'm going to switch over to a more

01:27.550 --> 01:28.840
text Risebrough.

01:29.210 --> 01:34.690
Now I'm not using any brushes are not included with Photoshop so search through these till you find

01:34.690 --> 01:38.680
one you like the one I'm using here is labeled number 24.

01:38.680 --> 01:43.480
I'm going to go ahead and paint with that then I'm going to switch over to a green color so don't come

01:43.480 --> 01:46.950
into my greens a little bit more towards the aquatic side.

01:47.260 --> 01:50.830
And I want it to be somewhat exaggerated but not to be saturated.

01:50.830 --> 01:54.510
So somewhere in here should be good maybe a little bit more saturated.

01:54.670 --> 01:57.410
And then we can go ahead and paint in those edges.

02:00.050 --> 02:11.930
Like so and we want them to look hand-painted that's why we're painting them with this brush right here.

02:12.180 --> 02:15.080
Now these are going to match up with each other on both sides.

02:15.090 --> 02:21.120
When we paint in our patterns we want to make sure that they're relatively similar in width so that

02:21.120 --> 02:22.690
should be a lot closer.

02:22.710 --> 02:28.860
Next we're going to go ahead and select the shape of our zigzag are going to go ahead and push this

02:28.920 --> 02:29.940
selection back.

02:29.970 --> 02:31.470
So we're not pushing that image back.

02:31.470 --> 02:33.710
We're just pushing the selection back.

02:33.890 --> 02:35.700
So too about there should be good.

02:35.890 --> 02:38.360
Then we're going to go ahead and hit delete.

02:38.940 --> 02:41.300
Then we're going to go ahead and duplicate this layer.

02:41.310 --> 02:43.650
Make sure you unselect out of your selection.

02:43.740 --> 02:46.900
Otherwise it's not going to select everything with a duplicate.

02:47.190 --> 02:53.930
So go ahead and duplicate that then we're going to grab this new one and pull it back to about there.

02:54.340 --> 02:55.410
Great.

02:55.440 --> 02:58.340
Now everything that's green on this side we don't want.

02:58.380 --> 03:01.880
So we're going to come back down to our green layer and using our research tool.

03:01.950 --> 03:09.180
We're going to go ahead and erase by hand all of that area that's coming off the wrong side.

03:14.880 --> 03:20.480
Now the last thing we want to do is we want to add a small dot into each one of these triangles so one

03:20.530 --> 03:22.430
to switch over to a yellow color.

03:22.440 --> 03:25.220
So I'm the coming of my yellow's somewhere in there should be good.

03:25.410 --> 03:28.530
Little bit brighter but there should be good.

03:28.920 --> 03:33.270
Then I'm going to go ahead and paint that and using my brush tool and I can stay on this rough brush

03:33.270 --> 03:38.180
if I like or I can switch over to a different brush doesn't really matter.

03:38.250 --> 03:44.440
Now the last thing we want to do is we want to change the color of this inner spike right here.

03:44.520 --> 03:49.830
And the way we'll do that is by coming up to that layer and then we're going to add a new layer above

03:49.830 --> 03:56.160
it change it into a clipping mask and then we can fill that whole layer in with an orange color.

03:56.190 --> 04:01.140
When it comes into our oranges and come pretty saturated to about there.

04:01.230 --> 04:01.930
OK.

04:02.220 --> 04:03.170
And we'll fill that in.

04:03.210 --> 04:06.040
And that changes that to orange.

04:06.120 --> 04:09.920
Now we can go ahead and merge all of these layers together.

04:11.790 --> 04:14.830
And then we're going to go ahead and select it with our marquee tool.

04:14.830 --> 04:21.480
Make sure you're on your rectangular one that will copy and paste it into our document to see what size

04:21.480 --> 04:22.250
it is.

04:22.620 --> 04:23.990
A little bit too large.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.050
So what we're going to do is we're going to shrink it down by about half.

04:28.050 --> 04:34.430
So when you come back in here and then I'm going to come up to image come down to image size select

04:34.440 --> 04:37.110
that and now I can shrink this down.

04:37.110 --> 04:43.520
Now if I had this little chain link right there this is going to help it shrink down and keep its portions.

04:43.770 --> 04:45.290
So I'm going to cut this in half.

04:45.300 --> 04:50.530
So that's 150 plus ten is 160.

04:50.880 --> 04:51.420
Great.

04:51.570 --> 04:52.310
OK.

04:52.530 --> 04:58.530
So now that the shrink that down for us next what we want to do is we want to save this out as a pattern.

04:58.800 --> 05:04.870
So what we're going to do is we're going to come up to it and then come down to define pattern I'm going

05:04.870 --> 05:08.100
to call this zig.

05:08.240 --> 05:09.040
OK.

05:09.380 --> 05:15.290
And now that saved out as a pattern that we can fill areas in with show you what I mean right now.

05:15.620 --> 05:20.930
So let's go ahead and delete this letter and then we're going to add a new layer above this.

05:21.260 --> 05:25.950
And on this new layer I'm going to go ahead and make a rectangular selection like so.

05:26.270 --> 05:30.020
And then I'm to come to my fill tool and up here where it says foreground.

05:30.020 --> 05:33.540
We're going to click on that and change it to pattern and I'll.

05:33.590 --> 05:38.120
Here we get another menu and we can click on that and we have all these different patterns we can choose

05:38.120 --> 05:38.690
from.

05:38.720 --> 05:41.120
Now right over here that's the pattern we just created.

05:41.120 --> 05:47.090
So let's go ahead and select that then we can go ahead and fill in this area and you see it really quickly

05:47.090 --> 05:52.880
fills in that area with our exact pattern and it duplicates it over and over again so we don't have

05:52.880 --> 05:54.690
to do it next.

05:54.710 --> 05:59.420
Let's go ahead and take our marquee tool and what we want to do is we want to slide right up to the

05:59.420 --> 06:07.430
bottom of one of these like so the Leite and then we're going to select right up to the top of it.

06:07.520 --> 06:11.150
So about their number hit delete again.

06:11.660 --> 06:12.880
Perfect.

06:12.890 --> 06:14.400
So now we have a little pattern.

06:14.660 --> 06:18.150
Let's go ahead and place that on the top of our board.

06:19.040 --> 06:22.450
We can nudge it down if we have to.

06:22.470 --> 06:29.730
Now let's go ahead and duplicate this where we can drag this one down like so transform tool and flip

06:29.730 --> 06:32.570
it vertical awesome.

06:32.610 --> 06:34.090
I would say Enter now.

06:34.100 --> 06:37.830
You'll notice that it's not lining up perfectly down here at the bottom.

06:37.850 --> 06:44.270
So what we can do is turn on our transformed tool and we can rotate that until it fits with that right

06:44.270 --> 06:45.050
angle.

06:45.080 --> 06:47.420
Will drag it into place.

06:47.510 --> 06:48.280
Awesome.

06:48.560 --> 06:49.900
Enter next.

06:49.910 --> 06:54.620
Let's go ahead and merge these two layers together and then using my arrays too.

06:54.650 --> 06:59.180
I'm going to go ahead and start erasing some of these aerial ways like this area that's hanging over

06:59.240 --> 07:00.180
our divot.

07:00.200 --> 07:04.130
We don't want that there Biloela or face that.

07:04.210 --> 07:06.640
And same with up here.

07:06.640 --> 07:10.480
So we're going to go ahead and you racist area that's hanging over the edge.

07:10.480 --> 07:11.710
Perfect.

07:11.740 --> 07:16.620
Now in these areas we can go ahead and large the size of our brush to quickly erase it away.

07:18.050 --> 07:29.030
Smith with over here and lastly over here and right here right next let's go ahead and bring down the

07:29.030 --> 07:29.750
opacity.

07:29.750 --> 07:34.100
Just the tiniest bit about there should be good.

07:34.130 --> 07:40.140
And the reason why we're doing that is so you can just barely see the wood texture and grain through

07:40.140 --> 07:41.210
our paint.

07:41.610 --> 07:43.300
Awesome bright.

07:43.320 --> 07:45.470
That brings us to the end of this lecture.

07:45.660 --> 07:50.220
So in this lecture you learn how to create a really cool pattern in Photoshop and how to make it look

07:50.220 --> 07:52.290
like it's hand-painted with a paintbrush.

07:52.470 --> 07:57.600
Then you also learn how you can create a small pattern and then have Photoshop duplicate it for you

07:57.690 --> 08:00.860
so you don't have to duplicate it over and over yourself.

08:01.290 --> 08:04.830
Thanks for watching this lecture and I look forward to seeing you in the next one.
