00:00.650 --> 00:05.630
In this lecture we're going to go ahead and treat some really cool or neat ironwork on our book.

00:05.640 --> 00:10.460
So we're going to create sort of some latches over here on our binding and we're going to add a gemman

00:10.460 --> 00:11.560
to the center.

00:11.610 --> 00:13.440
So let's go ahead and get started.

00:13.440 --> 00:16.580
First off I'm going to add a new layer above all of my layers.

00:16.770 --> 00:20.790
And on this layer I'm going to paint in the shape for one of my latches.

00:20.790 --> 00:26.040
Now I want to start off with a pretty dark gray color so I'm thinking somewhere right about there I'll

00:26.040 --> 00:27.920
hit OK then using my brush too.

00:27.930 --> 00:31.410
I'm going to go ahead and just start painting in the shape of my latch.

00:31.460 --> 00:36.180
I'm going to bring my brush size down quite a bit and I'm just going to start painting in the shape

00:36.300 --> 00:38.050
of my latches.

00:38.160 --> 00:42.680
So I want to create a curved line right along the spine just like this.

00:42.980 --> 00:47.990
And these don't have to be perfect because these have been baned out of iron by a blacksmith.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.970
And so there's going to be some imperfections in it.

00:51.300 --> 00:57.510
So then the come across over to here to about that distance and then I'm going to add another curved

00:57.510 --> 01:00.120
line over here.

01:00.120 --> 01:03.330
So there's part of our latch on the spine of our book.

01:03.330 --> 01:05.500
Now we want to do the latch on the top surface.

01:05.520 --> 01:11.450
So I'm going to create two lines that are coming in towards each other like this.

01:11.640 --> 01:14.650
And then I want to have the line that connects these two together.

01:14.790 --> 01:19.500
That needs to be at the same angle as this line and this line and all the lines that are going in that

01:19.500 --> 01:21.240
direction on our book.

01:21.240 --> 01:23.240
So we don't want these to be straight like this.

01:23.250 --> 01:27.070
We want to make sure that this line ends a little bit sooner than this one.

01:27.360 --> 01:31.950
And then we're going to go ahead and add in a little bit more detail in here so when to add in one circuitry

01:32.040 --> 01:37.350
here and then I'll add in a second circuitry here and just the same we want the circles to connect at

01:37.350 --> 01:41.200
this diagonal line and not a straight up and down the line.

01:41.220 --> 01:46.110
And then lastly I'm going to go ahead and add in a third circle right here and I'm going to go ahead

01:46.140 --> 01:49.100
and add and a little bit of a point to that circle.

01:49.800 --> 01:52.290
Now go ahead and fill this all in.

01:52.530 --> 01:56.680
And you can go ahead and start adding in more detail to make this look more realistic.

02:07.270 --> 02:11.680
Once you have your shape completely filled then you can go in there with your eraser tool and you can

02:11.680 --> 02:16.480
go ahead and erase away some of the areas that you don't want to help shape your shape out a little

02:16.480 --> 02:17.110
bit more.

02:17.110 --> 02:21.290
So for example I might make that edge a little bit harder.

02:21.320 --> 02:25.180
I'm going to make sure I'm on a hard edged brush when I do this because I don't want a soft edge on

02:25.180 --> 02:26.720
these Eraste ones.

02:30.300 --> 02:31.800
All right great.

02:31.800 --> 02:36.530
Next what we want to do is we want to go ahead and add some shadow to this because even though it's

02:36.530 --> 02:38.760
some metal they're still going to be some shadow.

02:38.880 --> 02:43.110
So going to go ahead and add a new layer above this create clipping layer mask by holding know older

02:43.110 --> 02:45.710
option hovering between the two and then cooking.

02:46.200 --> 02:53.340
And then I'm going to go ahead and select a black color I'm putting my brush at 20 percent opacity on

02:53.340 --> 02:55.640
the go ahead or painting in my shadow.

02:55.740 --> 02:59.630
So I'm just going to slowly layer this up until I get it looking the way I want it.

02:59.940 --> 03:05.070
So I'm going to add another layer now and I might come a little bit further back than my last layer

03:05.070 --> 03:09.360
so I get a nice soft edge between my lighter color and my darker color.

03:09.380 --> 03:11.990
And then I add a little bit more shadow down here at the bottom.

03:12.130 --> 03:17.160
Then I'm to bring my brush opacity down to 20 percent so that it's even softer now.

03:17.340 --> 03:20.790
I'm just going to soften all of these together.

03:20.790 --> 03:21.150
All right.

03:21.180 --> 03:22.230
Great.

03:22.230 --> 03:26.480
Next you don't want to do is I want to add a shadow edge along the bottom edge of my shape.

03:26.750 --> 03:31.530
So using my brush once again and bringing my brush capacity up to 30 percent I'm going to go ahead and

03:31.530 --> 03:33.540
just paint right along the bottom edge

03:37.200 --> 03:42.570
just so it looks a little bit more three dimensional because it has a nice shadow edge now.

03:43.630 --> 03:44.600
Great.

03:44.630 --> 03:45.450
It's going to zoom out.

03:45.450 --> 03:48.140
See how that looks awesome.

03:48.360 --> 03:51.540
Next you don't want to do is I'm noticing that is a little bit darker here in the middle.

03:51.540 --> 03:55.670
So what I'll do is I want to go ahead and select this dark gray color right here.

03:55.890 --> 04:00.390
Then using my Burstall and coming up to 100 percent opacity I'm going to go ahead and paint right over

04:00.390 --> 04:04.730
the top of that to help blend that in just a little bit more.

04:06.270 --> 04:06.910
Great.

04:06.930 --> 04:12.960
Now we can go ahead and start adding in some of our neat detail so I'm going to go ahead and add new

04:12.960 --> 04:15.880
layer turn that layer into a layer mask.

04:16.320 --> 04:19.240
And this is the layer I'm going to paint all of that detail on.

04:19.380 --> 04:24.840
So what I want to do is I first want to grab this light gray color right here and then I'm going to

04:24.840 --> 04:29.100
use my brush tool and I'm going to paint in some design on this part right here.

04:29.130 --> 04:32.790
And then when we get up to here we're going to switch to a lighter gray.

04:32.930 --> 04:37.650
So bring my virtualise down because since this is at an angle all of the design here is going to be

04:37.650 --> 04:39.270
pretty squished.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.840
So it's going to come up like this.

04:42.090 --> 04:47.990
And I'm just going to start painting in almost some random shapes and year.

04:48.000 --> 04:53.570
Now obviously you want them to have some good design but I don't really have any of this planned out.

04:53.580 --> 04:59.370
If you wanted to you could paint this out flat and then work it with the Transform Tool so it fit onto

04:59.370 --> 05:01.740
the perspective of this part.

05:02.010 --> 05:06.450
But in this case I'm just going to paint it on by hand because I think it will look better that way

05:06.480 --> 05:08.530
and that will be much quicker.

05:08.700 --> 05:13.800
So we can go ahead and add in some things like some swirls sometimes broken down like this and another

05:13.800 --> 05:18.520
one here might have some more up here.

05:21.570 --> 05:24.850
And we might have a dot there maybe some lines.

05:24.860 --> 05:27.410
Want to do the same thing on the other side so it's symmetrical

05:34.820 --> 05:36.020
are great.

05:36.030 --> 05:38.530
Now let's go ahead and move up to this top part.

05:38.640 --> 05:42.920
So I'm going to go ahead and select a lighter version of this color.

05:43.060 --> 05:44.910
So somewhere about there should do.

05:45.030 --> 05:45.870
OK.

05:45.940 --> 05:50.740
I'm going to go ahead and continue this or any design across here.

05:50.820 --> 05:56.520
So we're going to come all the way up and here in this area we're going to get sort of a clover type

05:56.520 --> 06:03.430
of design.

06:04.450 --> 06:11.480
And you'll notice that my design isn't perfect it's not completely symmetrical it's not completely perfect.

06:11.560 --> 06:16.320
And the reason for that is because this is handcrafted by blacksmith and so it's not going to look perfect.

06:16.330 --> 06:19.870
So it's all right if it's not you want it to look handmade.

06:19.930 --> 06:20.800
At least I do.

06:20.800 --> 06:24.120
So that's why I'm ok with it looking this way.

06:27.920 --> 06:31.900
I'm going to go ahead and add some circles in on these edges.

06:38.780 --> 06:42.850
Know go ahead and paint around these edges.

06:42.980 --> 06:44.930
We don't want to go over that shadow edge.

06:44.930 --> 06:50.150
We want to make sure that we stay right along those edges or in some circles in here also.

06:50.480 --> 06:54.900
And we'll even add in sort of some flower designs within each one of these petals.

06:58.030 --> 07:05.700
Then go ahead and atavism some circles on this part and maybe add in a circle and here it's going to

07:05.700 --> 07:07.170
zoom out and see how that looks.

07:07.170 --> 07:07.480
All right.

07:07.500 --> 07:07.950
Great.

07:07.980 --> 07:11.280
So now we have our design but it's not really looking like metal.

07:11.280 --> 07:15.370
The reason for this is because it doesn't really have any highlights or reflections on it.

07:15.600 --> 07:18.070
So let's go ahead and add some of those in right now.

07:18.300 --> 07:21.000
So we'll go ahead and hold down control or command if you're on a Mac.

07:21.050 --> 07:26.310
I'm going to let the sheep of everything on that layer that I'm go ahead and zoom in there and starting

07:26.310 --> 07:26.910
with this lighter.

07:26.910 --> 07:27.320
Great.

07:27.330 --> 07:31.350
I'm going to grab an even later race so I'm going to grab a gray that's right about there maybe even

07:31.350 --> 07:37.110
brighter than that and we'll paint at a lower opacity so we can layer up the reflection in my brush

07:37.110 --> 07:40.700
too and bring up the brush size to quite a large size.

07:40.710 --> 07:45.900
I want to paint at 20 percent opacity and I'm just going to go ahead and paint a line across it like

07:45.900 --> 07:50.990
so then I'll paint another one that's a little bit wider and I'm just going to do that a few times.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.490
So we get a nice highlight going through there.

07:52.500 --> 07:55.120
I might even do a little bit of that over here on this tip.

07:57.190 --> 07:59.200
And then down here we want to do the same thing.

07:59.230 --> 08:06.040
So I'm going to go ahead and select this letter grade color that we used for just the normal design.

08:06.040 --> 08:09.290
I'm going to paint that over here because it will appear lighter.

08:09.580 --> 08:13.390
So when you go and paint along the bottom edge a little bit maybe a little bit right across through

08:13.390 --> 08:15.390
the middle area.

08:16.140 --> 08:20.110
Don't go ahead and unselect out of this by switching back over toward marquee tool and clicking out

08:20.110 --> 08:21.760
of that see how that looks.

08:21.880 --> 08:28.300
It's going to zoom out and see great out looks a lot more like a reflective metal.

08:28.330 --> 08:32.040
Now we want a second lache over here on this side of our book.

08:32.230 --> 08:36.700
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and select all these layers merge them together.

08:36.700 --> 08:42.070
So now that's all one layer then holding down old and using my grabbing move to I can go ahead and drag

08:42.070 --> 08:46.440
over a layer just like that and we'll just move it to here.

08:46.660 --> 08:51.520
Then using my earpiece on my keyboard I can nudge this into place until I like the placement of it.

08:51.550 --> 08:55.490
So I think right about there where the mood is actually really good.

08:56.170 --> 09:00.310
So next what we want to do is we want to go ahead and add in our Gen now.

09:00.340 --> 09:06.370
I think the quickest way to do this is to go ahead and grab the gem that we've already created and we're

09:06.370 --> 09:11.270
going to change the color of this gold and we'll just bring it in here and place it on our book.

09:11.620 --> 09:13.750
So I'm going to go ahead and find that folder.

09:13.750 --> 09:16.090
So here's my folder for that right there.

09:16.300 --> 09:21.010
And then I'm going to go ahead and merge my two layers that are making up this ring around it.

09:21.010 --> 09:26.430
So when I right click merge layers then using the control you on my keyboard or command you if you're

09:26.450 --> 09:32.530
on a Mac I'm going to go ahead and bring out the saturation so that it becomes more of a gray color

09:32.890 --> 09:37.300
and I might even darken it just a little bit and darken it too to right about there.

09:37.300 --> 09:43.050
And then I'm going to go ahead and hit OK then I'm going to go ahead and grab this folder right click

09:43.870 --> 09:45.600
and I'm going to merge group.

09:45.610 --> 09:47.350
So now that's all one layer.

09:47.350 --> 09:48.640
Now I don't see this out.

09:48.640 --> 09:51.830
Otherwise you're going to lose all those layers you had for this.

09:52.000 --> 09:52.980
But just for this purpose.

09:52.990 --> 09:57.670
I've merged it together so I can copy it and then I'm going to go ahead and paste it in here.

09:57.940 --> 10:00.970
And using my transform to I can go and shrink that down.

10:01.030 --> 10:02.450
First off.

10:02.450 --> 10:06.670
So I want to shrink it down to about the size that I want so I don't want it too big.

10:06.820 --> 10:12.610
So about there should be a good size then I'm in the right click and come to distort and then I can

10:12.610 --> 10:15.640
go ahead and distort this like I did with the top surface of my book.

10:15.640 --> 10:17.230
So going to distort it to about there.

10:17.230 --> 10:22.570
Then I'll bring this corner up in this corner up a little bit so it's sort of at that same angle as

10:22.570 --> 10:23.380
these lines.

10:23.420 --> 10:27.340
I might actually bring that down just a tiny bit aren't great.

10:27.370 --> 10:32.170
And I think this is actually pulled over too much so to pull these corners over because these lines

10:32.230 --> 10:37.490
need to match with these outside edges and these bottom lines need to match with these bottom edges.

10:37.600 --> 10:39.640
Then I'm going go ahead and hit enter.

10:39.640 --> 10:44.950
Now this doesn't really look right because the gym is supposed to be three dimensional and so it looks

10:44.950 --> 10:47.200
like it's actually been flagged.

10:47.200 --> 10:51.020
So what we want to do is we're going to go ahead and work Argin.

10:51.040 --> 10:56.230
So the way we'll do that is by coming back into here we're going to hit Control Z to undo our move.

10:56.380 --> 10:58.170
And we might have to do that a couple of times.

10:58.390 --> 11:00.760
So that way our gym becomes its own thing.

11:00.760 --> 11:05.260
Once again we have all of our layers over here and our layers panel and we just want to find all the

11:05.260 --> 11:07.160
layers that have to do with our gym.

11:07.360 --> 11:09.620
And we're going to go ahead and merge them all together.

11:09.760 --> 11:12.590
So all four of these layers merge them.

11:12.640 --> 11:14.680
So now that is all one layer.

11:14.680 --> 11:19.870
Now we can go ahead and select that then we'll go ahead and come back into our book and we'll paste

11:19.870 --> 11:25.970
that in and what we want to do now is we want to go ahead and first off shrink this down.

11:26.050 --> 11:29.650
So it's about the size of the genome we already have there.

11:29.680 --> 11:35.140
So right about there should be good that we're going to Right-Click and we're going to distort just

11:35.140 --> 11:40.570
like we did before and we wanted to distorted to about the same angle that we have here on top of our

11:40.570 --> 11:56.580
book.

11:56.820 --> 12:00.740
So right about there should do that we're going to Right-Click again and then come to work.

12:01.050 --> 12:04.460
And we want to work this up a little bit so it has a little bit more of a bump.

12:04.470 --> 12:09.850
So it looks more three dimensional we can pull down these bottoms so they stay in the correct position.

12:10.170 --> 12:12.300
So something like this should work.

12:12.330 --> 12:14.480
Keep working it until you get it looking the way you want.

12:14.550 --> 12:18.070
I think that boat here should be good.

12:18.120 --> 12:21.180
So now I can go ahead and hit enter now looks a little funny.

12:21.180 --> 12:26.310
I can use my Arie's tool to erase the way this top area a little bit more just so it gets a better shape

12:26.310 --> 12:26.990
in there.

12:27.390 --> 12:31.590
But you should be getting the idea that by warping it you can go ahead and get more of a three dimensional

12:31.590 --> 12:33.810
look down here at the bottom.

12:33.810 --> 12:37.350
You'll notice that we see a little bit of the gem underneath it.

12:37.350 --> 12:41.070
So what I'll do is I'm going go ahead and zoom in there and using my Bursch tool.

12:41.220 --> 12:56.410
I'm going to go ahead and just paint it over that so you can no longer see that.

12:56.470 --> 12:57.140
Great.

12:57.160 --> 12:57.990
It's going to zoom out.

12:57.990 --> 12:59.090
See how that looks.

12:59.170 --> 13:00.230
Perfect.

13:00.230 --> 13:05.140
Now I'm going to go ahead and merge all these layers together so that my GM is all on one layer and

13:05.140 --> 13:07.710
using my grabbing move tool and the arrow keys on the keyboard.

13:07.720 --> 13:10.710
I can go ahead and nubs this over into the position I want it.

13:10.890 --> 13:13.470
So going to move it to right about there.

13:13.570 --> 13:15.630
That brings us to the end of this election.

13:15.640 --> 13:21.610
So in this lecture we went ahead and created these latches that go on the binding of our book and then

13:21.610 --> 13:22.760
we created this gem.

13:22.780 --> 13:27.700
Well we already created this gem previously but then we took it and we applied it to our book and made

13:27.700 --> 13:31.150
it look a little bit more three dimensional in the next lecture.

13:31.150 --> 13:35.950
We're going to finish up with the details by adding in more of an edge on this book cover maybe a few

13:35.950 --> 13:42.460
scratches endings in here and we'll also go ahead and add in a few bookmarks and papers and maybe even

13:42.460 --> 13:45.940
a ribbon bookmark hanging out of our book.

13:45.940 --> 13:46.740
Thanks for watching.

13:46.750 --> 13:50.080
And I'm really looking forward to seeing you in the next lecture.
