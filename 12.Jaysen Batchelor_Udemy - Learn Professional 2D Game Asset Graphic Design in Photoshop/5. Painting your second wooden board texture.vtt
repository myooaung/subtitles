00:03.370 --> 00:07.350
All right let's go ahead and finish up this wood plank.

00:07.450 --> 00:13.750
So the first thing I want to do is I want to select the shape of my plank of wood that way I don't paint

00:13.780 --> 00:14.990
outside of it.

00:15.010 --> 00:18.450
Next I'm going to go ahead and select one of these lighter colors.

00:18.970 --> 00:23.770
And what I want to do is I want to find an even lighter version of that because right now my plank of

00:23.770 --> 00:26.680
wood is looking a little bit too dark.

00:27.490 --> 00:29.080
So about there should be good.

00:29.370 --> 00:34.440
I use my brush tool and put my brush at 2 percent or 20 percent opacity.

00:34.570 --> 00:37.850
I'm going to go ahead and paint in some of these areas.

00:37.870 --> 00:39.950
So they're not so dark.

01:16.230 --> 01:16.810
Great.

01:16.830 --> 01:20.050
Next let's go ahead and find a really bright highlight color.

01:20.070 --> 01:27.090
So I'm to come straight up like so maybe a little bit more down towards the red side.

01:28.320 --> 01:29.920
OK.

01:30.420 --> 01:33.260
Now let's go ahead and start painting some highlights.

02:06.080 --> 02:12.380
Next let's grab an even brighter highlight so to about there and I'm going to come back more towards

02:12.380 --> 02:13.190
the yellows.

02:13.290 --> 02:15.240
It's getting a little bit too cool for me.

02:17.040 --> 02:44.140
Let's go ahead and paint in those highlights.

02:44.570 --> 02:53.000
Now I'm going to go ahead and grab sort of a cool color a blue color sort of come up into my blues and

02:54.140 --> 02:56.090
bring some around here.

02:56.570 --> 02:57.520
OK.

02:57.650 --> 03:02.150
And now I'm going to go ahead and just start adding a little bit of blue into my word.

03:02.210 --> 03:04.820
This just makes it look a little bit more interesting.

03:28.030 --> 03:28.540
Great.

03:28.540 --> 03:33.670
Now the last thing I want to do is I want to add a little bit more of a darker edge around the edge

03:33.700 --> 03:34.660
of my plank.

03:34.840 --> 03:39.040
So we have more shadow and we'll be able to differentiate between the two points of wood when they're

03:39.040 --> 03:40.140
next to each other.

03:40.450 --> 03:45.680
And I also want to add a little bit of dark shadow into these cracks to give it a little bit more depth.

03:45.700 --> 03:50.160
So I'm going to select this outside color and then I'm going to find a darker version of it.

03:50.170 --> 03:57.650
So when it comes down to that there and then I'm going to go ahead and start painting in that darker

03:57.650 --> 03:58.610
edge.

03:58.610 --> 04:02.030
Now I saw my brush set to 20 percent opacity

04:06.270 --> 04:10.060
you'll see how I'm painting into these cracks to give it more depth.

04:22.870 --> 04:27.840
Remember you're at 20 percent capacity so you might have to go over the edges a couple of times.

04:27.860 --> 04:30.240
The reason why we're at 20 percent opacity.

04:30.380 --> 04:32.810
You know we're trying to get a completely dark edge.

04:32.850 --> 04:38.640
It's just because we don't want the edges to look too sharp and we want to keep it pretty organic.

04:39.210 --> 04:46.830
And so we're keeping at 20 percent because that allows us to build up the different transparencies on

04:46.830 --> 04:48.800
top of each other.

05:22.070 --> 05:22.980
Great.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.420
Now one last thing I want to change is right here.

05:25.430 --> 05:31.070
We're not having very much definition and these two sort of shapes are just kind of morphing together

05:31.070 --> 05:31.950
down here.

05:32.210 --> 05:36.880
So I'm going to go ahead and select this darker color and I'm going to give some definition.

05:36.890 --> 05:38.060
That kind of break it up

05:42.180 --> 05:45.840
just like so now I'm also thinking I want a little bit more highlight.

05:45.840 --> 05:50.220
Also someone to go ahead and slide my highlight color and find just a little bit lighter version of

05:50.220 --> 05:52.170
that summer up there.

05:52.440 --> 05:58.500
And I'm just going to add the last little bits of highlight and I promise you this will be the last

05:58.500 --> 05:59.310
thing we do on this

06:41.640 --> 06:42.220
cool.

06:42.220 --> 06:45.470
So you just made your first hand-painted plank.

06:45.480 --> 06:48.320
Let's go ahead and make a copy of this letter.

06:49.020 --> 06:51.370
So control J or command commanded J.

06:51.430 --> 06:53.790
Now we're going to drag that over like so.

06:53.890 --> 06:57.940
And what I'm going to do is I can use my Transform Tool and then I'm going to right click.

06:58.100 --> 07:04.710
I'm going to come down to flip horizontal and then I right click again and hit Phlip vertical.

07:04.710 --> 07:09.980
That way we kind of get an opposite shape to start off with when we start creating our second plank.

07:10.260 --> 07:12.050
Let's go out and hit enter.

07:12.060 --> 07:16.920
So what we want to do here is we want to completely reshape the landscape of this plank and we're going

07:16.920 --> 07:22.460
to use these colors that are already here as a base because that'll make it much quicker and easier.

07:22.470 --> 07:28.710
So what I'm going to do first is I'm going to take my mid color and I'm going to bring my brush opacity

07:28.710 --> 07:35.690
up to 4 percent and then we're just going to start sort of repainting in the shape of our wood.

07:36.300 --> 07:39.600
So this time I want to keep my word pretty straight.

07:39.600 --> 07:41.730
This one is kind of go in diagonal.

07:41.730 --> 07:45.560
And we want this woodgrain to be going more in a straight direction.

07:45.810 --> 07:51.760
That way we're kind of changing up the visuals of our wood and they don't both look exactly the same.

08:08.550 --> 08:09.030
All right.

08:09.050 --> 08:13.100
Next what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and grab one of these and her dark colors.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.580
So like that right there.

08:15.590 --> 08:22.950
And now we can go ahead and start painting and sort of the shadow and between each grain of our wood.

08:36.930 --> 08:40.890
I'm going to select a darker colors maybe like this color down here.

08:40.890 --> 08:41.970
Start painting with that

08:53.800 --> 08:56.940
this time we might add sort of a little not here.

08:57.650 --> 09:01.920
For now I'm just going to kind of create a little cavern right there for it.

09:15.300 --> 09:16.250
Great.

09:16.260 --> 09:21.750
Now let's go ahead and grab another dirt color so maybe something like right there start painting with

09:21.750 --> 09:22.110
that

09:28.410 --> 09:30.430
and we're still going to painting with too much of a blue.

09:30.460 --> 09:33.340
So I want to try to get it in there and get a dark brown

09:54.590 --> 09:55.240
next.

09:55.250 --> 09:57.570
Let's go ahead and start painting in our highlights.

09:57.590 --> 10:02.860
So I'm going to select one of my darker highlight colors maybe from like right there.

10:02.930 --> 10:04.670
Now let's start painting those highlights in

10:07.630 --> 10:12.010
so I'm just going to start off by painting right along the edges of some of my Wood Green

10:16.550 --> 10:18.650
and over here.

10:18.660 --> 10:23.510
I'm going to add a little bit more of a light area because I want to add a sort of another shape over

10:23.520 --> 10:24.120
here.

10:24.280 --> 10:27.170
So smooth down here.

10:57.840 --> 10:58.820
Cool.

10:58.830 --> 11:04.170
Now let's go ahead and select this brown color here and let's just add a little bit more color into

11:04.170 --> 11:05.180
this.

11:35.670 --> 11:40.710
Now I'm going to select this darker shadow color over here and my other piece of wood and I'm going

11:40.710 --> 11:45.720
to paint in a little bit more shadow within this cavernous little area where we're going to have it

11:45.720 --> 11:52.810
not.

11:54.120 --> 11:57.470
We might add a little bit more shadow over here also.

12:02.070 --> 12:03.320
Perfect.

12:03.470 --> 12:10.740
Now let's go ahead and grab our really bright highlight color and let's start adding some real highlights

12:10.860 --> 12:12.330
here.

12:50.790 --> 12:51.330
Cool.

12:51.440 --> 12:54.800
Now I'm going to go ahead and select this darker shadow color over here.

12:55.020 --> 12:59.270
I'm just going to start painting in some of these areas that I no longer really want.

12:59.480 --> 13:05.780
So I might add a little bit more shadow right here and remember you can always use your eyedropper tool

13:05.780 --> 13:08.990
to select that middle color so you can blend

13:20.170 --> 13:29.250
my had a little bit more blending in here just to soften things up.

13:29.260 --> 13:35.110
Now let's go ahead and paint in that not so I'm going to Resul like this highlight color down here and

13:35.120 --> 13:45.250
my not is going to come around like so and then it's going to make a little swirl within our little

13:45.250 --> 13:46.330
cavern.

13:51.290 --> 13:55.220
So I had a little bit more shadow on this side.

13:55.250 --> 14:00.070
So I'm just like the Sturk recolor here start painting around there like so

14:03.840 --> 14:05.370
perfect.

14:05.400 --> 14:09.870
Now let's go ahead and select our final highlight color so I'm going to grab my highlight color again

14:11.060 --> 14:14.840
and then grab just a little bit brighter version of that.

14:14.850 --> 14:18.200
Now we're going to add the last little highlights on our wood

14:40.600 --> 14:41.260
OK.

14:41.290 --> 14:42.830
I think this looks pretty good.

14:43.060 --> 14:47.520
I'm just noticing that there's not much definition between our wood grains.

14:47.530 --> 14:52.720
So what I want to do is I'm going to grab my dark color again and then I'm going to go ahead and just

14:52.720 --> 14:54.890
paint a little bit more definition in there.

15:10.940 --> 15:14.390
And then down here I'm going to go ahead and select this color.

15:14.600 --> 15:18.830
I'm just going to sort of fill this in a little bit more because that shape looks a little bit weird

15:18.830 --> 15:20.200
to me and unnatural

15:26.220 --> 15:28.170
one that will highlight down here.

15:28.800 --> 15:30.370
Maybe grab a lighter highlight color

15:33.240 --> 15:33.920
great.

15:33.930 --> 15:38.950
We're now done creating the hand-painted texture for a wooden crate in the next lecture.

15:38.970 --> 15:41.880
We're going to go out and take this and apply it toward drawing.

15:41.880 --> 15:47.070
Remember that when you're doing hand-painted artwork the idea is to start with your darkest color and

15:47.070 --> 15:51.780
move up to your brightest highlight and then if need to go back you can change things and add other

15:51.780 --> 15:52.610
colors in.

15:52.860 --> 15:55.830
But for the most part that's the way you want to do it.

15:55.830 --> 15:59.310
Thanks for watching this lecture and I look forward to seeing you in the next one.
