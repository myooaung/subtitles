00:00.480 --> 00:04.190
All right let's go ahead and animate our button now.

00:04.500 --> 00:11.100
So the first thing we want to do to create an animation in Photoshop is add in a timeline line the way

00:11.100 --> 00:16.620
you do that is by coming up to window then coming down to timeline and selecting that.

00:16.620 --> 00:22.890
So now we have a nice little timeline down here at the bottom where we can add in frames for our animation.

00:22.890 --> 00:27.840
Next what we want to do is we want to add in our second frame so we're going to come over here at the

00:27.840 --> 00:32.010
bottom where it looks like a new layer icon but it's going to add in a frame.

00:32.020 --> 00:33.210
Once we click it.

00:33.210 --> 00:39.680
So now the way frames work in Photoshop is whatever layers you have turned on on that layer.

00:39.810 --> 00:41.320
That's what's going to be shown.

00:41.400 --> 00:47.210
So on our first one we want to turn off this top layer so we can only see this one.

00:47.430 --> 00:51.040
And then in the next layer you'll notice that it changes the second layer.

00:51.040 --> 00:54.940
That's because anything you do to the first layer at it's going to apply to all of them.

00:55.350 --> 01:00.210
So now that we're in the second layer we need to turn off this frame one folder and turn on this frame

01:00.240 --> 01:01.330
to folder.

01:01.620 --> 01:05.850
So now we come back to our frames and switch between them by clicking on them you can see what the animation

01:05.850 --> 01:07.650
will play like.

01:07.650 --> 01:10.970
And then we can go ahead and play that with the play button.

01:11.370 --> 01:15.130
And right now I have it set to one frame per second.

01:15.150 --> 01:19.800
So now if you wanted to let's say this is going to be used in an app you can time your finger and pretend

01:19.800 --> 01:22.450
like you're pressing the button to see what that feels like.

01:22.500 --> 01:26.410
Not in real life but feels like visually when you press that button.

01:26.700 --> 01:31.920
Now if your animation is playing way too fast what you need to do is you need to pause it and then you

01:31.920 --> 01:38.250
need to select both your layers by holding down shift and selecting them and then you need to click

01:38.340 --> 01:42.080
where it says one second and you need to change this from whatever it's set to.

01:42.090 --> 01:43.660
It might be set to zero seconds.

01:43.680 --> 01:50.100
So you want to click one second or 1.0 and then also if it's not playing forever you need to come down

01:50.100 --> 01:56.170
here where it says forever and you're going to change it from once to a forever loop and then it'll

01:56.190 --> 01:58.280
start playing over and over again.

01:58.290 --> 02:01.400
All right let's go ahead and create our spreadsheet now.

02:01.410 --> 02:08.190
A spreadsheet is just a document that your game can use to draw from to grab lots of different assets.

02:08.430 --> 02:14.940
So for example let's say you had a bunch of different frames for an animation now rather than saving

02:14.940 --> 02:19.890
each one of those frames as its own document that would take for a really long time for your game to

02:19.890 --> 02:20.400
draw from.

02:20.400 --> 02:25.950
All of those documents and play the animation when you have it all in one document then it can just

02:25.950 --> 02:31.410
cut it out and draw from that one document it makes game play much faster.

02:31.650 --> 02:33.400
And so that's what we're going to create right now.

02:33.420 --> 02:36.820
We're going to create a straight sheet that has each one of these frames on it.

02:37.260 --> 02:40.250
So what we need to do is first we need to crop our image.

02:40.260 --> 02:41.960
So it's as small as it can be.

02:42.210 --> 02:47.100
So I'm going to go ahead and switch over to my frame too because that's where we have the most pixels

02:47.100 --> 02:49.650
coming out because of this outer glow.

02:49.800 --> 02:54.390
And then I'm going to switch over to my crop tool and we're just going to go ahead and drag it in like

02:54.390 --> 03:00.690
so and I'm going to drag it down to about there and I'll drag this side into about there.

03:00.690 --> 03:02.970
Then let's go ahead and hit enter.

03:02.970 --> 03:06.930
Perfect next to what we want to do is we want to create a new document.

03:07.140 --> 03:12.450
But before we do that we need to find out what the exact size of this document is so that we can create

03:12.450 --> 03:14.740
a document that will fit both of them.

03:14.790 --> 03:18.520
So we're going to come up to image and there are going to come down to image size.

03:18.900 --> 03:22.610
And that's our width and height right there so we can go ahead and write that down.

03:22.650 --> 03:29.660
So the width is four hundred and ninety two pixels and the height is 231 pixels.

03:29.850 --> 03:33.870
So our hype is going to stay the same but it's going to double.

03:33.870 --> 03:41.910
So let's go ahead and hit cancel and then we want to go file new document and our new document is going

03:41.910 --> 03:44.250
to be the height that we already have.

03:44.250 --> 03:50.670
So 231 pixels and then the width will double from 490 to pixels.

03:50.670 --> 03:59.230
So that's going to be nine hundred and eighty four and then we want to set our background to transparent.

03:59.250 --> 04:00.410
Because it's a Spryte sheet.

04:00.420 --> 04:03.480
We want all of our backgrounds to be transparent that way.

04:03.480 --> 04:07.060
It doesn't pick up anything that's not part of our asset.

04:07.230 --> 04:10.360
So I'm going to change this from white to transparent.

04:10.560 --> 04:11.850
And then we can go ahead and hit.

04:11.880 --> 04:12.810
OK.

04:13.350 --> 04:18.370
Next what we want to do is we want to make a line right down the center of our document.

04:18.450 --> 04:24.690
That way we can place these in the correct position if you have your button positioned more to the left

04:24.690 --> 04:25.130
side.

04:25.170 --> 04:28.410
And then in the next frame it's positioned more to the right side.

04:28.450 --> 04:31.320
The button is going to look like it's moved and we don't want that.

04:31.320 --> 04:33.770
We want it to be in the exact same spot.

04:33.780 --> 04:38.160
So what we'll do is we're going to grab a ruler and we're going to drag it right to the center and it

04:38.160 --> 04:39.930
should click into place.

04:39.960 --> 04:44.070
Now we can go ahead insert dragging in our folders and toward document.

04:44.310 --> 04:50.280
So I'm going to come back into our file and what we need to do is we need to also grab this gray background

04:50.340 --> 04:52.560
with our folder and you'll see why in a second.

04:52.560 --> 04:58.320
So I want to select both those layers and then I'm going to click and drag them into my other document

04:58.440 --> 05:04.050
and drop them right in onto the document like so and then we can go ahead and take that and position

05:04.050 --> 05:04.400
it.

05:04.560 --> 05:11.910
And now you see why we had to grab that gray background so that it lined up perfectly within this rectangle.

05:11.910 --> 05:16.830
Now that we have the all lined up we can go ahead and come down to that gray background layer and we

05:16.830 --> 05:19.210
can hit delete because we don't need it anymore.

05:19.740 --> 05:21.890
Let's go ahead and grab our second frame now.

05:22.020 --> 05:27.740
So we're going to select my background then holding down control I can select my frame too.

05:27.780 --> 05:33.780
And that allows me to skip frame 1 so whatever I click on while I'm holding down control I can select

05:33.780 --> 05:36.860
those and skip everything in between.

05:36.870 --> 05:43.140
Now let's go ahead and collect those letters and drag them into our document drop them and then I'll

05:43.260 --> 05:44.930
position it right there.

05:45.060 --> 05:48.800
And then I can go ahead and delete that gray background.

05:48.840 --> 05:49.530
Awesome.

05:49.530 --> 05:51.620
So now we have our sprite sheet.

05:51.900 --> 05:58.520
Now in order for your game or for unity to use this right she needs to be saved out as E.P. Angie.

05:58.530 --> 06:00.140
So let's go ahead and do that.

06:00.150 --> 06:06.750
So the way you see it as a parent is by coming up to File Save As and then we're going to save this

06:06.810 --> 06:08.640
out as a play button

06:11.280 --> 06:11.880
spreadsheet

06:15.420 --> 06:22.020
and then we're going to change it from a Photoshop document to a P and G and we'll go ahead and hit

06:22.020 --> 06:26.140
save and hit OK.

06:26.280 --> 06:30.680
And so now we have a flattened version of this that has no layers or folders.

06:30.750 --> 06:33.730
It's just the image itself with a transparent background.

06:33.960 --> 06:36.150
That's what your game is going to need to create.

06:36.180 --> 06:37.640
It's animation.

06:37.680 --> 06:38.090
All right.

06:38.130 --> 06:40.460
That brings us to the end of this project.

06:40.470 --> 06:43.550
Thanks for joining me and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
