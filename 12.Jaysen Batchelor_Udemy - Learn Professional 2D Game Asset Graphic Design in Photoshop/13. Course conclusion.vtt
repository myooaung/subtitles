All right that brings us to the end of this course.

00:03.840 --> 00:08.580
I really enjoyed going through this course with you guys and I also really enjoyed creating it I hope

00:08.580 --> 00:13.280
is really helpful for you if it was you can go ahead and leave a review if you'd like.

00:13.290 --> 00:15.360
If not no worries.

00:15.420 --> 00:19.320
Let's do a quick recap of what we learned in this course.

00:19.320 --> 00:22.910
So first off we went over the basics of Photoshop.

00:23.130 --> 00:28.260
Once we got comfortable in Photoshop we went ahead and started learning how to draw and all the basic

00:28.260 --> 00:30.500
fundamentals of drawing.

00:30.540 --> 00:35.760
Then we went ahead and took all that knowledge that we learned about drawing and color theory and applied

00:35.760 --> 00:37.800
it to our first asset.

00:37.800 --> 00:43.890
Then we took that asset and created an even more advanced paint texture for it once you got comfortable

00:43.890 --> 00:46.140
with painting assets in Photoshop.

00:46.170 --> 00:51.420
We went ahead and recreated some assets from Raman where you learn how to create patterns in Photoshop

00:51.690 --> 00:54.110
as well as how to paint glass.

00:54.270 --> 01:00.880
Once we did that we went ahead and created a sword and he learned how to paint leather and metal.

01:00.930 --> 01:05.940
And then lastly you learn how to paint a jewel button where you learned how to create transparent gems

01:06.270 --> 01:08.760
as well as a gold texture.

01:08.760 --> 01:11.170
Now there's also a bonus section in this course.

01:11.190 --> 01:16.280
So if you keep moving on they'll be another lecture on how to animate a play button and eventually there's

01:16.290 --> 01:19.060
going to be even more videos and that bonus section.

01:19.350 --> 01:23.240
So thanks for joining me on this course and I really enjoyed this.

01:23.250 --> 01:26.230
I look forward to seeing your artwork and have a great day.
