00:00.540 --> 00:05.910
OK before we start adding color to this we need to go ahead and merge some of these layers together

00:06.240 --> 00:09.010
so that they're one and we can paint right over them.

00:09.240 --> 00:13.410
So first we're going to start with the very bottom second to start with this piece right here along

00:13.410 --> 00:15.090
with its shadow piece.

00:15.090 --> 00:17.960
So we're going to go ahead and merge those together.

00:18.750 --> 00:21.080
Next we're going to merge our body piece together.

00:21.090 --> 00:24.230
So it's going to be this large cube with the rearview mirror.

00:24.300 --> 00:29.100
Some of them up to that layer and find my rearview mirror layer and just merge those together.

00:29.310 --> 00:30.830
So now that's all one layer.

00:31.020 --> 00:37.980
And lastly I want to merge this whole piece on top as one layer so misled all of those and merge.

00:38.010 --> 00:39.750
So now that's all one layer.

00:39.830 --> 00:42.680
This is going to make it much easier to color our truck.

00:43.050 --> 00:44.790
All right let's get started.

00:44.940 --> 00:49.830
So the first thing we want to do is add a new layer above this top piece.

00:50.130 --> 00:55.260
And on this new layer we're going to convert it into a clipping mask and then we're going to go ahead

00:55.290 --> 00:57.110
and fill that in with a balloon.

00:57.150 --> 01:01.530
So don't come into my blues and somewhere about in here should be good.

01:01.530 --> 01:03.280
A little bit desaturated.

01:03.390 --> 01:05.340
I'm going to go ahead fill that in.

01:05.580 --> 01:09.860
Next I'm going to change my blend mode from normal to overlay.

01:10.020 --> 01:15.280
So now we get this really nice cool shadow on the white part of our truck.

01:15.500 --> 01:19.440
Now while we have this blue color selected We're going to go ahead and paint this back part of our truck

01:19.500 --> 01:21.940
because we want it to be the same color.

01:22.050 --> 01:26.550
So I'm going to find the layer that has the back of my truck on it right there that I'm going to add

01:26.550 --> 01:30.960
a new layer above that create a clipping mask.

01:30.960 --> 01:36.530
Fill that in and then change the blend mode to overlay.

01:36.660 --> 01:37.620
Perfect.

01:37.620 --> 01:41.160
Next let's add a little bit more detail to the back part of our truck.

01:41.340 --> 01:44.240
So I'm going to go ahead and grab my Lasso tool.

01:44.790 --> 01:52.170
And then on a new layer above this blue layer I'm going to go ahead and select a shape that goes right

01:52.170 --> 01:56.460
along this edge and we're going to fill this in with a dark gray.

01:56.460 --> 02:04.770
Now you can come outside of this area because it's going to be clipping mask.

02:04.900 --> 02:09.360
So just like so then I'm going to go ahead and fill that in with a black.

02:09.820 --> 02:15.190
And what we're going to do is we're going to bring the opacity down on that so that we can control how

02:15.190 --> 02:17.380
great it is.

02:17.410 --> 02:21.640
Now we want to make this into a clipping mask so I'm going to drag the layer underneath the blue layer

02:21.690 --> 02:23.230
and then back up.

02:23.530 --> 02:28.000
And now we can go out and turn that opacity down on the layer until we like what we see.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.460
So going to turn it down to about 15 percent should be good.

02:32.470 --> 02:37.610
Now going to copy this layer and I want to make sure it's a clipping my mask so I'll drag it underneath

02:38.150 --> 02:43.380
and then I can grab that and drag it all the way to the bottom so I can get it lined up.

02:43.880 --> 02:45.180
Perfect.

02:45.250 --> 02:48.370
Next let's add some color to the body of our truck.

02:48.420 --> 02:54.950
Someone come up to that layer at a new layer above it and turn it into a clipping mask and then I'm

02:54.950 --> 02:56.840
going to fill that in with a red.

02:56.900 --> 03:02.510
So I'm going to come in to my reds and I don't want to be completely saturated but I want it to be pretty

03:02.510 --> 03:04.930
close or somewhere about there should be good.

03:05.170 --> 03:10.730
Then I'll go ahead and fill that layer in and then I'm going to change the blood mode from normal to

03:10.760 --> 03:11.860
multiply.

03:12.080 --> 03:15.060
Next let's go ahead and add a window on this truck.

03:15.410 --> 03:19.430
So I'm going to go ahead and zoom in there a little bit more so you'll see my last or two.

03:19.460 --> 03:26.690
I'm going to go ahead and slide from here over to you about there and then I'm going to come straight

03:26.690 --> 03:32.630
up like so and then i'm not come over like so just eyeballing making sure that I'm on the same diagonal

03:32.690 --> 03:34.460
angle as the other parts.

03:34.460 --> 03:41.840
So probably two about there and then I'm going to come straight across here and do the same thing just

03:41.900 --> 03:46.970
eyeball it making sure that the distance between here and here is the same as here and here.

03:46.970 --> 03:49.260
So I go about there.

03:49.850 --> 03:55.400
And if you're unsure about it what you can do is you can turn the opacity down on your truck and then

03:55.400 --> 03:58.170
you'll be able to see the grid behind it.

03:58.170 --> 03:58.540
All right.

03:58.580 --> 04:02.960
And then I'm not going to worry about this line down here because I'm not going to be able to eyeball

04:02.960 --> 04:08.000
that well enough so I'm just going to come straight across like so and reconnect it then I'm going to

04:08.000 --> 04:09.640
fill that in with black.

04:09.650 --> 04:14.220
So change the color to black and fill that in next.

04:14.240 --> 04:16.970
Let's go ahead and switch back over to the Lasso tool.

04:17.080 --> 04:19.770
We're going to come across here like so.

04:20.330 --> 04:24.160
So that way we can figure out where that point needs to be on this corner.

04:24.350 --> 04:25.770
So now we know where that goes.

04:25.970 --> 04:29.810
And then we come across here and just eyeballing it and where it should be.

04:30.050 --> 04:38.620
So I'm going to say somewhere about there and then we can go ahead and come across reconnect and feel

04:38.620 --> 04:43.830
about him now and getting this little red line here because I did this on top of my red layer.

04:43.860 --> 04:49.460
So what I can do is I can go ahead and take my brush and just fill that in.

04:49.500 --> 04:53.050
But let's go ahead and zoom out and see how that looks awesome.

04:53.490 --> 04:58.340
So we're going to create our tire on a new layer and then we're going to use the Transform Tool to morph

04:58.340 --> 05:00.210
it to the correct perspective.

05:00.210 --> 05:03.820
So a lot of new layer above this and using my Marki tool.

05:03.840 --> 05:10.610
I'm going to go ahead and make a square selection like so and then I'm going to fill that in with black.

05:10.680 --> 05:14.550
Next I'm going to go ahead and select this shadow dark color right here.

05:14.610 --> 05:15.680
That sort of blue.

05:16.020 --> 05:22.320
And I'm going to add a new layer above this and fill this square in and then use them transform to I

05:22.320 --> 05:27.390
can go ahead and shrink that down and also holding down shift and Olt to keep the proportions and keep

05:27.390 --> 05:31.520
it centered or shrink it down to about their center.

05:31.620 --> 05:36.870
And now it's merge both these layers together that's going to be our tire.

05:37.050 --> 05:40.690
So let's make a copy of the Slayer so we have a backup one.

05:40.950 --> 05:43.980
And then I'm going drag this guy over like so and I'm going to zoom in there.

05:44.940 --> 05:51.440
Next let's turn to transform tool on Right-Click and come to distort and then what we want to do is

05:51.450 --> 06:00.410
we just want to drag this wheel right up to each corner and straight up this way no more drag like there.

06:00.660 --> 06:05.580
Let's just get them into the basic position and then we can figure out how we're going to get them straight

06:06.060 --> 06:08.600
and correct according to our perspective.

06:17.560 --> 06:21.980
If you have your snap to turn on it should snap right into the correct shape.

06:22.000 --> 06:28.000
If it doesn't what you need to do is come up to you and then come down to snap to and make sure you

06:28.000 --> 06:32.570
have guides layers and document bounds checked next.

06:32.620 --> 06:34.830
Let's go ahead and enter next.

06:34.870 --> 06:37.750
You want to grab this lever and drag it down towards a red layer.

06:37.750 --> 06:41.020
I'm going to drag underneath and we're going to drag it above it.

06:41.020 --> 06:43.050
So now it's a clipping layer mask or that.

06:43.080 --> 06:45.240
Now you see it didn't fit perfectly.

06:45.280 --> 06:49.300
So what we're going to do is we're going to turn on the transform tool and just barely nudge that over.

06:49.300 --> 06:49.870
Like so.

06:49.870 --> 06:52.890
So it fits in there.

06:53.080 --> 06:57.300
Next what we want to do is we want to fill in this area right here with black also.

06:57.370 --> 07:04.120
So I'm going to zoom in there and using my lasso to go ahead and select along this edge like so and

07:04.120 --> 07:06.370
then I'm going to fill that in with black

07:10.210 --> 07:11.260
perfect.

07:11.260 --> 07:14.020
See how that looks awesome.

07:14.020 --> 07:17.070
Now let's go ahead and make a copy of this letter.

07:17.410 --> 07:21.060
Then we're going to drag that layer down to the bottom part of our truck.

07:21.250 --> 07:23.170
So that's that layer right there.

07:23.410 --> 07:25.680
And we're going to convert this into a clipping mask.

07:25.720 --> 07:33.460
So right click and come to clipping mask and then we want to drag that over just like so and get that

07:33.520 --> 07:35.260
all lined up correctly.

07:35.470 --> 07:38.810
So about their looks good maybe up on.

07:39.010 --> 07:39.990
Perfect.

07:40.140 --> 07:42.030
And we're going to make another copy of this.

07:42.190 --> 07:43.820
So what control J.

07:43.960 --> 07:45.020
Drag the underneath.

07:45.040 --> 07:50.840
So it becomes a clipping layer mask and then we can drag it over here and get all lined up also.

07:50.860 --> 07:51.280
All right.

07:51.310 --> 07:52.680
That looks good.

07:52.690 --> 07:56.830
Next we're going to add some color to the bottom part of our truck and we're just going to add a little

07:56.830 --> 08:01.630
bit of gray something to create a new layer above this and automatically become a clipping layer mask

08:02.320 --> 08:06.650
and then I'm going to go ahead and fill that in with a darker gray like so.

08:07.090 --> 08:14.020
So fill that in and change it to a multiply layer and then I can go ahead and play with that opacity

08:14.020 --> 08:16.400
to change how dark that Gray is.

08:16.400 --> 08:18.210
And I think I like it pretty dark.

08:18.220 --> 08:21.260
So maybe just a little bit lighter about there.

08:21.280 --> 08:24.100
Perfect.

08:24.190 --> 08:27.600
Now we can go ahead and turn this wheel we'll layer off.

08:27.680 --> 08:29.360
So find that.

08:29.440 --> 08:33.260
Turn it off and then I'm going to find this bottom cube and I want to turn that off.

08:33.700 --> 08:37.360
And then we can turn our tree back on.

08:37.360 --> 08:38.850
See how that looks with it.

08:39.010 --> 08:44.810
And that tree might be a little bit too large so we can go ahead and grab that folder and shrink all

08:44.800 --> 08:48.270
of those layers down like so.

08:48.680 --> 08:51.330
That looks like it'll fit much better.

08:51.610 --> 08:56.590
And then we can come down to our background layer and we can go ahead and add a new layer above that

08:56.650 --> 08:59.430
and fill it in with gray.

09:00.130 --> 09:01.110
Very cool.

09:01.310 --> 09:04.130
Going to move this tree out of the way so it's not so much in the way.

09:04.500 --> 09:06.920
So maybe two right here.

09:07.630 --> 09:09.150
Awesome.

09:09.160 --> 09:09.630
All right.

09:09.670 --> 09:12.070
That brings us to the end of this project.

09:12.340 --> 09:13.850
I hope you enjoyed this project.

09:13.990 --> 09:14.590
I did.

09:14.590 --> 09:17.290
I really like the look of these type of graphics.

09:17.380 --> 09:22.140
Now your assignment for this lecture is to create this project but I want you to change it up.

09:22.150 --> 09:25.800
I want you to change the color maybe change the shape of a window.

09:25.810 --> 09:27.310
Change the design on the back.

09:27.310 --> 09:29.200
Change the design on the tree.

09:29.350 --> 09:30.970
Change the shape of the tree.

09:30.970 --> 09:33.270
Maybe even change the shape of the truck.

09:33.310 --> 09:39.670
Just change it up and then once you create your crossroad graphics I want you to post it to the Q and

09:39.670 --> 09:41.680
A section of the course.

09:41.680 --> 09:44.730
Thanks for watching and I really look forward to seeing your work.
