00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.340
Now let's explore the power of program management.

2
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.100
So how do we plan and coordinate all this stuff we've been talking about?

3
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:15.340
Well, we design a program, and we manage it.

4
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.150
Program management is the application of knowledge,

5
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.700
skills, tools, and techniques to meet program requirements.

6
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.450
Organizations with mature program management will be

7
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.440
more successful than those without it.

8
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.010
Here are three key benefits to using program management. Where possible

9
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.870
there are significant advantages to define a program in support of an

10
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.750
objective and then subdivided it into component projects instead of

11
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.840
embarking on individual projects in a scattered and random fashion.

12
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.140
Program management strengthens the alignment of the business unit

13
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.500
strategy and ensures better control and focus on realizing those intended

14
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.300
and expected benefits.

15
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.890
The program manager leads those organizational teams, they are the boss, but

16
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.140
have a very small staff and leverages the organizational teams and talent.

17
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.000
The staff of the program manager can contain, among others, senior business analysts.
