00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.780
Let's talk about your role at the program scale. In the last section,

2
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.280
we ended with getting all of the groundwork completed

3
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.380
regarding the application stakeholders.

4
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.420
What should we now be thinking about and considering

5
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.730
before we drill into epics and features?

6
00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.950
Let's find out. Now our requirements are a much

7
00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.320
larger scope and greater complexity.

8
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.510
We were used to doing analysis for a single product or a couple of systems,

9
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.670
and now it is much,

10
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.270
much broader. With a single Agile team, it was organized around a

11
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.120
product or system with all the necessary team members,

12
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.650
a product owner, business analyst, dev members,

13
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.970
testers, and maybe a Scrum Master, project leader or tech leader.

14
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.630
Again, any mix of those that works for your organization is,

15
00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.980
of course,

16
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.620
fine. What we can expect in our daily work as a business analyst

17
00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.410
to change, especially given such a lofty and broad requirement

18
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.670
like increase order revenue? Well,

19
00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.260
we can expect a lot of change. With programs, we have a lot more complexity

20
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.890
and a larger scope of work to perform and need to consider and think about the

21
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.130
following, how many backlogs will this affect? Will you have multiple product

22
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.350
owners? How many and where are they?

23
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.040
How should the Agile and Lean teams be organized, by feature,

24
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.240
by component, by product, by service?

25
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.140
How do you prioritize across multiple backlogs?

26
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.810
How do we plan and coordinate all of this?

27
00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.580
Now I go into some length on my Pluralsight course,

28
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.190
Deploying Value with Kanban, in how to design and organize complex,

29
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.550
interrelated backlogs.

30
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.510
So check that out. So you can see it will take some pretty

31
00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:40.010
smart people, like yourself, to figure all this out. From

32
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.690
business analyst to program analyst.

33
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.200
The role of business analyst is very common, so you may not find

34
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.080
the role titled program or business unit analyst,

35
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.950
but I call it out here to make a point.

36
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.130
It is a much more responsible and experienced position. Before your

37
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.040
role was a business analyst working for the business itself and

38
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.560
partnering with the product owner or in the IT organization and

39
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.350
working more closely with the dev team or possibly in a project

40
00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.910
management office working in the CFO's organization or just directly

41
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.360
to a finance function.

42
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.740
Working for program management is a huge step up with

43
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.850
significant and more impactful responsibilities.

44
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.040
This would be a major promotion and a seniorâ€‘level responsibility

45
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.520
if you choose this career path. Importantly,

46
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.770
you must be able to work with executives.

47
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.740
You will need to leverage the module, relationships,

48
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.040
the secret to successful requirements.

49
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.110
Therefore, you need the following skills, excellent at planning skills,

50
00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.770
outstanding interpersonal skills, and superb at communication skills.

51
00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:46.000
Are you ready for the job? I find this kind of work very intellectually intriguing, indeed.
