00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:03.630
In carrying out your role as a business analyst,

2
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.930
you'll be using some or all of these tools.

3
00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.230
We're not going to cover these since they are the basic tools you should

4
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.480
either already know or have some familiarity with.

5
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.730
This is a partial list, of course,

6
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.070
but it gives you an idea of the kinds of tools and methods you should have in

7
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.040
your hip pocket and pull out when you think you need them.

8
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.990
And here is a list of typical skills that a business analyst should have.

9
00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.560
Again, we're not going to cover these since they are the basic skills you

10
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.930
should already possess or have some familiarity with,

11
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.310
such as designing user interfaces and experiences, prototyping,

12
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.360
data modeling,

13
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.180
exploiting business data analytics, understand different software

14
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.680
architectures, and knowledge of off‑the‑shelf solutions.

15
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.990
This is a partial list,

16
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.450
but it gives you an idea of the kinds of skills and

17
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.340
capabilities you should also have.

18
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.360
In addition to the ones I've just mentioned, I just can't stress this

19
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.210
enough. To me, soft skills are the most important,

20
00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.880
such as oral and written communication skills,

21
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.570
interpersonal consultative, and facilitation skills. As

22
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.770
you will see in the next module, solid,

23
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.780
healthy, and productive professional relationships based on

24
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.490
communication and interpersonal skills are your secret weapon in

25
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.140
developing requirements that added value to the business.

26
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.850
Also, analytical thinking and problem solving,

27
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.080
being detail oriented and capable of delivering a high level of accuracy,

28
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.350
organizational skills, and knowledge of the

29
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.640
business structure of where you work.

30
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.280
Here are a few more soft skill must haves, stakeholder analysis.

31
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.590
You need to seek out the stakeholders who have a vested interest in the

32
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.400
requirements with which the project is concerned.

33
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.000
Requirements engineering refers to the process of defining,

34
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.070
documenting, and maintaining requirements in the design process.

35
00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.140
We're going to talk a lot about that. Cost benefit analysis.

36
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.810
That's a systematic approach to estimating the strengths

37
00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.800
and weaknesses of alternatives used to determine the best

38
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.800
options. Process modeling.

39
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.590
Now that's the activity of representing processes in an enterprise so that the

40
00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.720
current process may be analyzed, improved, and automated.

41
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.920
If you're not very technical,

42
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.460
you should still have a general understanding of networks, databases, and

43
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.260
the latest technology, just Google the top five technology innovations

44
00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.550
about once a month and do a little reading and,

45
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.030
of course, much more.

46
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:27.000
This is just a partial list to give you the basics of soft skills I believe you must have.
