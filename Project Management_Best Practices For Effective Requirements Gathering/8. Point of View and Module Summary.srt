1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:05,540
Here is my point of view and module summary.

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:10,010
There may be an organizational influence on the business analyst's role.

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:14,370
For example, the BA is organizationally with the product and the product owner,

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,850
so you are reporting into that organization.

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:22,280
Or the BA is organizationally in the information technology organization, okay?

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,520
Or in some companies,

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,180
the business analysts are organized under the finance

8
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,910
organization under the CFO and maybe also in a project

9
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,540
management office also known as the PMO.

10
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,230
All three work, and there's no right a wrong way.

11
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:36,740
Every company is different.

12
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,680
If you have an affinity to the business,

13
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,260
then you might prefer working in the product organization

14
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,000
and partnering with the product owner.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,430
I have found that product owners need the most help

16
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:47,550
than any other role on the agile team.

17
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,280
And if you have an affinity to IT and technology,

18
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,550
then I would suggest you work within the IT or

19
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:54,280
technology part of the organization.

20
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,100
And lastly,

21
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,530
if you come from a business or MBA background, working closely

22
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,150
with the CFO or finance part of a company may be more rewarding

23
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:05,590
as well. Consider your professional passion when choosing your

24
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:09,040
next position in a company.

25
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,640
Here's my point of view, thoughts, and opinions.

26
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,250
Do you need a scrum master?

27
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:13,980
Personally,

28
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:18,210
I think agile scrum teams can learn the role of the scrum master easily.

29
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:18,620
Now,

30
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,710
if you are in a large company and have 50 agile teams, then

31
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:24,820
certainly having a few scrum masters ensuring all the teams are

32
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,540
following the scrum process makes sense.

33
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,170
Who makes the best product owner?

34
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:31,570
Certainly someone who really knows the business and can

35
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:34,040
devote the time and attention to your project.

36
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,860
Since that's not always the case,

37
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,420
you have a great opportunity to jump in and really

38
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,460
help the product owner be successful.

39
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,270
Can't find the right business analyst role in your company?

40
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,360
Well, go make that role. Be proactive.

41
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,240
Suggest to your management the role you think would add value to the business.

42
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,310
You will be surprised on how easy it is to chart your own

43
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,640
path in your company. But focus on how your recommendation

44
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,780
will add value. And good luck.

45
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,960
Now, you might want to check out my Pluralsight

46
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,610
course, The Technical Business Analyst,

47
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:07,010
where I go into great detail about the skills you need to be a very

48
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:13,070
successful business analyst in today's world. In this module,

49
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:16,290
we covered how the business analysts can contribute to requirements

50
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:19,790
development for a new product, and here are the key takeaways.

51
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:23,600
We discussed the composition of the agile product team and how the BA

52
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,490
is a member of that team, though the BA's membership on the agile lean

53
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:31,810
dev teams is underrepresented, in my opinion .Normalizing the product

54
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:35,530
backlog. We learned that the product backlog can have all sorts of

55
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,760
odds and ends in it,

56
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,140
and that the business analysts can normalize those odds and ends

57
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,660
into succinct user stories that can be understood by the product

58
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,910
owner and the technical developers.

59
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:49,060
There are some other benefits to normalizing the backlog as well.

60
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,520
Besides creating quality user stories,

61
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,600
the process itself to normalize the user stories is a mechanism for

62
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,570
you to learn even more about the business domain and to further

63
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:01,580
illuminate the product owner's understanding of the requirements.

64
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,610
For user stories to be effective,

65
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:07,770
they need to follow the user story template, the three parts being the role,

66
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:11,630
the goal, and the benefit. Use INVEST as a checklist or a

67
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,820
mechanism to develop better user stories,

68
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:18,040
resulting in better outcomes, thus yielding more value to the business.

69
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,910
No matter where you are organizationally in your company,

70
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:24,170
you will have the best success with your projects by partnering

71
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:28,640
closely with your product owner. Up next,

72
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,480
gather requirements for the business unit.

73
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:37,000
This is where we take a broader view of requirements gathering. I'll see you there.
