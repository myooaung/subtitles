00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:05,490
The BA's role and responsibilities on an agile, lean team.

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,030
In my own experiences,

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:12,610
I typically have not seen BAs in general as regular members of agile teams.

4
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,940
The BA role seems to be played by the developers themselves,

5
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,210
and to a greater extent, the dev lead.

6
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,500
That's okay, but sadly and mistakenly,

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,120
the BA role has either been overlooked or

8
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,740
inadequately resourced on agile, lean teams.

9
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,600
This section will outline where the BA's role will give

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,140
you the biggest bang for the buck.

11
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,920
Here are the typical responsibilities of the business

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,490
analyst as an agile or lean team member.

13
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,300
As a member of an agile, lean team design,

14
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,960
a BA role should be considered for every team.

15
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,030
It may not be relevant for every team,

16
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,160
but the BA role should at least be considered.

17
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,690
Based on the nature of the makeup of the team,

18
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,360
the complexities of the user stories, and your available resources,

19
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,350
sharing a BA across multiple teams is an option,

20
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:01,460
certainly, just like a DBA or QA role may not be full time either.

21
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,570
So you usually have a full‑time core team and some other

22
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:07,220
members adding value as needed by the core team.

23
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,320
The BA as a part time member.

24
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,980
So in a perfect world,

25
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:14,310
the dev team is one single group of people performing

26
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,690
multiple iterations and getting more efficient,

27
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:19,810
that is, improving their velocity with every iteration.

28
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:24,360
A BA may be on several agile teams working part time on each.

29
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,940
I think this is a great value, helps manage limited budgets,

30
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,690
and adds value to the business.

31
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:32,420
But that is not how it usually is in the real world.

32
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:35,800
Resources vary and the business analyst skillsets vary,

33
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,250
therefore,

34
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,970
be flexible in how you allocate your business analyst

35
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,240
resources for an agile or lean team.

36
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,110
The BA needs to really focus on supporting the team to deliver

37
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:47,910
features and components to add value to the customer.

38
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:51,320
This helps increase the value of the BA to be on the team.

39
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,850
Quickly and efficiently focus on resolving any issues or

40
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:57,030
questions on features and user stories.

41
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,810
The software engineers will greatly appreciate your

42
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,930
effort, and further respect you.

43
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:06,490
If there are budget or resource issues, you want the software engineers to say,

44
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:09,330
hey, please don't take my business analyst away,

45
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,440
they remove requirements roadblocks and make my life easier.

46
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,370
The BA role may fluctuate over time as requirement needs will

47
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,260
vary during the lifecycle of a project.

48
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,810
The BA is interfacing with the product owner to track down and

49
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,320
resolve any questions on business rules,

50
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,900
requirements, user stories, and priorities.

51
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,190
Now let's talk a little more about the relationship

52
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:35,340
of the BA and the product owner.

53
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:40,230
In this example, we have the business analyst partnering with the product owner.

54
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:43,880
The product owner fulfills the product owner role completely,

55
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,380
and the business analyst augments the product owner's role when

56
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,570
they are too busy or away from the office,

57
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:52,070
such as providing additional business analysis for

58
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:54,390
improving the backlog items' quality.

59
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,260
Furthermore,

60
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,940
the business analyst works with the product owner and other key

61
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:01,110
business experts to clarify requirements and user stories.

62
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:03,640
Executives and senior managers will typically describe

63
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,570
requirements in large and fuzzy epics, and hence,

64
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:09,660
the BAs will perform more analysis to deliver more

65
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,750
granularity on the epics and the user stories.

66
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:16,030
This is essential for the success of the development team, certainly.

67
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,120
You can't program fuzzy requirements.

68
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,780
Also,

69
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,890
they can perform analysis to validate priorities as set by the product owner.

70
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:25,520
The product owner may make some quick priority swags,

71
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,600
and then you, the BA,

72
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,820
can further determine what priorities would be the best for the business.

73
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,580
Develop rough estimates for backlog items.

74
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,190
Estimates are key in helping product owners prioritize work.

75
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:39,200
It greatly helps in giving them a relative value for each.

76
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,230
And lastly,

77
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,630
represent the product owner in agile and lean

78
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,410
planning activities such as standups.

79
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:48,770
This keeps the project moving forward when the product owner is busy elsewhere.

80
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,020
In this situation,

81
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:53,520
the BA is either reporting to this business organization or

82
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,140
maybe is on loan from the IT department.

83
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:02,320
Now I will illustrate how I see the level of effort of a business analyst

84
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,960
interacting with the agile process flow with the product owner,

85
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,630
so ideas, concepts,

86
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:11,970
very chunky epics and lucid‑defined features and requirements in business terms.

87
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:15,230
The BA is helping the product owner convey and relate

88
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,140
this information to the dev team.

89
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,740
When designing the agile project,

90
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,910
the BA will be able to describe the idea or concept with some

91
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,690
detail at the epic level and in business terms.

92
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,790
When designing the agile releases,

93
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:30,150
the BA will be able to describe and explain user stories with

94
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,910
conciseness in business terms and help lay out the features or user

95
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:36,280
stories to be included in each release.

96
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,310
When designing the agile iteration,

97
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:41,490
the BA should be able to describe and explain user stories

98
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,190
with conciseness in business terms, and which users

99
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,070
stories can be in each iteration.

100
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:49,150
And with daily work, to be able to answer requirements,

101
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,510
questions or issues about the user stories.

102
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:54,600
Now, the brightness of the orange represents the level of

103
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,060
effort of the BA in this process flow, brighter on the left,

104
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,290
and less so as you move to the right.

105
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,740
On the left moving right,

106
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,720
it is likely that the BA will spend more time with the product

107
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,200
owner and in project and release planning,

108
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,680
and less in iteration and daily work planning.

109
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,230
On the left, we have more pure business and on the right more pure technology,

110
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:14,460
hence,

111
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,820
the BA is supporting and enhancing the translation of those

112
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,810
business requirements into technical implementations.

113
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:23,470
Since business people are great at business and technical

114
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:25,580
people are great at highly technical activities,

115
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:33,000
it allows an opportunity for the business analyst to bridge the gap between the business and the technologists.
