00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.820
Here are a few quick tips on enhancing your collaboration

2
00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.740
experiences with your stakeholders.

3
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:09.860
Here are my useful tips.

4
00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.700
As appropriate, regular standups please.

5
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.440
The more communication and opportunity for feedback

6
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.180
with your teammates and stakeholders,

7
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.800
the better the collaboration and productive outcomes.

8
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.640
Prepare ahead for each meeting.

9
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.440
Write and distribute an agenda and expected outcomes of your meeting.

10
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.890
Have a clear purpose and outcome for each meeting.

11
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.880
Why have a meeting if you don't know what you want?

12
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.280
Listen and empathize.

13
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.830
Hey, you may not always agree with what's being said,

14
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.570
but listen, empathize,

15
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.090
and try to understand where they're coming from and

16
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.560
why they need what they need.

17
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.340
You will be surprised when you really listen, you can learn a lot.

18
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.990
Document thoroughly the outcomes of your collaborations.

19
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.680
Yes, it's a bit of extra work, but trust me,

20
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.580
it goes a long way in building trust with your stakeholders,

21
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.580
and it shows you listened, it shows you care,

22
00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.760
and it shows you are a professional.

23
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.610
This is an easy one.

24
00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.940
Just eliminate techie talk unless you're talking to, well, techies.

25
00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.090
That really turns off non‑techie stakeholders,

26
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.140
so be self‑aware, and if they don't understand what you're saying,

27
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.340
what's the point?

28
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.080
Here's a few more useful tips.

29
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.750
Provide feedback and notes by the next day.

30
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.770
Don't wait too long on your collaborations.

31
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.550
That could be refined specs, status reports,

32
00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.370
updated presentations, and the like.

33
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.880
Deliver information that's in the form that is understood by the stakeholder,

34
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.680
typically in business terms.

35
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.050
Again, avoid techie talk in your documents unless the recipient is technical.

36
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.210
Know your audience and your stakeholders, and try to use their terminology.

37
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.860
Before any collaborations, try and understand who will be attending,

38
00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.130
what their role is, and what they want out of this particular activity.

39
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.160
Review or update your stakeholder prep document that we discussed earlier.

40
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.440
Add and update any information to it.

41
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.500
Demonstrate positive encouragement.

42
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.140
Now, don't go overboard, certainly,

43
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.040
but be supportive of the ultimate outcome even if you

44
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.350
differ on the approach to get there.

45
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.680
At impasses, strive for compromise.

46
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.560
Try and never leave a meeting with bad feelings.

47
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.480
If you don't agree and have not arrived at a compromise,

48
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.660
that is okay, put it on the agenda for the next meeting,

49
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.720
but maybe even reach out later after the meeting with a phone call to

50
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.740
further discuss before the next full working meeting.

51
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.010
Always try to create an environment of trust.

52
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.340
Trust is gold.

53
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.340
Don't ever make a decision that would degrade the trust that they have in you.

54
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.150
Remember our analysis framework from the last module?

55
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.980
This is now a best practice for you and your team to use,

56
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.450
so we could name this best practice stakeholder

57
00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.320
collaboration tips and add it to our framework.

58
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.420
This works for any business context, certainly.

59
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.340
Every time I create a new artifact in the progress of my

60
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.000
work that I deem important and usable, I add it to my framework, and you can do the same as well.
