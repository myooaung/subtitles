1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:08,930
Apply the "Right" Level of Effort. And what I mean by that is be lean.

2
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:12,640
Lean is when you eliminate waste and optimize your work.

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,040
So you want to keep this in mind when developing your

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,140
analysis processes and best practices framework.

5
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:22,560
I have seen so many times when the philosophy is one size fits all.

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,150
So no matter what the task or activity assigned,

7
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,770
they use the same templates, tools or whatever.

8
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:34,340
Be creative and use the right level of effort for each analysis context type.

9
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:38,230
Apply the right level of effort for each context type.

10
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:41,150
So we have our analysis activities, Gather,

11
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:41,740
Specify,

12
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:45,250
Analyze & Recommend, and then we have our business context types

13
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,100
along the top, System or Product, Business Unit,

14
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,040
and sometimes we use the term program, Enterprise,

15
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,200
and sometimes we use the term strategic. At the intersection of

16
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,340
the analysis activity and the business context,

17
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,870
the analysts will apply their best practices in the

18
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:01,830
most optimal and efficient manner.

19
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:05,530
So in that intersection or cell, you will have listed your tools,

20
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:06,620
templates, presentations,

21
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:11,340
etc. that best support a lean approach to the requirements development process.

22
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,170
Maybe this is all in Confluence or SharePoint for easy access

23
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,140
and maintainability by your whole team.

24
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:17,720
Obviously,

25
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,330
you could extend this model any way you see fit.

26
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,960
Here is a simple framework example.

27
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,220
We have chosen the view the world by analysis activity versus business

28
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,210
context, and wherever they meet will reside all of the artifacts,

29
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,340
processes, templates,

30
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,920
etc. that we need. Now you can choose to view the world any way you want,

31
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,660
and it could map to and reflect how your company is organized and

32
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:46,410
operated. And you can see at the intersection of the Analysis Activity

33
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:50,310
and Business Context are things like backlog templates and Agile

34
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,740
analysis process documents and materials,

35
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,150
maybe stakeholder presentation materials,

36
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:58,060
system design template with workflows and state diagrams,

37
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:58,970
etc.

38
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:03,040
Let's see how we might extend this framework.

39
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,250
Here's a product or system example.

40
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,390
You can extend this model as you see fit. In this case, we will find

41
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:14,350
the top access to represent operational work based on ticket sizes. We

42
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:18,160
decompose ticket activity into three areas, from a ticket where the

43
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,840
estimated work is less than 24 hours, tickets between 24 and 40 hours,

44
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,560
and tickets over 40 hours, which, in fact, could even be projects.

45
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,960
These intersection cells are not dumping grounds

46
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,280
for a bunch of bloated documents.

47
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,710
They contain only what's needed, including process templates,

48
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,180
backlog templates, etc.

49
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,440
Always think lean, only what you need, not too much and not too little.

50
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,670
Maybe in another case,

51
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,690
we want to look at the vertical access of Analysis

52
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,450
Activities. And instead of Gather, Specify,

53
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:52,100
Analyze & Recommend, maybe there's other elements in there or

54
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:57,990
decompositions of those that are shown. Here is a short list of

55
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:01,300
potential candidate framework items, checklists,

56
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:05,890
templates, and samples, recommended tools to use, best practices,

57
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:10,350
artifacts from previous projects, training required, Agile iteration

58
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:14,210
templates and structure, continuously update and improve the

59
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:16,840
repository for the framework at all times.

60
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,430
I am sure you have tons of artifacts that could be used or reused

61
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,830
and improved so that you can quickly jump start any activity you

62
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,830
have and apply Lean to your own processes.

63
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:30,150
Can you imagine how helpful this can be for new hires or

64
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:39,000
new people transferring into your team? A common flexible framework is lean and supports an agile environment.
