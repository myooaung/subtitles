00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:02.880
Driving Epics to Backlogs.

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.310
In this module, we'll take our business unit requirements,

3
00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:07.960
which are equivalent to epics,

4
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:14.740
and see how we decompose them into user stories ready for the backlogs.

5
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.620
Driving epics into organizational backlogs.

6
00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.170
From a program or business unit perspective, we have the chunkier epics.

7
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.980
Your role will be to drive those down into features and user stories.

8
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.610
Next, you will review your collection of user stories and will push,

9
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.550
that is, assign those into agile team backlogs.

10
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.930
So you will refine epics into features and user stories.

11
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.750
Now they are more concrete and will give implementation

12
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.540
teams something to really work with.

13
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.670
Now this part is hard.

14
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.190
It will take meetings, workshops, workflow diagrams,

15
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.030
and all your BA tools to make this happen.

16
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.550
Next,

17
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.390
you will map the features and user stories to the appropriate

18
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.040
organizational or application backlogs.

19
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.530
Remember,

20
00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.400
epics are at a program level and will span multiple

21
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.440
departments with potentially multiple agile teams.

22
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.600
So not only do you need keen business analytical skills but also a

23
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.950
rich appreciation and knowledge of the organization to ensure the

24
00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.040
right teams are doing the right work.

25
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.910
We have our program requirements on the left from a couple of sections ago,

26
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.480
and it was determined by the program manager,

27
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.820
stakeholders,

28
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.820
and business analysts that we have three business unit

29
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.390
requirements: Increase order revenue, improve customer order stickiness,

30
00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.380
and equal the competition for ease of ordering.

31
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.900
And we determined that it would affect, that is,

32
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.470
require changes to four systems: The vehicle order system,

33
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.310
order management system, vehicle allocation system,

34
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.970
and the dealer customer support operation center.

35
00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.940
And we also performed stakeholder preparation for each of

36
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.620
the four applications on the right.

37
00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.740
Well, now we're ready to take the next step.

38
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.860
Let's look at an example of translating epics to features to user stories.

39
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.010
Here is one of our business unit or program requirements.

40
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.660
I am equating those to the epic level of our requirement

41
00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.050
definitions I laid out in the previous section.

42
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.240
Epic 1: Increase order revenue.

43
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.720
Well, through your analysis and talking with your customers and stakeholders,

44
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.430
this will drive three features.

45
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.280
Feature 1: Enable the ordering of accessories when

46
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.160
the dealer is ordering motorbikes.

47
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.490
Feature 2: Dealers can only order twice a year; enable

48
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.340
dealers to order every two months.

49
00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.520
And Feature 3: Enable dealers to see the competitor's motorbike model

50
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.930
sales by dealer region while ordering motorbikes.

51
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.240
That may really help them increase orders.

52
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.740
Now those in turn will drive our user stories.

53
00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.390
Now you can see my naming scheme.

54
00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.420
So I can trace a user story back to an epic.

55
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.280
At the conclusion of your analysis,

56
00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.790
you have decomposed the three epics into several features and

57
00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.930
each feature down into multiple user stories.

58
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.260
The analysts, the application stakeholders,

59
00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.190
and the agile team should have all a uniformed

60
00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.840
understanding of the requirements.

61
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:50.660
And, if not,

62
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.160
then you'll need another meeting or workshop to work out the details.

63
00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:00.640
You want everyone on the same page before you make any backlog assignments.

64
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.760
Key nonfunctional implementation analysis.

65
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.850
That's a lot of words.

66
00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.740
But in your typical BA role,

67
00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.490
you've been spending time analyzing business requirements and developing epics,

68
00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:11.800
features, and user stories.

69
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.950
Great, perfect!

70
00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.150
I also see another additional and very important role for

71
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.040
a program or business unit analyst.

72
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.560
You will need to analyze how best to implement your

73
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.000
epics in the most optimal way. Okay, let's look at some ideas in the next section.
