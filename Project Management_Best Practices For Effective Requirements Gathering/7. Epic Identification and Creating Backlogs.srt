1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,560
Now let's go into more detail with Epic

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:07,300
Identification and Creating Epic Backlogs.

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,260
Translating themes to epics,

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,780
your main job would be to identify and describe epics from

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,910
the theme or themes you are assigned.

6
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:18,530
You will likely be on a team, well, I certainly hope so.

7
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:20,940
That is definitely a team activity to do.

8
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,660
You may be with stakeholders, subject‑matter experts,

9
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,810
product managers, analysts, IT experts, or others.

10
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:30,430
Remember, themes are high level and usually fuzzy and,

11
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,140
therefore, need a lot of refinement.

12
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,270
So you and your team will perform what I call normal requirements

13
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:38,100
gathering‑‑analyze and document requirements further,

14
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,610
validate and prioritize requirements further.

15
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:45,200
This activity, though, may not be suited for detail‑oriented analysts.

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,010
Epics are still very high level,

17
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,950
and you'll be working more with visionaries and not nuts and bolts stakeholders.

18
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,560
Suffice it to say, there'll be a lot of talking,

19
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,770
fact finding, business case development,

20
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,140
timelines, budgets, and all that going on.

21
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,730
Here are a few more activities you will be doing.

22
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,600
You will be using all your business analysis tools

23
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,660
that you are already familiar with.

24
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:08,130
Workshops.

25
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:12,410
I find I get the most out of stakeholders when you roll up your sleeves

26
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:15,200
and get on a white board and really brainstorm ideas.

27
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,460
I do find it a bit harder to do this activity remotely with video conferences,

28
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,540
but do what you can.

29
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,990
Workflow and data modeling.

30
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,750
For me, workflow means process, and everything has a process side to it.

31
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:26,910
And, of course, data.

32
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:28,620
Without data, we have nothing.

33
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,960
Business and technical architecture modeling.

34
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,580
I look at this as sketching out some high‑level building

35
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:36,240
blocks that may become part of the underlying platform

36
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,620
supporting one or more epics.

37
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,220
High‑level cost estimates.

38
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,240
Without estimates,

39
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,440
your stakeholders will have a tougher time prioritizing your epics.

40
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,110
Incremental reviews with stakeholders.

41
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:48,630
Hold as many stand‑ups and review meetings as possible.

42
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,700
Error on the side of more, not less.

43
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,570
Communications.

44
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:56,160
Always keep everyone up to date with regular status and presentations.

45
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,270
And you'll be roughing out implementation opportunities and options as well.

46
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,790
And business cases of course.

47
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:05,200
Just because you figured out a few epics does not mean it makes sense to

48
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,370
implement if there's not a sufficient business case to do so.

49
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,850
The outcome of doing these things at the epic

50
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:13,240
enterprise level is they will be high level,

51
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,590
less detailed, and may give some of you an unsettling sense since you,

52
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:20,530
if you're like me, like specificity over fuzz.

53
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:24,130
But I have learned over the years to like and appreciate things at a high level.

54
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:27,360
It's important to feel good and comfortable about high‑level,

55
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,040
fuzzy requirements because that's what executives usually like to give us.

56
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,090
Let's now prioritize our epics.

57
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,250
Now you have your compiled lists of epics.

58
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,810
How do you know which ones to do?

59
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:43,580
Just like any other backlog, you will need to rank or prioritize each one.

60
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,860
Every organization or department will be different,

61
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:49,190
so come up with your own criteria to support a common

62
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:51,450
process of prioritizing your epics.

63
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,830
Keep it simple, lean, and agile.

64
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:58,830
You do not want long, drawn‑out estimates or research but a quick way to decide.

65
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,700
So maybe look at value.

66
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,040
What is the potential value of doing this epic?

67
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,610
What is the level of effort?

68
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:07,310
What are the risks of doing or not doing this epic?

69
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:10,890
And what's the estimated ROI, or return on investment?

70
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,990
Now this is just a short starter list.

71
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:18,210
It will be up to you or the portfolio management team to come up with one

72
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:23,120
and only one criteria so that then you can ensure that all epic backlogs

73
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,440
have been prioritized fairly and equitably.

74
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,970
Now that we have our epics, let's keep it going to features and user stories.

75
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:36,100
A prioritized and approved epic is pulled off the backlog.

76
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,220
It is assigned to an epic owner.

77
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,580
Now that could be a program or project manager,

78
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:43,450
maybe a business unit manager or business analyst.

79
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:47,000
Their portfolio management office manages and tracks all epics,

80
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,840
as we discussed previously.

81
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,580
Now let's get from epic to feature and user story.

82
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:55,670
The BA supports and guides development of the features and user stories.

83
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:59,080
The BA may join the team or only act as an adviser.

84
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,890
Now we go from user story to software development.

85
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:06,240
The BA may join the agile dev team or maybe just be an adviser.

86
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,040
There are countless combinations that may work.

87
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,670
Different skills and varying resources will drive the types

88
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:15,150
of assignment a business analyst may get.

89
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,660
Now everyone is down to doing the real work,

90
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:23,240
so we made it from theme all the way down to code.

91
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,940
Let's do a visual recap.

92
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:29,380
Here are our sources and stakeholders for themes such as Board of Directors,

93
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,350
Executives, etc.

94
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,270
They drive our themes,

95
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:35,480
some business and some architectural and technology oriented.

96
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,620
Let's take Theme A.

97
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,010
That will drive a backlog of epics.

98
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,540
Now let's take Epic 2.

99
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,940
That will drive a backlog of features.

100
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:46,750
Now let's take Feature 4, and that will drive our list of user stories.

101
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,530
Hopefully,

102
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:51,740
all this can be generated automatically by some great cloud‑based tools,

103
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:56,000
like Jira and countless others. So check those out.
