1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,540
What's a requirement?

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:08,190
A requirement is a description of what a system is supposed to

3
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:10,940
do. Now, can it get any easier than that?

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:14,670
Then why is it so challenging and take so much energy to

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,430
figure out which requirements are the right ones that will add

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,800
the most value? Because it is hard,

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,660
takes discipline, and you need a solid process and the right soft

8
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:28,680
skills for your success. Categories of requirements.

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,930
There is a world of requirements, and they come in all shapes and sizes,

10
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:35,540
and it would be impossible for me to list all the

11
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,030
different types of requirements.

12
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:40,110
So I narrowed it down to these categories for the sake

13
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,570
of this course. The first, strategic.

14
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,860
These are quite large, big picture,

15
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:48,080
long‑term and critical for the success of an enterprise.

16
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:53,400
An example, we need to integrate wearable devices into your product offerings.

17
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,790
Next, is epics. For me, several epics can fulfill a strategic initiative.

18
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:01,640
An example, create a mobile app that integrates with a

19
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,500
fitness watch of brand X. And lastly,

20
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,520
features. Again, as we move down this slide,

21
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,000
there is more granularity. An example, our mobile app can

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,190
connect and share data with fitness watch brand X.

23
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:18,040
I wanted to show you that a requirement can be quite broad and vague.

24
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,870
Yet as a strategic requirement down to a very

25
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:24,890
detailed description with a feature, the requirement spectrum is a big,

26
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,340
juicy grayscale.

27
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,800
Take a moment and reflect as to where you spend most of

28
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,000
your analysis time on this grayscale.

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,040
The three modules at the end of this course will focus on these

30
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,320
three categories or requirements context and how to handle each

31
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,140
to add value to the business.

32
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,630
The result of your requirements analysis has a significant and

33
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:50,000
far‑reaching impact on your organization such as making quality,

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,820
value‑based business decisions. Make versus buy.

35
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,660
Should we make something internal or buy it from the outside or

36
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:01,570
maybe both? System software development. Will what you provide

37
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:04,710
enable the software and system development teams to build in the

38
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:07,780
most effective way? Go/no‑go.

39
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:11,630
Should we even do this strategy, epic or feature? It is just as

40
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:15,430
important to say no if it will not add value or you need some more

41
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,160
analysis time. Estimates and schedules.

42
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,120
Yes, I know they sound boring,

43
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,640
but management needs to know, at least roughly, how much

44
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,080
it will cost and when will they get it?

45
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,620
Even in the Agile world,

46
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:32,220
management needs to have some idea. Budgets and capital allocations.

47
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,740
My same comment here, may sound boring,

48
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,320
but management needs to know. So you can see that the results

49
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:42,000
of your hard work is so important in providing the necessary

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,040
information the business needs.

51
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,710
I truly believe that how you gather, specify,

52
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:53,360
analyze, and recommend requirements can make or break a company, that

53
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,660
is garbage in, garbage out, right? Your software development teams are

54
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:01,870
ingesting your requirements to develop applications. Again, that is

55
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:05,140
why your role as an analyst is so important and critical to the

56
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,760
success of an organization.

57
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:16,000
And that is why you need to have a solid analysis framework, processes, and good soft skills, and this course will help you get there.
