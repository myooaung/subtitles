1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,540
We have talked about business themes,

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:09,940
and now let's turn our attention to architectural and technology themes.

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,610
So what about architectural and technology themes?

4
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,390
We have focused on business themes, which makes sense,

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,590
and most themes are likely to be business themes or business theme oriented.

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,570
But today, no business should ignore architectural and technology themes.

7
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:28,220
Technology is, or is becoming, the heart and soul of every business.

8
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:29,030
And in fact,

9
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:35,540
architectural themes are required for the success of business themes today.

10
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:40,080
So it really boils down to this, what architectural or technology do you need

11
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,030
in place so that your business themes will be successful?

12
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:46,340
It is likely that no business theme will succeed without some

13
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:51,240
architectural or technology enablers to support it.

14
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,620
Here are a few architecture and technology examples:

15
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,750
implement remote voice and video corporate wide,

16
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,380
and maybe the supports want to more business themes,

17
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:04,080
such as allow all employees to work from home. Enable data storage,

18
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,340
processing, and analytic solutions in the cloud, and this technology

19
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,050
theme supports remote storage for all employees,

20
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:13,540
enabling better data management, working remotely,

21
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,340
and security of corporate data.

22
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:19,280
Roll out all new laptops with the latest OS to all employees.

23
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,340
This theme supports, at a basic fundamental level,

24
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,620
all business themes. Migrate remaining on‑prem computing to the cloud.

25
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:30,080
The cost of operating on‑prem computing keeps going up and up.

26
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,780
And maybe by migrating to the cloud,

27
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,370
we will not only save operational costs, but provide an agile

28
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,940
and cost effective platform for our future.

29
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,270
Typically, architectural themes are large,

30
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:44,030
complex, and require major investments and management oversight

31
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:48,680
using portfolio management. Business themes,

32
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:53,920
as you know, drive business epics, and tech themes drive tech epics.

33
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,600
So all themes drive epics and are placed in the epic backlog.

34
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,340
Typically,

35
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,820
the technical business analysts will assist in the

36
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,640
development of technical epics.

37
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,390
Now the BA also has a role with architecture themes and epics.

38
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:12,270
They will help articulate the architectural and technology

39
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,400
themes to support the business themes.

40
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,270
Of course, timing is important.

41
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,540
If you don't have the technical infrastructure in place,

42
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,700
the business themes will not be fulfilled.

43
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,630
Help translate to architectural technology themes into

44
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,600
epics and ensure they are visible,

45
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,060
estimated, and planned just like business epics.

46
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:32,290
Help translate the architectural and technology epics into features and ensure

47
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:36,550
they are visible, estimated, resourced, and in a release. Help ensure technology

48
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:41,000
features are further translated, refined, and articulated into technical user

49
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,920
stories. And again, your involvement will be heavier in the beginning and will

50
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:51,470
lessen as you move down through to the user stories. You need to ensure tech and

51
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:56,230
business themes are in sync, technically and from a fiduciary responsibility, as

52
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:56,710
well.

53
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,580
The tech teams know their stuff, certainly,

54
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,530
but you need to be sure that the business epics will be implementable

55
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:05,580
via whatever technology or architecture is proposed by the technical

56
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,100
teams. You will convey, describe, translate those business

57
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,330
requirements to the technical teams so they fully understand what the

58
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:16,700
technology theme needs to do, and at the right time. Releases need to

59
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,040
be coordinated.

60
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,500
Also, you will gather timelines, estimates,

61
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:20,880
budgets,

62
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,900
etc. from the tech teams and work with portfolio

63
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:30,000
management to ensure the tech and business themes are in sync with the investment expectations.
