1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,740
The uncertainty of business requirements.

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:08,690
Just what makes requirements so uncertain?

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:09,710
Let's find out.

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:14,520
Poor definition of requirements is one of the major causes of failed software.

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,810
Well, no surprise here.

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:16,930
What may cause this?

7
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:20,490
Lack of experienced analysts, not enough analyst resources,

8
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,930
inadequate interpersonal and interviewing skills,

9
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:27,050
the absence or half‑heartedness of adopting agile and lean processes

10
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,340
for requirements gathering and software development.

11
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,010
Any sound familiar to you?

12
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:34,300
Successful software development is often affected and in

13
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,670
fact hindered by the generally inadequate state of the

14
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,420
process of requirements analysis.

15
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,400
That is why I laid out the lean process and framework to

16
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,370
mitigate these issues in this course.

17
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:48,740
And by the artifacts that make up the requirements,

18
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,870
the documentation, mockups, workflows, data models,

19
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,670
and all the other items you need to clearly and

20
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:56,810
accurately capture the requirements.

21
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:57,290
Also,

22
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,660
the ability of the business analyst who provides the

23
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,410
interpretation of the business rules and requirements,

24
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:07,130
which are then further interpreted by the technical development team.

25
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:09,440
The operative word here is interpretation.

26
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,890
First, the analyst has to interpret the business,

27
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,760
and then the technical team has to interpret from the analyst.

28
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,140
Room for error.

29
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,920
Lastly, the fast‑paced business environments we live in today.

30
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,120
Business is moving so fast,

31
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:26,230
your requirements development process must be lean and agile to

32
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:29,240
address the fast‑paced business environment.

33
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,170
To me,

34
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:33,530
the insufficient process to gather requirements is a

35
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:36,910
major cause of failed software today.

36
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:40,000
The critical role of the BA.

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,430
The business analyst, that is,

38
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,690
the person doing the requirements gathering, must

39
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:46,150
address and understand three key areas.

40
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:48,620
There may be many kinds or roles of users.

41
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,160
The analyst must fully understand and appreciate the

42
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,400
users' needs and expectations,

43
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,370
which, again, are many and varied, based on the roles of the users or

44
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:01,410
customers. There are daily end users, there are the managers of those

45
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,350
users, there are business stakeholders,

46
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,940
the development team, and a host of others.

47
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,280
Also, how well is the problem domain understood?

48
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,640
Is it a complex sales order process?

49
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,090
Is it a multi‑system integration project?

50
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:18,270
It is a migration to a new ERP system? These all require

51
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,500
either a deep and rich knowledge base of the business domain

52
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,740
or the ability to figure it out.

53
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,820
Analysts must clearly understand the business or problem domain to

54
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:31,110
be successful, so working a few extra hours here and there to first

55
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:34,500
fully understand the business, well, that might really pay off.

56
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,590
Lastly, how rigorously,

57
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:39,360
accurately, and succinctly are the requirements

58
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,890
captured in the specification artifacts?

59
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:46,230
Many of the ones I've had to read our are marginal at best. And that is your

60
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:50,570
job too, that is, just how will you document everything. Too little provides

61
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,540
vagueness, and too much may just be a waste of time.

62
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:57,810
Also, don't do too much up front, since requirements get stale over time.

63
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,800
Try and capture quality requirements just when you need

64
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,160
them, also known as just‑in‑time requirements. That is an

65
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,640
agile and lean way of doing it.

66
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,230
I would like to suggest to you that for a new

67
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,610
software system or a major enhancement,

68
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,870
the requirements will not be completely known until

69
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,860
after the users have used it.

70
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:23,910
At first, I thought this was somewhat funny, and then I realized how true it is.

71
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,240
And why is that?

72
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,520
It is because getting to the ultimate system the users want

73
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,240
is an incremental and iterative process.

74
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,250
Always has been, always will be.

75
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,800
And that is why agile and lean approaches have been so successful. By

76
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,780
leveraging agile and lean approaches for requirements gathering itself, you

77
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:47,150
will be more successful in adding value to the business. Because of the

78
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,550
potential shortfalls that we have discussed,

79
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:52,190
the skills of the business analyst, documentation,

80
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,050
domain knowledge,

81
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:56,650
communication skills, and more, we can say the following truism.

82
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:01,480
Uncertainty is inherent and inevitable in software and systems development.

83
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,540
So what can you do about that?

84
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,540
Let's embrace and adapt uncertainty.

85
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,480
Don't fight it.

86
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,320
You will not get all the requirements right, so let's adapt to a new process

87
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:15,300
such as avoid taking big steps, certainly. Frequently stop,

88
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,740
inspect, and adapt. And have the shortest possible

89
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,700
feedback loop to your customer.

90
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,850
Sound familiar?

91
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:26,220
That's agile and scrum and Kanban and maybe some other methodologies

92
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:33,550
as well. As I've been saying, agile and lean reduces uncertainty. By

93
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,480
adopting agile and lean approaches,

94
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,350
tools, and techniques such as scrum and Kanban into your

95
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:41,520
requirements development process, you can minimize but not

96
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,550
eliminate the uncertainty of the requirements and greatly

97
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,910
improve the quality of the requirements.

98
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,700
A major tenet of this module is to use agile and lean

99
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,390
approaches to requirements gathering. You will be more

100
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,920
successful at adding value to the business.

101
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,580
Now here are two of my Pluralsight courses that tie

102
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,350
right into what we're talking about,

103
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:03,300
so you may want to check them out. Kanban for Agile/Scrum Practitioners

104
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,370
and also Developing Effective Agile Sprint Plans.

105
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:11,500
Both can be directly applied to the requirements process, as well as, if

106
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:17,000
you're a business analyst on an agile or Kanban team, this will greatly help you.
