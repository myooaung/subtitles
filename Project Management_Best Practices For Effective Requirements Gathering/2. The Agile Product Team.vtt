00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.240
Let's talk about the Agile product team. In general,

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.320
this is how an Agile team works.

3
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.170
There is no ideal size.

4
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.930
So do what works for you.

5
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.160
Typically, three or four, maybe even up to seven or so, again,

6
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.840
no hard and fast rules, but this range seems to work best.

7
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.160
The backlog of user stories is owned by the product manager.

8
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.870
They are in control of fine tune and prioritize the

9
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.380
backlog, potentially in each standup. Members of the team

10
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.970
define, build, and test user stories.

11
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.480
This is the main activity, and more importantly, drive value to the business.

12
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.370
Work is performed in iterations,

13
00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.010
typically in 2‑week iterations for Agile/Scrum‑type projects.

14
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.430
But with Kanban, there is no notion of an iteration.

15
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.500
And if you are intrigued by this, check out my Kanban courses here,

16
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.210
at Pluralsight.

17
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.170
Now, each iteration produces working and functioning user stories,

18
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.830
but those stories may not be immediately given to the customer.

19
00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.790
There may be one or more iterations in a release that is software deployed

20
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.970
to users. So a release maybe one iteration and then deployed to the users

21
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.000
or several iterations and then released that is deployed to the customers.

22
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.270
Of all these items listed, each team will have slight variations and

23
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.090
cadences that work for them, but you get the idea.

24
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.360
It is quite simple and brilliant. Hidden in the last slide were

25
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.200
several Agile team roles, and here are the Agile team roles

26
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.560
required for the success of your team.

27
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.190
The product owner or stakeholder may represent a line of

28
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.210
business, steering committee, department or other segments of

29
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.090
the user or customer communities.

30
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.690
The product owner needs to express the items clearly in the backlog so

31
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.270
they are understandable by the development team and prioritize them so the

32
00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.480
development team knows what to work on next.

33
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.700
Now expressing those items clearly is definitely a challenge for product owners,

34
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.830
and that's where you come in, the BA, but more on that later in this

35
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.480
module. Then we have the Agile development team.

36
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.410
Development teams are cross‑functional and working concurrently.

37
00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.930
I want to emphasize this since in the traditional project model,

38
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:03.390
typically,

39
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.190
code is developed, then tested, and then moved into pre‑production

40
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.510
environments as separate teams and/or processes.

41
00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:13.340
The Agile/Lean team is working together concurrently

42
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.190
throughout the development process,

43
00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.160
very important. In the Agile/Scrum world, the Scrum Master role is

44
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.460
facilitating the adherence to the Agile/Scrum process,

45
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.640
and the team is self‑directed, that is without a team leader.

46
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.560
What I have seen in practice more often,

47
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.050
though, is that there is no Scrum Master,

48
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.030
but instead either maybe a project manager or a line

49
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.470
manager or maybe a technical lead. In fact,

50
00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.460
technical lead is most common.

51
00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.770
Those roles may still provide the Agile process guidance, or another way of

52
00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.610
saying it is the Agile development team will simply monitor itself.

53
00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.880
Personally, I prefer this. Without a Scrum Master, I do save on budget, and

54
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.400
the team is self‑directed and doing just fine.

55
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.540
Now let's drill into the product owner or stakeholder role.

56
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.050
Here are the key product owner roles and responsibilities.

57
00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.830
The product owners are representatives from the business,

58
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.550
a focal point for the business, and are sometimes called the stakeholder.

59
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.680
And I do like that term the best.

60
00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.390
It sounds more accountable.

61
00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.110
They also determine requirements.

62
00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.610
They basically know what they want and when they want it,

63
00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.420
or at least technically speaking,

64
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.410
they should. They list the requirements into a backlog.

65
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.120
The backlog is the list of requirements they would like implemented at a

66
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.680
point in time since the backlog list is dynamic and potentially changing.

67
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.170
They also prioritize them in the right order,

68
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.940
and the order can change based on the needs of the business at any time.

69
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.860
This role helps to simplify the development team's work by collecting up the

70
00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.940
requirements and having a deeper understanding of them.

71
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.730
The product owner focuses the team on the backlog.

72
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.590
That is where all the action is.

73
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.090
The world revolves around the backlog.

74
00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.320
The backlog is driving business value or it's not in the backlog.

75
00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.400
The product owner works daily with the team,

76
00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.710
as noted in the Agile Manifesto, and usually through daily standups.

77
00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:01.670
As you can see,

78
00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.770
the product owner has a very important responsibility.

79
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.590
Continuing with the roles required for success, let's drill

80
00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.740
into the Agile development team.

81
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.500
Here is a sampling of the typical roles I have seen as part of

82
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.170
a development Agile team. Software developer is certainly the

83
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:23.880
most common members of the team.

84
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.760
This includes front‑end developers, back‑end developers,

85
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.680
integration developers, and many other developer skills. Creatives.

86
00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.340
These are team members that design the look and feel,

87
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.660
artwork, and the user experience.

88
00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:36.090
Usually,

89
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.440
the creatives hand off their output to the software developers to

90
00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.090
implement. QA engineers, they will do the testing of the product,

91
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.960
whereas the software engineers will do the unit testing. The QA

92
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.300
engineers will do the end‑to‑end testing and making sure all the

93
00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.890
user stories work properly.

94
00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.480
Data or database engineers will obviously work with data,

95
00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.240
designing databases, moving data, transforming data,

96
00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.000
data analytics, and things like that. And certainly, system

97
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.630
architects. Many times on complex projects, system

98
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.470
architects are certainly required.

99
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:06.120
Also,

100
00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.940
let's not forget business analyst may be part of the dev team as

101
00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.760
well, providing further development or refinement of the user

102
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.850
stories, fill in feature questions,

103
00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.650
doing additional business role research, and the like.

104
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:17.370
Also,

105
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.620
the Agile team roles will vary and be different in just about every

106
00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.190
organization I have seen, which makes sense since skills can be

107
00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.870
different, resources may or may not be available,

108
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.470
and budgets may impact team membership as well.

109
00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:37.000
Now let's drill a little deeper into the BA role on an Agile development team in the next section.
