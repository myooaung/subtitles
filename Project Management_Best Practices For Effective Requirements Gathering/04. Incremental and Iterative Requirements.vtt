00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.500
Let's move on from Waterfall and now talk about

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.740
incremental and iterative requirements.

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.200
Here are just three challenging factors facing analysts

4
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.920
regarding requirements development.

5
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.180
13% of project failures are due to the lack of user input,

6
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.960
12% of project failures for incomplete requirements, and

7
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.600
another 12% for changing requirements,

8
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.130
for a total of almost 40% of all project failures

9
00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.790
tied to requirements development.

10
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:29.250
Well,

11
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.350
we as analysts own a part of that. These alarming numbers caused us to have

12
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.820
to get more creative and become incremental and iterative.

13
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.800
If you want to look at the other statistics from the study I referenced,

14
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.240
please check out the Standish Group's CHAOS Report survey.

15
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.580
Here's the basic definition of incremental. Incremental

16
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.190
requirements development is where you gather and document a

17
00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.890
modest number of requirements.

18
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.000
The developers implement this group of requirements, the

19
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.540
increment, and you observe and verify its outcomes.

20
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.310
Iterative. So an iteration is the repetition of a

21
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.800
process in order to generate an outcome.

22
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.080
Each repetition of the process is a single iteration,

23
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.060
and the outcome of each iteration is in the

24
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.140
starting point of the next iteration.

25
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.430
So to summarize, the increment is the grouping of worker tasks, and

26
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.240
the iteration is the next step in the process.

27
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.760
In the '80s and '90s,

28
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.170
several models came along that improved on the waterfall model and

29
00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.800
are known as the discovery models, spiral, RAD,

30
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.940
which I played a major role in introducing RAD into a major aerospace

31
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.000
company and just love the approach, and lastly, RUP. Okay, let's explore each.
