00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:03.840
The Essential Role of the Business Analyst.

2
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.730
I've seen many cases where the business analyst role is

3
00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.750
underappreciated or deemed not necessary.

4
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.960
That, to me, is a huge mistake and can cost organizations money,

5
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.040
time, and the loss of customers.

6
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.030
I'm sure I don't need to convince you, but you may need to convince others,

7
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:21.410
such as managers or leaders,

8
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.120
that the role of the business analyst is critical to

9
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.240
the success of all businesses.

10
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.040
I hope that some of the material in this course will help you do just that.

11
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.100
It's essential that the business analyst's role is to have a clear,

12
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.640
lean, and agile process to determine requirements that are truly

13
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.170
essential and would add value to the business.

14
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.530
So what I am saying is that in our search for those requirements that add value,

15
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.140
we better have a solid and lean process to do so.

16
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.940
That is the underpinnings of this module and in fact, the entire course.

17
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.690
There are many designations, titles, or monikers of an analyst,

18
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.060
but they should all have the same focus,

19
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.250
adding value to the business. Well,

20
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.240
everyone is an analyst almost every day of their life.

21
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.870
Let's say you want to buy a new TV.

22
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.820
Well, how big? Does it need to be a smart TV?

23
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.400
Will I need a wall bracket?

24
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.630
Will I need delivery?

25
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.440
And, of course, what will it cost?

26
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.550
Is it worth the price?

27
00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.730
Or, in other words, will I get the ROI that I expect, return on investment?

28
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.100
We do things everyday that require our business analysis skills. Of course,

29
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.000
the main title or name of role is business analyst.

30
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.680
But certainly there are others, many others,

31
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.350
such as business architect, process analyst,

32
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.340
systems analyst, project manager, and a host of others. A title as just that,

33
00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.340
a title.

34
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.680
Many people in an organization perform business analysis work every day,

35
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.640
so your title may vary, as well.

36
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:57.240
It is what you do and how you do it that is important, not what you are labeled.

37
00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.530
There are likely as many definitions of business analysis

38
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.600
as there are analysts on the planet, but here is a basic definition.

39
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.630
Business analysis is the practice of adding business value by enabling

40
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.290
change in an organizational context, by defining needs and recommending

41
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.240
solutions that deliver value to stakeholders.

42
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.340
You can't add business value without change, and maybe

43
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.190
even very significant change. Resistance to change may be

44
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.940
a headwind to your activities, so be aware of that,

45
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:26.560
please.

46
00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.940
The critical outcome or mission of your work is adding value to the

47
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.020
business through changing the way business is conducted.

48
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.500
Don't forget that. That should be your elevator soundbite when you're asked

49
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.040
what you do for a living. Key takeaway; value through change.

50
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.640
And how exciting is that?

51
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.540
That is why I love performing analysis activities.

52
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.170
Also,

53
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.730
the role of an analyst can best be justified to management if

54
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.000
you can continually add value to the business, don't lose sight of that.
