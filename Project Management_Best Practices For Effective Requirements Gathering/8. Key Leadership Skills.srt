1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:05,180
Key leadership skills. Interpersonal, communication, and

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,340
leadership skills are highly synergistic,

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,770
and they begin to blur together and support each other in

4
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:15,340
building a solid softâ€‘skill platform.

5
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:15,950
For me,

6
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:19,610
my career was the most enabled and propelled by leveraging

7
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:23,680
my interpersonal, communication, and leadership skills, and

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,640
maybe they can for you too.

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,600
In addition to what we've talked about,

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,930
here is an additional list of key leadership skills you need.

11
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,910
But, before I go over this list,

12
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:39,200
I want you to think about how you would rate yourself for each of them.

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,160
Embrace and be a champion for change. Leaders drive

14
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,200
change and are change agents.

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,740
Do you like change?

16
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,870
Change is typically not a natural attribute of most people,

17
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:51,790
but it is of leaders.

18
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:56,380
Earn credibility across your organization. In order for you to be successful,

19
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,740
work hard to earn credibility, that is, you are honest,

20
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:03,580
have integrity, and always follow through with what you say and do.

21
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:06,690
This will enable you to be more productive in your organization and

22
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,640
enable broader career opportunities within your company.

23
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,750
Ability to build trust.

24
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,450
This is a critical leadership quality you must

25
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:17,020
master. Strong negotiation skills.

26
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:21,580
Most business interactions entail discussions and arriving at a consensus.

27
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:22,160
Therefore,

28
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,370
you must have the ability to communicate clearly and effectively to

29
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:28,140
others during the discussions and negotiations.

30
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,970
Strategic planning skills.

31
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,310
I think this is important, as people want to know,

32
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,180
where are we going and how are we going to get there?

33
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,580
Project and team management skills. Yes,

34
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,750
leadership is paramount and essential,

35
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,880
but you still need some basic and practical project and team management skills.

36
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,060
These will really help you in being an analyst as well. Strong

37
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,200
communication and marketing skills. Like we talked, certainly

38
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,980
verbal and written skills are essential,

39
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,930
and what I mean by marketing is that you will need to ensure

40
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,740
that the business and your stakeholders know what you are

41
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,870
doing clearly and succinctly.

42
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,780
This will result in you receiving better projects to work on, more

43
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,370
resources, and maybe even better career opportunities, and,

44
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:08,780
of course, strong interpersonal skills, which we've all talked about.

45
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,320
You want coworkers to feel that they can approach you,

46
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,220
talk to you, and share information with you.

47
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,640
The use of these skills with your stakeholders and teammates will enhance

48
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,430
your ability to bridge the gap by helping you elicit and capture business

49
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:24,760
requirements and then bring forward and communicate those business

50
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,160
requirements to all of your stakeholders.

51
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:27,750
Okay,

52
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,950
how did you rate yourself? Using the same scale as before, if

53
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,330
you gave yourself 16 points or more, well,

54
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:37,140
you're doing well and keep it up.

55
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,290
Here's a good quote.

56
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:42,380
"Difficulties mastered are opportunities won," by Winston

57
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,350
Churchill. I discussed the important need for interpersonal

58
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,480
communication and leadership skills.

59
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,420
Some of these may be uncomfortable for you.

60
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,320
Trust me, I,

61
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,590
too was uncomfortable with speaking to large groups, working with senior

62
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,700
management, as well as other situations during my career.

63
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,740
The meaning behind this quote is something like this.

64
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:03,280
You should strongly consider getting out of your comfort zone and face your

65
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,280
individual challenges. I found as I improve these skills,

66
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:15,000
I was more successful at my work and was presented with more career opportunities, as you will be too.
