00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,430
Hello, and welcome.

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:04,880
I'm Michael Krasowski from Pluralsight.

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,950
I will be presenting the module, gathering requirements for the

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,370
business unit, in the course, Best Practices For Effective

5
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:17,430
Requirements Gathering. Our backdrop for requirements gathering in

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,760
these last three modules is by business context.

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,000
In the previous module,

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,540
we covered how the business analyst would perform requirements

9
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,890
development for a product working within an Agile or Lean team

10
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,640
and working with the product owner.

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,550
In this module,

12
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,980
we will discuss requirements gathering in a broader context within

13
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:37,120
the business unit, or also known as program,

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,840
where you may have dozens of systems,

15
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,590
applications, and complexities that must be managed. And for what's

16
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:45,950
coming up in the next module, we will cover the requirements gathering

17
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:50,950
in the enterprise or portfolio context. As a reminder, these contexts

18
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:54,590
are not cut and dry and may not even be existent in most

19
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,600
organizations, but as I mentioned,

20
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:02,040
we need a form of categorization to frame our discussions.

21
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,200
Here are the topics of this module, the business unit in programs,

22
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,180
the power of program management, designing program requirements,

23
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:15,250
the BA's role at a program scale, levels of expressing user requirements,

24
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,910
the BA's role driving epics to backlogs, analyzing the

25
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:22,520
optimal workload composition, and analyzing the optimal

26
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:27,150
Agile team composition, and finally, point of view and module summary.

27
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,540
Okay, let's get after it.

28
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,520
Here is the module outcome, to enable you to improve your

29
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,500
requirements development skills for multiple products,

30
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:44,000
systems, and applications to meet a broader spectrum of business needs within a business unit or program.
