00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:06,040
Here's my point of view and module summary.

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:11,040
This module is titled Relationships, the Secret to Successful Requirements,

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,160
and I hope you think so and agree as well.

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,720
But the secret has yet another secret, trust.

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,220
Here are a few guidelines to think about to further build trust with

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,790
your business stakeholders and colleagues. As you begin each

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,010
engagement or encounter with your stakeholders,

8
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,000
have clear and consistent goals. Always know where you are going,

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,680
the big vision, the projects, and down to the daily tasks.

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,550
This will help your coworkers and your stakeholders have a better

11
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:40,810
understanding of what you are proposing or aiming for and what the

12
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:44,070
end game may look like and how the teams will know when they arrive

13
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,340
at a conclusion or solution.

14
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,240
And, as we mentioned before, be open and listen.

15
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,730
This builds trust and shows compassion.

16
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:54,360
Your business coworkers will come to believe that they are

17
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,700
understood and feel they are being listened to.

18
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,220
Not only is this respectful in all encounters,

19
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:04,370
but you will also actually get more honest input to do your job better.

20
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:07,240
Being open and honest builds trust.

21
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,180
Be decisive.

22
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,070
Wishy‑washy is an ineffectual quality in your position.

23
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:17,130
Would you want to see the CEO of your company in a very serious situation say,

24
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,520
gee, I don't know.

25
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,480
What should we do?

26
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,100
This does not mean that you have all the answers,

27
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,490
but it does mean if you don't know something,

28
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:30,230
you'll take the action to find out. You are not perfect, so admit mistakes.

29
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,740
This shows you are human.

30
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,240
And even if it was not you perse who made the mistake, take

31
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,470
one on the chin and show responsibility.

32
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,270
This will build trust as well. Respect the opinions of others.

33
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,340
Always listen.

34
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:45,700
It does not mean you have to agree, but you do have to listen.

35
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,850
Then, be decisive and make appropriate recommendations or

36
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,810
decisions and explain your reasons objectively.

37
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,470
Manage expectations.

38
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:54,390
This is a biggie.

39
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:58,910
Every single stakeholder interaction is an opportunity to manage expectations,

40
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,600
meetings, emails, phone calls, status reports,

41
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,220
presentations, the water cooler, and more.

42
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,650
Never pass up these opportunities to further connect with and

43
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:10,690
communicate with your business stakeholders and coworkers.

44
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:13,390
Now you can't be robotic or stiff or go through this

45
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,270
list like it's some sort of checklist.

46
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,770
You need to be sincere,

47
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:23,140
and it should come naturally because these qualities are who you are.

48
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,480
Here is my point of view.

49
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,470
Everything we talked about helps build strong relationships.

50
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:30,530
You absolutely need them to be the most you can be.

51
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:33,170
And it's all related, interpersonal skills,

52
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,410
a healthy connection with your stakeholders,

53
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:40,740
leadership skills, trust, communication skills, and collaboration.

54
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:47,740
They all fit together to support great relationships.

55
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,090
Here are the key points of this module.

56
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:52,650
The toughest part of requirements development is the

57
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,690
process which results in helping users discover that what

58
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:58,340
they need provides business value.

59
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:02,060
The secret to developing quality requirements is through influencing,

60
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:06,270
nurturing, and cultivating relationships with all of your colleagues.

61
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:09,590
We categorized our stakeholders where some need to be informed,

62
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:13,420
those that need to be consulted, and those that are more like partners.

63
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:13,940
And finally,

64
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:17,860
the decision makers. Thinking of them in this way provides a method to

65
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,840
better target how we want to relate and work with them.

66
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,810
We expanded on that to develop our stakeholder preparation document.

67
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:28,380
This captured their involvement and how we want to interact with them and,

68
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,510
of course, feel free to add any attributes that make sense.

69
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:34,190
There are activities that we can use to foster

70
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:37,560
collaboration and enhance our relationships such as

71
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,310
workshops, discussing potential solutions,

72
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,840
one‑on‑one meetings, team meetings, and standups,

73
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,980
to name a few.

74
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:47,760
It is a premise of this course that the business analyst is typically the

75
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,430
integration or touch point between IT and the business.

76
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:56,060
This is a big responsibility, requiring interpersonal and communication skills.

77
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:56,770
In fact,

78
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,070
interpersonal communication skills are the

79
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:02,540
underpinnings of a quality leader. And lastly,

80
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:14,000
always strive to build and sustain trust with your stakeholders and peers. Up next, The Evolution of Requirements Gathering.
