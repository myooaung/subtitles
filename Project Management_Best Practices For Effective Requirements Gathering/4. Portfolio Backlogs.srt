1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:05,940
Now let's talk about portfolio backlogs.

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,040
What's a portfolio backlog?

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,700
Themes are not part of a theme backlog.

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,320
There is no theme backlog.

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,940
Themes have a much longer lifespan than do epics.

6
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,620
Epics get implemented, and then they are complete,

7
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,830
whereas themes may be around for a while,

8
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,120
maybe even a long while.

9
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,870
Let's say one of our themes is to develop a brand‑new,

10
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,890
high‑efficiency commercial jet that reduces fuel

11
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,190
usage by 50% among other things.

12
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:33,530
Well, that jet may be around for 20+ years or more.

13
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:37,400
Epics deliver the value to the business in support of the theme.

14
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:42,900
Therefore, epics need to be identified, prioritized, estimated, maintained.

15
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,020
Within the portfolio backlog,

16
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,720
epics are treated just like any other agile backlog.

17
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:52,040
And, of course, epics drive features and features drive user stories.

18
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,080
Business analysts can help perform these activities,

19
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,090
and it's critical that they do.

20
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:02,850
Remember our examples of portfolio themes from the last section?

21
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,630
So we have our themes on the left and ideas or examples on how

22
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,230
we might fulfill those themes on the right.

23
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:11,700
These are likely brainstorming ideas, say,

24
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:18,740
from a workshop with company leaders and senior business analysts.

25
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:23,140
Those ideas we had on the right on the last slide, well, they are epics.

26
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,160
You could imagine that you may get 20 ideas or 20

27
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,140
epics for cross‑selling services.

28
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,810
Well, which ones are the best?

29
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:31,240
Which ones should you do?

30
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,960
So we're going to need a group of people to help identify,

31
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,110
prioritize, estimate,

32
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:41,140
and maintain the epics in our epic backlog that we created from each theme.

33
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,060
Let's talk about the role of the business analyst or,

34
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,320
I should say, senior or principal business analyst,

35
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,810
since this is definitely a very senior experience role indeed,

36
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,820
something I suggest you aspire to.

37
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,140
Here are the types of activities you would perform: Collaborate

38
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,660
and partner with the executive sponsor or sponsors for each

39
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:03,270
theme you are supporting; help translate the themes into epics

40
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,390
and ensure they are visible, well understood,

41
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:06,220
roughly estimated,

42
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,400
and planned; help translate the epics into features

43
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,870
and ensure they are also visible, estimated,

44
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,420
resourced, and in a release,

45
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:17,800
and I would suggest that you create a team for each epic; using your new team,

46
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,170
help ensure features are further translated,

47
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,930
refined, and articulated into user stories.

48
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:26,340
Be sure your user stories are in alignment and support the

49
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,820
theme and nothing got lost in translation,

50
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,710
so to speak.

51
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,590
Note: Your involvement will be heavier in the beginning and

52
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,910
will lessen as you move down to user stories.

53
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,880
User stories will be most likely developed by other business

54
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,740
analysts and developers closer to the business domain,

55
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:44,340
whereas your actions in this role are at the theme and epic level,

56
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,790
and you will really be providing guidance and direction

57
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:54,000
to those writing the user stories, since you will have in your mind a clear understanding of the theme and epic.
