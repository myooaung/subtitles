1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:06,240
Let's see how we can more efficiently gather requirements.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,940
Here is a great quote that I truly believe in.

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:13,310
If you can't describe what you're doing as a process,

4
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:16,320
you don't know what you're doing by Mr. Deming.

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,390
So if I walked up to you and said,

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,320
please tell me how you go about requirements development,

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,550
What would you tell me?

8
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,360
Usually in about 5 minutes, I can tell whether you

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,540
know what you're doing or not.

10
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,690
When you are performing business analysis,

11
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:32,540
you need to have a process by which you follow.

12
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,320
That may include a framework, tools, standards,

13
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,460
artifacts, and best practices in order to quickly

14
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,460
implement your analysis assignments.

15
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:43,730
The bottom line for me, process is critical to

16
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:45,580
successful requirements gathering.

17
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:48,290
If you do each analysis activity randomly,

18
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:53,340
you will have random, unpredictable results.

19
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,150
Develop a basic process in how to do your requirements development.

20
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,420
This can improve productivity greatly.

21
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,490
For example, if you hire new people,

22
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:03,920
they can immediately begin using your material.

23
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,620
This material can be a repository of all your processes tools,

24
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:10,570
approaches, artifacts, and requirement examples.

25
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,890
This does not have to be detailed or voluminous, keep it all in a

26
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,540
wiki and continually update and improve it.

27
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,470
I am sure you and your team already have a ton of material to get

28
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:23,840
started. Create your own best practices and document them. A best

29
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,280
practice is a method or technique that has been generally accepted by

30
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,940
you and your team as better to any alternatives because it produces

31
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,440
results that are superior.

32
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,820
A best practice may be a process, tool,

33
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,900
template, or outline, or return on investment spreadsheet, you

34
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,880
name it. In this way, you can quickly grab something from your

35
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,770
repository, say in Confluence or SharePoint or a cloud drive, and

36
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,560
start working immediately.

37
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,450
So how much process or best practices is enough?

38
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:50,000
Well,

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,380
it depends. For each activity you embark on, you need

40
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,440
to look at your context, system,

41
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,730
business unit, or enterprise, you need to look at the stakeholders,

42
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:02,420
timeframe, urgency, budget, and many other factors.

43
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,320
This matrix of information should be in your process and

44
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,360
best practice repository to help guide you on how much

45
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,230
level of effort is appropriate.

46
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:15,040
Now we'll talk more about level of effort in a bit.

47
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,610
I have used the term lean several times earlier in this module,

48
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,850
and here is a more formal definition.

49
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:24,990
Lean can be defined as a set of techniques to identify

50
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,610
and eliminate waste from operations.

51
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:31,370
Keep this in mind when developing your processes and best practices.

52
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:40,000
Lean systems, or lean anything for that matter, focus on process improvement that eliminate waste and improve workflow.
