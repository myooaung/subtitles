00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.640
In search of the perfect requirement.

2
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.580
How much analysis is enough?

3
00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.410
Well, when you think the requirements are clear,

4
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.060
stable, and the users agree. Well that sounds simple enough,

5
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.710
doesn't it?

6
00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.070
Do requirements need to be perfect? No, they don't.

7
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.260
But as you've realized, they just need to be clear enough and stable enough,

8
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.080
and the users pretty much agree. So we can see that this is not a perfect

9
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.900
process, but if you strive for perfect requirements,

10
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.910
you will likely never succeed.

11
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:37.710
Life isn't perfect. Are soft and high‑level requirements okay? Well, yes and no.

12
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.520
If you have soft and high‑level requirements and they are intended

13
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.290
for a report to your manager or stakeholder,

14
00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.640
then you did a great job.

15
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.280
If they are high‑level and soft requirements and you plan to hand

16
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.220
those over to a development team to implement,

17
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.270
then you likely did not do your job, and that may cost time,

18
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.140
money, or even your career.

19
00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.780
Now conversely, if your requirements outcome is too detailed,

20
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.240
then it might be a waste of time for two reasons.

21
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.810
One,

22
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.160
because requirements are a moving target and they can rapidly change, and

23
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.580
therefore, be a waste of your time. And two, if you're only going to provide

24
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.020
decision data to your manager or stakeholder,

25
00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.130
why go into so much detail?

26
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.810
In this case, a soft and high‑level outcome maybe would be just fine.

27
00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.330
So what is the right amount?

28
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.540
Well, there is no clear answer for this,

29
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.540
but I will try and take a stab at it on the next slide.

30
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.480
Here is my guidance for the right amount of analysis.

31
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.850
It is basic and straightforward, and should help

32
00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.370
you if you struggle in this area.

33
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:36.450
You are not alone.

34
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.250
I have certainly struggled in my career on this topic.

35
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.160
So this is what I would do. Always know your outcome before you start.

36
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.910
Whomever is giving you the assignment,

37
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.180
be sure you understand what is expected of you and your team.

38
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.600
Ask questions, and get a good holistic feel on what they need.

39
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.460
Document their expectations, and send it back to the

40
00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.830
person, not for approval per se, but for affirmation.

41
00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.330
Okay, now you have a firm assignment and you're ready to start.

42
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.080
I can't believe how many people work on assignments,

43
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.650
not really knowing their assignment.

44
00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.280
How productive is that?

45
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.340
Not very.

46
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.060
Perform all analysis in increments and iterations, just

47
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.680
like I've described in this module.

48
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.140
Remember,

49
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.600
doing work in short increments with regular reviews

50
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.610
enables us to make course correction.

51
00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.230
Life is dynamic.

52
00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.610
Things change.

53
00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.960
List your backlog of tasks, just simply jot down a list of tasks

54
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.130
you need to do, and if you have your framework,

55
00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.610
pull out a template, lay out your iterations, maybe three days if you're by

56
00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.950
yourself, or 1‑2 weeks, or whatever works for you. Provide incremental

57
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:42.000
feedback during standups, you will be amazed that incremental feedback to your stakeholder has so many benefits.
