00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:07.140
Now let's talk about some recommendations on how to interact with stakeholders.

2
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.400
Here are some approaches to involving stakeholders. Determine

3
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.750
the level of involvement for each stakeholder.

4
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.510
Each stakeholder is different with their own needs and expectations.

5
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.210
Truly understanding their level of involvement will help you

6
00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.780
establish and begin to build your relationships.

7
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.310
And how much time can they actually spend with you anyway?

8
00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.640
Some stakeholders will need to be informed,

9
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.530
provide regular status reports, and keep them informed of

10
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.410
any decisions that would affect them.

11
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.150
Find out from them how often they want to be informed or receive status reports.

12
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.920
Do not assume everyone is on the same cycle.

13
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.420
Some stakeholders just need to be consulted.

14
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.380
Some stakeholders have knowledge and expertise that may, in fact,

15
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.440
provide most of the information you need in your analysis,

16
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.460
especially end users and business owners,

17
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.140
which would benefit from outcomes of your work.

18
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.590
Some stakeholders will be more like partners.

19
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.730
These may be other members on your team,

20
00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.770
other business analysts in your organization, and possibly even

21
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.280
developer teams. You work regularly and closely with them.

22
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.790
Lastly,

23
00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.090
decision makers. There are those who may not be that close with

24
00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.950
your activities, but will be making key decisions,

25
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.060
especially if they relate to customer deliverables, costs,

26
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.540
budgets, and overall impact to the business.

27
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.360
Here are stakeholder interactions you need for success. Now that you've

28
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.920
identified and are involving stakeholders in your analysis,

29
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.020
you need things from each and every one of them, timely input,

30
00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.780
feedback, and information. They need to provide you the

31
00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.840
right information at the right time.

32
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.100
This can be very challenging since they are very busy people just like you, so

33
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.240
building a solid relationship where you have their interests at heart will help

34
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.730
greatly. Proactive participation. As you know,

35
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.280
without key stakeholder participation, you can't get your job done.

36
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.340
All that knowledge is tied up in people's heads and you need to pull it out.

37
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.230
If they are not in the room, so to speak, you will produce substandard results.

38
00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.840
Be creative and flexible in fitting into their schedules.

39
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.110
Balance business contexts.

40
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.030
In the previous module, we discuss business context,

41
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.980
a single system, you know, somewhat smaller chunks of work,

42
00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:11.260
a business unit that covers a major portion of a

43
00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.090
company, and the full enterprise context.

44
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.180
Where is your analysis activities fall?

45
00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.510
Be aware of the stakeholder viewpoints that are

46
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.250
myopic and do not take a broader view.

47
00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.700
Remember,

48
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.100
there is just one company and you may have to share the

49
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.360
viewpoints and needs of other stakeholders with the

50
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.550
stakeholders you are currently talking to.

51
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.480
Bidirectional communication.

52
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.340
How do you want to communicate with them?

53
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.930
How do you want to be communicated to? Negotiate what makes the best sense to

54
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.350
them and not yourself, if possible. Collaborate with them and determine what

55
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.140
you think might be the best forms of communication.

56
00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.060
Each one may have a different way you need to communicate

57
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.890
with. Communication with stakeholders,

58
00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.900
the when and the what, figure out when is the best time to communicate daily,

59
00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.540
weekly, monthly,

60
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.500
quarterly, or even some random schedule, whatever works

61
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.630
best between you and your stakeholder.

62
00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.090
Also, what form of communication works for each stakeholder,

63
00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.710
so you need to consider that as well.

64
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.210
Meetings, emails, status reports,

65
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.760
presentations, or a variety and a mix of all of these. I have

66
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.900
seen cases where analysts forced their schedule on content

67
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.940
formats onto the stakeholders.

68
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:19.950
Please don't do that.

69
00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.240
Try and figure out what works best for everyone,

70
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.540
including yourself, but if push comes to shove,

71
00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:33.000
satisfy the desires of the stakeholder. These behaviors exhibit professionalism and contributes to building trust.
