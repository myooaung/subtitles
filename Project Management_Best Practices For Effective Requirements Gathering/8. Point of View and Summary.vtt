00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.230
Here's my point of view and module summary.

2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.370
"Rolls" versus roles, potato, potato.

3
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.450
Many companies have different roles or titles for what we've been talking about.

4
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.170
For example,

5
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.390
the product manager is usually less operational in her

6
00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.380
activities and more business and forward thinking,

7
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.380
such as defining a product and how best to sell it and

8
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.440
have it be successful in the marketplace.

9
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.940
This is a very common role in business,

10
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.350
so you may be partnering with the product manager.

11
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.410
Now a product manager could have multiple product owners given a

12
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.880
very broad‑based product and may even be called a program manager

13
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.770
like we discussed previously as well.

14
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.840
Now you remember our agile role of product owner of course.

15
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.600
That role we are familiar with and is, in fact,

16
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.860
more operational, defining the backlog, setting priorities,

17
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.670
working out releases and iterations.

18
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.340
And it may be said that this role is a subset of an

19
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.490
overall product manager role.

20
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.630
Certainly business analysts, or some form or permutation of analyst,

21
00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.020
like technical business analyst, or a financial business analyst.

22
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.510
Based on the size of the company, you may have all these roles,

23
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.140
some of these roles, or a whole new batch of roles or monikers.

24
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.160
The point of this slide is that if you're looking for a new job

25
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.240
within your company or outside your company,

26
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.140
be aware that your perfect job may be titled different than you may think.

27
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.280
Here's my point of view, my thoughts, and opinions.

28
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.970
Themes can go by several names, strategies, initiatives, to name a few.

29
00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.400
Now user stories are well defined and understood in industry

30
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.140
today and are commonly understood by everyone.

31
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.760
But themes and epics have a lot of wiggle room and

32
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.000
different points of view and interpretations,

33
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.200
which is just fine to me.

34
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.640
Just adapt and move forward.

35
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.340
Here are the key points in summary of this module.

36
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.860
In this module, we looked at gathering enterprise‑wide requirements,

37
00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.100
also known as portfolio themes.

38
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.850
Portfolio themes are strategic business initiatives.

39
00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.980
These are very high level and visionary.

40
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.470
What is also important, themes are strategic and propel a company forward.

41
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.140
It is the vision of the company that themes represent.

42
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.350
Themes come from the most senior leadership of the company or

43
00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.020
board of directors or even outside consultants.

44
00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.250
Portfolio themes drive the creation of epics and implement the theme.

45
00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.850
Portfolio backlogs are the collection of epics and not the themes themselves.

46
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.330
Portfolio management is the people and processes that manage the

47
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.840
creation and implementation of the themes and epics.

48
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.400
Themes are not just business oriented,

49
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.840
but also architecture and technology themes are

50
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.470
critical to the success of any company.

51
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.060
And both business and architectural themes drive epics.

52
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.680
From themes, BAs help with epic identification and creating epic backlogs.

53
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.360
Epics get prioritized based on a template or model and then assigned to the

54
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.550
appropriate organization or program to get implemented.

55
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.650
The activities in this model that we discussed may be worked on by BAs,

56
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.820
program managers, product managers, line‑of‑business managers,

57
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.560
project managers, or a cross‑section of all of them.

58
00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.270
If you like or think you like this kind of work, don't worry about the title.

59
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.810
Just jump in and get involved.

60
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:10.000
Up next: Applying Key Learning Objectives. I'll see you there.
