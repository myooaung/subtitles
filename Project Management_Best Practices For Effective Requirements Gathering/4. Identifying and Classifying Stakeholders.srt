1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:07,940
Let's go through an example of identifying and classifying stakeholders.

2
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:10,950
It is very important before you run off and start gathering

3
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,670
requirements that you clearly know who you are doing it for and

4
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,000
with, so identify and classify your stakeholders.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,240
Here is a scenario. You have a new analysis project and

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,800
here are the steps to do just that.

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,740
Step one, identify and get their contact information

8
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,800
and determine their stakeholder type.

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,690
This may change after you have interviewed and begun

10
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,440
building your relationships with them.

11
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:36,110
This is not in concrete, but a starting point for your activities.

12
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:38,230
Step two, determine their involvement.

13
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:43,390
In what way or role do you need them to cooperate with you, inform, consult,

14
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:47,110
partner, or decision maker like we talked about in the previous section,

15
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:50,450
and it could be more than one of these for each stakeholder as well.

16
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,540
Step three, determine the interaction you want with them.

17
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:57,290
Identify the forms of communication and interactions for each person.

18
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:01,540
Now let's look at a specific example.

19
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:05,070
Here is an example on how to prepare to work with your stakeholders.

20
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,220
Let's say you have a new analysis assignment and you've been given the

21
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,510
task to develop the requirements to add the ability of dealers to order

22
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:13,760
accessories when ordering a new motorcycle.

23
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,320
You are assigned to the IT department and have been given a few names.

24
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,940
Before you begin, you want to get your act together,

25
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,540
set up a simple grid to start the process.

26
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:27,050
We have the stakeholders names, the contact like senior VP of sales,

27
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:31,450
stakeholder type like system stakeholder, involvement like decision maker

28
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:35,230
and when you think the interaction would be like weekly, and the

29
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:38,440
interaction format like status report. Now,

30
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,260
as your work progresses, you may add people and add new

31
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,820
columns to keep track of other information that I haven't

32
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,240
thought of, so be creative.

33
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,030
This is a living document and change it any way you want to, but this will

34
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:54,380
give you a great overview of who your contacts are and how you have to work

35
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:59,040
and relate and build that relationships with.

36
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,620
There are tons of other interaction formats,

37
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,790
and here are a few, face‑to‑face meetings and workshops,

38
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:08,330
telephone and email, presentations, standups,

39
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:11,650
texts and instant messaging, video web conferencing,

40
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:14,720
wikis, and other requirement portals, and Teams, and

41
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,370
Slack, and other tools like that.

42
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,900
So which of these options will facilitate connecting

43
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,130
with your stakeholders? Maybe one, maybe all,

44
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:23,900
maybe a blend, and maybe each stakeholder would like a

45
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,020
different type of format that works best for them.

46
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,740
Please accommodate your stakeholders.

47
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:34,490
We now have a new artifact, so add it to your analysis framework.

48
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:37,630
Remember our analysis framework from the last module? This is now

49
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:41,090
a best practice for you and your team to use so you can name this

50
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:44,890
best practice stakeholder prep and add it to our framework for

51
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,380
future use and improvements.

52
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,520
This approach works for any business context. It'll be either system,

53
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,340
business unit, or enterprise.

54
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,000
In fact, the bigger the responsibility, the more stakeholders you will have,

55
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,550
and thus this makes this approach even more important.

56
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:01,170
Every time I create a new artifact in the progress of my

57
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:07,000
work that I deem important and reusable, I immediately add it to my framework.
