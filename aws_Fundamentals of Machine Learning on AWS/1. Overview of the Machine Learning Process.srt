00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:01,900
[Autogenerated] greetings.

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:04,180
I remember Israel Son and welcome to this next module in

3
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:07,540
the course about machine learning on AWS.

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,350
In the last module we looked at how to take a business problem

5
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,740
and frame it as a machine learning problem.

6
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:13,390
So at this point,

7
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:16,640
we should be able to start doing some actual machine learning bits.

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,440
And that's the focus of this module getting started with our data.

9
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,220
We'll walk through the machine learning process,

10
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,560
starting with an overview of the seven phases and then

11
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,600
really focusing on fetching data,

12
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,140
including the various AWS services that you'll be using.

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,860
We'll also talk about how to clean the data,

14
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:37,740
things like handling missing values, dealing with formatting and scaling issues.

15
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:38,950
And then, to prepare the data,

16
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:43,240
we'll get into what's called data visualizations and feature engineering.

17
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,820
We'll go through all of these steps conceptually and then also see

18
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:50,440
them in action with demos and sage maker studio.

19
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,770
The machine learning process will be following in this course

20
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,450
is one that you'll find out on the developer Guide for Amazon

21
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:59,840
Sage maker scrolling Down here, you'll see the different phases.

22
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,050
You will see slightly different wording out there with

23
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:05,440
other process models for example, rather than cleaning data,

24
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,190
it will be called sanitizing data or analyze instead of evaluate.

25
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:13,340
But this is the terminology will be using in this course,

26
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,610
and this is definitely an iterative process.

27
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,650
Machine learning isn't a once and done.

28
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:21,940
You repeat this entire process Azure building and testing your solution.

29
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,830
And even within the process, there are points of iteration.

30
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:27,840
For instance, you'll train your model and evaluate it,

31
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,540
but then you might need to start back over with some new data.

32
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:36,000
Just keep that in mind. Now let's dig into the first phase of fetching data.
