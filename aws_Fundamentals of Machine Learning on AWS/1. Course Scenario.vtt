[Autogenerated] Alexa, start the course introduction Hello from Pluralsight.

2
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.010
Welcome to this course on the fundamentals of machine learning on AWS.

3
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.440
I hope you have fun and learn a lot.

4
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.480
Thanks for that introduction.

5
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.000
Alexa.

6
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.890
Hi, everybody.

7
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.340
I'm Amber Israel Sin and I'll be your guide through this course,

8
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.140
Let's get started.

9
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.830
When you think of artificial intelligence or machine learning,

10
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.480
you might think of things like self driving cars,

11
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.410
robots or something from your favorite sci fi movie.

12
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.900
Your book and all of those popular or cliche ID use cases are great

13
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.740
and definitely being used in the world today,

14
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.610
but we're gonna bring it a little bit closer to home

15
00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.040
with a company called Globomantics.

16
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.340
Globomantics is a wireless carrier based in the United States.

17
00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.430
So think about whoever your carrier is for your cell phone,

18
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.040
and this is very similar.

19
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.160
They sell devices and service plans for their customers and offer

20
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.140
support through retail stores and a call center.

21
00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.210
Nicole is a software developer who works at Globomantics,

22
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.940
and she's leading several machine learning initiatives at the company.

23
00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.010
One of her main stakeholders is Ray,

24
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.010
who is VP of customer experience that Globomantics the company

25
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.310
has experienced a lot of customer turn lately,

26
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.340
meaning customers leave and go to another carrier.

27
00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.340
This is a big problem, and his job is on the line if you can't fix it.

28
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.300
He's listened to phone calls from call center.

29
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.540
Agents looked at feedback from various customer surveys and so forth.

30
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.560
But he's heard a lot of buzz about machine learning and

31
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.940
thinks Nicole might be able to help.

32
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.110
During his meeting with Nicole,

33
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.210
he explains the situation and then asks we can use

34
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.840
machine learning for that right?

35
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.260
This story might sound familiar to you in general.

36
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.210
There's a lot of buzz about ML right now,

37
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.160
but a lot of companies are in the early stages of

38
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:49.000
figuring it out and how they can use it, which is actually great news for you.
