00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:01.900
[Autogenerated] in this clip,

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.640
I'll walk you through How to get set up with sage Maker studio.

3
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.440
But first, a quick note about costs.

4
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.840
Sage maker studio itself is free and it sits on top of sage maker.

5
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.310
Like other AWS services.

6
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.060
You only pay for what you use,

7
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.670
but you can get started for free for the first two months.

8
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.240
And then after that, you'll pay for what you use For more details.

9
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.750
You can check out these sage maker pricing page here

10
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.800
under sage maker slash pricing.

11
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.990
If you view sage maker in the past and you're already

12
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.790
outside of that two month free window, don't worry.

13
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.590
If you complete all the demos in this course,

14
00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.240
your costs should still be less than $1.

15
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.300
So with that in mind, I'll show you how to set up Sage Maker studio.

16
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.270
And then we'll also take a brief tour of three

17
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.340
different examples that come with it.

18
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.040
Here I am logged into the AWS management console.

19
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.240
I'll go to the Fine services search box and type in sage maker.

20
00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:04.440
We'll select that and then on the top left Select Amazon Sage Maker studio.

21
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.240
If you scroll down on the right,

22
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.100
you'll see there's two different ways to get started.

23
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.240
You could do quick start or sage Maker will configure all the defaults for you.

24
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.170
Or, if you want more control over the set up, you can use standard.

25
00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.040
We're going to go with Quick Start.

26
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.910
First, we'll need to choose a username.

27
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.240
You can choose whatever you want here.

28
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.640
I'm going to do PS for Pluralsight machine learning

29
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.040
and then you need an execution role.

30
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.640
You'll see here.

31
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.310
It says that sage maker studio requires permissions

32
00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.840
to access other AWS services,

33
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.820
and the execution role must have the Amazon sage

34
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.640
maker full access policy attached.

35
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.390
We're gonna let sage maker help us with this,

36
00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:50.240
so I'll select this drop-down and say, Create a new role here on top.

37
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.990
Down on the bottom,

38
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.540
you'll see this allows access to any S3 bucket or

39
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.020
object with sage maker in the name,

40
00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.300
as well as things with tags of sage maker equals true.

41
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.630
And then any S3 bucket with a bucket policy

42
00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.630
allowing access to sage maker on top.

43
00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.740
You can optionally allow access to any S3 bucket specific

44
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.320
buckets or none for what we're doing.

45
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:17.040
I'm gonna leave all the defaults here and then say Create role success,

46
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:23.100
scrolling down a little bit more want to hit submit back in the control panel.

47
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.470
This will take a few minutes to set up for the first time.

48
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.340
You want to keep an eye on status down here and see what it's done.

49
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.240
I'll pause the video for a minute and be back when it's ready,

50
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.380
and it looks like Sage Maker studio was ready.

51
00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.140
So over here on the right, you'll click on Open Studio.

52
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.980
This will also take a couple minutes to launch,

53
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.440
so we'll be back in just a minute.

54
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.960
And here's Sage Maker studio now.

55
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.860
This isn't a course about sage maker studio per se,

56
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.840
but we'll be working with several of the features as we go along.

57
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.010
The first thing I want to show you is how to get the sage maker.

58
00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.070
Studio examples will be using one of them in our demos,

59
00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.050
but there are many others that are great to work through.

60
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.840
Azure getting started.

61
00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.740
I'm going to switch over to the launcher tab up here.

62
00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:11.960
I'll scroll down to System Terminal, and what we want to do here is clone,

63
00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:17.240
the repository of sage maker examples We'll do that with get clone.

64
00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:24.250
HTTPS GitHub dot com AWS labs slash Amazon hyphen Sage maker Hyphen examples.

65
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.240
.NET This is going out and grabbing the examples,

66
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.100
and you'll see him over here on the left hand side in

67
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.830
a folder called Amazon Sage Maker.

68
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.240
Examples.

69
00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.240
Now that's done.

70
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.740
I'll just give you a really quick tour over here through the folders.

71
00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.390
I'll expand this just a little bit.

72
00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.540
Here.

73
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.840
You can see there's examples for a lot of different parts of machine learning.

74
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.540
ID encourage you to check these out.

75
00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.520
We're going to go to the AWS Sage Maker studio folder and

76
00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.240
there's a getting started folder in here,

77
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.140
and there just happens to be a customer insurance scenario that

78
00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.870
we're going to be working with in our demos,

79
00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.840
So I'll click on this.

80
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.640
Now when you open up a notebook, you're going to be asked to select the kernel.

81
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.870
What's happening here that's really nice about sage maker studio is it's

82
00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.470
automatically going to spin up the underlying infrastructure.

83
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.240
You need to run this notebook.

84
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.990
If you'd work with sage maker prior to studio,

85
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.030
you'll know that you had to manually go through and set up

86
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.960
your instance and create your notebook.

87
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.140
But it's all happening with one step here, which is super convenient.

88
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.140
The kernel we want to use is Python three data Science.

89
00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.600
Now there seems to be a little bit of a bug here where you have to

90
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.950
mouse over these items to see what they're called.

91
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.150
I'm hoping that will be fixed,

92
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:40.390
but we want to select Python three Data science and select on the lower left.

93
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.640
You'll see kernel starting.

94
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.140
While that's starting, let me just move a few things around here.

95
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.220
Once the kernel is started, you'll see appear on the top, right?

96
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.060
If you click into this information about the

97
00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.350
instance type that we're running on, you'll see M L t.

98
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:56.940
Three medium.

99
00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.830
We could actually change the instance type from here if we wanted to.

100
00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.040
But I'm gonna leave it as it is.

101
00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.740
We'll cancel.

102
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.940
You'll also see the kernel information up here.

103
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.870
We're using Python three data science,

104
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.540
but we could switch the kernel here if we wanted to.

105
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.690
I'll cancel lot of that and we'll ramp up in this demo.

106
00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.760
You saw how to set up Sage maker studio,

107
00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.290
how to clone the examples repository and how to

108
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.110
launch your first Jupyter notebook.

109
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.940
Nice work.

110
00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.820
Next up, we'll start digging into machine learning concepts,

111
00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:31.000
talking about when it makes sense to use machine learning. And when it doesn't, I'll see you there.
