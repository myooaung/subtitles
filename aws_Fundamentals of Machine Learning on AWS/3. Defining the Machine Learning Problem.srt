[Autogenerated] Now that we know the different

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,090
types of machine learning problems,

3
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:05,900
let's talk about how you to find your business

4
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,940
problem as a machine learning problem.

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,450
First, what is the problem you're trying to solve?

6
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,270
It's super important that you're clear on this,

7
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:15,450
because how you ask the business question will

8
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,040
determine the machine learning problem.

9
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:18,680
For example,

10
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,060
maybe the business problem is the company needs to predict sales of

11
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,640
products in order to inform manufacturing decisions.

12
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,890
You don't want to commit a lot of time,

13
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:31,660
and resource is to manufacturing products that aren't likely to sell One

14
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:35,300
way you could frame this is a machine learning problem would be predict

15
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,440
which products will sell more than 100 units,

16
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,880
and then we need to figure out the target and type.

17
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:46,300
The target is the final output you're trying to predict to show you what I mean.

18
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:50,560
Here's some data for existing products for the problem we're trying to solve.

19
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,650
We want to know of each of these products sold more than 100 units,

20
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:55,340
true or false.

21
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,780
After we've trained on this data,

22
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,460
we should be able to pass in any other product and figure

23
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,710
out if it will sell more than 100 units.

24
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,240
So this last column here is the target.

25
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:09,120
Now you'll sometimes hear the word label and target used interchangeably,

26
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,320
but that's not 100% correct for the data that you sent into the model.

27
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,440
This is the label e labeled data,

28
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,340
and then when you're describing the output or the

29
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,710
thing you're trying to predict, that's the target.

30
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:24,940
So similar, but slightly different.

31
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,230
Some other terminology to cover.

32
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:29,640
While we're here, the columns are called features.

33
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,780
You'll also sometimes hear them called attributes.

34
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,640
But I'll be using features and the rest of this course.

35
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,800
And then the rows are called the observations.

36
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:42,640
So we have seven observations in this particular dataset back to our example.

37
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,910
Our target in this case is binary,

38
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:49,160
meaning tour faults and the type of problem is binary classification,

39
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:54,840
which, of course, is the broader category of a supervised learning problem.

40
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,710
Let's look at another example where we've worded

41
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,740
the problem a little differently.

42
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,200
Here.

43
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,640
We want to predict the number of sales for each product,

44
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,900
so not true or false, whether we sold more than 100 or not.

45
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:09,760
But we want the prediction for the number of sales you remember

46
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,730
that when you're predicting prices or sales,

47
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,040
you're working with continuous values.

48
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,280
We could predict sales of zero products or a million products,

49
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,440
and anything in between.

50
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,940
Our target will be a numeric value.

51
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,940
The number of products sold and it's continuous.

52
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,530
And then the type of ML problem is regression,

53
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:32,820
which is also the broader category of supervised learning Azure trying

54
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,660
to frame your business problem as an ML problem here,

55
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,040
some additional things to consider.

56
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,040
What is your current pain point?

57
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,140
How are you currently solving this problem?

58
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,140
What data do we have?

59
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,240
Is that data labeled?

60
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,540
How will we define success?

61
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:57,000
What are the trade offs and what is out of scope? Now let's apply these concepts we just talked about.
