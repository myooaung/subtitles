00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:04.180
[Autogenerated] hello and welcome to this final module in the course

2
00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.340
about machine learning on AWS IT memories Wilson.

3
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.160
We've covered a lot of content in this course,

4
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.520
and we finally made it to the end.

5
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.920
Congratulations in this module all summarize.

6
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.420
These important points to remember for the exam give you some additional

7
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.770
resource is if you want to dig deeper and you definitely should.

8
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.040
This course alone is not enough to pass the exam,

9
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.710
and then I'll wrap up by bidding UI do if you haven't already just one

10
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.350
final reminder to delete the resource is you've used.

11
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.840
If you've been following along with the demos,

12
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.510
you'll have an S3 bucket, a sage maker endpoint,

13
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.510
an application and a Jupyter notebook kernel and instance which

14
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.140
you can stop Pluralsight age maker studio.

15
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.110
During this course, we built out a definition of machine learning,

16
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.910
saying that it identifies patterns and existing data

17
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.940
to make predictions about new data.

18
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.630
I won't rehash this entire slide,

19
00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.320
but you'll definitely need to be familiar with these different categories of

20
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.080
machine learning problems and some common examples for each No,

21
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.670
that features are your columns.

22
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.320
Observations are the rows and the thing you're trying to

23
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.940
predict is the target in the input data.

24
00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.340
That final column is also called the Label.

25
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.240
We walk through the machine learning process,

26
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.060
and although you probably won't get questions about the overall lifecycle,

27
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.740
let's walk through some of the main points for each phase.

28
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.010
For the fetch stage.

29
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.240
Know the basics about batch processing,

30
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.430
where we touched on three different services Data pipeline

31
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.940
database migration service or GMs and AWS glue.

32
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.220
Anything related to streaming is going to be the can.

33
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.720
Is is family of services.

34
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.340
So data streams, data, firehose, data analytics and video streams.

35
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.240
No, the differences between them and what they're used for.

36
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.240
And finally we talked about Amazon Am our Athena and Red GIF spectrum.

37
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.340
M R is used for working with a massive amount of data in a distributed way,

38
00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.100
and Athena and Red Shift Spectrum are both used for SQL queries on your data.

39
00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.990
But unless you're already using Red shift,

40
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.910
Athena is the way to go in the cleaning and preparing phase.

41
00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.900
Understand some common ways to handle missing values,

42
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.640
outliers, formatting and scale.

43
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.510
Be familiar with some of the common visualizations we covered.

44
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.640
Scatter Plot Correlation, Matrix histogram and box plots.

45
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.820
No that feature engineering is all about adding,

46
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.240
removing or combining features to give your model more predictive power.

47
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.090
This also includes the step of encoding.

48
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.740
So taking categorical data, for instance, and changing it to numeric data.

49
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.060
And for AWS services,

50
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.990
ground truth can be used to help with labeling the data for terminology.

51
00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.350
Make sure you understand that nominal means order does not matter,

52
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.800
and for ordinal, order does matter.

53
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.780
And you'll definitely need to be familiar with how one

54
00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.310
hot encoding works on this slide.

55
00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.810
Shows an example of that for the training and evaluation phases ID

56
00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.850
strongly suggest going out to the developer guide and working through

57
00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.860
that whole list of algorithms out there.

58
00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.180
No, generally, what they're used for and how they work for data splitting.

59
00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.040
Know that you want to set of data for training, validation and testing.

60
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.010
The split could be 70 2010 like we used in the course,

61
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.680
but there's other valid ways to split is,

62
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.880
well, no steps to create a model in sage maker and for evaluation.

63
00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.540
The goal here is to have the model generalize not over fit or under fit,

64
00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.870
know how to identify and prevent over fitting and under

65
00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.390
fitting for hyper parameter tuning.

66
00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.840
Remember, these are the knobs that you can use to tune the algorithms behavior,

67
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.980
and all those details are in the developer guide confusion matrix.

68
00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.860
You'll definitely be asked about this one.

69
00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.080
So make sure you know how to fill out The Matrix with your true positives,

70
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.380
your true negatives and so forth and for accuracy,

71
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.680
precision and recall.

72
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.890
You'll need to memorize those formulas and know how to

73
00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.020
calculate the scores for deploying and monitoring.

74
00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.630
Know that architecture and security best practices applying machine learning

75
00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.650
just like they do everywhere else for deploying a model.

76
00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.890
No,

77
00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.400
that you first need to create your endpoint configuration and then the actual

78
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:09.000
endpoint and for monitoring the two services to know about. Here are CloudWatch and CloudTrail.
