00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:03.230
[Autogenerated] before we get into answering the question of what

2
00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:05.520
exactly machine learning can do do and can't do.

3
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.240
Let's talk about why it should matter to you.

4
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.170
Unless you've been living under a rock lately.

5
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.840
I'm sure you know that AI and ML are the future.

6
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.610
With increases in computing power,

7
00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.030
the cloud and the amount of data we have access to machine

8
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.890
learning's time has come and for you specifically,

9
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.340
there's tons of opportunities in this space.

10
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.550
In fact, according to indeed,

11
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.310
DOT com Machine Learning Engineer was ranked the number one job in 2019

12
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:37.440
and job posting Screw 344% between 2015 and 2018.

13
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.310
This is a really,

14
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.990
really good place to be right now for AWS in

15
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:43.970
particular their leader in the space.

16
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.890
According to Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Cloud Ai Developer services,

17
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.590
published in February 2020 this upper right quadrant

18
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.990
shows that they have the completeness of vision and the

19
00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.700
ability to execute in this area, and that's all great news.

20
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.460
But you might be saying, What exactly is machine learning on AWS?

21
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.000
How do I get started and how do I get certified? I'm glad you asked
