00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:05.440
[Autogenerated] Let's recap the key points to remember for this module.

2
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.840
The first thing to remember if you haven't already is to delete the resource

3
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.570
is that you've used if you followed along with the demos.

4
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.640
I showed you this at the end of our last demo.

5
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.570
You haven't S3 bucket, a sage maker endpoint,

6
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.140
a sage maker application and your Jupyter notebook instance in kernel.

7
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.940
You can stop these for the management console and from within Sage Maker studio.

8
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:27.980
So with that out of the way,

9
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.820
the important points to remember are two use

10
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.960
architecture and security best practices.

11
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.740
Azure designing and deploying your solution.

12
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:35.730
To deploy the model.

13
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.820
Remember that you first need to create the endpoint configuration

14
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.210
and then the actual endpoint for monitoring.

15
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.440
Use CloudWatch for performance metrics,

16
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.120
and then CloudTrail is for monitoring API activity and finally,

17
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.380
model Monitor a relatively new service that you can use to monitor the

18
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.170
results of the model Once it's out in production,

19
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.730
this will ensure quality,

20
00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.540
and it makes sure that your models not drifting over time,

21
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.490
and that's a wrap for this module.

22
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.940
Up next, let's walk through the overall machine learning stack.

23
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:12.000
We've touched on a lot of things throughout the course so far, but we'll see the big picture and how everything fits together
