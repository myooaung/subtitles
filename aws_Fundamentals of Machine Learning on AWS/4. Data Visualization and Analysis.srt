00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:05,240
[Autogenerated] next up data, visualization and analysis.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,450
Once you've got your data cleaned up, then you want to start to make sense of it.

3
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:10,540
Better understand what you have and how the

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,940
different features relate to each other.

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:16,280
First, you want to look at the descriptive statistics for your dataset.

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,330
This includes things like the number of rows or

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,720
columns in the dataset mean median,

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,370
standard deviation and things like count or the most or

9
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,740
least frequent values that you find.

10
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,720
The point of this is just to get a better sense of the

11
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,540
underlying data that you're working with.

12
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,590
And then with visualization, you can answer things like,

13
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:38,140
Is there correlation between features?

14
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,740
You config really see the mean the men, the max values.

15
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:46,340
You can identify interesting patterns as well as any outliers in the data,

16
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:50,240
and you can more readily see if there's any features that you need to add.

17
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,740
Let's look at some common visualizations that you'll use.

18
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,410
First is the scatter plot.

19
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,740
Scatter plots are great way to show relationship between two variables.

20
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:00,430
As an example,

21
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:04,840
I've taken this one from Wikipedia showing data for old faithful eruptions.

22
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,420
If you don't know,

23
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,590
old faithful is a Geiser in Yellowstone National Park in the U.

24
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:09,840
S.

25
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,860
On the X axis.

26
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,840
We have the eruption duration in minutes,

27
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,050
and on the Y axis we have the waiting time between eruptions.

28
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:19,640
Also in minutes, and with scatter plots,

29
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,960
we show a positive correlation if the line ______ from the lower

30
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,640
left to the upper right like this one does,

31
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,890
and a negative correlation of the line ______ the other

32
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:31,140
way from upper left to lower right.

33
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,240
In this example, we have a positive correlation between weight,

34
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,840
time and duration.

35
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,740
We have either short wait short duration eruptions or

36
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,640
long wait long duration eruptions.

37
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,810
It would be pretty hard to see this relationship if you

38
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:46,630
were just looking at the table of data.

39
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:50,840
So this is a great illustration of the power of data visualization.

40
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,690
Another really important insight we need into our

41
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:55,040
data is how things are correlated.

42
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,040
A correlation matrix lets us quantify the relationship between variables.

43
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,970
Here's an example of a correlation matrix showing the relationship

44
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:06,640
between poverty and various health conditions.

45
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,200
A correlation of one means that the variables are perfectly correlated,

46
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,540
meaning that they move in the same direction.

47
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,980
In other words, as one increases these other increases or as one decreases,

48
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,140
the other decreases.

49
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,490
The correlation of negative one means that they're

50
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:25,480
perfectly negatively correlated, meaning they move in opposite directions.

51
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,140
One goes up, the other goes down and vice versa.

52
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:33,140
And if the correlation is zero, that means there's no linear relationship.

53
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,200
Now you might notice down the middle diagonal.

54
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,940
These are all ones.

55
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:37,640
For instance.

56
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,110
Poverty is perfectly correlated with itself.

57
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:43,440
Breast cancer is perfectly correlated with itself and so on,

58
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,140
so that middle diagonal will always be one.

59
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,170
Sometimes you'll see these matrices with the right upper squares blank,

60
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,820
since they basically mirror the lower left squares.

61
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,740
But I'm going to use the Foley Field out version.

62
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,120
But we can Docker a few things from this matrix.

63
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,650
There's a strong positive correlation between obesity and high

64
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:04,940
blood pressure shown here in the orange squares.

65
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:08,300
We can also see a moderate positive correlation between breast

66
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:12,540
cancer and ______ and no significant meaning.

67
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,240
The numbers are all pretty close to zero correlation

68
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,240
between poverty and any of these conditions.

69
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,730
So that's the correlation matrix,

70
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:24,740
a really important one for understanding the relationships in your data.

71
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,360
Next up is the histogram.

72
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,700
This shows the distribution of your data.

73
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,940
Like the travel times for people shown here on the left,

74
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,780
the values are grouped into bins,

75
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,210
which are the rectangles are bars you see on the chart and in this

76
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:40,320
example we can see the at the majority of people are commuting less

77
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,740
than 30 minutes to wherever they're going.

78
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,750
Box plots are another way to show distribution of data,

79
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,440
but in a very consolidated way.

80
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,250
In this example, we have temperature readings, these upper and lower lines here.

81
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,520
These are called whiskers.

82
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,940
Like a cat.

83
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,830
These show the maximum and minimum values.

84
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:03,440
And then the line in the middle is the mean value.

85
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,440
We can see the at the majority of cases meaning 50% or more,

86
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,540
earned the range shown in this box.

87
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,840
And then we've got a few outliers on the top and bottom of that range.

88
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,040
In this example, the majority of temperatures are between 67 75 degrees.

89
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:25,540
The max temp is 79 degrees, men is 57 degrees and the mean temp is 70.

90
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,940
And then we've got a couple of outliers,

91
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,410
so that wraps it up for some of the common data visualizations that you'll see.

92
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,370
There's definitely others that you come across,

93
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:39,000
but hopefully that gives you an idea of how powerful they are in understanding your data.
