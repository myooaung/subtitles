00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:03.370
[Autogenerated] in this clip will take what we've learned so far

2
00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.110
in the module and apply it to Globomantics,

3
00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.240
the wireless carrier we've been following.

4
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.140
What is the current pain point?

5
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:11.440
Well,

6
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.370
customer turned last year was 14.5% and we have no way to predict who

7
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.540
will leave so that we can incentivize them to stay.

8
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.140
How are we currently solving this problem?

9
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.520
If a customer gets angry during the service call and threatens to leave,

10
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.940
then the customer service agent can offer them an incentive.

11
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.140
And this is something.

12
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.350
But at that point it might be too late.

13
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.750
It would be really nice if we could be more proactive about

14
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.640
incentivizing those customers who are flight risks.

15
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.720
What data do we have?

16
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.840
And is it labeled?

17
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.710
Here's a snapshot of the data will be working within the demos you'll see here.

18
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.970
There's a good amount of features again, those are the columns for observations.

19
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.040
There's a lot more than I can show here,

20
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.740
but this will give you a sense of what we have to work with.

21
00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:57.450
And then finally,

22
00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.510
the target that we're trying to predict is whether the

23
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.230
customer will churn and you'll see we have a label for that

24
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.740
in the final column called Churn.

25
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.410
So our machine learning problem is predictive.

26
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.190
A customer will leave, our target is true or false,

27
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.750
and the type of problem we're solving is a binary classification problem,

28
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.440
which falls under supervised learning.

29
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.940
Next, how will we define success?

30
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.650
We're going to say that we want the customer churn rate to drop to 4% and

31
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.940
customer retention incentives shouldn't exceed $750,000.

32
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.970
This question about success is an important one to answer upfront.

33
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.140
Before you do anything with your data or model or anything else,

34
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.230
you can spend a lot of time and resource is putting

35
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:40.990
together a machine learning solution.

36
00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.280
But if you don't know how you're defining success,

37
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.850
then how will you know when you're done or if it

38
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.240
was even worth the effort spent?

39
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.240
What are the trade offs?

40
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.580
Well,

41
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.780
some customers will be given incentives even though they're not turned risks,

42
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.310
and then some customers who are given incentives are going to leave.

43
00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.450
Anyways, we know this won't be a perfect solution,

44
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.440
so you want to think through the trade offs and if they're worth it,

45
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.440
Finally, what's out of scope.

46
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.370
What aren't we trying to solve or account for with this solution the

47
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.940
activation or downgrade of service or features?

48
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.460
In other words, if somebody switches to a cheaper plan,

49
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.340
we're not trying to solve that as a turn problem and the sales

50
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.640
experience of performance of the customer service agent.

51
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.840
While the customer's interaction with the agent definitely

52
00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.520
has bearing on how happy they are or not,

53
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.140
we're not going to account for that in our machine learning solution.

54
00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.680
So hopefully that helps you to see how to transform a business

55
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.450
problem into a machine learning problem and think through some of the

56
00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:44.000
nuances that might not be apparent upfront. And with that, let's wrap up the module.
