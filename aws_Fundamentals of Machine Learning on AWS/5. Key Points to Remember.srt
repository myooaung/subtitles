00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,980
[Autogenerated] This was a fairly short module,

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:06,440
but there's a few key things you need to remember for the exam.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,450
At the top level,

4
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,550
AI services go back and review the services we talked

5
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:15,450
about and understand it a high level, what each does and some typical use cases.

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,140
There are several questions on the exam about what these services do

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,630
Also know that you can use them in combination.

8
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,270
For example, maybe I use transcribed for speech to text,

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:29,620
and then I use comprehend to make sense of it for email services.

10
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,120
We've covered a lot throughout the course,

11
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,600
but one additional thing to remember is that the marketplace

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,340
is used for accessing pre built models, data sets and algorithms,

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,160
and then for the bottom tier of frameworks and infrastructure.

14
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,940
Just know that their support for many of the popular frameworks

15
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,970
and interfaces also know that elastic inference can do help lower

16
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:51,420
the cost of in prints and green grass is used for machine

17
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,220
learning at the edge or on I O.

18
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,940
T devices.

19
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,060
And with that, let's move to our final module,

20
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,560
where all recap the takeaways from the course overall and

21
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:05,000
then talk about what you could do next to continue your learning and studying for the exam
