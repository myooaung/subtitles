[Autogenerated] Hello there.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,420
And welcome to this next module.

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,520
I'm Amber is Wilson.

4
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,760
Thanks for sticking with me in the last module we talked

5
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,240
about When it makes sense to use machine learning and when

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,400
it doesn't in this module, we're going to go to the next step,

7
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,780
taking those opportunities,

8
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,170
categorizing them and then getting them into a form

9
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,840
that a computer could work with.

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,120
We'll cover the types of machine learning problems and

11
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,730
then work through how to define the problem in a format

12
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:25,980
that we can eventually feed into.

13
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,420
The algorithm will cover some core concepts and then apply

14
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,740
them using some real world scenarios.

15
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,000
Remembering back to our company Globomantics they

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,440
have a problem with customer churn.

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,340
How exactly do you think machine learning could help solve that problem?

18
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,190
In this example,

19
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:44,850
we're feeding in customer data things like the type of

20
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,120
service plan there on how Maney service calls.

21
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,340
They've made that type of thing.

22
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,660
We train the model on that data so we know what a

23
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,140
customer flight risk looks like.

24
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,240
And then, for new data,

25
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,990
we should be able to predict the likelihood that

26
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,540
that customer will leave or turn.

27
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:04,000
Now let's talk more about this piece in the middle. The algorithm
