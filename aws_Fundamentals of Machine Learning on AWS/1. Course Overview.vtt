[Autogenerated] Hi there.

2
00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.880
My name is Amber Israel Sin and welcome to my course

3
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.400
fundamentals of machine learning on AWS.

4
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.930
I've been a developer, author and technical trainer for over 16 years,

5
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.540
and I must say it's an exciting time to be in technology right now.

6
00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.000
You've probably heard about how machine learning is shaping

7
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.740
our world from facial recognition to package delivery speech

8
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.240
recognition to self driving cars.

9
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.340
But how do you get started in this cutting edge field?

10
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.640
That's what this course is all about.

11
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.840
In the upcoming modules,

12
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.000
you'll learn how to solve real world problems with

13
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.740
AWS Machine Learning Technologies.

14
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.060
First, you explore what M.

15
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.240
L is and how it relates to artificial intelligence and deep learning.

16
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.740
Next, you'll learn how to identify and frame opportunities for machine learning.

17
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.280
You'll discover the end end process, fetching,

18
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.210
cleaning and preparing data training and evaluating

19
00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.340
models and deploying and monitoring.

20
00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.830
Finally,

21
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.070
you'll learn the AWS artificial intelligence and machine learning

22
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.650
stack that enables this process and see those technologies in

23
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.040
action with Amazon Sage Maker Studio.

24
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.310
When you're finished with this course,

25
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.680
you'll have the skills and knowledge of AWS machine learning technologies

26
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.150
needed to solve real world problems This course will also lay the foundation

27
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.640
for the AWS machine Learning specialty certification.

28
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.940
The course is targeted a software developers and data scientists who

29
00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.780
want to learn the basics of machine learning on AWS,

30
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.180
a secondary audiences business decision makers who want to understand how

31
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.840
machine learning convey used to solve business problems.

32
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.440
While you don't need any prior machine learning experience,

33
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.740
you should know the basics of Amazon Web Services before continuing.

34
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:53.000
I hope you'll join me in this journey in fundamentals of machine learning on AWS at Pluralsight.
