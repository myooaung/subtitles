X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.010
Moving on to the styling.

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.145
Let's go over to the sidebar and create our style sheets,

00:00:05.145 --> 00:00:08.775
which I'm gong to call the styles.css.

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:11.610
We can then link this inside of our index,

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.270
inside of the head section with the link element.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.565
The relationship is a style sheet,

00:00:17.565 --> 00:00:19.965
and this is new root of our project.

00:00:19.965 --> 00:00:23.700
We can link this with styles.css.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.430
Open this up, and as ever,

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.020
we're going to begin with our HTML section by setting the root font size.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.630
This is just the way I do things by setting this to be 10 pixels.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.375
To make the calculations really easy when converting this with a REM.

00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:45.460
But as ever, you can approach this in any different way which you prefer.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:52.620
Your body section for this is going to have a background which will be a linear gradient.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.535
Then we can add inside our two values to blend between.

00:00:58.535 --> 00:01:03.020
The first one, a hex value of 3b3b3b.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.930
The second one is going to be pretty similar.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.820
This is going to be 2b2b2b.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.020
If you're using the live server,

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.025
you can just save the file and this will update the browser immediately.

00:01:16.025 --> 00:01:19.260
If not, just go to the browser and hit refresh.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:25.090
After the background, we can also set the height of this to be 100 percent.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.690
This will stretch the background as we get more content.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.450
The color currently on text is a little too dark for the background.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.190
So I'm going to change this to be a value of white smoke.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:42.945
Also a larger font size of 1.4 REMs.

00:01:42.945 --> 00:01:46.065
We can also center this with margin.

00:01:46.065 --> 00:01:48.070
I'm going to go for two REMs,

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.000
which will be on the top and bottom,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.990
and then zero on the left and right.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.645
Some padding, which is going to give us some space

00:01:55.645 --> 00:01:58.665
in the inside of this gray body section,

00:01:58.665 --> 00:02:00.905
also of two REMs.

00:02:00.905 --> 00:02:04.870
We can center the text with text-align center.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.685
Then after this, we'll go over to the index page.

00:02:07.685 --> 00:02:11.845
We can see that inside the body we have this div with the class of player.

00:02:11.845 --> 00:02:15.575
This is going to surround pretty much all of the content inside.

00:02:15.575 --> 00:02:17.390
Just like we see only the final version,

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.040
we're going to give this a background color,

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.330
which is this purple color,

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.005
and it also has a radial gradient.

00:02:23.005 --> 00:02:25.565
We have the darker color in the center,

00:02:25.565 --> 00:02:29.870
and then it spreads out to be a lighter color on the outside.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.830
Our target is player class over in our style sheet.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.300
Let's set our background and the radial gradient.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:49.125
The two values I'm going to go for is going to be 211e24.

00:02:49.125 --> 00:02:56.590
The second one, again, a hex value you this is 4f3341.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.420
We now see our radial gradient,

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:05.130
which comes from the center of the background and blends out to the outside edge.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.690
After this, some padding to give this some spacing on

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.410
the inside of the element of two REMs,

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:18.210
and then we can round the corners of this purple section with our border radius.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.010
Now the wrapper is taken care of,

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.405
and we now need to move inside of this player section,

00:03:26.405 --> 00:03:28.940
and then begin to work with our content.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.345
At the very top, we have this image and the image is a little too large for our project.

00:03:34.345 --> 00:03:37.750
If we go over into our style sheet, we can target this.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.690
Then we can restrict the width to be 50 percent of the available space.

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.530
After our image, we don't need to do anything with

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.205
this audio section because we're using our own custom controls,

00:03:49.205 --> 00:03:51.280
which are listed just below.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.170
This control section has the ID of controls.

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.780
We're going to use is to add a border and also some padding to the section,

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.740
just like we see in the final version.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.760
The idea of controls,

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.230
we target this with the hash.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.000
The border, this is going to be one pixel wide,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.700
a color of light slate gray.

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.830
This is also going to be a solid line.

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:22.750
To round the corners, we can add

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.565
our border radius of 10 pixels or we can also do one REM.

00:04:28.565 --> 00:04:34.725
Also some padding on the inside of the section to give it some spacing from our controls.

00:04:34.725 --> 00:04:37.000
Currently, now we see less content on

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.265
the screen since we've made the image a little smaller.

00:04:39.265 --> 00:04:42.100
We can now see that the gray background color which we had for

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.865
the body section is now not covering the full height of the page.

00:04:45.865 --> 00:04:51.175
To fix this, we can change the height to be 100 percent of the current view board height,

00:04:51.175 --> 00:04:53.200
which is the height of the browser.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.630
We can also make sure that this is the minimum too.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.940
Go over to our HTML and then inside here,

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.530
we have this class of controls wrapper.

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.490
Inside here, this contains our two spans which have

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.730
our icons for the play and pause controls.

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:13.800
We can target all these fun elements which are inside of our control wrapper.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.470
Back over to our style sheets.

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.480
We can then target the controls_wrapper.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:26.420
Then we can select all of the span elements which are immediately follow this div.

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:30.860
Inside of here we want to make sure that the mouse cursor is a pointer.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:36.145
This will change our pointer each time we hover over any of these icons.

00:05:36.145 --> 00:05:40.580
The color, this is going to match the border,

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.265
so this is going to be light slate gray.

00:05:43.265 --> 00:05:47.765
We can make these larger with the font size of six REMs.

00:05:47.765 --> 00:05:50.920
Some padding to give this some spacing.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.070
Then we're going to move onto our songs.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.570
First of all, inside of this wrapper,

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:59.825
we also have this p element with the ID of currentSong.

00:05:59.825 --> 00:06:02.180
Each time the user clicks on any of these songs,

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.085
we're then going to grab the song name,

00:06:04.085 --> 00:06:06.320
and then place this at the very top.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.010
We also need to handle what to do if a song title is really long,

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:13.160
since we don't want this spilling off the edge of the screen.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.200
The way to do this, if we grab our ID,

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.110
which is currentSong, and we use the hash.

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.925
All we're going to do to prevent this is to set

00:06:22.925 --> 00:06:26.470
the overflow property and set this to be hidden.

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:29.945
This is basically going to hide the rest of the title,

00:06:29.945 --> 00:06:32.840
which is too wide to fit inside the container.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.690
If our title was right across the page,

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:37.910
as soon as it got to the edge of our div,

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:40.240
the rest of the text would then be hidden.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.340
We can also do the same down in our song list.

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:48.750
So we scroll down. The song section has this ID of songList.

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:56.140
We'll do the same, we'll set the overflow to be hidden.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:01.175
We can also align all texts over to the left of our section.

00:07:01.175 --> 00:07:04.955
Each one of our songs is a list item.

00:07:04.955 --> 00:07:10.330
Back to our HTML, we have our list items which wrap each one of these songs.

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.315
We can also change the cursor to be a pointer

00:07:13.315 --> 00:07:16.465
each time the user hovers over any one of these songs,

00:07:16.465 --> 00:07:19.340
just like we did with our icons.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:24.960
Our list item. The cursor is going to be a pointer.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:31.300
Also 1.5 REMs of padding to give us some spacing between each of our songs.

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:35.470
We have our spacing, and we can also see that

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:39.720
the cursor changes to a pointer when we hover over each one of these.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.615
We can also make sure that

00:07:41.615 --> 00:07:45.985
the background color changes to be a matching red color to these headphones.

00:07:45.985 --> 00:07:51.140
Let's do this when we hover over any of these list items, so li.

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:53.680
We can select the hover state.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:08:01.380
All we're going to do is to set the background color to be a red value, which is f3644b.

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:07.160
This is now the base of the styling for our application,

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.085
and it also looks pretty good on the small screen.

00:08:10.085 --> 00:08:12.500
However, if we make this a lot wider,

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.035
we may want to introduce a media query

00:08:15.035 --> 00:08:17.945
to restrict the maximum width of this body section.

00:08:17.945 --> 00:08:22.255
Let's add this at the very bottom at media,

00:08:22.255 --> 00:08:28.820
and then we'll select all of our screens with a minimum width of 800 pixels.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.480
Select our body section,

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:36.085
and then we can set the maximum width to be 60 percent of the view bar width.

00:08:36.085 --> 00:08:41.285
Also the font size, let's increase this to be 1.8 REMs.

00:08:41.285 --> 00:08:44.560
The body section is now restricted,

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.910
but we also need to place this back into the center. Let's do this.

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:53.410
If we go back to our original body section and inside the margin,

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:56.305
we're setting two REMs in margin on the top and bottom.

00:08:56.305 --> 00:08:58.755
Put zero on the left and right.

00:08:58.755 --> 00:09:02.105
We can fix this by setting this to be auto,

00:09:02.105 --> 00:09:07.340
and this will split up any remaining margin on the left and right equally.

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:10.175
This is the styling now done for our app.

00:09:10.175 --> 00:09:15.210
Then next up, we're going to move on to adding JavaScript to list all of our songs.
