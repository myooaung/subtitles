00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.115
Hey, welcome to this class.

00:00:11.115 --> 00:00:13.680
If you are a web development beginner and

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.590
want to just jump in and build some fun projects,

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.840
you've came into the right place.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.740
The idea behind this series is to show you what you can do

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.565
with regular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

00:00:26.565 --> 00:00:28.830
I'm not going to be using any frameworks,

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.550
any boilerplate, any libraries or any templates.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.970
Instead, we are going to be building everything completely from scratch

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:42.130
step-by-step to show you how these free technologies all work together.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.050
During this course, we'll download various songs

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.125
which we going to include in our application.

00:00:47.125 --> 00:00:49.625
Then we'll list these out down at the bottom.

00:00:49.625 --> 00:00:52.190
Once the user clicks on any of these songs,

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.570
we then have access to all of the controls over at the top here,

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.995
we're going to click on the play button,

00:00:57.995 --> 00:01:00.889
we can pause, we can adjust the volume.

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:04.310
We see exactly which song is currently playing and also we have

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:08.470
this progress bar which is updated about the song duration.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.400
This is what we are going to be creating.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.234
We'll create this completely from scratch using HTML,

00:01:13.234 --> 00:01:16.940
CSS, and make it fully interactive using JavaScript.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.180
We'll also add some nice animations when we click on a song,

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.245
make these headphones bounced too.

00:01:22.245 --> 00:01:25.650
This application will teach you a broad range of skills,

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.765
including HTML audio, working with CSS styling and animations.

00:01:30.765 --> 00:01:32.820
Of course there will be lots of JavaScript too.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.765
We'll have arrays of songs which will loop through and then display in the browser.

00:01:36.765 --> 00:01:38.310
We will add event listeners,

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.880
so this song is activated when the user clicks on it.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.210
We'll work with audio controls for playing, pausing,

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.590
re-loading, volume sliders, working with the song timing and duration,

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.235
and a lot more JavaScript fundamentals such as template strings,

00:01:52.235 --> 00:01:54.935
working with functions, conditional statements,

00:01:54.935 --> 00:01:57.250
constants, and so much more.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.500
This class is designed for JavaScript beginners.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.785
However, do bear in mind that this is the sixth project in this JavaScript Fun Series,

00:02:05.785 --> 00:02:07.970
so if you are a JavaScript beginner,

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.480
I would recommend that you go through the first projects to begin,

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.735
to give you a good grounding for reaching at this stage.

00:02:14.735 --> 00:02:17.315
Although if you do have some JavaScript experience

00:02:17.315 --> 00:02:20.450
you could just jump straight in to this project.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.730
Thank you for taking an interest.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.750
I hope this class is enjoyable and I'll see you inside the first lesson.
