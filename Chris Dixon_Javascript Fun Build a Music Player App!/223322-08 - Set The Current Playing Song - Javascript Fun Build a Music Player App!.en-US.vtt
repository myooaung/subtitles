00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.240
This is going to be a pretty straightforward video.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.830
All we're going to do is to grab

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.520
this song title and then display this inside the browser.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.270
We're going to do this is to select our p element which

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.905
we created early on in the index page.

00:00:13.905 --> 00:00:19.380
This p element has the ID of "currentSong" and is currently set to be empty.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.915
Let's try this with the ID,

00:00:21.915 --> 00:00:24.345
and we can set the inner text.

00:00:24.345 --> 00:00:29.535
We can do this when we select our new song inside of this "onclick" function.

00:00:29.535 --> 00:00:33.255
I'm going to do this just before we load our audio.

00:00:33.255 --> 00:00:36.000
First of all, let's grab our elements.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.340
We can use anything such as "getElementById" or we can use "querySelector".

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.990
As we looked at earlier, "querySelector" will allow us to select any one

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.535
of our elements with a CSS-like selector.

00:00:51.535 --> 00:00:55.200
So we can select like "div" or in our case, we have an ID,

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.625
so we select it with the hash,

00:00:56.625 --> 00:00:59.595
just like we would do in our CSS.

00:00:59.595 --> 00:01:02.560
The ID for this one is the currentSong.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.160
We can then set the inner text of our elements to be equal to a string.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.800
If we just wanted to display some regular text,

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.060
we could add this as a string inside the quotations.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.160
But because we want to add this as a dynamic string

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.535
which is going to take in the current song title,

00:01:19.535 --> 00:01:23.890
we need to insert some variables so we can add this as a template string.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.520
So open up the backticks.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.575
We can start with the text of Now Playing,

00:01:29.575 --> 00:01:35.195
a colon, and then we insert a variable with the $ symbol and the curly braces.

00:01:35.195 --> 00:01:38.600
From the last video, we already know how to get the song title,

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.190
and this is stored inside of our "e.target" and then we select the "innerText".

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.665
We do exactly the same inside here.

00:01:45.665 --> 00:01:51.435
Select the "e.target.innerText" save this file,

00:01:51.435 --> 00:01:53.220
and over to the browser.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:59.340
Click on a song, and this is now displayed inside of our audio player.
