1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:02,860
I'm sure a lot of you have been looking forward to this one.

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,740
We're going to create a flappy bird clone.

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:11,820
So really this is an opportunity to see how you can create games on Android and flappy bird is a relatively

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,030
simple game to create if you haven't heard of it.

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:21,300
It was released in 2013 to the frustration of many IRS users because it was fiendishly difficult at

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,820
the same time being very simple.

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:23,880
It was very popular.

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,510
And actually there's an interesting story behind it about the developer actually removing it from the

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,790
App Store because of all the criticism that he got because people found it so difficult to play.

10
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,350
But anyway you can go away and Google that if you want to find out more.

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,120
I just want to show you very briefly how the game works.

12
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:42,250
So here's a flappy bird or you can go and have a look at it now.

13
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,960
And this just shows you an online version of the game which is pretty similar to the one that we're

14
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,220
going to create.

15
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,490
So you press that.

16
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,670
I didn't even get past the first two.

17
00:00:53,100 --> 00:01:01,050
You keep pressing or clicking on the screen to keep flappy moving up and down.

18
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,750
And then the idea is that you've got these randomly positioned pipes.

19
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,380
They got past one which then you have to get there.

20
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,560
And obviously if you hit the pipe you die.

21
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,760
So it's very simple but it will allow us to see all of the basics of android game creation how we can

22
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:27,930
do collision detection have sprites animating around the screen et cetera et cetera and scoring of course

23
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,520
up there.

24
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,900
So it should be a lot of fun.

25
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,460
We're going to start by downloading live GDX which is a Open-Source gaming library which I thoroughly

26
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,840
recommend if you're going to be hand-coding games.

27
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:47,670
It's actually cross-platform as well so you can build not only Android apps but apps which work on Windows

28
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,280
Mac Linux iOS as well so it's a really good system to learn.

29
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:58,030
But we're still just using Java and we're very much creating a native Android game here.

30
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:04,640
It just gives us a lot of features that we would otherwise need to code ourselves on the Android system.

31
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:13,260
So if you haven't already go to lib GDX dot bad logic games dot com and then click download and then

32
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,480
download the set up app.

33
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,630
I'm just going to save it right there on the desktop.

34
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,850
It's just a small little java application.

35
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:26,490
Fortunately you've got Java installed because you've got android studio up and running.

36
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,530
So you should just be able to tap the

37
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:35,200
downloaded file and then you'll get this.

38
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:40,050
So this allows you to set up your app.

39
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,160
So let's call it

40
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:51,590
flappy bird and then package remember it's something like com.

41
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:57,720
And then your name or your company name and then the app name.

42
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:01,450
So flappy bird and Game class can be whatever you like.

43
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,760
It's just the name of the class.

44
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,000
I'll call it flappy bird.

45
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:08,540
And then you just choose where you want it to appear.

46
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:15,360
And then to get the Android SDK path we can actually get that from Android studio.

47
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:27,550
So just load up and click Tools Android SDK manager and then right there at the top is your STK location.

48
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,580
So that will be very similar to this.

49
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:34,550
If you're on a Mac obviously be something different if you're on Windows.

50
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:41,460
So just copy that and then paste it back in and then I would just stick with whatever the latest version

51
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,330
of Liber GDX is.

52
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,160
And we really want to develop for Android here so to simplify things.

53
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,470
I'm going to get rid of the other three.

54
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,550
There's lots of support online for other platforms if you want to start developing for those as well

55
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,550
but we'll stick with Android for now.

56
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,470
And all the other options I just keep to the default and click generate.

57
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,580
Now you'll likely get this message you have a more recent version of Android build tools than the recommended

58
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,320
version.

59
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,620
I would definitely go for yes there.

60
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:16,590
And similarly Yes for the using the more recent Android API version that would just mean that it's easier

61
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:23,210
to run an android studio without doing any tricky alterations on the app.

62
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,170
So this will then generate the app for you.

63
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,300
And there we go.

64
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:32,820
That's done build was successful that's sounding promising.

65
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:38,350
So now we just go back to android studio and open that in the usual way.

66
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:44,410
So over to desktop and then let's put it in test for some reason.

67
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:52,100
Well I will be fine and then choose that and in this video we're just going to go as far as having a

68
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:58,940
quick look at what it actually includes And what we get if we run the D4 project and then we'll actually

69
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:02,620
start building flappy bird in the next video.

70
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:03,490
So here we go.

71
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:09,000
Let's have a look and see what files we've got so straight away you might notice some differences here.

72
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:11,760
There's no rez folder that we're used to.

73
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,230
We do pretty much everything in Java.

74
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:20,630
And here is our flappy bird class which looks a little bit scary compared to everything that we're so

75
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,360
used to.

76
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:29,870
We've still got our create method which as you can imagine runs when the app is run and now we have

77
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:35,540
a render method as well which is what will mostly be coding in the render method essentially gets run

78
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,320
again and again and again.

79
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:44,300
So you can think of it as an ongoing loop and that's where we'll put our code to animate our stripes

80
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:51,050
to do our collision detection and everything like that to see where the game actually works.

81
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:58,990
So we'll keep it on the same emulator I had open just for convenience there's no need to do this in

82
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,210
API 21.

83
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:03,400
It'll work fine and API 22 as well.

84
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:06,250
So we've got a few new classes there as well.

85
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:11,800
Spryte batch you can maybe imagine that that's essentially a batch of Brandt's that then process to

86
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,470
the screen.

87
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:18,040
And we've got textures which are basically images that we work with and think of them as sprites as

88
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,360
well.

89
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,650
So like a flappy bird hoopy our first texture of sprite that we're going to work with.

90
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:31,990
So all this does it creates a new sprite batch called batch and then it creates a new texture on image

91
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:41,710
which is from the bad logic to J pick J pedofile then it creates a background color which I think is

92
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:42,340
red.

93
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:49,240
And then it draws the image at position 0 0 and then ends the process of drawing the batches.

94
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:53,550
But I'll pass Geo points from Cuba displaying Merilee them.

95
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,330
So let's take a look.

96
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,440
So the output is simply that.

97
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:04,670
So first off notice by default that we're locked into landscape mode.

98
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:08,920
So 0 0 here is the you can think of it as the bottom left.

99
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:10,840
Really even though it looks like the top left.

100
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,800
If you take that round up with the bottom left.

101
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:17,190
And so we've got this red background and the bad logic logo there as well.

102
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:24,610
So that's it we've now set up GDX and we've got the code that we need to get our app working and we're

103
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:30,730
going to start in the next video by changing the background and displaying an animating our little flappy

104
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:33,040
bird sprite should be fun.

105
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,460
So here the.
