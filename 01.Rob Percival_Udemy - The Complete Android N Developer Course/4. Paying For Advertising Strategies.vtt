00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.180
Let's talk about paying for advertising strategies.

2
00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:09.940
Now my personal experience with Google Ad Words is surprising.

3
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.790
It really does work.

4
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:20.200
My strategy is to spend no more than 50 to 100 dollars and split test your ads once you see which ad

5
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.610
works the best.

6
00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:30.250
Meaning getting a high click through rate and a low cost per click you can easily get 80 to 100 fresh

7
00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.460
new daily downloads.

8
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:41.860
Please make sure you use highly targeted keywords and you can also target your device so you don't wind

9
00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.040
up poisoning your money.

10
00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.880
Showing your ads to people not interested in your rap.

11
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.560
Facebook is another great place to get people to download and install your app.

12
00:00:52.570 --> 00:01:01.620
Facebook costs can be even cheaper to get a person to download and install your app versus Google AdWords.

13
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:09.610
Always test drive the traffic using a small amount of your money at first until you see what that traffic

14
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:19.020
is costing you per install and then make an educated decision after you test your paid traffic on ad

15
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.060
words or Facebook or Twitter.

16
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.740
Again always try split testing your ads to see which ad is cheaper if you don't run.

17
00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.050
You'll save money this way with split testing.

18
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:40.720
All you're doing is changing one thing at a time and see how that ad performs against your other ad.

19
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.330
OK I'll see you in the next lecture.
