1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:06,390
So here in the final video of our Android Wear tour I'm going to show you how we can customize.

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:13,980
I watch face on Android Wear and it's actually pretty easy to do an android studio because as I watch

3
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:14,490
face

4
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:24,730
templates include it and you may have noticed it either here.

5
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:25,410
They we get

6
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,290
so I'll keep those the default for now.

7
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,980
You can choose analog or digital probably digital is easier to work with initially to customize.

8
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:44,850
So we'll start with digital and all I'm going to do here is just run you through the code and show you

9
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:51,240
how you might want to change a few things depending on how you want your watch face to work.

10
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:56,990
So here we go.

11
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:04,150
You can see we've got instead of our usual main activity we've got my watch face as our main class and

12
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,560
all I'm going to do is just run the one through the content of my watch face.

13
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,740
Explain roughly what it's doing.

14
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:14,880
And that would give you all you need to start customizing and changing your own watch faces.

15
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,500
So here we go.

16
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:23,380
We've got first off the typeface so you could imagine First off if you want to change the typeface to

17
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,040
anything else you could do that there.

18
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:27,770
Couple of other settings here.

19
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:30,040
The update right.

20
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:36,360
So unsurprisingly the update right here is every second which is probably about right.

21
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:40,670
But if you wanted to say I don't watch kind of a watch you might want to do that every tenth of a second

22
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,350
or something else.

23
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:49,370
And here we've got a message ID which is a number that is passed to our various updating methods.

24
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:58,030
When the time is updated and we've just got to lines of code to create the new engine to update the

25
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:06,430
time this then gets the time zone which is passed to the app via the broadcast receiver and then sets

26
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:14,190
m time appropriately This sets and register time receiver to initially fails to be created later.

27
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:21,250
And then we've got a couple of paint variables paint's allow us to create 2-D graphics so you could

28
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:28,310
just have a simple single color there or you could create patterns and store them in these paint variables.

29
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:33,820
But one for the background and one for the text the ambient billion tell us whether we're in ambient

30
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:39,940
mode which is generally fainter and less battery intensive and full interactive mode.

31
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:45,040
We've got the actual time variable which is actually now deprecate but still in use here.

32
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:50,360
The updated version is actually doesn't say that it is Greggory in calendar.

33
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:55,720
If you want to keep your watch up to date you should upgrade that used Gregorian calendar instead of

34
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,340
time.

35
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:03,860
And then those are the offsets for x and y for our actual watch display.

36
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,330
Almost then this final one as you can see there is a special setting.

37
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,610
If the display supports fewer bits for each color in MGM and be a mode.

38
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:17,340
So if it's true anti-aliasing will be disabled.

39
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,610
All right so now we've got our familiar create method.

40
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:27,390
So this essentially creates the watch face or watch face style builder.

41
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,910
And then we've got our usual sets of options.

42
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,260
So we've got card peak mode.

43
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:36,540
So essentially what notifications are going to be allowed and the default there is peak mode variable.

44
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:41,420
I believe only shows important notifications but you could change that if you want it.

45
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:46,860
We've got the background visibility and you can play with that to see what the various modes are show

46
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,790
system UI time.

47
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,870
So there's a system clock on the screen.

48
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:54,790
Most of the time you probably wouldn't want that piece to be displayed on your clock as well.

49
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:57,010
So that's usually centerfolds.

50
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:03,540
And then we build it then we get some resources for the watch face which we're not really going to be

51
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,580
using here.

52
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:12,600
And we set the y offsets to 90 pixels we create a new page for the background which is just a single

53
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,240
color whatever the digital background by default is.

54
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:24,240
And similarly for the text in color which is whatever the digital text color is and then we've got our

55
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,120
time is created there as well.

56
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:34,050
Now we've got some different methods so undestroyed this happens when the watch faces closed by the

57
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:34,640
user.

58
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,660
So it just removes the messages.

59
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:42,390
So just to clear clear the cache essentially is what's going on that we've got a method for creating

60
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:47,160
the text paint which sets the typeface and the anti-alias.

61
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:55,620
If we're using it as well as the color right moving on we go on visibility changed here which is called

62
00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:00,920
when the watch face becomes visible or when it ceases to be visible.

63
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:07,560
So when it becomes visible we register receiving the updates and time and get the time zone and we set

64
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,680
the time to now.

65
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:14,970
And when it becomes invisible then we unregister that to say again saving battery power.

66
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:19,090
And it also starts all stops the timer as necessary.

67
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:27,320
This method just registers the receiver to get the user's time zone and this unregister the receiver

68
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,200
for it.

69
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:32,060
Again we don't want to be listening for a time zone change if we're not active.

70
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:42,640
This method is another way to get whether the screen is round or square and it's on a apply window as

71
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,270
it sets.

72
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,770
We can actually use this anywhere.

73
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:52,550
And in this method you can use the Boullion is round which you get from insets is round and that will

74
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:57,140
return true if it's round or falls if it's not.

75
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:05,420
So this allows you to set the X offset dependent on the screen shape and also the screen size as well

76
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,400
using get dimensions.

77
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:14,870
OK almost them on properties changed is called When we go in or go out of ambiant mode and this just

78
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:18,190
updates em low bit ambient to keep track of that.

79
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:25,790
So it knows where we are with regards to ambient mode the on time tick is called every minute in ambient

80
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:34,970
mode to update the watch face and the default here is just invalidate which invalidates the canvas causing

81
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:40,870
the watch face to be updated in ambient mode.

82
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:47,030
We've got a fairly straight forward on ambient mode changed so this will happen when the ambient mode

83
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:47,800
is changed.

84
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:51,530
And it just checks to see if we're in ambient mode or not.

85
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:58,730
And updates settings accordingly and then invalidates the canvas so that the watch face will be redrawn

86
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:05,280
the draw method is the main one that you're going to be working with.

87
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:10,070
And this is the method that draws the watch face in ambient mode.

88
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:15,940
So if you wanted to create for example a watch that counts down to Christmas or something like that

89
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:19,570
then this is where you would read to the logic for that.

90
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:26,500
So time gives you the current time and then Currently you can see we're just formatting the screen depending

91
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,750
on whether we're in ambient mode or not.

92
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:33,070
And if we're in ambient mode we're just going to show the hour and minute.

93
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:39,280
And if we're not in ambient mode then we're going to show the hour minute and second.

94
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:44,920
So it's these numbers that you would want to play around with if you wanted to have a different time

95
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:47,950
or display the time in a different format.

96
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:55,630
So for example we wanted a dash instead of a colon there and we would just change it like that.

97
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:04,400
And then it draws the text using the offsets and the text paint variable that we've seen and then this

98
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:10,310
one just updates the timer if necessary as it says if the time isn't running that it starts them off

99
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,590
or stops it.

100
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,580
It shouldn't be running but he's

101
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,710
this one then updates the time more often.

102
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,880
If we're in interactive mode.

103
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:29,790
And finally this part handles the messages to update the watch face or not depending on the time and

104
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,200
the mode etc..

105
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:36,320
So there's a lot of stuff that you probably won't need to mess around with there.

106
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:41,490
The main thing if you are interested in watch faces that I would start off looking at is this on Draw

107
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:44,910
method and just take a look at what editing that does.

108
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:50,860
But you might also want to play around with layouts and images and that kind of thing.

109
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:57,320
If you actually want to sell or distribute a watch face then it's usual usually styles that people are

110
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,250
particularly interested in.

111
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:02,620
So that's probably what you're going to want to play with most.

112
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:08,720
So let's just very quickly see how we initialize this watch face because it's not just the same as running

113
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,590
an app.

114
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:17,620
Once you've run the app on your device you need to select it as a live watch face.

115
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:20,780
So first off to something to notice is in the Android manifest.

116
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,530
We've got a label.

117
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:27,360
My digital and that is the name that appears on the list of watches.

118
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:34,590
So if you wanted to make that something custom you could do that down here in strings SML.

119
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,870
So that's currently my digital if you wanted to change it.

120
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:41,730
Rob is what face or something like that then you would do that there.

121
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:53,730
So here we get to get our watch face up we need to go back to the main home screen and then long press

122
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,650
and then you can jump through.

123
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:02,290
We actually got a couple of my digitals there from my testing earlier.

124
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:11,310
So let's just select one of those and say that's the one that we had before so you can see we've now

125
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:16,850
got the dash instead of a code where I changed it then.

126
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:17,730
So there you go.

127
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:21,120
That's the basics of how to edit a watch face.

128
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:25,740
And that takes us to the end of our tour of Android where I hope you've enjoyed it.

129
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:32,410
And I'll just redirect you back to the Android documentation which is a great place to go.

130
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:36,260
It's got instructions on creating such faces and sinking data.

131
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:41,140
So all of the stuff that we've talked about but in a bit more detail and showing you some of the features

132
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,040
that that I haven't included here.

133
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:47,450
So I hope your brain is whizzing with brilliant ideas for wearable apps.

134
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,780
As always don't be afraid don't worry about it.

135
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,370
Just put something together.

136
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:52,120
Test it.

137
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,690
See if people like it.

138
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:54,430
Best of luck.
