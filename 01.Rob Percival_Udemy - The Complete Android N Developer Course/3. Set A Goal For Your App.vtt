Here I want you to set a realistic goal to achieve for your app..

2
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:13.430
I don't want you to think you'll be the next Flappy Bird creator but I also don't want you to have a

3
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.810
defeatist attitude heading into this business.

4
00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.380
This is a business that has many pitfalls.

5
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:28.650
I'm going to try my best to help you steer around them or even better avoid them.

6
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:37.880
Just think about how much money and hours you have invested with your app and how much you need to make

7
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.050
per day to break even or even show a profit.

8
00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.830
OK I'll see you in the next lecture.
