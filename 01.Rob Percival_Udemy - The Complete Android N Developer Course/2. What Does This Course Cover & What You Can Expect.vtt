00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:08.640
In a nut shell designs course over the last several years by studying the trends of anything dealing

2
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:17.670
with app marketing and monetization since the very beginning of 2008 one thing that was blatantly obvious

3
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.960
to me was that the app marketing ecosystem is a for ever changing beast.

4
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:32.400
I'd say ninety nine point nine nine percent with great certainty that nobody really has a clue how to

5
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.280
successfully market an app today.

6
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.300
The spark hits us all.

7
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:46.380
We or we either build the game ourselves or pay someone to do it for us and just upload the app onto

8
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:52.130
the app stores and sit back and watch the money roll in.

9
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.550
Guess what.

10
00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.420
That actually only worked in the first six months to a year of the iTunes App Store when it first opened

11
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.570
up.

12
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:10.620
Fast forward to several years later and the app developer of today faces a daunting task of making a

13
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.850
living building apps today.

14
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:21.210
This course will prepare you for the road ahead and hopefully make it a much easier and less bumpy journey

15
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.730
for you.

16
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.090
Think about it.

17
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:32.170
Back in the beginning the iTunes App Store was probably getting 10 to 50 games perhaps a day.

18
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.970
Now it's in the thousands if not tens of thousands per day.

19
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:45.710
Over one billion apps in the iTunes App Store and Androids Google Play Store surpassed Apple already.

20
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.380
So why do you need this course.

21
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.730
Forgive me for being blunt here.

22
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.770
If you want a fighting chance of making any living doing something you love doing that you will need

23
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:07.290
to learn this horse's basics which then leads into more advanced top experts strategies tips and thinking

24
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:15.270
outside the box mentality from experts who have successfully received millions of downloads collectively.

25
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.500
I've learned from the very best over the years.

26
00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:26.190
Now it's time you need to level your competition and surpass them with higher AppStore rankings more

27
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.050
downloads and installs and more generated revenue.

28
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:39.980
Now if you want to be successful and not waste your time after all the hard work you did or money you

29
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:47.150
spent having your app built and tested you need to help to level the playing field with the big companies

30
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.780
as well as your established competition.

31
00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:58.720
Ninety nine percent of all app developers think their app is the best thing since sliced bread and maybe

32
00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:06.620
it is but you don't know how to go about promoting it in the right direction or monetizing your app

33
00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.610
correctly from the from the beginning.

34
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:16.310
Then you will most certainly get lost along the great app highway and you'll wind up losing a load of

35
00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.990
money in the process and tearing your hair out.

36
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.870
I've been a very successful app developers since the iTunes App Store first opened way back in July

37
00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.260
2008.

38
00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:37.710
And have studied all the trends involving everything to do with app marketing and monetizing since then.

39
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:43.420
I then said to myself all of this knowledge will help me and others down the road.

40
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:51.300
That's the genesis of why this course exists today to help others make it in the supersaturated app

41
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.490
business marketplace.

42
00:03:53.490 --> 00:04:01.680
The lucky ones that find this course and apply these tried and proven strategies will greatly benefit

43
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:08.460
from the updated current strategies and tips from all the experts I've learned from out there of which

44
00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:13.220
I will be teaching you what's really important for you to know.

45
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.500
I cover everything from A to Z and left nothing out.

46
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:27.870
What I'd like to do is create a discussion group hopefully in the tens of thousands so we can also help

47
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:34.180
each other out with new theories and tips or strategies that worked out for you.

48
00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:41.610
Let's not forget about the best ways to monetize your app is also of great importance here.

49
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:52.100
The average life expectancy for an app today is around two months this course will teach you how to

50
00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.780
squeeze every last drop of revenue out of your users.

51
00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:04.550
Keeping them happy and prolonging your apps life expectancy so you can make even more money in the long

52
00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:05.100
run.

53
00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:13.570
That along with my course being always updated will give you that much needed leg up or edge on everyone

54
00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:21.320
else and your competition rest assured I will always be updating several times a month.

55
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:28.390
But the latest buzz on app marketing to make you that more successful and generate more revenue.

56
00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:36.320
It's one less thing you have to do besides reading the updates here my teaching style is easy going.

57
00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.070
Just sit back listen and take notes.

58
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:46.850
I've included at PTF were notes for each lecture so if you have missed something don't worry everything

59
00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:47.740
is right there.

60
00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:54.950
And each lectures PTF along with the recommended lengths that I want you to read and check out.

61
00:05:54.970 --> 00:06:02.050
This can easily be found by clicking on the downward facing arrow icon in the upper right corner of

62
00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:03.140
your screen.

63
00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:10.990
Under downloadable resources for that lecture I've included 13 quizzes along the way to see how much

64
00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:12.770
you have retained.

65
00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:19.240
Once you have successfully completed this course you Demi will send you a very nice looking certificate

66
00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.740
of completion along with your name that you entered you dummy with.

67
00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.340
With that being said I just don't want to deliver.

68
00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:34.900
I want to over deliver to you here and make sure your money is very well spent here.

69
00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:40.020
My latest updates are always added to the course to keep it fresh.

70
00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.690
So let's get the show on the road shall we.

71
00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:53.410
Over 51 percent of the US population has played mobile gaming at least once a month.

72
00:06:53.890 --> 00:07:02.710
That's roughly 165 million players that are playing mobile games 10 times more than PC gaming these

73
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:03.830
days.

74
00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:12.760
30 percent of the age groups 60 to 75 have played a mobile game within the last seven days.

75
00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:23.140
This shows you the diversity here also in the USA women make up 56 percent of the gamers here 50 percent

76
00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:26.980
of the gamers play one to four hours every week.

77
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:33.590
Twenty five percent play five to nine hours per week.

78
00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:35.840
There is a lot of money to be made here.

79
00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:44.060
If you are an app developer today truly an exciting time to be a successful app developer I should say

80
00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:53.220
but you need to know all the important where when how and why questions before you jump in the deep

81
00:07:53.220 --> 00:08:00.840
end with all the big whales and sharks present today ninety nine point ninety seven percent of all new

82
00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:08.400
app developers today don't really have a clue as to what they need to do to even make it in this business.

83
00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:15.680
This is why this coerse is going to be the most important career purchase you'll ever make.

84
00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:25.520
The app developer of today simply can't stay afloat long enough to even break even if you aren't armed

85
00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:29.170
with the knowledge you'll be learning inside this course.

86
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:35.930
The day is truly over where you could just simply pay a couple hundred dollars and place a banner on

87
00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:43.890
a couple of popular app review sites for a month and make some money back try that today and you'll

88
00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:45.220
fail miserably.

89
00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:53.680
Even if you think your app is terrific this future proof course I create is always being updated as

90
00:08:53.720 --> 00:09:02.300
this is an ever changing ecosystem that changes daily and eats app developers alive in a heartbeat without

91
00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:08.870
showing any remorse for all your hard work and time gig.

92
00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:19.750
Oh M has revealed a tremendous separation between app developer incomes for instance the top 1.6 percent

93
00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:32.530
make over 500000 per month or as 49 percent of Android developers and 35 percent of iOS developers make

94
00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:36.870
less than one hundred dollars per month.

95
00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:39.500
That's a big difference.

96
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:47.280
This fact proves one thing many act of VELLAR purrs are flying headfirst into the deep end of the swimming

97
00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:51.630
pool and don't know what they are doing or how to swim.

98
00:09:51.630 --> 00:10:00.580
They all seem to have an idea of what needs to be done but almost always fall into these pits and that

99
00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:06.300
in reality swallow up yet another app developers dream of hitting it rich.

100
00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:09.330
Or being at least successful.

101
00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:17.150
This is why I've invested my time money and experience into this course in order to help you increase

102
00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:25.520
your odds so you can become more successful in doing this and avoid these many pitfalls that swallow

103
00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.860
up so many good app developers out there.

104
00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:37.820
Just think how many great and fantastic apps we will never get through to experience all because those

105
00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:47.650
app developers just didn't know how to successfully market or even monetize correctly and just quit.

106
00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:55.560
Many people really don't realize or know what it really takes to even reach let's say the top 50 for

107
00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.590
free or paid apps today.

108
00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:04.860
I'll let you know what it takes to do so and the very best ways to break into the top charts for iOS

109
00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:06.210
and Android.

110
00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:13.390
You can expect an increase in your app rankings and thus an increase in your downloads and social engagement.

111
00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:16.500
Just follow this Course's advice.

112
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:19.210
That's why we're all here basically right.

113
00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:24.640
I'm going to teach you all the critical aspects of that marketing.

114
00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:32.110
Some strategies are from the top experts that I've learned from over the years that will help give you

115
00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:40.390
that extra punch to crack into the top categories for your apps genre or niche.

116
00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:45.000
Plus hopefully we will keep growing and growing.

117
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:51.750
Our discussion forum and help one another out so we can be even more successful.

118
00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:59.080
Part of my teaching strategy is to re emphasize certain key points so they stick in your mind because

119
00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:04.690
I feel they are very vital and important for your success.

120
00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:12.760

121

There are no affiliate links inside the main course and just one located in the bonus section at the

123
00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:23.640
very end of this course at this time.

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:25.540
Let's begin.

125
00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.130
OK and I'll see you in the next lecture.
