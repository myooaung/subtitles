00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:09,360
All right let's talk about more ways on how to increase your social engagement for your app if possible

2
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:12,910
always enable chat inside your app.

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,750
This keeps your users engaged and talking to friends.

4
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:21,730
Maybe have tech support where you can answer questions inside your route.

5
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:29,070
Anything to keep your users enlightened engaged and spending a lot of time inside your app is always

6
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:37,550
being tracked by the App Store and calculates all of that data into your apps ranking on their app store.

7
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:42,140
Another way is to use push notifications.

8
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,010
But please be careful using this one.

9
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,660
This can scare them and delete your app.

10
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:52,650
So use this one wisely to lure them back to your app.

11
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,600
Always alert them for things they have opted into.

12
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,290
Or perhaps looking forward to in a positive way.

13
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:07,030
Email notifications should be used only after you have tried.

14
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:13,880
Push notifications because push works better to get your user back into your app.

15
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:21,930
You just have to think to yourself what features do you need to add to your app that will increase your

16
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,530
users social engagement.

17
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:32,660
For example offer your users a daily reward of some kind to get them back into your app.

18
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:41,400
Remember Android users must opt in to push notifications when they install the app they want whereas

19
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:50,700
on iOS the user has a choice whether or not to receive push notifications after they install their wrath.

20
00:01:50,760 --> 00:02:00,150
Please note on the Android platform push notifications must be enabled and requires extra permissions.

21
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:05,810
This results in fewer downloads as a user doesn't want to be bothered.

22
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:13,350
Another way to increase your social engagement and keep your users inside your app is to show them videos

23
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,580
of a few minutes long.

24
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:23,880
Start your own YouTube channel and show all your vids inside your app for them to watch or for them

25
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,220
to watch video ads that you get paid for.

26
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:36,030
By now you should get the picture here and that's to come up with ideas to engage your users to stay

27
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,530
playing with your app.

28
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,730
This is tracked by the App Store a logarithm of which affects your App Store ranking.

29
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:53,100
Don't provide just the link or they will leave your app and that won't help your social engagement if

30
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,570
they leave.

31
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:57,400
Not everybody is going to have a game app.

32
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:06,720
So if you have to say a business app or any non game map you can provide YouTube video tutorials to

33
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,980
keep your users engaged inside your app.

34
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:17,400
Remember you can have all your written content coded so that your user doesn't need to connect to the

35
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,650
Internet.

36
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:26,910
Therefore keep adding fresh new written content that brings your user back on a daily basis which UPS

37
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:29,130
your apps ranking.

38
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:34,070
