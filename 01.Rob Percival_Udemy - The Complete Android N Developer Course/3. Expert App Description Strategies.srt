1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,330
This is a very important part of a process.

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:12,060
This is where you have your best chance at selling your app to all your potential users browsing the

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,480
app market.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,630
This works just like the meta description tag for a web site.

5
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,920
It's not searchable so you don't have to overpacked it with keywords.

6
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,180
This should be around three or four sentences.

7
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:35,190
Google Play allows 80 characters for a short description of your app and up to 4000 characters for its

8
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,850
long or full description.

9
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:48,750
Apple allows 4000 characters for its description section remember only the first 580 characters will

10
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,490
be seen until the viewer has to click on the More button.

11
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,490
The first three lines of your apt description are super important.

12
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:06,030
That's because people looking on a desktop or tablet get to see only the first three lines of your description

13
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,350
plus your app icon and first one or two screenshots.

14
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:21,930
Therefore place your most important words here first for example place any awards you may have one or

15
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:23,540
top reviews here.

16
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,600
Everybody just isn't going to read your entire description.

17
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,040
Tips for both Apple and Android.

18
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,890
The full fold put the most important information before it.

19
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:40,190
List the benefits and features.

20
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:49,080
Never use HVM Ill never sound too technical speak in layman's terms so everyone can understand.

21
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:54,090
Include a call to action to make people feel they need to have it.

22
00:01:54,210 --> 00:02:00,060
You can say download now to enjoy pull that psychological trigger.

23
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:07,310
Include some social proof to help convince people how cool your app is such as awards or reviews.

24
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:15,490
Places always at the very top your apps description will constantly be evolving.

25
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,460
So when you get solid reviews you'll want to add those here.

26
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:26,460
Now if you want to see what your description will look like before you release your app to the store

27
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:31,550
please use a software called app snippet preview.

28
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,870
OK I'll see you in the next lecture.
