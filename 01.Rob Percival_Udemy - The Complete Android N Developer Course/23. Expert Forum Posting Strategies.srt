00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:05,400
OK let's talk about expert forum posting strategies here.

2
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:15,580
I always do a search for your niches forums and Google for example your niche plus forums in the search

3
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:16,450
field.

4
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:23,170
Now register for the ones you see a lot of traffic you can eyeball this by simply looking over all the

5
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:24,450
replies.

6
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,430
If you see high numbers that's great.

7
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:36,640
You can also go to Alexa dot com and copy and paste the forms you are l and see where it's ranked and

8
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,360
who is likely to visit it.

9
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:47,680
By looking at the demographics for that site now read the rules for posting my tip here is provide questions

10
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:54,820
or if you can help someone out even better get your feet wet by answering other people's questions or

11
00:00:54,820 --> 00:01:02,080
asking your own for about a week or so you want to set up a presence of trust on these forums first

12
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:09,670
then add your app store your arrival with a call to action to your forum signature.

13
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:13,060
And that's where you promote your app from.

14
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,150
Don't just sign up to a new forum and post.

15
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:19,940
Hey I would like it if you checked out my new app.

16
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:22,640
You can download it right here.

17
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,470
That's a no no.

18
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:28,610
You'll wind up getting banned on day one.

19
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:33,630
