00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:06.260
Now that you know how to show and hide use the interface elements as well as working with timers.

2
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.290
We're going to put that together to make a pretty complex app called the brain Traina.

3
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.730
You may have used apps like this before.

4
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:21.660
Essentially this brain Traina app will create a series of sums for you so addition sums to keep your

5
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.090
brain in check and you have to answer as many as you can within 30 seconds.

6
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.760
So initially we've got nothing but this big button.

7
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.980
And then when we press the button we get a timer counting down a score at the top right.

8
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.440
And then in this case a fairly simple sum if we tap it we get it right and add one to our school.

9
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.290
If we get it wrong then it says wrong and obviously doesn't add one to our school.

10
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:54.370
We can then keep on going trying to get more etc..

11
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.810
So you know ID.

12
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.870
Right.

13
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.830
And then when the time runs out you get a summary of your score and then you get the option to play

14
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:08.230
again.

15
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.870
And then it starts all over again.

16
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.610
So that's what we're aiming to create.

17
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:20.310
I'm going to give you one tip that I've used a thing called tags to help me work out which button has

18
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.910
been pressed.

19
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.900
And I recommend you do the same.

20
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.870
So as usual have a Google.

21
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.150
See if you can figure out how that'll work for you or indeed ignore my suggestion completely and do

22
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.120
it another way.

23
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.690
Very welcome to do that.

24
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.380
This is as I say a pretty complicated app compared to anything we've made before.

25
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.040
So if you get completely lost Don't worry about it.

26
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.400
Just take a break and then if you like.

27
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.130
Watch me go through the process of creating it.

28
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.720
But I hope it should be a lot of fun.

29
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.070
Stephanie a challenge.

30
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.070
So best of luck.

31
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.290
I'll give you a moment to pause the video now.

32
00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:58.380
All right.

33
00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.500
That went well.

34
00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.870
I'm going to start Of course by creating a new project

35
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.220
and we'll call it brain drain.

36
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.250
OK.

37
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.130
So we're going to start by designing the main layout.

38
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:27.960
So we'll start with the layout for the kind of launch page so that big button that says go and then

39
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.600
we'll have the layout for the actual quits questions page after that.

40
00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:35.400
Here we go.

41
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.950
So let's get rid of Hello World.

42
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:53.530
I'm just gonna have a single big button right in the middle of the screen that says Go and call it the

43
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.660
stop button.

44
00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.840
OK.

45
00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:06.190
Very nice but we don't need much bigger text then let's try 80.

46
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.390
Looks pretty good.

47
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.120
I'm going to increase the padding a bit.

48
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.400
So let's try 20.

49
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.160
D p maybe more.

50
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.240
Lovely.

51
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:38.720
And I want the background tint to be Cuore fantastic.

52
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.810
Pretty clear with space to do so when they press the button.

53
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.450
We're going to run the start

54
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:56.940
method which mostly is going to initially at least hide that button.

55
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.210
And then we'll be able to put all the other elements in place.

56
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.720
So that's right.

57
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:12.670
OK to do that say public void start and will be called by the button of course.

58
00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:14.280
And then

59
00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.310
the view framework and then we want to hide that initial button.

60
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:30.360
So again say creates a global variable for it up there.

61
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:38.270
Lovely.

62
00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.100
And then we'll find it in the uncreate method.

63
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:54.600
So start putting equals and then we want to cast our view to a button find the by ID card or ID it start

64
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.840
button there we go.

65
00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:04.960
And then we can just restart button set visibility.

66
00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.820
If you don't invisible

67
00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:18.860
get just a quick one then to make sure that that's all connected OK all of it should happen of course

68
00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.980
is that that big button should disappear when we tap it.

69
00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:29.140
Say tapping the button and there it goes.

70
00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.470
Fantastic.

71
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.900
So everything fine that's fun.

72
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:39.020
Now I'm actually going to update this so that the button is hidden by default so that we don't have

73
00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:46.780
to tap it every time and that makes it much easier to create and lay out as well if we don't have to

74
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.440
hide things behind the button cetera.

75
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:55.360
So let's set the visibility to invisible from the off.

76
00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:00.290
And then let's add in text view at the top left

77
00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:10.650
which is getting say contain the number of seconds left.

78
00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:24.260
So it initially call that 30 seconds and we'll call it time text view.

79
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:29.050
And I think we need to make that a little bit bigger.

80
00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:40.770
Try to NTSA pay maybe 30.

81
00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:46.550
I'm also going to change the background color just to make things a little bit more fun.

82
00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:47.950
So make this yellow

83
00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:54.070
and add a little bit of padding

84
00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:11.130
then on the top right we'll add another label or another text view.

85
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:17.440
This is going to be top right and this is going to be that the number of points.

86
00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:22.280
So initially we're going to have 0 out of 0.

87
00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:31.960
And we'll call it points text Viiv And again

88
00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:42.410
we'll try 40 P.

89
00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:50.430
Let's keep it the same size 30 as P and then padding of

90
00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:57.400
10 DP

91
00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:01.440
and background's

92
00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:08.420
of orange.

93
00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:12.180
Lovely.

94
00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:16.060
And then in the middle here I'm going to add yet another text.

95
00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:23.040
It's going to be aligned to the top but centered which is going to have how some in it.

96
00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:34.730
So let's say we'll start with 31 plus 12 and we'll call this the some text for you.

97
00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:41.000
And then again

98
00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:48.820
we'll have text size money to be a little bit smaller.

99
00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:54.580
So let's try 25.

100
00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:55.630
I think that is good

101
00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:03.650
and padding of 15 DP

102
00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:08.850
OK.

103
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:12.680
I'm also going to make that slightly darker

104
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:16.580
text color up

105
00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:30.020
so we'll have it just slightly off black

106
00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:37.170
great that brings that out little bit of a good sofa.

107
00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:42.120
Now we're going to have our grid layouts to put out buttons into.

108
00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:49.160
So that's going to go underneath all of this.

109
00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:54.700
So let's drag in our first button to this grid layout.

110
00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.520
I'm going to drag it up there.

111
00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:58.960
Just as we did before.

112
00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:04.830
And then I'm going to go over and do a few bits in the text.

113
00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:08.490
So his great laugh and his our button.

114
00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:09.670
So I'm going to set

115
00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:15.230
the column to zero.

116
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:22.150
The Ready to zero because this is going to be my top left button.

117
00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:25.880
I'm going to set the column right.

118
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.200
White T.

119
00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:27.690
One

120
00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.980
on the right white one as well.

121
00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:46.010
And then I'm going to set the layout gravity to fill and now this is this is the new bit I'm going to

122
00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:47.210
set a tag

123
00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:57.280
and this is what I'm going to use to refer to my buttons.

124
00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:02.200
So this one is going to be the first one that's going to have a tag of 0.

125
00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:06.180
So I will see how to use that in a bit.

126
00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:07.000
But there we go.

127
00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.830
So my text for the moment is just going to be a number.

128
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:18.330
Say number three the text size needs to be quite a bit bigger.

129
00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:24.960
So let's say for 20 espie I think we can actually get a lot bigger than that.

130
00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:29.940
Well Dubik to make I mean 50 OK.

131
00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:30.540
Even

132
00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:34.770
larger than that it may be

133
00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:41.750
80 OK.

134
00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:47.870
And then I'm just going to change the background color because we want nice colorful boxes here.

135
00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:59.170
So we'll make this one please.

136
00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:02.100
Lovely.

137
00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:03.950
And finally the unclick

138
00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:12.960
is going to be if I can find it.

139
00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:20.510
She's onza.

140
00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:23.810
OK so now I've set up everything I need.

141
00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:28.240
I'm going to copy and paste the SML for that button.

142
00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:38.610
Four times to get all four buttons and then just update it as I go.

143
00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:43.450
So this one is going to be column 1 0.

144
00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:50.540
The tag is going to be 1 and I'll choose the background color separately.

145
00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:56.900
This one's going to be color 0 or row 1 tag is going to be two.

146
00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:08.560
And then finally this one is going to have column one row one tag three.

147
00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.130
OK.

148
00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:13.320
So I'm liking all of those.

149
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:15.620
We do have some ideas.

150
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.380
Overlapping we don't want

151
00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.630
to buttons with the same ID.

152
00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:31.480
So let's just say those to 0 1 2 and 3.

153
00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:37.880
Then we just need to create different background colors for these buttons.

154
00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:48.050
I can find it

155
00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:55.490
to be very careful not to click on the slider that.

156
00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:57.480
So great for a nice green one.

157
00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:18.180
We'll make this one kind of pinky purple and then bottom writes will make turquoise

158
00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:21.850
OK.

159
00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:22.950
Lovely.

160
00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:25.180
It's a bit like it was designed by a four year old.

161
00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:27.700
But that's as far as my design skills go.

162
00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:30.870
I'm afraid it's at least quite pretty and hopefully quite fun.

163
00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:40.160
The last thing I'm going to do is just change the grid layout to change the height to wrap the content.

164
00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:47.590
So that makes the buttons quite a bit smaller but gives us room to put a correct or incorrect label

165
00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:49.330
underneath.

166
00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:50.140
So let's bring in

167
00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.470
the text you want it to be centered

168
00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:04.940
and became and again will change the text size.

169
00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:10.500
About 50 Espey maybe slightly smaller

170
00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:23.900
and I'll just pick correct said that we know how it's going to look and result.

171
00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:30.370
Text VI.

172
00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:37.560
Only thing I'd like there I think is I'd like a little bit of a margin at the top of my grade out to

173
00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:38.610
move it down slightly

174
00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:42.980
let's just try that

175
00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:47.290
great.

176
00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:51.710
Now I want to move correct down slightly.

177
00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:52.480
There we go.

178
00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:53.510
All right.

179
00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:54.750
I'm happy with the lay out.

180
00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:57.430
Let's start getting some interaction.

181
00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:02.000
So we'll go back over to the main activity together.

182
00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:05.560
And here we've hidden the start button.

183
00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:10.180
I'm not going to worry about showing everything else at the moment because we're just going to start

184
00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:14.070
by default and then right at the end we'll add back in the start button.

185
00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:24.960
So it will actually put our code in the on create method and will start by creating our sum.

186
00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:31.140
So we're going to have two letters that represent numbers that we're going to add together.

187
00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:33.310
So if for example it was going to be 7

188
00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:44.330
plus 8 then we'd do something like that of course we don't want 7 and 8 every time.

189
00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:50.850
So we're going to need a random number generator and we do that in Java as we've seen before using Rande

190
00:16:52.380 --> 00:17:03.720
So first we'll create a random rende which is going to be a new random

191
00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:18.680
OK and then we want a random and will generate an integer and I'm going to generate random numbers between

192
00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.790
0 and 20.

193
00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:27.710
So that means I need to give it a value of 21 and that will generate a random number between 0 and 20

194
00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:31.420
and will do the same thing for the

195
00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:40.140
you can of course have different vocations for your random numbers you might want them to be too small

196
00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:43.090
or you might would want to be a bit bigger or whatever you like.

197
00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:44.550
Doesn't really matter.

198
00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:51.240
So the first thing we're going to do with these random numbers is update the value of this label so

199
00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.860
that the user can see the sum.

200
00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:57.680
So this was some text view.

201
00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:03.240
So let's access that first.

202
00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:04.510
It's a text view

203
00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:09.210
we'll call it some text field.

204
00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:21.390
We need to cast it to a text field and then we'll find it by its ID using our ID or some text field.

205
00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:25.460
OK.

206
00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:31.160
And then we're just going to update some text view.

207
00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:34.080
And we're going to set the text to

208
00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:49.970
integer dot to string I and then plus and then a plus inside the string.

209
00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:53.530
So this plus is not concatenate ending anything.

210
00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:56.160
It's just the plus that appears in the string.

211
00:18:56.730 --> 00:19:05.470
And then we add to that integer to string B.

212
00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:06.430
All right.

213
00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:14.400
So let's just run that and make sure that everything that we've done so far looks OK.

214
00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:19.190
There we go.

215
00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:21.100
So the layout looks nice.

216
00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:24.040
We've got some then which is a couple of random numbers.

217
00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:27.410
Looks good to me and everything else is working.

218
00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:29.890
Now we can generate our answers.

219
00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:31.960
So of course three of them have to be wrong.

220
00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:39.020
And one of them has to be right and the correct one has to appear in a random location within our buttons.

221
00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:43.990
So let's have an answers array list

222
00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:51.500
and these are going to be integers.

223
00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:00.770
And we'll call them ounces I'm defining them up here because we're probably going to need them in a

224
00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:03.740
number of different efforts.

225
00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:13.570
Now we need to generate several random numbers need to generate the three correct answers and also location

226
00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:15.200
of the correct answer.

227
00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:23.170
So let's just define an integer which is going to be location of.

228
00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:31.330
Correct on some.

229
00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:38.020
And then we'll let location of the correct answer be another random number.

230
00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:45.120
This time we wanted to be between 0 and 3.

231
00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:47.440
So we use REM's next.

232
00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:48.160
And then four.

233
00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:58.560
So this will give us 0 1 2 or 3 which makes sense then I'm going to do a little loop which will loop

234
00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:02.960
through each of the values for the buttons.

235
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:12.260
So through four of them and sign them either the correct answer or a randomly generated incorrect answer.

236
00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:20.070
So I'll use a flip I is going to start off being 0.

237
00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:24.030
We're going to keep going as long as I is less than four.

238
00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:36.020
And we want to increment by one each time and then we want to check if he is equal to the location of

239
00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:37.150
the correct answer.

240
00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:42.020
Then we want to set

241
00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:47.360
says

242
00:21:53.280 --> 00:22:02.020
talk pads and then the correct answer which is a plus b

243
00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:14.260
and if it's not then we won't say that generated incorrect answer.

244
00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:17.610
So we'll use Rande next it.

245
00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:24.520
And if we going from 0 to 20 for each of the two numbers that we're adding together then going from

246
00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:31.330
0 to 40 seems sensible for the total.

247
00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:33.110
Now that's a potential issue here.

248
00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:38.100
It's possible that we could generate a random number which happens to be equal to the answer.

249
00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:42.110
And then if they use a tap's that then they would get it wrong.

250
00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:53.070
So to get round that what we'll do is create an integer called incorrect answer.

251
00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:59.000
And then here will generate an incorrect answer.

252
00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:12.360
In just the same way as we did before we'll have a little while loop which will keep on going as long

253
00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:25.220
as the incorrect answer is equal to A the correct answer which is a plus b.

254
00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:31.870
And if that's true then we'll generate a nother incorrect answer.

255
00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:39.520
So that's quite a neat way of ensuring that we don't have an incorrect answer that happens to be the

256
00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:41.270
same as the correct answer.

257
00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:47.950
So this loop will just keep on going until an incorrect answer is generated which is different to the

258
00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:48.800
correct answer.

259
00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:53.110
So probably that won't take more than once or twice would be very unlikely if it did.

260
00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:55.770
But it could keep on going for a long time.

261
00:23:55.780 --> 00:24:02.940
If by sheer chance we kept on getting values which were the same as the correct value.

262
00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:09.770
OK so now we'll add in the correct answer to our array list.

263
00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:15.500
So once this loop is completed we should have four values in our array list of which one will be the

264
00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:22.430
correct answer and that will be at the location of the correct answer which is again generated randomly

265
00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:31.200
then it's a matter of updating the buttons with their matching values.

266
00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:34.150
It's slightly inelegant what I'm going to do but it'll get the job done.

267
00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:37.310
And for four abutments it's probably the simplest way to do it.

268
00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:40.940
I'm just going to update each of them using their IDs

269
00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:46.000
so we'll create

270
00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:51.190
buttons here.

271
00:24:52.750 --> 00:25:05.500
And Button zero is going to be a button line view by id and our DOT Heidi dot buttons here.

272
00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:10.270
And then to keep things moving swiftly.

273
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:11.570
Just copy and paste that's

274
00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:23.010
one T three.

275
00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:29.390
And then we can just update each of those manually.

276
00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:41.480
So button 0 I don't set text and that text is going to be integer to string and then the appropriate

277
00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:50.580
answer for that button which is going to be answer is to get and then zero.

278
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:58.460
So that will set the text of the first button to the first answer.

279
00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:00.300
And then

280
00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:06.160
second button to the second down to it set up

281
00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:19.910
and just before we run that we do actually need to set up answers or a list to be a new array list of

282
00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:20.830
integers.

283
00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:24.390
Otherwise it's not initialized and we can't actually use it.

284
00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:38.750
OK we should with any luck find that we now get a set of four numbers of which one is the correct answer.

285
00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:41.710
So 12 plus 15 is 27.

286
00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:45.600
And that answer is that the other answers are incorrect.

287
00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:46.170
Fantastic.

288
00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:47.800
I just want to test that again.

289
00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:51.120
Just to be absolutely sure.

290
00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:55.130
So next time we should get a different random number.

291
00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:56.910
And there should be in a different location.

292
00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:01.770
So six plus four is 10 which is there and we get some other incorrect answers.

293
00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:02.470
Brilliant.

294
00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:11.490
So now let's add the code for the user to set their correct answer.

295
00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:17.250
We call that cheese on some.

296
00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:18.680
So I'm going to have that

297
00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:23.160
say public void

298
00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:27.710
Jews onza.

299
00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:34.750
And that's going to be called by one of the buttons which of course is a view.

300
00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:41.020
And now this is the clever bit using the tag will allow us to tell which of the buttons has been tapped.

301
00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:51.430
So for now just to convince us that the tags are working let's use logged or I and then tag and then

302
00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:56.820
get the tag of the button that was tapped.

303
00:27:57.070 --> 00:28:01.690
We use view to get the button and then get tag

304
00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:09.620
and then we do just need to cast that to a string which will do that for us.

305
00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:12.980
OK.

306
00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:19.500
So that should print to the logs 0 1 2 or 3 depending on which button we've test.

307
00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:20.900
We've tapped.

308
00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:22.750
Let's just check that that's true.

309
00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:28.180
And then of course we can check that against location of the correct answer to find out whether or not

310
00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:30.080
the user has got it right.

311
00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:34.360
Here we go.

312
00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:41.520
So yep that was the 0 1 2 3 billion.

313
00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:43.370
So we're getting the tag.

314
00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:50.050
So now we need to take the tag and compare it to the location of the correct answer.

315
00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:57.150
So we'll do that by converting both of them to strings.

316
00:28:57.350 --> 00:29:08.240
So I will use view it gets tag to string and then we're going to compare that and remember when we're

317
00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:15.030
comparing two strings we use equals and then the other string is going to be location of correct answer

318
00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:16.940
which is of course an integer.

319
00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:20.230
So we're going to need to convert that to a string as well.

320
00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:26.130
So what is integer to string and then location of correct answer.

321
00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:36.480
So if those match then will log

322
00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:40.680
for now.

323
00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:41.400
Correct.

324
00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:51.020
Remind about the spelling them just want to check to see if this works.

325
00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:56.880
OK.

326
00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:59.740
Six plus years is six.

327
00:29:59.750 --> 00:30:03.010
So with any luck it displayed Carex.

328
00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:03.940
Fantastic.

329
00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:10.240
And just to be sure again we get correct for the others.

330
00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:12.400
Nothing happens.

331
00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:19.260
William So now we need to think about what we're going to do when the user gets the correct answer.

332
00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:27.370
We're going to need to add one to that school and then generate a new question so generating a question

333
00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:30.020
we're going to do that regardless of whether they've got it correct.

334
00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:34.680
So really the only thing we need to do to get it right is add one to that school.

335
00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:41.170
So let's have a school variable which will initially set to.

336
00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:53.010
And then if they get it right school plus plus and come to think of it we also do need to update the

337
00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:54.820
label.

338
00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:59.930
So the result text few label to say correct even though it already does

339
00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:11.440
say let's have a text we call it result text.

340
00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:16.820
We'll find it down here.

341
00:31:22.510 --> 00:31:24.070
It's going to be a text we

342
00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:36.580
are going to find it by its ID and Id dot results X-Fi should be my second nature doing that now.

343
00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:47.250
So now we can take result text V and set the text to correct

344
00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:53.310
and then if they get it wrong.

345
00:31:55.420 --> 00:32:06.860
Then we dont increase the score but will set the text of the result text view to wrong.

346
00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:11.410
OK.

347
00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:13.380
And then lets just go back and

348
00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:30.130
set the contents of that text view to 0 or to empty start with and now we should generate that label

349
00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:32.110
or the label content.

350
00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:34.170
At least when we get it right or wrong

351
00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:41.050
so plus 14 16 is correct.

352
00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:42.900
Fantastic.

353
00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:49.250
Just to make sure make sure that the wrong label appears when necessary as well.

354
00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:55.980
And plus one is not 11 that's wrong.

355
00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:58.450
So we're looking good.

356
00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:01.720
Let's then keep track of this score.

357
00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:03.710
So we need to display that to the user.

358
00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:08.070
And we're doing that up here in our points text view

359
00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:16.940
as well as the school we need to know the number of questions.

360
00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:22.680
Which again is going to be Zerah.

361
00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:27.210
And here we're going to increment the number of questions.

362
00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:33.650
Either way whether they get it right or wrong they still get in the question.

363
00:33:33.770 --> 00:33:35.060
So now we need to find

364
00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:40.360
the what was it called points text view

365
00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:47.780
say text VI points text view

366
00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:52.180
down him

367
00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:02.670
points text is a text view finding it by its ID.

368
00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:05.240
Ideato points text for you.

369
00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:07.470
Lovely.

370
00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:13.190
So now we can set the points text view

371
00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:24.740
text to and we want a slash in the middle and we want the school

372
00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:28.700
as a string

373
00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:48.120
and then the slash and Ben we want to convert the number of questions to a string say let's just quickly

374
00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:48.800
check that.

375
00:34:48.990 --> 00:34:53.950
We should now find the ones with answer to a question it updates the school

376
00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:57.400
correctly for us

377
00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:07.270
say 7 1 out of 1 billion.

378
00:35:07.330 --> 00:35:08.450
This is looking good.

379
00:35:08.770 --> 00:35:14.560
So now we need to generate a new question each time a question is answered.

380
00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:24.390
So if you've been paying attention you're probably thinking that we need to create a new method generate

381
00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:25.000
question

382
00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:34.810
because we're going to want to call that various points.

383
00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:35.990
So here's our code.

384
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:43.900
Remember that generates the question.

385
00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:50.580
So I'm just going to cut all of that that generates a question at the beginning.

386
00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:58.210
And then put that Kate in the I'm going to need

387
00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:05.940
those buttons to find elsewhen.

388
00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:08.430
Let's just get rid of the definitions that

389
00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:17.030
and define them up here.

390
00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:31.120
So one T and three and some text few as well.

391
00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:38.330
So we'll copy that definition.

392
00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:39.970
We don't want to define it down there.

393
00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:43.520
Instead we want to define it up here.

394
00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:51.450
OK with just checking that's our code still works.

395
00:36:51.450 --> 00:36:54.000
So we're generating a random number that I need within.

396
00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.720
How that here so that's fine.

397
00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:59.880
That's going to update the question.

398
00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:03.030
We randomly generate the location of the correct answer.

399
00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:06.850
Then we generate the incorrect answers then we display those on the buttons.

400
00:37:07.050 --> 00:37:08.100
That looks promising.

401
00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:13.370
So we're going to want to generate a new question

402
00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:22.050
soon as the user has answered the previous question.

403
00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:29.620
All right so now if we've done everything correctly we should find that we have a string of questions

404
00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:37.770
being asked and indeed that they the app keeps track of the score as well as we go along.

405
00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:40.860
So 11:12 23.

406
00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:42.000
So one out of 1.

407
00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:42.840
Correct.

408
00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:44.420
And a new question.

409
00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:45.490
Is it looking good.

410
00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:48.300
19 plus 14.

411
00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:53.020
Now the correct answer is 33 which is not here.

412
00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:57.100
Can you think what's causing that error in fact I'll give you a moment to think about it because it's

413
00:37:57.100 --> 00:37:59.610
quite a good one.

414
00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:06.680
The answer is our array list is getting added to every time we generate some new answers.

415
00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:10.590
So what we need today is

416
00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:20.450
remove the contents of our answers list each time we generate some new ones and we can do that using

417
00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:22.870
answers it clear

418
00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:28.780
every guy with any luck with that shit.

419
00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:37.740
Fix the problem and will genuinely generate nuances that we can access and add to our buttons.

420
00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:40.690
OK is there a plus there is zero.

421
00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:46.790
13 plus 2 is 15 7 plus 16 is 23.

422
00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:48.130
Excellent.

423
00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:49.800
Let's just get one wrong.

424
00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:52.120
This is good.

425
00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:52.570
Yep.

426
00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:54.770
Five plus eight is 13.

427
00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:55.240
Brilliant.

428
00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:58.120
And that score is doing a great job of keeping track.

429
00:38:58.370 --> 00:38:58.950
Brilliant.

430
00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:03.340
So our basic core system is now working we just need to add a few tweaks.

431
00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:06.780
Mostly we need to get this time of working.

432
00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:09.760
So let's do that over in on create

433
00:39:15.090 --> 00:39:17.170
we'll need a new count down timer

434
00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:27.170
and we want it to last for 30 seconds.

435
00:39:27.210 --> 00:39:33.360
So 30000 and we wanted to tick every seconds every thousand

436
00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:43.460
and I'm going to ask it to generate the methods for us

437
00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:53.020
lovely and we need a semi-colon there.

438
00:39:53.070 --> 00:39:57.150
And actually I just remembered that we need to make it very slightly longer.

439
00:39:57.450 --> 00:40:04.400
Otherwise we would have that weird effect that we saw in the egg time app so we actually have to do

440
00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:06.760
each time the time it takes down

441
00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:17.830
is the date the label over here the text the time a text field.

442
00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:19.770
So let's do that.

443
00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:30.440
I'm going say creates it up here so I text field time at

444
00:40:33.810 --> 00:40:34.440
textfield

445
00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:39.470
and then we'll find it here.

446
00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:51.370
Cast it to text we find VBI ID Card ID.

447
00:40:51.830 --> 00:40:52.730
Time at X-Fi

448
00:40:56.310 --> 00:40:56.750
we go.

449
00:40:56.780 --> 00:40:58.930
So we just need to set a time a text free

450
00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:11.490
and then we're going to take our seconds into finished.

451
00:41:11.490 --> 00:41:17.260
Divide that by a thousand and then convert that to a string.

452
00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:20.010
So we use string dots

453
00:41:24.850 --> 00:41:25.720
value of

454
00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:34.100
every game and then just to check here.

455
00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:45.080
I'm going to put the final results that the user got in the same place as

456
00:41:50.050 --> 00:41:51.790
the results are in results.

457
00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:53.040
Textfield.

458
00:41:53.770 --> 00:41:58.540
So let's just update that is the result.

459
00:41:58.610 --> 00:42:00.710
Text feed or set text

460
00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:11.840
find out just put down and say that we don't have to watch it every time let's change it to three seconds

461
00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:15.860
and then we just need to tell that to start

462
00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:31.270
and actually don't want to forget to add the ass off to the valley.

463
00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:33.600
So I know that there's so many seconds remaining

464
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:38.720
I can take a look.

465
00:42:42.010 --> 00:42:44.380
Here we get two seconds.

466
00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:56.570
Excellent IPs all that.

467
00:42:56.620 --> 00:43:01.590
Once again I think we do need to update the time on finish

468
00:43:04.350 --> 00:43:05.010
time text.

469
00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:06.350
We set text

470
00:43:08.930 --> 00:43:15.660
to zero seconds on finish and then we'll

471
00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:21.230
change the text to your school.

472
00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:23.830
And this is really just going to mirror what it already says.

473
00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:29.060
In the top right any way.

474
00:43:29.090 --> 00:43:33.660
So let's just copy that.

475
00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:47.010
And pop that you could if you wanted add a little well-done or could do better.

476
00:43:47.130 --> 00:43:50.170
If you want to decide what makes a good school and what doesn't.

477
00:43:50.310 --> 00:43:55.940
But I'll leave that to you to add the final bits.

478
00:43:56.780 --> 00:44:01.870
In this part at least for me is going to be to add a play again button.

479
00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:06.420
So that just underneath

480
00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:11.830
my result text V.

481
00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:21.440
So the text will be played again.

482
00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:23.650
Ideally we play again

483
00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:30.350
button.

484
00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:33.010
And then the only thing I'm going to edit here is the on click

485
00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:42.410
call that plug in.

486
00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:46.420
So let's write the code for that

487
00:44:54.190 --> 00:44:58.430
as usual public void play again.

488
00:44:58.450 --> 00:45:01.290
It's going to be called by a view.

489
00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:03.410
So what do we need to do.

490
00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:06.300
We need to set the school back to zero.

491
00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:11.530
We need to set the number of questions back to zero.

492
00:45:14.650 --> 00:45:18.880
We need to update the timeout

493
00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:25.910
say.

494
00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:27.440
In fact what I think the

495
00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:32.200
is just cool.

496
00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:44.880
They play again method when the app starts and then put the timer in that and then we just want to reset

497
00:45:45.450 --> 00:45:51.300
the text of the time a text view.

498
00:45:58.180 --> 00:46:00.800
Set text to 30 seconds

499
00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:04.900
and we want to say it's

500
00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:12.890
the text of the points text we

501
00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:17.520
zero out of zero.

502
00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:27.180
And we want to set the result text the text to nothing.

503
00:46:30.350 --> 00:46:34.640
We also want to hide the play again button because we don't want that to be that while they're actually

504
00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:36.500
playing.

505
00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:36.860
So

506
00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:46.810
let's keep that in say button play again button.

507
00:46:51.810 --> 00:46:52.770
And then down here

508
00:46:56.730 --> 00:46:59.460
we'll add our play again button.

509
00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:11.460
Find Wii by id and then Adon Heidi don't play again.

510
00:47:11.850 --> 00:47:15.040
Button.

511
00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:23.760
So we want that to show you when the timer has finished.

512
00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:24.540
So here

513
00:47:28.570 --> 00:47:34.870
I play again button set visibility.

514
00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:48.700
If you don't visible and then we want to hide it when we started to play again I Plag up and button

515
00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:56.500
set visibility view Dorte invisible.

516
00:47:56.840 --> 00:48:04.670
And finally we want initial visibility to be invisible because we don't want the plug in button to appear

517
00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:08.480
at the beginning of the game.

518
00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:09.160
Right.

519
00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:12.880
I think we've done everything that we may well have forgotten one or two things but let's take a look

520
00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:17.870
and see how it displays.

521
00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:25.860
I have found that we don't necessarily see all of the values of this time as my machine is chugging

522
00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:27.470
a little bit here.

523
00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:31.110
I think I may have missed can see here.

524
00:48:33.350 --> 00:48:34.880
I haven't got any arguments.

525
00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:37.210
I should have some arguments.

526
00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:40.320
Not a problem.

527
00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:42.050
That's quite an interesting area actually.

528
00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:49.580
It's not that I forgot to view in my method definition it's that down here

529
00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:57.310
we're calling play again and we need to send a V.

530
00:48:57.930 --> 00:48:59.810
So here it really doesn't matter what the view is.

531
00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:01.800
But it just needs a view.

532
00:49:02.010 --> 00:49:04.040
So what will day is we'll send

533
00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:08.960
the play again button the

534
00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:16.270
given that that's what launches it later on anyway it seems to make sense.

535
00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:18.780
But really any view will do here.

536
00:49:23.980 --> 00:49:24.650
Here we go then.

537
00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:26.880
So got no button there that's good.

538
00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:28.120
OK your score zero.

539
00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:30.600
Fantastic plug in.

540
00:49:31.330 --> 00:49:33.550
So it's getting back to zero again.

541
00:49:34.370 --> 00:49:42.060
This is looking good but one thing it's not doing is generating a new question.

542
00:49:42.090 --> 00:49:43.070
That's a shame.

543
00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:45.640
OK but not a problem.

544
00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:52.480
They're easy to fix We just need to add that to our play again.

545
00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:56.680
Method here.

546
00:49:57.900 --> 00:50:04.890
So generate question and in fact that means that we can get rid of it from our own create method

547
00:50:08.050 --> 00:50:12.770
because it's already going to be called when we call the play again method here.

548
00:50:18.210 --> 00:50:18.630
OK.

549
00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:20.050
I feel we're pretty close now.

550
00:50:22.450 --> 00:50:31.170
Our last step of course will be setting up the go button so score zero.

551
00:50:31.210 --> 00:50:32.650
That's fine.

552
00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:33.360
Excellent.

553
00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:39.930
Now we've got a new question if I can answer in time and we do get one out of one fantastics our basic

554
00:50:39.930 --> 00:50:42.490
brain drain is now completely up and running.

555
00:50:42.510 --> 00:50:48.480
We just need to set it up so that that initial go button is displayed correctly.

556
00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:56.130
Now what I'm going to do here rather than manually hide and show all of these elements I'm going to

557
00:50:56.130 --> 00:51:07.590
create a second relative lay out which I'm going to drag into the existing relative lay out there and

558
00:51:07.590 --> 00:51:11.050
then everything except the start button.

559
00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:23.110
I'm going to select and then drag it into that new relative lay out and then that relative lay out is

560
00:51:23.110 --> 00:51:25.620
going to be invisible to start with.

561
00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:37.270
So everything is going to be invisible and the stop button is now going to be visible.

562
00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:43.920
There we go.

563
00:51:43.930 --> 00:51:47.250
And then when the stop button is pressed

564
00:51:50.350 --> 00:51:54.510
it sets its own visibility to invisible.

565
00:51:54.550 --> 00:51:59.080
We then need an ID to refer to this new relative layout

566
00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:06.220
or call it game relative lay out

567
00:52:12.490 --> 00:52:16.540
and then let's just add that in.

568
00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:21.430
So it's a relative lay out called Game

569
00:52:25.110 --> 00:52:26.160
relative layout.

570
00:52:29.770 --> 00:52:31.260
We'll find it down here.

571
00:52:36.450 --> 00:52:40.970
Relative lay out fine be for you by id

572
00:52:44.010 --> 00:52:58.870
high speed game relative layouts and then we can make that visible by setting the visibility to two

573
00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:04.150
relative lay out dot feasible.

574
00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:07.180
There we go.

575
00:53:07.590 --> 00:53:10.970
And it actually doesn't matter whether we leave the play again.

576
00:53:12.190 --> 00:53:15.420
Method call in on create.

577
00:53:15.730 --> 00:53:22.610
But I think it makes a little bit more sense logically at least to call it when the start button.

578
00:53:22.780 --> 00:53:27.220
And in fact yes we will need that because the timer we want to start as soon as the start button is

579
00:53:27.220 --> 00:53:31.550
pressed and not before OK.

580
00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:33.430
I'm feeling fairly confident about this.

581
00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:38.090
I'm going to update the timer to get back to 30 seconds.

582
00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:46.260
To start with and then let's take a look.

583
00:53:46.290 --> 00:53:54.120
So just to recap their wallets compiling I've used a relative lay out there more as a logical collection

584
00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:59.500
of objects rather than an actual way of laying them out as such.

585
00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:05.860
And that's a perfectly valid use of a layout or grouping if you want to do it that way.

586
00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:15.790
So here we go time is looking good 19 plus three 22 correct is in the wrong place right.

587
00:54:16.170 --> 00:54:18.340
So we've lost something there.

588
00:54:19.170 --> 00:54:24.150
Let's just jump back quickly.

589
00:54:24.330 --> 00:54:26.340
So yeah we do have a problem with our results.

590
00:54:26.350 --> 00:54:27.030
Textfield

591
00:54:30.450 --> 00:54:36.050
Let's just quickly make all of that visible again be a little bit easier.

592
00:54:39.330 --> 00:54:46.050
I think what's happened is I set the layout for result textfield to depend on go button which was a

593
00:54:46.050 --> 00:54:50.300
bad idea anyway but it completely broke when I took the go button.

594
00:54:50.310 --> 00:54:57.670
Out of that relative out so it's probably easiest to fix this using the text

595
00:55:02.370 --> 00:55:03.750
say where is how

596
00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:11.100
result.

597
00:55:11.250 --> 00:55:11.850
Text Phew.

598
00:55:11.850 --> 00:55:12.560
There it is.

599
00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:14.840
Yep you can see.

600
00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:19.370
So it's currently below the start button which is not what we want.

601
00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:26.220
We wanted to be like the grid layout which I don't think actually has an ID

602
00:55:30.890 --> 00:55:34.040
so let's just set an ID to the grid layout

603
00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:45.260
and that's just can be

604
00:55:52.590 --> 00:55:53.200
gridlock.

605
00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:54.440
We'll be fine then.

606
00:55:55.600 --> 00:56:11.050
And then let's set this to be for TS PayPal I a great lay out might make it a little bit too low down.

607
00:56:11.090 --> 00:56:13.390
Hard to tell because it doesn't currently have any text

608
00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:18.330
Let's check it out.

609
00:56:25.620 --> 00:56:29.250
It's not hugely significant one way or the other but it should appear down there.

610
00:56:29.310 --> 00:56:36.010
I suspect we may need to change the layout slightly that we'll see

611
00:56:40.830 --> 00:56:42.700
oh yes of course we need to make that invisible.

612
00:56:42.710 --> 00:56:47.670
But let's just use this to check the location of the result label.

613
00:56:47.730 --> 00:56:52.750
Yeah I think I'd like to give that a bit of a top margin to move it slightly further down.

614
00:56:52.800 --> 00:57:01.570
And while we're doing that we can make relatively invisible as well so let's just change results next

615
00:57:01.570 --> 00:57:04.570
few to have a margin at the top.

616
00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:13.610
Try 15 t Petey's and it's looking a little higher up actually.

617
00:57:16.430 --> 00:57:17.060
25

618
00:57:19.870 --> 00:57:20.850
try that out.

619
00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:25.990
And then just set the game relative layouts to invisible

620
00:57:28.930 --> 00:57:30.680
and with any luck for the final time.

621
00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:31.700
Well give it a run

622
00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:35.950
okay.

623
00:57:36.590 --> 00:57:38.840
Tango 6 plus 1 is 7.

624
00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:40.250
That looks much better.

625
00:57:40.450 --> 00:57:59.840
Serapis 20 is 20 1970 and 16 who 25 hottest Q1 on purpose obviously 14 plus 1731 6 plus 16 22 18 22

626
00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:08.460
12 plus 3 or 15 12 percent 20 every game.

627
00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:10.320
Your score 12 out of 13.

628
00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:12.700
Fantastic So that's all working great.

629
00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:14.120
And then play again.

630
00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:19.830
Resets everything back to zero again and 14 plus to 16.

631
00:58:19.820 --> 00:58:22.110
It's such beryllium.

632
00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:24.700
So we now have are completely working brain Traina.

633
00:58:24.770 --> 00:58:29.450
I hope you did manage to do a fair bit of that yourself but there was quite a lot of complex code in

634
00:58:29.450 --> 00:58:37.520
here and you can see we've actually written quite a lot of code all in all which hopefully starts to

635
00:58:38.600 --> 00:58:43.100
convince you of the importance of keeping your code very well organized keeping your variable names

636
00:58:43.100 --> 00:58:50.240
very clear et cetera et cetera because trying to maintain something like this is not simple.

637
00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:55.350
If you particularly enjoy that one there's very easy ways to take it further.

638
00:58:55.790 --> 00:59:01.580
You could make it so that instead of just addition signs we have subtraction as well multiplication

639
00:59:01.580 --> 00:59:02.270
division.

640
00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:08.030
So they could be randomly put in there or the user could have the option to choose addition or subtraction

641
00:59:08.060 --> 00:59:13.100
or multiplication or division has their sums for that day.

642
00:59:13.370 --> 00:59:19.220
You could have a high school which is updated each time the user obviously outperforms themselves and

643
00:59:19.220 --> 00:59:23.710
you could of course make it look even more beautiful and colorful than it does already.

644
00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:28.730
That wouldn't be too difficult a challenge but I hope you've enjoyed making what was probably our biggest

645
00:59:28.730 --> 00:59:30.840
and most complex app so far.

646
00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:36.170
We're now going to move away from time as a last and we're going to start looking at how we can download

647
00:59:36.170 --> 00:59:39.680
web content and use that directly in our apps.
