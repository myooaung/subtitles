00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.250
OK I'd like to discuss expert press release.

2
00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:13.040
And perfect timing strategy always create a press release for everyone of your app launches.

3
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:13.660
Why.

4
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:21.580
Because it does help with SEO at the very least you can use p or blog or P or.

5
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:28.710
You need to learn how to write a press release correctly or it will be tossed in the garbage unfortunately.

6
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.970
I hire a professional to do this for me.

7
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:39.110
Just check out the final notes in my bonus section at the end of this course for a link and it's very

8
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.580
inexpensive too.

9
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.930
There are others there that can submit your press release and save you hundreds of dollars as well.

10
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.750
Peter Webb is currently ranked number one news release service.

11
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.420
Both are very good.

12
00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:02.330
If you don't have thousands of dollars to burn per month then I would highly suggest that you stay away

13
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:08.990
from PR agencies or firms because they can throw your money really fast here.

14
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.700
Now when's the perfect time for a press release you ask.

15
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.770
Well there's no magic number.

16
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.920
The popular advice was to always avoid the weekends Mondays and Fridays.

17
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:31.130
Other experts always say a slow news day when there's not much happening and the journalists are scratching

18
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:37.200
their heads for newsworthy stories is a good day to send your release out.

19
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:44.300
All experts agree that the worst time to send out your press release is when the whole world is glued

20
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.880
to a huge breaking news story.

21
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.810
Therefore don't even think about competing with a celebrity story.

22
00:01:52.040 --> 00:02:00.230
A terrorist attack or a school shooting data suggests that the busiest day for press releases is on

23
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.610
a Tuesday.

24
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:09.980
That's when the top press release services receive their highest numbers the second busiest day tends

25
00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:12.590
to fall on a Monday.

26
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.530
Fridays are the least busy week day and almost nothing happens on the weekends.

27
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:25.910
Almost everyone sends their press releases between 8:00 and 9:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.

28
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.030
53 percent said Tuesday was the best day.

29
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.170
And 63 percent reported Tuesday morning was the best time.

30
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.290
Always avoid the weekends period.

31
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:48.140
Experts say try sending in your press release on a Wednesday or Thursday morning or perhaps even after

32
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:56.220
hours on Monday would suffice here because editors and journalists are always connected.

33
00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:03.600
The timing of your press release is becoming less and less important than it was in the past.

34
00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:12.220
The media can now assess your e-mails and social networking accounts 24/7 today.

35
00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.680
OK I'll see you in the next lecture.
