00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:06.230
Congratulations on making it to the final video in Section 2 that the complete Android nugget developed.

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.600
Course you've learned a huge amount already.

3
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.700
You've learned how Android studio works with our main activity and activity main.

4
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:25.230
Working together to create our apps with added images text views buttons and text fields to our apps

5
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.530
and we've written some reasonably complicated code to do things like updating images and displaying

6
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.130
information to the user when a button is clicked.

7
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.010
Now it's time to put all of that knowledge together and build our final app of the section currency

8
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.790
converter.

9
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.660
And this is what it looks like.

10
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.410
So it's pretty simple.

11
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.460
We've got a nice image at the bottom there.

12
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:58.260
And then the user can put in an amount in my case in dollars and click convert and it displays the amount

13
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.140
in pounds as a toast.

14
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.700
You can use any two currencies you like doesn't need to be dollars and pounds that is going to be one

15
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.550
complication that you'll come across obviously to convert from dollars to pounds.

16
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.940
You'll need to multiply by a certain number whatever the conversion factor is but you'll find that you

17
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:23.690
can't multiply a stream by a number so you'll need to take this whatever the user has inputted and convert

18
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.580
it to what's known as a double which is essentially a decimal number.

19
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.350
So I'm going to leave that to you to see if you can figure out a quick bit of googling to get the answer.

20
00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.070
If not of course just watch the video and I'll take you through how it's done.

21
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.630
Well we're looking at variable types and a lot more detail in the next section but do see if you can

22
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.400
work out how to do a simple conversion here by yourself.

23
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.440
So that's it.

24
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.110
Best of luck because well

25
00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.410
all right I hope that one well and you managed to do at least most of it yourself.

26
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.140
I'm going to start Of course by creating a new Android studio project

27
00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:17.570
call it currency converter and we'll use all the usual settings

28
00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:23.710
while that's being generated.

29
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:37.660
All jump over to my browser and go back to Google images to find a nice image to go with my app.

30
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.450
So I'll search for

31
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.580
currency

32
00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.820
and all that.

33
00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.830
Look at that first one.

34
00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.150
So once again if you're just trying this out for yourself perfectly fine to use these images.

35
00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.870
But if you're going to be releasing an app you need to make sure that you have the rights to the image

36
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:08.790
or control click and save image as and save it right there on the desktop.

37
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.990
It's 2000 by 1000 which is a little larger than I need.

38
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:23.380
So I'm just going to adjust the size OK for one thousand and buy 500.

39
00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:29.400
Generally you should be aware of the resolution of the devices that you're supporting and then choose

40
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:36.480
a suitable image resolution so that it will look good but not take up too much memory.

41
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.740
OK here we go.

42
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:43.450
Here we are.

43
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.390
So let's add our image in to our drawable folder

44
00:03:52.170 --> 00:04:00.790
so command C or Control-C on Windows and then over to drawable and command or control the on Windows

45
00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.330
that we got.

46
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:04.600
All right.

47
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.500
I'm going to set up the layout first of

48
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:19.010
so I'll start by getting rid of that label that I don't need and then bringing in an image of the

49
00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:33.950
then we'll set the saw see where the source for the image be to be our currency or peg should be down

50
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.840
in the bull's list.

51
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.450
I think I missed it.

52
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.090
There it is.

53
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.470
That's great.

54
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.820
And I'll actually leave it as that lay out and

55
00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:07.130
I'll take a textfield and this can be a number which we haven't used before.

56
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.700
We need a number for

57
00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.550
our amount.

58
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.210
So I'll use the hint

59
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.110
and the amount in dollars to tell the user what to do.

60
00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:43.660
And then I'll call this dollar amount at it.

61
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.070
Text

62
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:47.500
excellent.

63
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:55.380
And then the only other that we need is a button so drag this to the center and then just underneath

64
00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:56.220
the edit text

65
00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.270
and I'll change that to convert

66
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:12.690
and then find the on click.

67
00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:14.420
There it is.

68
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:19.140
And I'll just call it converts great.

69
00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.870
I just set that C run in the background.

70
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.140
And then while it's running we'll go over and write our code.

71
00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.390
In main activity Java

72
00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:44.540
OK so again this should be second nature to you by now we're a public method which doesn't return anything.

73
00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.200
It's called convert

74
00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:58.720
and or create a view called a view to represent the button that we'll call the convert method.

75
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:05.410
So as before I'll just do a quick test to make sure everything's connected up right.

76
00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:06.560
I'll start by

77
00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.950
getting the amount at it.

78
00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:30.950
I call it dollar amount added text and then you find VBIED resources dot ID dot dollar amount and it

79
00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:37.730
text and we'll convert that to an added text

80
00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:45.650
and then for now I'll just log

81
00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:58.660
mounts and then deliver it text you get text start to string

82
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:02.460
OK.

83
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:10.120
C looks like we did get the app running so we'll just wait for that C to run with the new code.

84
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:19.250
And we should find that whatever we enter in the text field will be saved in the logs.

85
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:24.770
So you can see we've got our number keyboard which is great.

86
00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:26.160
Let's have a quick look.

87
00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:28.770
And 2009 is right there in the

88
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:32.650
prelim.

89
00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:41.900
So we've got our amount as I mentioned we're going to need to convert our string here to 8 double.

90
00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:47.720
So a number type essentially.

91
00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:51.790
So let's see if we can figure out how to do that.

92
00:08:52.930 --> 00:09:03.480
Android let's say for convert string to double.

93
00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:06.340
Here we go converting strings to double and Android stack.

94
00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:07.890
I fly once again.

95
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:14.040
Let's have a look we don't need to read the whole question

96
00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.800
OK this seems to do the trick.

97
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.110
Pass double

98
00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:23.470
OK.

99
00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:25.660
That looks like that's the command that we need.

100
00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:33.370
Let's jump back over to Andrew's studio and see if we can figure out how to do it.

101
00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:42.520
So we're going to need to create a variable type of double and hopefully we've got the idea now to create

102
00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:46.650
a double We use double with a capital D.

103
00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:55.940
So this is going to be the dollar amount as a double and we're going to get this

104
00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:01.330
using the pass double

105
00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:07.730
method.

106
00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:14.950
So if we use Double Dot pass double and then we're going to put a string into that and the string is

107
00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:19.270
going to be dollar amount at it text or get text

108
00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:26.050
dot to string

109
00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:36.810
then we're going to convert that to pounds.

110
00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:42.110
So I'll just call this pound amount.

111
00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.770
Let's check out what the conversion is

112
00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:54.920
say at the time of recording it is no point 7 5

113
00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:06.720
so we're going to take our dollar amount double and multiply that by nought point seven five

114
00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:12.310
OK.

115
00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:14.480
And then we want to display that.

116
00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:16.480
So let's just play it as a test

117
00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:21.130
so we'll create a new test

118
00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:30.400
and then we're going to take our pound amount and we're going to need to convert that back to a string

119
00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:31.730
which we know how to do.

120
00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:38.930
It's just got to string.

121
00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:47.630
And just to make it a little nicer I think I'll put a little pound sign at the beginning.

122
00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:48.270
All right.

123
00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:49.230
I should do it.

124
00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.140
Let's have a look.

125
00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:55.140
So we've taken our dollar amount as a text.

126
00:11:55.140 --> 00:12:01.080
We've got the value and then we've passed that or converted it to a double which is essentially a number

127
00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:03.350
and then we've taken that number.

128
00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:09.030
Multiply that by no point seventy five in a new variable could pound the amount and then we've created

129
00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:14.190
a toast using pound amount to string and a pound sign has

130
00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:20.500
the content of our toast.

131
00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:21.070
So let's have a look.

132
00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:24.650
Well start with 239 converts.

133
00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:28.340
That looks just about right.

134
00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.370
Fantastic.

135
00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:37.990
So forget $90 £67 50 $10 £7.

136
00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:39.700
50.

137
00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.190
Now some of you might be thinking seven point five.

138
00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.820
Been nice if that was two decimal places.

139
00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:51.770
Let's see if we can figure out how to do that.

140
00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:53.570
Maybe Android.

141
00:12:53.570 --> 00:13:01.930
I'm going to put Java in this time because just two decimal places on its own might not be enough.

142
00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:03.920
With Android.

143
00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:04.870
So there we go.

144
00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:10.100
Looks like we've got a good result.

145
00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:11.810
So we can use string.

146
00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:12.920
Format

147
00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:18.950
OK.

148
00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:22.430
So it looks like we'll use that here.

149
00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:30.740
So string doc format and then the string we want to or the amount that we want to convert is pound amount

150
00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:37.840
and that percent decimal point to f rounds to two decimal places.

151
00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:39.850
So let's have a quick look

152
00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:45.770
and see if that does what we wanted.

153
00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:50.280
OK here we go.

154
00:13:50.510 --> 00:14:07.620
So I convert.

155
00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:10.840
So here we go up 10 back in.

156
00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:14.510
Convert very nicely to 7 pounds 50.

157
00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:17.530
Let's just try one more 360.

158
00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:20.610
Yep that looks perfect.

159
00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:21.900
Excellent.

160
00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:27.710
So well done you've made it to the end of section 2 of The Complete Android and develop of course.

161
00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:32.720
I hope you've enjoyed yourself and you've managed to make a few real apps already in the next section.

162
00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:36.440
We'll be going on to looking at Java in a lot more details.

163
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:41.690
So far we've just been crabbing together really bits of Java without knowing the whole picture.

164
00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:46.820
So in the next section where we starting looking at Java from scratch and seeing how all these variable

165
00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:52.920
types methods classes and a lot more all fit together we're doing that in the next section.

166
00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:54.780
I'll see you there.

167
00:14:55.010 --> 00:15:01.180
Congratulations on making it to the final video in section 2 of the complete Android and developer of

168
00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:01.820
course.
