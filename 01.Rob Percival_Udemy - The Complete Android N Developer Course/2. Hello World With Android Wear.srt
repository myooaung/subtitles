1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,820
Android where is Google's smartwatch platform.

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:06,700
Well it's still pretty early days for smartwatches.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,750
It's a market that's bound to go quickly.

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,770
And if it's anything like the smartphone market Android is pretty likely to take it over.

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:20,220
So in this section we're going to be looking at Android Web 2.0 which is planned for release in the

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,680
autumn of 2016.

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,120
You don't need any special software to develop for Android where you can just do it all with an android

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:33,660
studio and I'm going to show you how in this video we'll look at how great a basic Hello World app for

9
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,950
Android where and run it on the simulator.

10
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:47,090
So within our studio we get to file new projects and then as you've probably noticed we have the option

11
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:54,090
to create an android where project I'll call this Android where demo

12
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,060
and we've always used the phone and tablet option so far.

13
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:09,570
But this time we're going to switch to Android where as usual you can choose the various different options.

14
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,040
I'm going to go for five point.

15
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:17,190
OK so MS compatibility but as always if you want to use any of the particular API that come with six

16
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:23,040
point seven Boito then you need to choose die's OK.

17
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,900
Now as with our Android apps we can choose the default activity.

18
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,550
So you've got an always on where activity.

19
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:36,180
A blank one a notification Google Maps and a watch face.

20
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:43,070
So we're going to be going for blank where activity for the moment and then next we'll leave those as

21
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,310
the default options.

22
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:53,220
And finish while that setting up we will need an Android Wear device to test this on.

23
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:58,740
So let's create one in the tools Android DVD manager.

24
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:03,640
Remember we did this right back at the beginning of the course and DVD is an android virtual device

25
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:07,150
and we need to create a watch device.

26
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:14,110
To test out our apps on so we create this in just the same way that we did before.

27
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:19,700
But of course we're going to choose a web device this time and it doesn't matter too much which ones

28
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:24,790
you choose but I'd recommend having a square and a round one available.

29
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:32,020
So I'm going to go for that top square device and then click next.

30
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,580
And again you can choose any version you want.

31
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:38,950
I'll just go for the one that I've already got.

32
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,220
That is lollipop.

33
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:46,450
And as always you can customize the device IFAB it if you like as well.

34
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm just going to leave that as it is and click Finish.

35
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,650
And there we go.

36
00:02:55,390 --> 00:03:08,360
Let's quickly do another one to create a round device so I use that bottom one then the next next and

37
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,240
finish.

38
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:21,300
So we now have two Android Wear devices and heads out Android Wear Dema app.

39
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:23,240
I'll just run it in the background.

40
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:32,090
So we'll start with round and well that's lady let's have a quick look at the files that we're used

41
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,620
to seeing.

42
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,270
So we've got our Android manifest

43
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,950
which looks pretty similar to what we're used to seeing.

44
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:46,270
We've got this new feature of Android how it's like.

45
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:51,820
Watch of course but the rest is fairly familiar in the Java section.

46
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:56,670
We've got code that again is pretty similar to what we're used to.

47
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:02,180
We've got our main activity which is sending activity and we've got a specific text view here which

48
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,140
is part of our default lay out.

49
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,060
And then we've got our own create method.

50
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:14,930
We do have a new variable type of watch view stub which will go into and see exactly what's going on

51
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,930
there in the next video.

52
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:23,070
For now that notice that we've got three different lÃº files this time.

53
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:28,990
So we've got the primary lay out which you can see them unfortunately in the preview it doesn't show

54
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:32,190
you it in a watch which is a bit of a shame.

55
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:38,830
But the main thing really is to notice that we've got two different activities or two different layouts

56
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:42,790
at least for rectangular and round.

57
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:49,450
And in our case in this demo app and the round activity we've got a text with a halo round world in

58
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:58,090
the middle and then in the rectangular you can see we've got hollow square world which is at the top

59
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,300
left.

60
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:04,040
So you can have different layouts very easily for round and square watch faces.

61
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,050
OK let's take a look.

62
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:16,510
A TV guy you can see the Android Wear emulator is coming to life.

63
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:23,330
You might notice though that I do have an issue down here saying that there's not enough memory to run

64
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:25,720
that particular CD.

65
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,800
So that's worth being aware of when we go to the manager.

66
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:45,420
We might need to edit DVDs and give them more memory so to do that we show advance settings.

67
00:05:49,530 --> 00:06:00,840
And then we can choose the amount of RAM here let's go for a pretty big 2 4 8 2 gigabytes of RAM should

68
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,320
be enough

69
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,920
and then click Finish.

70
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:12,450
And then the same thing with the square device.

71
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:22,580
So advanced settings and then the same thing with the round device say edit show advance settings and

72
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,330
will change the RAM to 2.

73
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,310
I for I

74
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,840
had finished now let's run again.

75
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:42,730
On the round device and there we go you can see the halo round a world text in the center of the screen

76
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:43,150
there.

77
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:52,170
And then we can also run the app on the square emulator or Android where Square and then if we move

78
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:59,830
over to see that emulator you can see it's currently running Android Wear itself

79
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,950
and then in a moment how app will pop up

80
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,300
and there it is how a square world.

81
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:16,160
The top left of the screen this time.

82
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:19,330
So that's the basic idea of how we run Android apps.

83
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:24,970
We have our main activity before and then we've got our rectangular and round activity layouts in the

84
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,430
next video.

85
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:31,420
Then we're going to dive a little deeper into how the watch stub system works and how we can build an

86
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:35,700
app that's customized for each shape of device.

87
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:36,410
I see that.
