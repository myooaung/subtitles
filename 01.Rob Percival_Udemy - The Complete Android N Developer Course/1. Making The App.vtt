There are two types of people to be considered here.

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:11.050
One that develops their own app thereby saving themselves tens of thousands of dollars.

3
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:18.870
And the other group that has to hire a person or app development company to design and produce their

4
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:19.590
app.

5
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:30.040
My friend spent over $70000 and that was with one major update to his entertainment game app.

6
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.540
He had to pay a mobile app development.

7
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.170
All that money and he lost 60 to 65 thousand on this investment.

8
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:48.090
For those who don't know how to code and are relying on your app developer My point here is if your

9
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:57.120
app gets seen you're going to have to continue its popularity by adding more and more updates and or

10
00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.320
fixes to keep the customers coming back.

11
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:09.630
Major updates can keep costing you several thousand dollars each time depending on how many hours are

12
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.900
needed for that particular update.

13
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.960
Before you know it your app will cost a lot of money possibly six figures.

14
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.710
Trust me I've seen this happen time and time again.

15
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.730
Some key abbreviations you should be familiar with are you.

16
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.480
That's user interface.

17
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.310
The goal of the user interface design is to make the users interaction as simple and efficient as possible

18
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.890
in terms of accomplishing user goals.

19
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:57.060
U.S. stands for a user experience design user experience design is the process of enhancing user satisfaction

20
00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:08.010
by improving the usability sensibility and pleasure provided in the interaction between the user and

21
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:09.830
the product.

22
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:21.450
And lastly you a user acquisition is the set of methodologies and systems to manage customer prospects

23
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.350
and inquiries generated by a variety of marketing techniques.

24
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.490
OK I'll see you in the next lecture.
