1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:07,740
We're now moving on from images and animations to look at video and audio both of which are managed

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,410
in a very similar way in Android.

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:16,060
And believe it or not we can actually add a video to our app in just two lines of code.

4
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,920
So let's find out how we do it.

5
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:24,280
So we'll click our usual new project

6
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,620
call it video demo

7
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,810
and the usual evil options.

8
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:39,580
Now obviously to embed a video into your app you need a video to start with.

9
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:46,720
So in the next lecture there's a link to download just a demo video but you can use any MP for file.

10
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:52,580
Android usually will be able to play it but if it can't then just use the one linked in the next lecture.

11
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:59,340
So let's jump over to a video demo.

12
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:08,240
So we need to put our video in a place where Android can access it and the usual place is in the red

13
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,400
folder.

14
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:15,420
So what I'm going to do is control click or right click on the red folder and then reveal in Finder

15
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,020
that will probably be Windows Explorer.

16
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:26,380
If you're on Windows and then within the red folder you've got a bunch of those default folders we need

17
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,990
to create a new one so create a new folder.

18
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:39,060
In the usual way on Windows you can do it right clicking in Windows Explorer and then roll.

19
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,230
So this is for raw data like video.

20
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:49,930
So I'm just going to open up the desktop in the new tabs and this is where I've downloaded that video

21
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,990
from.

22
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:54,190
You can as I say use any video but this one should work.

23
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,440
And then we're going to get into the red folder.

24
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:09,160
Into the raw subfolder and then just drag that file in.

25
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:16,470
So there it is and then we can see the world folder up here it should update pretty quickly.

26
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,740
And within that we should now have our video.

27
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,580
There it is.

28
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:28,330
If for any reason it doesn't update you should be able to synchronize to force it to update.

29
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,920
So now we got our video.

30
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:39,860
It's just a matter of adding it to our apps let's get rid of our Hello world and then scroll down our

31
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:46,790
palette to get the video view well named.

32
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,470
So we just drag that in.

33
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:53,260
I'm going to go for a full screen video view.

34
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:53,730
There it is.

35
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,420
That's all you need.

36
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,090
Take a note of the ID.

37
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:05,950
So the DVR is video view with a capital V Second V and then what we need to do is assign them a video

38
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,930
to that video view and we'll do that in the uncreate method.

39
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:15,290
So our assignment will happen as soon as the app is run.

40
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,420
So the first line of code we just get the video view

41
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:35,050
so video view and I'll call it video of you and just our usual process of converting to a video view.

42
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,070
And we're going to find it by id resources.

43
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,810
Id DOT video if you

44
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:54,740
so now that we found our video of you we just assign the video to it and we do that using video view

45
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,230
to set video path makes sense.

46
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,690
Now this is not necessarily obvious because we have to get the correct path.

47
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:08,490
But as long as you get this right it'll be fine.

48
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:18,390
So we use Android dot resorts and then we use colon and double slash there.

49
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:24,020
So a bit like a web address but instead of WDW we've got android Daut resorts.

50
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:29,020
That's where we're getting our file from.

51
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,890
And then we use GET

52
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:41,000
package name to get the name of the package because that forms part of the path.

53
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,420
In my case I could just use video demo.

54
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,360
That's all the package name is.

55
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:51,210
But if you get package name then if for any reason you change the package later on then this will update

56
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:52,330
automatically.

57
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:57,840
And also if you've chosen a different name for your package then this will work regardless of what the

58
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,160
actual package name is.

59
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:08,870
And then we add a second slash or third slash sorry for our path.

60
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:20,810
And the final bit is the actual file that we want which is resources don't roar at my video

61
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,440
so slightly long path.

62
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:28,930
Hopefully that will kind of make sense as to where it might come from.

63
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:36,430
And then all we need is video if you start that's it

64
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,110
he said adding video to an app was complicated.

65
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:51,140
There are a few things missing I have to say from this so we've got video but we won't have any video

66
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:55,440
controls so this will just play the video and nothing else.

67
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:02,480
So when we just check that this is working will have some controls to it.

68
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:07,720
We should bear in mind as well that running video on the simulator is not great.

69
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,970
I've had quite a few crashes and especially if you don't have a lot of RAM on your PC you could find

70
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:19,380
that it crashes a lot and possibly doesn't even work.

71
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:25,030
So you can always run it on a real device if you want to test it out and you're having problems with

72
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,410
the emulator

73
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:44,350
Here we go video and there it is at the beginning of it.

74
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,860
And fantastic.

75
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,140
So that's playing the video doesn't look right.

76
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,940
But again it would look much better on a real device.

77
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,930
So now what we do is just add the controls

78
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:08,150
to our video and we do that using a media controller.

79
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:15,320
So first of all let's create a media control.

80
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,220
There it is.

81
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,760
We call it media control.

82
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:26,350
And it's going to be a new media controller.

83
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,150
And to define our controller we need what's called the session which is a combination of the context

84
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:36,460
and the session ID.

85
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,150
Don't worry too much about all of that.

86
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,020
We get it with the key word this.

87
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:47,660
So this will give us the session which we need to define our media controller.

88
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,550
Now you'll likely get an error but don't worry.

89
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:58,430
That's just because we have to import the media controller widgets

90
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:12,170
say widget and then media control the I've got an issue there because we've got two different media

91
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,400
control is imported.

92
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:19,520
I would definitely go for Android widget dot media controller.

93
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,320
That's definitely the one that works for me.

94
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:29,380
And then we just have to attach our new media controller to our video view.

95
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:39,370
And we do that using media control set anchor view and the view that we want to anchor our video control

96
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,970
to is video view.

97
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:45,780
So the video of you becomes the anchor of view for the media controller.

98
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,490
And then we set it up the other way round as well.

99
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:59,430
So we take video of you and we set the media controller to a media controller.

100
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:02,120
So we kind of sync things up both ways.

101
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:08,470
We set the view for the controller to the video view and we've set the controller for the view to be

102
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,780
heavy to the media controller.

103
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:20,180
And again that's all it is super simple so let's just run that and we should now find that not only

104
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:23,340
have we got the video but we've got our video controls as well.

105
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,540
And this will show us how far along in the video will allow us to scrub backwards and forwards as well

106
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:29,840
as

107
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,300
start stop pause et cetera.

108
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:39,400
Here we go.

109
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,310
Here's our video player.

110
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,050
You can see when I tap.

111
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:49,620
Now those are the controls that pop up.

112
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:54,760
So there's avideo and I tap and we've got the controls.

113
00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:00,550
They do disappear after a few seconds you tap again to bring them back up and we can pause.

114
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,410
We can go backwards and forwards.

115
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,510
Etc.

116
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:11,890
It's a really simple way to add a video to your app in just a few lines.

117
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:14,740
Now you can also add online video here.

118
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:21,690
So if you go to MP for file or something that's hosted on a server somewhere you can access that and

119
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:24,360
that will actually get streamed to your app.

120
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,360
Now there are lots of problems with that and the emulator however.

121
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:33,000
So I haven't actually been able to get that working on the emulator but it's just a matter of adding

122
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,060
the the full path that's CTP and then whatever the rest of the link is and then you'd need to run that

123
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,110
on a real device.

124
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:45,910
Now for video that's as far as we're going to go in the next video we're going to move on to look at

125
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:51,390
all idio which uses a very similar system but the audio we're going to spend a bit more time looking

126
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:57,860
at how we can customize the controls with volume and just have more control over the set up.

127
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,200
We'll do that in the next video.

128
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,290
I'll see you there.
