1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:07,260
Now that you've learned how to work with the shared preferences and also how to create menus and use

2
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:12,100
a lot dialogues we're going to put this all together and build a note taking app.

3
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,140
And here's how it works.

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:22,590
So when we started off we've got an example note that we can then tap on and end it using a full screen

5
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,910
edit text or leave it to you to figure out how to do that.

6
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,870
And then of course we can change this note to anything we like.

7
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:40,890
And then we can go back and see the changes that we can also add new notes using the menu.

8
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,590
So at night we'll add a blank note

9
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,090
and then we can go back and we can see both of those notes.

10
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:57,140
And indeed we can long press to get an alert as well.

11
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:04,680
And then if we tap Yes that's saved or this of course as well is covered by permanent storage using

12
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,940
shared preferences.

13
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:11,010
So you can shut down the app and you'll see actually the same set of notes when you open it up again.

14
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,210
So that's the challenge.

15
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:13,030
Best of luck.

16
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:15,270
Pause the video and off you go.

17
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:25,860
OK.

18
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:27,370
That one well as ever.

19
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:37,670
I'm going to start with a new project and we'll just call this notes next.

20
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:47,710
And we have the marshmallow SDK and an empty activity and our first activity then is going to be our

21
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:53,610
list view where we'll put our notes as the user saves them.

22
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,570
So let's start by adding that in.

23
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:04,890
We'll do that an activity main layout and then get rid of the text the

24
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,460
and drag in our list view.

25
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,330
If we get

26
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,250
and I'll give it an idea of list view.

27
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,160
All right.

28
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,510
So we need for now.

29
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:31,370
So back over to main activity and then in the create method just run it in the background that

30
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:43,030
things all set up will create a variable length or at least we could at least be

31
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:56,190
and we're going to cast this to a list view and we'll get it from find view by ID using resources IDs

32
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,740
dot V.

33
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:06,430
Now we're going to need as usual an array list linked to our list view.

34
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:12,490
I'm going to need to access it from all parts of the app so I'm going to define it up here.

35
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,320
It's going to be an array list of strings

36
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,830
and I'll call it notes.

37
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,560
And this is going to be a new array list.

38
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,170
OK.

39
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:40,350
And for now we'll just add two notes an initial note.

40
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,180
So I'll call it

41
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:49,670
Example night then we'll set up our array adapter

42
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,280
call it wrapped up

43
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,810
how this is going to be a new right adapter.

44
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:11,330
Using the main activity or this as the context and then Android

45
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:30,630
dot lay out that simple list item one as the format and then notes as the list array.

46
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,350
And then we'll take a list view and we'll set an adapter to it.

47
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:44,010
And that adapter will be array adapter.

48
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,260
This just ties in

49
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,500
and a very blessed

50
00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:01,710
and then I'll just do a quick run of that just to make sure that Billis view is displaying correctly.

51
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,880
And there we go.

52
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:03,680
Everything looks great.

53
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,570
Then of course typing on an item in the list view at the moment doesn't do anything.

54
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:13,150
We're going to want that to jump to a second activity where the user can edit their note.

55
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:16,920
So let's create a new activity

56
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,870
and we want an empty activity as usual

57
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:35,360
and I'll call this the note editor activity

58
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,950
and every game.

59
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:54,820
And here we're just going to have a single edit text but it's an edit text that we haven't used before.

60
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,930
I hope you spotted it.

61
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,420
It's the multi-line text.

62
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:05,770
So that's of course ideal for adding things like notes where we want to use it to be able to add a large

63
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:09,380
amount of multi-line text.

64
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:14,860
All right let's make this full screen as well.

65
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:23,610
And I'm also going to take it a little bit further and take the relative lay out and remove the padding

66
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:30,490
so you can see some default padding them.

67
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:35,790
I'm just going to set the padding for all top bottom left and right to be zero.

68
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:40,850
And that will make it full screen and just look like we're editing the whole screen which is a bit nicer.

69
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:42,700
OK.

70
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,600
So now back to main activity.

71
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:54,750
And we want to now add the feature when they use the taps on an item in the list we like that it jumps

72
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,720
to the note editor activity.

73
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,780
And we should be fairly comfortable with this by now.

74
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:11,680
So we're going to take this view and set an on item click listener and this is going to be a new Adap.tv

75
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,750
dot on right and click listener.

76
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:21,800
And then when an item is clicked on item click method will be called and we're going to want to jump

77
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,300
to the note editor activity.

78
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,030
So we'll create an intent

79
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,010
called intent

80
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:35,560
which is going to be a new intent

81
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:52,600
using the application context as the context and then note editor activity class as the location of

82
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,270
the intent.

83
00:07:55,020 --> 00:08:02,790
And of course we also want to let the new activity know which item was tapped.

84
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,170
So we're going to put an extra

85
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:16,610
I'll call it note I.D. and it's going to be high.

86
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:25,760
This variable here which tells us they wrote road number that was tapped and then we're going to start

87
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:32,540
activity and the activity we're going to start is the intent.

88
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:32,900
All right.

89
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:41,930
So just before we run and check that I'm going to jump over to our new activity and we're going to display

90
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:45,700
the text for the note that the user has selected.

91
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,150
So we will do that in the edit text.

92
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:52,450
So let's just give it an ID or sort of get an idea of added text.

93
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:57,860
I think that will define as is only going to be one added text in this app.

94
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:09,210
So let's create an edit text call that text is going to be an edit text and we'll get it from a find

95
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:20,750
view by ID card or ID at text then we need to get the note Id that was passed to this activity from

96
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,880
main activity.

97
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:31,670
So we'll do that by creating an intent which will be this time the content that was used to get to this

98
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,740
activity and then

99
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:48,950
we'll create an integer node ID which is going to be equal to the intent to get in extra.

100
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:56,440
And the name of the variable that we want to try and get the extra of is note ID.

101
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:02,340
And we want to be pretty careful here just in case we get an invalid note Id somehow passed.

102
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:09,810
So what I'm going to do is give that a default value of minus one which is impossible to get on the

103
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:13,860
main activity because the list view Id start at zero.

104
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:21,480
So then we'll do a check to see if Note ID is not minus 1

105
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:40,940
and if that's the case then we'll set the text of the text text to main activity dot notes and we'll

106
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:48,600
need to set that as a static variable type to allow that.

107
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,650
And then we want to get

108
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:57,530
the note ID.

109
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:58,490
All right.

110
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,650
So let's try that out.

111
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:06,780
So we've now created an edit text and we're getting the note Id value from the intent.

112
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:13,970
And if it's not minus 1 then we're getting the value of the notes text and displaying it in the edit

113
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,040
text.

114
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,080
So let's see this in action.

115
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,350
Here we go.

116
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:22,190
So here's an example note.

117
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,970
Tap on that.

118
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,440
And there we go.

119
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:28,690
So it worked almost exactly as intended.

120
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,990
We've got the content and we're ready to go to edit it.

121
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:37,810
But it is centered in the screen which is not exactly what we want.

122
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:48,250
So let's just go back and change that if you remember we change that with the prop..

123
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:53,520
Gravity which is currently center vertical.

124
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:58,470
So let's change it to top and left.

125
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:00,720
Right.

126
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:05,750
So now we've got our main screen up and running.

127
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:12,680
And we've got our note editor displaying our note the next step is to if the note as the user edits

128
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,590
it.

129
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:16,220
So as I mentioned this isn't something we've done before.

130
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:20,440
So let's see if we can figure out how to do it.

131
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,740
So we're working with an edit text here

132
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,160
and we want to run some code when the text is changed.

133
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,600
Something like that.

134
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:36,530
So let's see what we get here.

135
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:42,920
So point five seconds after text change that could be useful but it's not quite what we want.

136
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,470
Finished typing event.

137
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,760
Not exactly how to apply the text change event on edit text.

138
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,990
Probably that would give us a result.

139
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,470
But this one actually Android on text change.

140
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:58,800
Listener that sounds like the sort of thing that we want

141
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:08,170
and here we go look at a text changed listener and then we've got some methods there off the text change

142
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:10,570
before text change and on text changed.

143
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:12,500
I think that's ideal for us.

144
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:16,890
So add text change listener looks like what we want.

145
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,150
Let's see if we can add that in here.

146
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:31,930
So we'll take our edit text and add text changed listener let's just have a look.

147
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:34,350
So it looks like we need a new text Wotcha

148
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:40,770
every go so let's use that.

149
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:43,960
And it's giving us the methods that we need.

150
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:48,930
So before and after text change we're not that interested in what we need on text changed.

151
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:56,140
And I'd be willing to bet that this character sequence here is the content of the text which is what

152
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,110
we need.

153
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,990
So let's give that a try.

154
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:06,750
So we want to update the notes array list from the main activity.

155
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:17,690
So it will take main activity notes and will set and the integer the item in the array list that we

156
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:21,190
want to change is going to be node ID.

157
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,550
And the thing we want to change to this character sequence here

158
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:34,830
so that should do the trick but don't notice that character sequences of a type character sequence.

159
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,090
So we're going to need to convert that to a string.

160
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:46,570
So we use string dot value of to convert that character sequence to a string.

161
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:52,420
And then we just want to update the sphere itself via the Araya adapter.

162
00:14:54,340 --> 00:15:01,010
So I will take main activity dot and then we want to access the array adapter to do that.

163
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,530
I'll need to redefine it

164
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,180
up here.

165
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,400
There we go.

166
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:20,690
And then we can get the array adapter and notify data set changed.

167
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:30,930
So now when we run the app we should be able to edit the note and the changes will be automatically

168
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:35,790
saved in the initial load field.

169
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,640
And then of course displayed on the list view.

170
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,590
And here we go.

171
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,570
So I will type example note.

172
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:44,910
It is displayed nicely now

173
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,090
so I'll change that to a hello world.

174
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:59,750
And then close the keyboard and go back and we should indeed see Hello world at the top of our list

175
00:15:59,750 --> 00:15:59,940
view

176
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,880
so other than permanent storage We've got almost all the features that we need except for the adding

177
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:11,370
and deleting of notes.

178
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:15,960
So let's do that and then we'll add the permanent storage aspect at the very end.

179
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:20,640
So adding a note we're going to do as a menu item at the top right there.

180
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,440
So let's make that happen.

181
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:29,560
We're going to need to add a new directory inside the resources folder.

182
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,880
I'll call it menu.

183
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:40,230
And then within that we're going to add a new menu Rizzo's file

184
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:50,340
I'll call it add no menu can to be a very simple menu

185
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,000
with just a single item in that

186
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:07,580
with an ID of ADD at.

187
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,040
Note

188
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:20,970
and a title of that note and then we'll add it to our main activity

189
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,310
by adding our two methods.

190
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:34,630
First on create options many.

191
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:41,330
And then we use our menu inflator to link our menu with the menu that we've just created.

192
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,410
We'll call it menu later.

193
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:53,670
We use the get menu inflator method to create it and then we'll inflate our menu.

194
00:17:56,290 --> 00:18:01,740
And we want to use our dogs menu dot add note menu.

195
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:11,540
I this one that I just created and we want to assign that to the menu that's just been created.

196
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,360
Okay.

197
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:21,150
And then we want to add our own options item selected

198
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:30,840
and we want to day any default code that's required and there's only one case that we're really interested

199
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,790
in.

200
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:38,510
So we're going to look for item darte get item ID and begin going to test to see if that's equal to

201
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:45,950
the DOT ID dot ad note.

202
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:54,700
So that was the ID of the menu item I just created them.

203
00:18:55,070 --> 00:19:00,930
And if that's the case then we want to jump to the new activity.

204
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:07,850
So intent intent and this is going to be a new

205
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:14,300
intent using the application context.

206
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:27,600
And note we're going to GMAC note editor activity dot class and this time I'm not going to provide a

207
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,920
note Id.

208
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:34,150
So instead we're just going to start the activity

209
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,600
via the Internet.

210
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:41,370
All right.

211
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:49,370
So now we need to prepare our note editor activity to add a new note.

212
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:51,030
So we'll do this here.

213
00:19:54,820 --> 00:20:02,030
So essentially he checks for a valid note ID and if there isn't one then we're going to add a new one.

214
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:08,560
So I'm going to start by adding it to the notes.

215
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:11,740
All right let's.

216
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:16,150
And initially is just going to be empty.

217
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,910
So I'm just creating an empty note here.

218
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:22,710
Now it's going to be updated here.

219
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:27,820
So we're going to need a note I.D. to be able to access it.

220
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,580
It's actually quite easy to set.

221
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:41,960
We just get note I.D. is equal to the main activity notes dot size minus one.

222
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:48,480
So if for example the notes that we've just added was the third item then it would have an idea of 2

223
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,280
and the size of the notes frailest would be three.

224
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,740
So minus one gives us the two.

225
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:02,860
Now we do have an issue here because we cannot edit final variables they're fixed in value.

226
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:13,060
So what we'll do is define my note Id up here as a global variable and then down here we'll just updated

227
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,420
and then we can access it from anywhere.

228
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:22,630
And I'll also update the array adapter to display

229
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,110
in the history

230
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:33,610
k so we will get that a quick try.

231
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:42,450
I do seem to have an error in main activity there let's have a look and see what's going wrong yes.

232
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:44,720
You've got a missing return statement here.

233
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:52,210
In the on line options item selected menu.

234
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:59,300
So I'll just return true if the appropriate item is selected and return false.

235
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,150
If it's not

236
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,840
easily forgotten so let's give that a try.

237
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:15,050
So we should now be able to use a menu item to add a new note and that will be correctly saved within

238
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:16,520
our app.

239
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,230
Let's give it a go.

240
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:24,270
Here we are so thick in the menu and at Note that then jumps around you note

241
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:36,190
I look at myself a reminder to get milk and then go back and there it is wonderful.

242
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,490
So we're looking at just two things left now.

243
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:45,580
One is to allow users to delete notes with a long press and the other is of course permanent storage.

244
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,770
So let's do the delete process first.

245
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:58,060
We're going to be running this in main activity and we're going to need an all night long press listener

246
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:13,740
so let's add that in a list view set on item long click listener and again we're going to need an adaptive

247
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,780
view on item long click listener

248
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:27,740
and here this is where we're going to use our dialog builder.

249
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:35,930
To give the user just an option to confirm that they want to delete that note so it will need a new

250
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:36,620
alert

251
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,060
dialogue builder

252
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:49,510
using the application context

253
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:59,910
and then we'll do the usual process so we'll set the icon to Android.

254
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:07,840
Doc drawable and I use the alert dialog icon

255
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,890
will set the title T.

256
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:15,720
Are you sure.

257
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:25,000
And what's the message do you want to delete this note.

258
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,800
And then we'll set the positive button.

259
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:33,940
Yes.

260
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:35,780
And we'll add

261
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:46,160
new dialogue interface on click listener.

262
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:50,790
There we go see if that one is pressed and we want to remove it from notes

263
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:57,450
so we'll use notes don't remove.

264
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:00,240
And the one that we want to remove is the one that was pressed.

265
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,780
So that's why

266
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:07,280
and then we'll update the data

267
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:13,690
OK.

268
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,330
That's what we need to do there.

269
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:19,540
Then we'll set the negative button to just know.

270
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:23,510
And we don't need anything to happen if they click no.

271
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:26,370
So we'll leave the method as no.

272
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:34,520
And then finally show to show the alert dialog and just before we run that couple of quick changes that

273
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,010
we need to make.

274
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:40,610
We need to change return false here to return true.

275
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:48,210
Otherwise when we do the long click it will assume that we want to do a short click as well.

276
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:52,970
So the return tree overcomes that and only does the long click.

277
00:25:53,360 --> 00:26:00,080
And also in my testing we're going to get issues here with this application context being the context

278
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,690
for our builder.

279
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,930
So we actually want the activity to be the context not the application.

280
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:15,260
And we would normally do this to make that happen but we can't do that here because we're within an

281
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:19,480
on item long click method so that this would refer to that.

282
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:31,090
So to force the main activity to be the context we use main activity dot this.

283
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:31,900
All right.

284
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,160
So let's give that a try.

285
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,950
We should now get our alerts popping up and then

286
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:42,760
if we choose yes it will remove our example node.

287
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:45,250
So I've already got two example notes here.

288
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:49,310
So I'm going to Long press on the first one we've got the message coming up.

289
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:51,300
Click yes.

290
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:59,260
Ah we've got a crash which is curious but again worth leaving in I think and this is because we've got

291
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,860
two eyes here.

292
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:08,170
So when we're talking about eye in this context we actually want this one the one that was long clicked

293
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:14,840
on not the button that was clicked on to say yes.

294
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:25,110
So to get around virus or create an integer called item to delete and we'll set that equal to I.

295
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:31,860
And then here we'll use item to delete instead of.

296
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,130
So again easy mistake to make.

297
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:38,720
I thought I'd leave that in because I wonder if some of you might have done that too.

298
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,490
So let's try it again.

299
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:50,240
So now finally with any luck we'll do our long press on our example notes tap.

300
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:50,900
Yes.

301
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,460
And it's got wonderful.

302
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:57,670
Of course I can still add a new note.

303
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:58,580
Here we go.

304
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:06,510
I'll put learn Java as my instruction and there it is.

305
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:11,730
And of course a long press will get rid of that as well.

306
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:12,420
Quite so.

307
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:18,400
Now Notes app works exactly as we'd like but of course we don't have the permanent storage yet.

308
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:20,780
So let's set that up.

309
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:25,220
Now there's a few places we're going to need to update the permanent storage.

310
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:36,450
So one is right here when we delete an item one is here when we save the content of an item and possibly

311
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:39,120
we could save permanent storage here.

312
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,730
When a new item is added although if they don't actually get the note whether or not we want to save

313
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:48,560
a blank note for them permanently is debatable.

314
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:54,900
In fact I'm going to not do it there so I'm just going to do it there and over in the main activity

315
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,300
when the item is deleted.

316
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:01,650
But the code is going to be very similar for both.

317
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:05,220
And I'm going to use the string set this time.

318
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:10,200
You're very welcome to use the same method that we used in the memorable places app but just for a bit

319
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:14,400
of variety or so you have to do it with a string set.

320
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:23,220
So let's set up our shared preferences Gaulish preferences and this time we are going to use the application

321
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:34,460
context and we're going to get the shared preferences using the package Id say coma.

322
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,300
Percival notes.

323
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:41,230
And as before we'll use context dot

324
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:49,010
mode private to only our app can access the data.

325
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:59,140
And you'll remember hopefully that shared preferences allows us to get a number of different variable

326
00:29:59,140 --> 00:29:59,920
types.

327
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:06,320
And the one we're going to be working with here is the string set.

328
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:09,330
So we need a set to be working with.

329
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:18,430
So I'm just going to create a set which is known as a hash set.

330
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:26,040
So it's a set of strings which I'll just call set and this is going to be a new Hash set.

331
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:33,820
Are we going to create it from now array list.

332
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:37,640
I mean activity dot next.

333
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,750
Simple as that.

334
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:49,100
So we create our string from a rightist and then we say it in shared preferences so shared preferences

335
00:30:50,530 --> 00:31:01,920
or edits don't put strings at and the strings that we want to put is set.

336
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:05,020
And I'm going to call it next.

337
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:13,870
And then don't forget they apply at the end and that's it.

338
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:19,050
And then we'll just copy and paste that code over.

339
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,240
The main activity

340
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:31,210
and pop it in there with the necessary classes so that the set is updated.

341
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:33,880
When I know it is deleted.

342
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:42,040
All right so then the final thing we need to do is when we display the content of the list view we need

343
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:49,180
to check shared preferences and see if there's a set there and if there is then display the content

344
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,140
from it.

345
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:57,590
So let's get our shared preferences variable again here.

346
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:12,300
And then let's get our set say hash set of loops not string tokenize is just strings all the

347
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:20,300
and this is going to be shared preferences don't get string set.

348
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:24,890
And the strings that we're after is notes.

349
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:34,490
And if that fails I'm just going to bring out a no strings that.

350
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:46,170
And I think we actually need to cast this to a hash that's of strings to make that work.

351
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:55,680
So then we'll check to see if the set is no

352
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:09,200
then we'll do our full set up and just add the example note and if it's not we want to take notes array

353
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:09,650
list

354
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:22,730
and recreate it as a new array list at this time based on the set.

355
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:31,170
And that will then bring back all of the data from the set that's been saved and display it to the user.

356
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:40,630
So let's find the moment of truth and check to see that this works as intended with the permanent storage

357
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:42,020
now included.

358
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:42,960
OK.

359
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:44,480
So let's get through the whole process.

360
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,550
We'll add a note

361
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,470
I hope this works

362
00:33:53,360 --> 00:34:03,940
go back and there it is and we'll even delete an item as well and then tap on the square button to get

363
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:08,280
multitasking and then tap the X to close the notes up down.

364
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:19,940
Then the second button to get back to the home page click the all apps button and then we open notes.

365
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:25,170
Keep your fingers crossed and then rejoice because our saved note is right there.

366
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,610
Wonderful.

367
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:30,860
So I hope you manage to make most of that one yourself.

368
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:34,780
And more importantly that you enjoyed the process in the second half of this section.

369
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:41,170
We're now going to go on and see a more complex but far more powerful way offering data that avoids

370
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:45,880
all of the complications that we've had to go to with sets get preferences.

371
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:50,340
And that is using databases and that see how today in the next video.
