Congratulations on making it to the end of Section 5 you've covered a lot of material now and I hope

2
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:11,800
that there were a few challenges but you managed to overcome them over this section.

3
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:18,310
We've covered now downloading material from the web as well as timer's lists views try and catch and

4
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:19,210
a lot more.

5
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:23,240
So it was a pretty meaty section and there was a lot to learn.

6
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:28,030
I hope you've been developing your app along the side and you're really in a position now as well to

7
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:33,190
get on freelance or web sites or even go to friends and family and see if they want a simple Android

8
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:38,910
app built and you've got a lot of skills now to put something real that could be could be used and put

9
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,940
live on Google Play together.

10
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,810
Again it's not about making huge amounts of money.

11
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,910
It's about getting practice and getting something.

12
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:51,760
Life is no substitute for that for getting feedback as well as enjoying it and feeling good about what

13
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,710
you're doing.

14
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:56,800
So try and get something live something real and as quickly as you can.

15
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:59,970
And of course I'll see you at the beginning of the next section.
