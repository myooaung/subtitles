1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,100
We're now going to be taking a little bit of a break from shared preferences and looking at how we can

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:11,790
add a menu to our Android apps in the top right which is the kind of standard location for a menu on

3
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:17,690
Android we're going to be using this in our notes app that we're making in a couple of videos time.

4
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:24,600
So let's create a new project to see how to customize the menu.

5
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:35,260
This is something that's changed actually in the most recent version of Android studio used to be that

6
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:39,690
you were given a menu by default and each app and you had to remove it if you didn't want it.

7
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:44,640
Whereas now the devil is not to have a menu and you have to add it in if you want it.

8
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:51,520
So we'll start with an app that doesn't have a menu and will create the code to add and customize the

9
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,400
menu.

10
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,060
And here we go.

11
00:00:55,690 --> 00:01:03,940
So for a menu in Android we need to add one new file and we need to customize the main activity java

12
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:05,350
file as well.

13
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:17,470
So the new file is a simple layout file which just gives the layout of our menu and it's usual to create

14
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:25,720
a new folder so control click or right click on rez for resources and we're going to create a new directory

15
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,150
which I'll call menu.

16
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:40,070
And then we click File menu and menu resource file and I'll call this main menu

17
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:44,710
click OK.

18
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:54,760
And then you can see we've got this main menu SML file so I'm going to use the text view to add my many

19
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:00,810
and all we need to do is to create a couple of items.

20
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:10,970
So I will start off with I setting's menu which will also need an ID

21
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,390
it settings

22
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,270
and similarly we'll just create a second one

23
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,630
copy from the first call.

24
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,220
Help.

25
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,490
So you can see our menu.

26
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:47,850
Obviously we can customize this in the same way we would anything either in the design view or the text

27
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:53,970
view but I'll leave it as the default layout for now.

28
00:02:53,970 --> 00:03:00,110
Now back in main activity we've got a few settings that we need to add before this will actually work.

29
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:13,050
And the first is to customize the on create options menu which will be run when the options menu is

30
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:20,520
created and what we mainly want to do here is link the options menu with how SML file that we've just

31
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,860
created.

32
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:31,320
And we do that using something called a menu inflator Djoko menu inflata and this will be able to get

33
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:40,920
menu inflator and then we'll take menu inflata and we'll inflate our menu then we want to access our

34
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,850
menu.

35
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:53,460
So we use resources top menu topped main menu and we want to link that to this menu here which is the

36
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,370
options menu.

37
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:58,260
The one in the top right.

38
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,060
There we go.

39
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:03,130
So now the menu will appear which is great.

40
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:08,750
Or just run it will be quicker to see it later on.

41
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,820
But at the moment none of the options will actually do anything.

42
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:18,350
So the final thing we need to add is on options item selected

43
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:23,460
and then here

44
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:33,270
will run superdog on options items selected.

45
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:39,490
And then we're going to check for which item was selected and we're going to do that using a switch

46
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,630
which you see once or twice before.

47
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:45,180
It's a bit like a big if else statement.

48
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:55,100
So we're switching on the ID of the item that was selected which is item dot get item id

49
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:06,450
and the first option quite literally is settings.

50
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:13,130
So if the item ID is our DOT ID dot settings

51
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:18,950
then for now it will just log

52
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,850
menu item selected.

53
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:34,210
And settings.

54
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,970
Another option is that

55
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:45,520
its our ID to help.

56
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,710
So in that case its copy and paste

57
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:58,020
menu item selected and help.

58
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,130
And then with a switch you always need a default.

59
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:12,180
And thats going to be return false doesnt really need to be returned foal's but

60
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:24,660
in case we do anything involving the menu from elsewhere in the app it can be useful to know whether

61
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,840
a successful selection was made or not.

62
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:35,070
So these returns dont particularly matter but they kind of make sense to returning true if the user

63
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:38,730
selects something and falls if they didn't.

64
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,350
All right so now we've got

65
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,210
you running.

66
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:47,320
And here it is.

67
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,790
So there's our menu.

68
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:56,320
We can tap on it and select settings for example and then we look in the logs.

69
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:04,450
With any luck we should see that settings every menu item selected and settings.

70
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:11,090
And similarly we select help and that will be shown there as well.

71
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:15,950
So of course just logging that the user has pressed an item in the menu of no particular use for what

72
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:21,410
we'd probably do there would be to display a new activity where the user could either look for some

73
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:28,310
help or change some settings or it might bring up a pop up or alert dialog which is what we're going

74
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,790
to learn how to do in the next video.

75
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:31,510
So you're there.
