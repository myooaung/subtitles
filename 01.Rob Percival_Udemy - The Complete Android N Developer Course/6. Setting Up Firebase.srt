1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:06,930
Firebase is a service owned by Google which is in many ways quite similar to pass server.

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:14,220
It allows us to do things like database storage authentication and also messaging notifications and

3
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,480
analytics.

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:21,920
Now while I'd recommend using past server if you just need the database features because that server

5
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:29,160
is self-hosted and so can't be affected by for example Google deciding to shut down firebase as Facebook

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,620
did with pass firebase is a great service and you might want to try using it.

7
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,830
It's also a prerequisite for using Google's AdMob platform.

8
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:41,880
So this idea I'm going to show you how to set up an app with the firebase.

9
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:47,610
And then in the next video we'll see how to add ads to a firebase app.

10
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,340
So first off we need to create an account on firebase.

11
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:57,300
So you get a file based on Google dot com and log in with your Google account and click get started

12
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,940
for free.

13
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,200
Firebase does have a pretty generous frita.

14
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:09,840
But of course you will need to start paying if you use large amounts of data so I'm going to create

15
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:18,270
a new project and I'll just call this firebase demo project

16
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:26,880
choose your country and then create project.

17
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:27,890
And there we go.

18
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:34,970
So we want to add firebase to our Android app and to do that we need a package name.

19
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:44,180
So let's quickly jump over to enter a studio and create a new project for this demo.

20
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:53,750
So we'll call it firebase demo app

21
00:01:56,410 --> 00:02:04,830
and just in case you missed it there a package name it can be calm don't rub Percival dot firebase hap.

22
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:09,540
And I've been using Google that but will go down to a lollipop.

23
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,390
Doesn't really matter.

24
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:18,420
I will support more devices in this demo app and then set that up as usual.

25
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,990
And then we can jump back over to firebase

26
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:30,120
and say Come Rob Percival

27
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,500
fire base

28
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,450
demo app.

29
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,310
There we go.

30
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:49,960
If you want extra security you can use a signing certificate but we'll just use the package name for

31
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,040
now.

32
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:03,370
That then allows us to download a Google services Jason File which we can put in our app directory

33
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,290
which contains all the settings that we need to connect to.

34
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,460
Firebase.

35
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:16,910
And then as it says there we can just check and make sure that Google services don't tell you some is

36
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:20,190
in the right place it should be in the app directory.

37
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:33,380
So if we tap on project and then in the dropdown here at the top there select project expand that and

38
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,820
then we get out Google services as some file is in there.

39
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,270
So I'm just going to try Ragatz

40
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,870
inti the app folder

41
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,340
and there we go.

42
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,840
So now it's in the app folder in the right place

43
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,810
so well click continue.

44
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:08,320
And then we need to add two lines to how build cradles.

45
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,090
So first look at the project level build cradle.

46
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:20,440
This will allow us to use the Google services Jason File and the Google services that it uses.

47
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:33,000
So back to android and then open up the first build a cradle file for the project and then we'll add

48
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,700
in under dependencies.

49
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,120
There we go.

50
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,670
Com dot Google dot JMS and then Google services 3.0 point zero.

51
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:53,960
Obviously if that version number has changed then use the version specified by firebase and then we'll

52
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,650
add the plug in to the app level build cradle

53
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:10,160
so that so that when there so to the very bottom of the file we add apply plug in and then come Tokiko

54
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:19,220
that JMS Google services and then we also need to add the firebase modules themselves which we do in

55
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,710
the dependencies section here.

56
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:37,300
And we use compile and then come dot Google dot firebase and colon firebase core flybys hyphen core

57
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,890
and then nine point four point zero.

58
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:48,400
And we also need if we're going to be using the database which we will do just to check that everything's

59
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,900
working OK.

60
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,940
We use kohm.

61
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,870
Google doc firebase

62
00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:01,510
colon firebase Ifan database colon.

63
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:07,030
Nine point four point zero.

64
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:15,020
And then we click sync now and that will add those plugins and dependencies to our app.

65
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:22,110
And now that it's done we can write a little bit of code in the main activity and we'll just write a

66
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:27,660
very simple bit of code which will connect to the database and save an object for us just like we have

67
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,420
on past server.

68
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:37,340
So to do this on firebase we start off by creating a database reference

69
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,500
which I'll call deep breath.

70
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:56,700
And this is going to equal the firebase database don't get instance don't get reference that will get

71
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:07,440
the database created as part of your firebase app and then we'll just create a simple map which will

72
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:15,530
link strings to streams and I'll call this values.

73
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:21,060
So it's just an object that we're going to store in the database.

74
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,160
And this is going to be a new hash map

75
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,250
then will set some values.

76
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:41,440
So values don't put on something like name Rob.

77
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:54,000
So we need and then to say that to the database we use D-B ref dot push and then set value.

78
00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:00,840
And we can just use values like that that will save it in the database but we always like to have a

79
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,030
callback so we know it's been successful.

80
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:13,150
So we're going to create a new completion Lisner which just like with pass server gives us the default

81
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,880
uncomplete method.

82
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:22,060
And again we can do as we're reasonably used to something like a database error equals no

83
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,290
log

84
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,840
safe successful

85
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
else log.

86
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:48,940
Save failed.

87
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,310
There we go.

88
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:54,220
So you can see the logic is quite similar to the Passover.

89
00:08:54,310 --> 00:09:03,870
One quick change we're going to need to make before we run that is to add the internet permission so

90
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,700
that uses permission.

91
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:16,910
Name Is Android permission dot Internet that we go.

92
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:27,590
So we'll run that on our device and as it's running I'm going to make a quick change on firebase now

93
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:34,010
the default on firebase databases is that the user has to be logged in to be able to save anything because

94
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:39,010
we're not going to go as far as user authentication in this small introduction to firebase.

95
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:47,070
I'm going to change those rules so I'm going to tap over there where it says rules and I'm just going

96
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:52,330
to change the not equal t t equals C

97
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,980
and then publish.

98
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:03,410
And that will mean that the user doesn't have to be logged in to read and write to the database

99
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:08,600
OK.

100
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,090
So let's have a look.

101
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:22,220
It's launching the activity.

102
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,450
And you can see save.

103
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,380
Successful.

104
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:32,550
So as with Percival Let's have a quick look back on the database and you can see we've got an object

105
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:39,030
that's an object ID and if we open it up you can see we've saves the name.

106
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,850
We're up super.

107
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:48,210
So if you want to go further with firebase then I just start with the documentation there and work your

108
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:50,760
way through creating some basic apps.

109
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,680
But we're going to go to look at how we can use firebase as a basis for AdMob.

110
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:03,370
I'm putting ads in our apps which is a great way of generating revenue particularly on Android and we'll

111
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,070
do that in the next video.
