00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:07.420
One very important aspect of the use of Android Wear is notifications so that showing data to the user

2
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:13.730
when when a certain event happens and I'm going to show you how to create those in Android where right

3
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:21.460
now the prices are actually pretty similar to what we saw back in chapter 11 on Android notifications.

4
00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:31.890
So cool this where notification Dema and usual settings

5
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:46.370
and as with Android notifications I'm just going to show you how to create the notification within your

6
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.830
app.

7
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:49.650
So here we go.

8
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.280
We're going to do everything in main activity Java

9
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.780
and we don't need any of that.

10
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.660
So let's get rid of it.

11
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:10.230
So just as before we start off by building our notification and we do that using notification

12
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:29.290
compact dot builder and this is going to be a notification build up and it is a new

13
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:46.580
builder using main activity as the context Ruperts whatever it is we want to set the various options

14
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.410
say we'll set the small icon

15
00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:01.590
Android to talk drawable and we'll find something or the error will be fine.

16
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.980
So that's the icon for our notification.

17
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.420
We set the content title

18
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.440
on just be boring and call it notification title for now.

19
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.200
Then we set the content text

20
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.170
Rob.

21
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.330
How's it going.

22
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:36.810
Then we set the content intent and we need a pending intent.

23
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.950
If you don't remember me talking about pending intense then go back and look at local notifications

24
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.750
in Android.

25
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:50.190
I won't go through it all again but we will create our pending intent which starts with creating a normal

26
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.740
intent.

27
00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:01.880
I'll stick with our usual eye and this is going to be what we want to happen when the notification is

28
00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:02.540
tapped on

29
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.430
so in our case we're just going to go to it should be capitalized.

30
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:17.570
We're just going to go to main activity the main activity class.

31
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:28.540
So context again is main activity and we want a jump in the main activity class but it might be that

32
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.260
you've got some other activities and you want to jump to one of those.

33
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.460
And then you change that back.

34
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.590
And then we create our pending intent.

35
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.100
Pending intent.

36
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.010
And we use pending attent don't get activity.

37
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.210
Context is this.

38
00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.190
And then we put in a request code if we want one.

39
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.510
I will just put zero but you might want to have another number that you can then get later if you want

40
00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.230
to refer to this particular pending content.

41
00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.500
Then we put our intent.

42
00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:12.230
And then some flags if we want any special options here we don't we just put zero in.

43
00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.830
So that's our pending intent.

44
00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:23.510
So at that there and then you can go in and add some more options if you want but those are that kind

45
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.880
of minimal options set that you'll need

46
00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:36.710
then we create our notification manager which has a type of notification manager compact

47
00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.690
and notification notification marriage makes a bit more sense.

48
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.690
And this is going to be

49
00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:56.400
created from the current context.

50
00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.140
And finally we take out a notification manager

51
00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:03.590
and we notify

52
00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:12.810
and then once again we've got a I.D. which I'm going to match up with that number there so.

53
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:24.530
And then we got to build the notification that we created up here and that's it.

54
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:32.310
So let's run the app and we should say that this notification is created on the watch as soon as the

55
00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:33.090
app is run

56
00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.510
and then we get the app has run now.

57
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:43.420
So if we tap the power button then we can see the notification.

58
00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:44.770
There it is.

59
00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.530
So you can swipe right.

60
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:51.350
I think it is to dismiss it or left to accept it.

61
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:57.590
And then we want to open the app so that will actually go again and then it will run the notification

62
00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:58.210
again.

63
00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.280
We'll go round and round like that but that's it.

64
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:07.910
Simple as that to create notifications on Android where you could even combine that with the transfer

65
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:13.490
of data between phone and watch as we saw last time to create a notification on the watch from the phone

66
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.630
listening to a data change and then running this.

67
00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:18.470
When that happens

68
00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.530
OK we're almost done now an hour to have.

69
00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.840
The last thing we're going to look at in the next video is something that's a lot of fun and that's

70
00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.800
creating our own custom watch faces.
