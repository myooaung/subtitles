1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:09,030
The first thing I would strongly suggest to do is find a so professional that will help you with this

2
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,570
critical part in order to see success.

3
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:18,550
They will show you which keywords you should try to rank for in the app stores.

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:25,590
Also the amount of competition for each key word is important to know as well here.

5
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:34,180
The CEO for the app stores is called a s or App Store optimization.

6
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:41,390
You can expect to get two tons to 10 times increase in downloads and revenue.

7
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:50,970
If you put the time into ASIO and follow these tips you might not see an overnight impact but trust

8
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:54,740
me over time you will see a big difference.

9
00:00:54,810 --> 00:01:03,330
You always have to be testing and experimenting with your keywords so you keep cranking well because

10
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:08,380
your competition is always changing and so is the ecosystem of the App Store

11
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:18,680
S-O is time consuming with constant monitoring and as a process that needs to be constantly tweaked

12
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,730
over time.

13
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:29,510
Retention I feel is the number one most mis represented a s o technique and here's why.

14
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:36,520
Without retention a lot of the other strategies tend to fall to the wayside.

15
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:46,470
Retention here is described as something about your app makes the user keep coming back to play over

16
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:51,110
and over again logging in many hours per month.

17
00:01:51,120 --> 00:02:00,540
We know the app stores take this retention rate into consideration when ranking your apps keywords retention

18
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,720
weighs heavily now in how your keywords rank.

19
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:13,860
Therefore you should always focus on your app's retention rate because the app stores do today all the

20
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:24,090
huge popular mobile app companies perform such soft launches in the UK Canada Australia and New Zealand.

21
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:30,690
First to test their retention rates before hitting the United States.

22
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:38,130
This way your retention rate is on the mark and all the other bugs and problems have been rectified

23
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,620
during your soft launch.

24
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:48,780
Then when you are ready for the main launch in the United States your retention rate is at its highest

25
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,560
and you'll have much greater success.

26
00:02:53,670 --> 00:03:02,020
AppStore search is one of the very first critical steps to increasing your downloads organically.

27
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:09,540
This is where your future customers type Hopefully your key word or key word phrases into the app store

28
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:13,220
search engine and your app shows up.

29
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,390
So the customer can easily see it and check it out.

30
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,580
This is where you have to think like a customer and not an app developer.

31
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:29,580
It's very important to pick and choose the right keywords or keyword phrases you want to target for

32
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,590
your app.

33
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:39,080
The app title should contain the key word as well as the description that description has to intrigue

34
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,640
your customer.

35
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,510
So make it interesting and make it sound fun too.

36
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:52,340
To sum it up the following three are super important and we will result in a big increase in downloads

37
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,820
from months to years to come.

38
00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:02,440
They are key words or phrases your apt title and your apt description.

39
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:09,500
If for some reason your downloads don't increase there are a number of reasons for this.

40
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:16,280
One could be there's just too much competition for that keyword and so you'll need to choose another

41
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:24,190
less competitive keyword or category to see if that remedies the download situation.

42
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:28,800
You then need to make a professional icon for your app.

43
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:37,660
Try to make it stand out with a 3D border and colors that make it stand out against the AppStore background.

44
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:41,580
Next important step is to take eye candy.

45
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:47,500
Hi rez screenshots to help sell your app to the masses.

46
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:53,740
The final step here is you better make your app very engaging.

47
00:04:53,750 --> 00:05:02,750
What I mean by that is you want the customer who just downloaded your app to not only spend time throughout

48
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:06,860
the day but keep them engaged or coming back.

49
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:15,020
You want them to keep opening your app up on a daily basis and spending a lot of time inside your giraffe.

50
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:19,200
Why are these factors so very important.

51
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:30,380
Because these are considered ranking factors in the App Store a logarithm that helps propel your app

52
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,410
higher in the App Store rankings.

53
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:38,500
So start your keyword analysis first and see what you're up against.

54
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:46,200
First I have recommendations for you if you want an ASIO professional to handle all this for you.

55
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:54,980
I can't stress this enough how super important your oh is done correctly in order to increase your downloads

56
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:58,860
on a daily basis for the long term.

57
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:05,810
You must please your customers with the most positive or more positive reviews you can achieve.

58
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:11,970
The more downloads will follow if you follow just these few steps alone.

59
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:16,160
You're going to have a few hundred more downloads per day.

60
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,730
Again it bears repeating here.

61
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:28,700
If you aren't getting the increase in downloads you have to step back and see whether it's your choice

62
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:35,090
of keywords or possibly it's your competitive category always split.

63
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:38,550
Test and keep records of your changes.

64
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:42,740
Always change one thing at a time when split testing.

65
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:51,860
Here for example change only the key word and keep the app title apt description and category the same.

66
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,590
Then see what happens.

67
00:06:53,810 --> 00:07:01,580
Then change just the app title which should have your key word in it and see if downloads increase or

68
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:05,040
decrease or stays the same.

69
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,570
Use this process until you get a favorable response.

70
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:12,610
Be sure to check the recommended links below.

71
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,160
Ok I'll see you in the next lecture.
