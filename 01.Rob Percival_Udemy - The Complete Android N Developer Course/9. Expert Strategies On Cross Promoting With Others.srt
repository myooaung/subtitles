00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:06,500
K now we're going to discuss expert strategies uncross promoting with others.

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,710
I don't advise you to use this strategy.

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:10,670
Why.

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,020
Think about it.

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:18,090
You really don't want to send people out of your app to another app because this winds up hurting your

6
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:23,140
social engagement which leads to lowering your AppStore ranking.

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:30,250
Therefore use this with caution if you do choose to do so for example.

8
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:37,530
So if you already have other apps available you can use them to promote the download of the new app

9
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,030
or use apps belonging to partners of yours.

10
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:48,950
There happens to be companies specializing in this type of cross promotion between apps.

11
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:59,130
They are known as cross-promotion networks C.P. and for sure a few are free and some are paid and you

12
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,190

00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:11,100
