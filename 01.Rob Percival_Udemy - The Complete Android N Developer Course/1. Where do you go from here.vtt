00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:06.750
Congratulations on making it to Section 17 of the complete Android and develop because if you follow

2
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:12.060
a through from the beginning then you've gone from zero skills in Android development and maybe no coding

3
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:18.060
skills before as well and you've learned how to work with Android studio how to code in Java and build

4
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.750
a huge range of different apps including Instagram Oubre colognes how people at games on Twitter and

5
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.850
WhatsApp Kline's as well.

6
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.860
So I hope you're proud of yourself and once again congratulations on making it this far.

7
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.160
The question is now where do you go from here.

8
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.750
Well firstly I would thoroughly recommend simply building your apps.

9
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.620
It's the best way.

10
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.700
Even if you don't get a lot of revenue from those early apps to start learning how to do what you need

11
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.020
to do when you're building apps and also how to do things like marketing your app.

12
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:56.620
Once it's out there on that note I'm now going to pass you on to professional app marketer Mark stock

13
00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.820
who is going to show you how to market your apps both on Google Play and beyond.

14
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.430
So I hope you've enjoyed the journey that we've been on throughout this course and I hope you're going

15
00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.680
to go on to build a huge range of Android apps and share them with the world.

16
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.720
And of course when you do let me know on Twitter and I'll happily for them on to my followers I wish

17
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.360
you the very best of luck with building and marketing your Android apps and I thank you for allowing

18
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.340
