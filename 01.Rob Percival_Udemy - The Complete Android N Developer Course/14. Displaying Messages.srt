1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:06,510
Now that we've seen how to make our app interactive using buttons and text fields we're now going to

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:12,600
see how to display information to the user on the actual app screen rather than just in the logs which

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,270
only we can see.

4
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,340
It's actually really easy to do.

5
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:19,020
Using something called a toast.

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:25,290
So a toast is essentially a small bit of text that pops up from the bottom of the screen much like a

7
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:31,370
piece of toast does from the toaster and then it will display that text and then disappear again.

8
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:37,900
And we can make one display very easily using the command toast.

9
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:43,370
And then you can see when I've typed in toast we've got the option to create a new toast.

10
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:49,620
We're going to press enter to select that option and then it gives us the code that we need to do that.

11
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,660
So to create a new toast we use Toast.

12
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:59,220
Don't make a text and then we need to provide it with what's called a context which is essentially where

13
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:05,430
the text should appear and we want it to appear on the screen i.e. over the main activity.

14
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:13,850
So we use main activity and then we use they don't this command to get the context for the main activity.

15
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:19,250
So it's a slightly odd thing to do and we'll both see some alternatives to that later on in the course.

16
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:24,570
But for now essentially we want it to appear on the main activity and to do that we use main activity

17
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:33,030
toward this and then the next instruction that we give it is the text that we want to appear when we

18
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,700
do the test so high then we can use anything you like.

19
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:43,990
And then we just decide at the length that the toast will appear for and you can see we can use Toast

20
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:50,850
length short or we can also use Toast length long.

21
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:55,650
Those are the only options we can either make it a very quick appearance or a slightly longer appearance

22
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,880
and then we use dot to show to actually make the text appear.

23
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:07,410
So let's just very quickly run that and see it in action.

24
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:13,390
And we should now see that high that text appearing up from the bottom of the screen.

25
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,590
And here we go.

26
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,830
So now I'm going to press this button.

27
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:24,910
And you can see Hi there appears and stays there for a reasonably long time but not loads of time so

28
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:31,630
this is obviously not for lengthy bits of text but just for quick bits of information.

29
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:36,460
So here's a mini challenge for you which is not the main challenge for this video but it will give you

30
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:40,180
a chance to manipulate the code that we've got there just a little.

31
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:47,710
Can you make it so that instead of saying hi there when we press the button that whatever text the user

32
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:51,130
has entered in the text field appears bare.

33
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:59,450
Instead go for it.

34
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:00,680
Did you manage it.

35
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:11,960
All you needed today was move the test code to after where we get the information about the added text

36
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:19,590
and then we've already got some code which gets the contents of the text field.

37
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:26,980
So all we needed to do was copy that and replace the hi there with that text.

38
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:34,650
So let's run it again and have a look now it should run fairly quickly.

39
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,840
Not exactly instantaneous but it's not too bad.

40
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:50,580
So now if I put hello or something there and then press the button then you can see that text appears.

41
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:54,510
It's worth noting that you can combine that string.

42
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:59,000
So whatever the user has typed in with some other text if you want to.

43
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:06,930
So if we wanted to put an exclamation mark on the end of whatever the user said for some crazy reason

44
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,100
then we would do it just like that.

45
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,460
So we get whatever they say and then we.

46
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:15,900
Plus an exclamation mark in quites again.

47
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,270
Just after it.

48
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:26,840
So this will now toast whatever they say but with exclamation marks after.

49
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,250
So let's see it in action.

50
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:33,340
If I type high then you can see we now get high with an exclamation mark.

51
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,920
All right so that's more or less all there is to toasts of course there's now a challenge for you to

52
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,080
put all of this together.

53
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,040
And the app that I want you to make is this.

54
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,230
So again very simple.

55
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:53,310
We've just got a little text for you then saying What is your name.

56
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:58,820
And then we've got a text field with name as the hint.

57
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:07,580
And then if I put my name in and click the button that says Click me it says Hi there Rob.

58
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:12,210
Simple as that but I will give you an opportunity to put everything that we've learned so far all together

59
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:16,280
and create your first truly interactive Android app.

60
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,880
Best of luck.

61
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:27,080
Go for it.

62
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:27,720
All right.

63
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,220
So here we go.

64
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:36,330
I'm going to of course start with a new project.

65
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:40,090
So I call this toast demo.

66
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,620
Oh the usual settings that we now are used to notice.

67
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:52,840
Hopefully that once you've got into the habit of creating a new project and doing the basic set up it

68
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,040
becomes second nature.

69
00:05:54,040 --> 00:06:00,640
This is why I've asked you to do new projects each time because that process of creating a new product

70
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,240
is something you'll be doing so often.

71
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:07,610
It's great to get in the back of your mind as something that you can do pretty much without thinking.

72
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,200
All right.

73
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:18,030
So I'm going to start as usual over an activity main

74
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:25,240
and we're going to keep this of course pretty simple.

75
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,060
So we'll have some text.

76
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,980
What is your name.

77
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:38,560
And then underneath that we'll bring in.

78
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,290
Why not use the person name

79
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:51,880
textfield and that has name presented for us super It's got a nice way actually but I'm going to increase

80
00:06:51,880 --> 00:07:00,010
it to all parents so that it's the full width that looks a bit nicer and then

81
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,320
we'll bring in our button

82
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,020
which I'll just say

83
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,810
click me.

84
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:28,450
And then on the button will set the on click.

85
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,750
I'll call it say hi.

86
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,850
And we're also going to need an I.D. for the name

87
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,840
I'll call it the name it text

88
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:49,350
and yep will update everything with that new ID

89
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:52,560
wonderful.

90
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:57,840
OK so that set up the user interface.

91
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,550
Now we just need to add our code in.

92
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,760
So again this should be more or less second nature by now.

93
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:11,050
We're going to create a public method that doesn't return anything called void.

94
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:18,170
I think I call that say hi but I'm going to just go back and check because my pool crash if I get it

95
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:18,570
wrong.

96
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,140
Yep.

97
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:33,340
And then we're going to create a new variable to represent our button and import the view class and

98
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:37,330
then we're going to create an edit text

99
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:49,950
and to import the class again and I'll call this name added text say the same as the ID and we're going

100
00:08:50,090 --> 00:09:00,480
to find view by ID using resources dot ID dot name added text semi-colon at the end.

101
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:06,270
And then we want to convert that from a view to an added text

102
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:13,200
and then we need to do is to create outburst.

103
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:21,100
So I'm going to enter to create a new TOSed use main activity of this as the context for the text and

104
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,690
then we want

105
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,320
to say hi there.

106
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:37,050
Karma and then we want to get the user's name to that name and it text get text

107
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:49,350
dot to strain and I'll leave it at short this time and that should do it.

108
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,110
So let's check it out.

109
00:09:54,290 --> 00:10:02,990
We should now find that when we click on the button then the app will say hi there followed by whatever

110
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,200
name we've entered in the box.

111
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,330
Let's say so here we go.

112
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,880
I'm going to enter my name in the box that everything looks nice.

113
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,480
We do need to make a small change that looks like name has actually been set as the default content

114
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:27,610
rather than the hint.

115
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:30,880
So we have to select it and get rid of it which isn't good.

116
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,590
So I'll just pop up in there and then click in the box and there we go.

117
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:43,640
Hi That web so that is more or less exactly what we wanted.

118
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,600
Let's just

119
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:54,090
get rid of we don't actually want the text name to be there.

120
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:05,920
But we do want a hint name and then if we run out again now that will work because we want it so rather

121
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,970
than having name as the text will have a name as the hint

122
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,090
and there we go.

123
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,500
That's much better.

124
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:24,920
Let's put Dave in the and we get high that wonderful.

125
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:28,130
So we now finally have that full interactivity.

126
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:33,140
The user can enter some data click to make some code happen and then we can give a response to the user

127
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,470
using a toast.

128
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:40,440
We're now nearly at the end of this first section but before we can make our currency converter app

129
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,060
we need to learn how to import images into our apps.

130
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,740
And that's what we'll be doing in the next video.
