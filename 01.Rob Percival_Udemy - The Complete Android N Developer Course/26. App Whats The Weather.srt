1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:07,800
So now that you've learned how to use Jason and how to get some Jason's data from the web and then interpret

2
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:13,160
it and use it in your app we're going to apply that to our What's the web app.

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:21,270
So we're looking for something like this where you can enter a city and then we can enter a city name

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:32,070
such as London tap water the weather and then the weather is displayed right there underneath.

5
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:35,260
So pretty much everything you've done before.

6
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,940
So it should be reasonably straightforward to make.

7
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,140
I'm just going to very quickly show you where I got that background image from.

8
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:47,900
I like this Web site on Splash dot com if you want sort of quite generic backgrounds that are completely

9
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:53,270
free to use in any apps really can make your app look a lot more attractive.

10
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:59,300
And of course we're going to be using the open weather map API which we saw in the previous lecture

11
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:02,240
which has content like that.

12
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:06,130
So as always strongly encourage you to have a go at this yourself.

13
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,250
Best of luck.

14
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:15,040
All right.

15
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:23,600
I hope that one well I'm going to begin of course by creating a new project and I'm going to call it

16
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,600
what's the weather.

17
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:32,690
I'm just going to avoid the apostrophe there because it can cause issues in package names.

18
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:38,940
I'd recommend not putting punctuation in that if you can avoid it and then blank activity

19
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,430
same one that.

20
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,220
OK.

21
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:51,810
So as I mentioned I'm going to try and make this app look a little bit prettier.

22
00:01:52,390 --> 00:02:01,090
So I'm going to get to Sunsplash dot com we have a bunch of fairly generic but often very pretty photos.

23
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:08,380
And I'm going to find one that might have something vaguely to do with whether that one is nice but

24
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:12,610
it's going to cause problems when we try and put text over that I think depending on where the text

25
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:16,740
ends up we need something a bit more generic.

26
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,510
I think this will be great.

27
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,330
I like the look of that one.

28
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:27,300
OK so I'm just going to save image as I'm just going to put it right there on the desk top.

29
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,900
And I'll call it background

30
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,810
OK.

31
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,470
Back over to Android studio here we are.

32
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,840
So let's start by importing our image.

33
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:46,250
So remember we're going to drag that into trouble.

34
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:53,700
So just control clicked can right click on Windows and then reveal and find them or Windows Explorer

35
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:56,380
and then

36
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,320
I'm going to open a new tab with command T.

37
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:13,950
Contest's shop and then just drag in my background taught jpeg image.

38
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,280
There it is.

39
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,030
It's in Africa back I have to studio with any luck it'll be there.

40
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:19,530
Lovely.

41
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:19,960
Yep.

42
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:26,830
If it's not remember you can just synchronize it to make it appear that great.

43
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,070
So let's get rid of hello world.

44
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:32,100
Let's drag in our lovely image for you.

45
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:44,400
Goes without saying that making a simple app it looks a lot prettier if you can get a nice pretty image

46
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,420
in the background and it's very easy to do as well.

47
00:03:48,480 --> 00:04:00,080
So I change the width and height to fill parents and then we'll set the SLC weps.

48
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,530
I do find that annoying.

49
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,480
I have a background

50
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,030
just see how that looks in the default.

51
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,410
So that's not quite what we are going for.

52
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,340
But I am worried we can it that way that scale type.

53
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:24,890
So here you can see if we want to stretch it x and y.

54
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,320
That looks pretty good.

55
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:32,610
Fits start fit center and fit and obviously not quite what we wanted.

56
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,460
We could try a center.

57
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:38,920
I like that t center inside.

58
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,580
Not what we want.

59
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,880
So now I'm going to go for center Kropp.

60
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:46,610
I think that looks nice with this particular image.

61
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:50,930
And then let's drag in what we need.

62
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,080
So we've already got the title we don't need that again.

63
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,950
I'm going to bring in a text view.

64
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,680
I'm going to want to be scented

65
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,530
into a city

66
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:16,580
and then here I definitely want a margin at the top.

67
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:23,640
Then let's try 50 the page.

68
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:38,580
Yeah I like that and when it began I tried 20 recipe a little bigger I think even than that trifecta.

69
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,740
Yeah.

70
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,010
I like that.

71
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:51,130
And I want to change the color.

72
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:54,210
I think it would look good if we make it completely white.

73
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:02,960
So we did that with bringing everything to t 5:5

74
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:13,350
Yeah I like that then we'll have

75
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,790
textfield to get the weather up.

76
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:28,510
So again we want to send it and we want it's not to the left of texture we want to directly underneath

77
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:29,330
text.

78
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,620
That we can change it to the width

79
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,410
of the whole screen.

80
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:55,410
Actually maybe that might look a bit weird that's a padding to the left of let's try 40.

81
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:02,050
DP Yep I like that so I noticed because it's scented it's automatically added a right to one as well.

82
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:05,390
And then finally we'll just need a button

83
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,460
to find out the weather.

84
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:16,070
So again we want it scented and Polow

85
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:28,320
the text input and we'll say what's the weather

86
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,090
and actually we can leave the idea button.

87
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,770
That's fine.

88
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:40,600
But we're once of course an on click

89
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:48,180
call Find web.

90
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:49,730
OK.

91
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:55,620
And then I think I just want to add a little bit of a margin to the top of that button.

92
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,280
Just tell me that down slightly.

93
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,420
That's maybe a little too much

94
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:05,930
OK.

95
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,040
Lovely.

96
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:12,330
And then finally we'll have a label which will appear down here to give us the weather

97
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:23,750
say actually I want to align it to the bottom this time

98
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:29,570
I will have a margin on the bottom to bring it up.

99
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:39,150
Let's try 100 tepees maybe slightly more.

100
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:43,060
Great change the text size again.

101
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:53,150
That I think there might be a little bit large as we to have quite a bit of information then.

102
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,880
And finally it will change the with

103
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:05,320
to actually leaving as web content should be fine because then it will grow as necessary.

104
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:08,710
But I will actually change the color.

105
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:13,160
I think the white works better against that background

106
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,900
lovely.

107
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,820
All right.

108
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:31,880
So we'll try now adding the code to find the web

109
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:39,940
so you'll be relieved to hear that I'm not going to take you through the whole process of downloading

110
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:46,130
our Jason and then purchasing it line by line because we've done that several times now.

111
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:50,700
I hope you think that you're reasonably expert on that.

112
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:56,320
So I'm just going to copy that over from Jason demo and then add it's

113
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:03,980
and you can see very nicely it's added all the classes that we might need.

114
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:12,200
So we don't have to do that manually.

115
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:20,850
So now let's create a method for finding the weather.

116
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,250
So we call that find whether

117
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:30,070
that's going to be called by Button view

118
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:40,760
and the one variable that we're particularly interested in is the city name.

119
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,300
So we need a way to get that.

120
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,060
I think we should

121
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,050
give that a better idea.

122
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:55,160
It will update those so city name

123
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:59,120
and then

124
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:05,020
we'll just add that to our code.

125
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,600
So it's an added text.

126
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,720
And I'll find it up there.

127
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:19,710
City name.

128
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:23,240
And then on create we'll find it

129
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:32,590
as we know it's an added text.

130
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:39,690
Thein VBI ID says Dot ID dot city name

131
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,700
as we've done quite a lot of stuff here.

132
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:51,380
Well I'm going to do you find out is log the valley of city name

133
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,810
so city name don't get text

134
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:10,510
it's too strong to convert it to a string.

135
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:14,310
OK so we're not actually using our download task at all.

136
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:21,440
But I just want to see make sure everything looks OK on the emulator screen and then make sure it's

137
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,530
all connected up.

138
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:29,340
And when we tap the button we should find whatever the user has typed in the city name in the locks

139
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:32,820
right.

140
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:38,850
Let's see now I actually got a crash than I thought I'd leave it in just to show you.

141
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:43,570
We've got an out of memory error.

142
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:47,390
Now if you have a think about what could be causing that we haven't done a lot here but we have just

143
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:54,650
imported this quite large image so I suspect the problem is that our image is too big.

144
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:56,030
So in

145
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:09,300
your Mac as an easy way to resize images so you just double click on it and then Tools adjust size.

146
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:11,620
And yeah this is a lot bigger than what we need.

147
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:13,640
So let's try and reduce it to

148
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,800
maybe 500 pixels.

149
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,110
Now 21 kilobytes rather than 336.

150
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:28,260
So that should make it rather more manageable.

151
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:40,580
I don't know an easy way to resize images on Windows I'm afraid but a quick google on that should get

152
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,980
you should get you a way of doing it.

153
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:48,220
So fingers crossed we shouldn't get that crash this time

154
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,350
and then again I like the look of our app.

155
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:59,480
So let's just give it a shot.

156
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:04,360
And what's the weather.

157
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:10,570
And all we want is to see London somewhere down here.

158
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:11,590
There it is.

159
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,890
Fantastic.

160
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,590
So it's all working as far as we expect.

161
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:24,130
All that remains is to actually get the weather for that particular location.

162
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:30,310
So we might as well copy and paste the commands that do it

163
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:40,020
say they are here.

164
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:50,300
So now the only difference of course is that instead of London we want whatever the user has typed so

165
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,250
let's have in

166
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,240
City Name that we get.

167
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:06,990
So that should print the information to the logs from the Jason.

168
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:09,210
So let's check that.

169
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,910
Now you can start seeing hopefully where all these exceptions might come in useful because we're allowing

170
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:17,540
the user to edit essentially how you are l string here.

171
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:23,000
So that could really go horribly wrong if they either don't edit or anything at all or if they end to

172
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,030
something that's not going to allow this to be a valid you are l then we don't want our app to crash.

173
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,300
We just want to give them a message.

174
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:44,280
And of course we mustn't forget to set the permissions in the manifest every guy and race knows what

175
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,780
we want now.

176
00:15:48,510 --> 00:16:01,050
So now we should find that we can log the weather of any city we like here we can't say let's try

177
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,560
Shanghai What's the weather.

178
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,580
OK let's take a look.

179
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,610
Fantastic.

180
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:21,190
So there's our main content and we've got clouds a few clouds.

181
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:24,270
That's that's all we've got about this particular weather.

182
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,070
It's quite brief.

183
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,400
This is.

184
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:28,810
But that's fine.

185
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:38,280
So now all we need to do is make sure that the weather is updated on the app itself rather than just

186
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,750
in the locks which isn't particularly useful.

187
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:46,980
So let's just jump back over the activity main and

188
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:54,580
check the ID text V-2 isn't great.

189
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:58,930
I'll call it results text for you.

190
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:07,190
And while we're here let's just get rid of the default text because we don't want any default text to

191
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,290
appear.

192
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:12,630
And then

193
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,560
we want a text view.

194
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:23,780
I've already forgotten what I just called it's text fi

195
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:34,300
and we'll find it here.

196
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:41,890
You

197
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,990
and we're going to find it using it Heidi.

198
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:54,860
All I'll say is ideas and results next few.

199
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,640
I do prefer space and

200
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:00,970
OK.

201
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:12,220
Now remember I said that in the on post execute method we can interact with the user interface.

202
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,900
So it's up to you how you want to actually display this information.

203
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:28,930
But what I'm going to do is create a string Maine which will initially be empty and the string description

204
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:43,740
which will initially be empty and then obviously I'm going to set mine to be the main part of the J-Zone

205
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:56,440
and then description to be the description part and then I'm just going to test to see if mine is not

206
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,270
an empty string and description

207
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:07,120
is not an empty string.

208
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:13,960
That means that we have a type or a mine and a description.

209
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:18,940
So if that's the case we can update our message string.

210
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:25,900
Which means we're going to need a message string.

211
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,820
So we'll set that initially empty up there.

212
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,680
So it sent a message

213
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:46,680
to have appended to its main and then I'm going to have a colon and a space and then the description

214
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:56,430
and then I want a new line and to do new lines I think we've seen before.

215
00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:01,680
We use backslash or backslash and for a line break.

216
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:09,710
So this will give us a new line at the end of this bit of code which will have the type.

217
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,020
So that is rain or drizzle or whatever.

218
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:21,180
And then the description and then finally when we've looped through all of that we'll check if message

219
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:28,570
is not empty non-empty string.

220
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,560
Then we'll update

221
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:38,430
the result textfield with it.

222
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,240
Result

223
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:49,410
text the set text and then message

224
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,940
OK let's just have a quick look at that

225
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:05,830
and see if it works.

226
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,800
So let's try

227
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:16,690
Paris this time.

228
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,200
What's the weather.

229
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:21,830
And you can see we're in a fun situation here.

230
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:26,090
We can see the result whether or not it's worked because the keyboard is in the way.

231
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:35,760
So we need a way to remove the keyboard as soon as the button is tapped and we can do that and Android

232
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,090
fairly shortly although it's not that simple.

233
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:52,680
We need to create a variable of a type input method manager and we'll call that mjr short for manager.

234
00:21:52,680 --> 00:22:01,230
And this is going to be an input method manager and we're going to get it from this time get system

235
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:12,600
service and the system service that we want to get is context Daut input method service.

236
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:20,850
So this gets the input method service that our app is currently using which is the keyboard.

237
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:31,680
And then we want to take that manager and use it to high eat soft input from window which does what

238
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,970
it says on the tin.

239
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:40,260
And then we just need to specify the window which we get from the name of the added text that we're

240
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,520
currently in.

241
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:48,180
So a city name and then don't get window token.

242
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:50,370
So that tells us which window.

243
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:57,450
And then we put a comma 0 because there are various other options or flags that we can put there if

244
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:00,260
we want but you probably won't ever use those.

245
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:04,610
So we'll just put comments there to hide the keyboard in the normal way.

246
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:07,990
Right.

247
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,230
So that's a very good skill to be able to hide the keyboard when you want to.

248
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:15,880
Usually it's when a button has been tapped.

249
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,360
Let's take a look now.

250
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:22,930
OK.

251
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,740
So I'm going to try again with Paris.

252
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,990
What's the weather.

253
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,060
There we go.

254
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:35,680
So it's not the fullest error message or not the fullest weather description as we see.

255
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,040
But it's what we've got.

256
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:43,250
I suspect if you have a look at the open weather map API in more detail we can get more detailed sort

257
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:48,160
of weather or just a general overall weather description.

258
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:48,520
OK.

259
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:49,480
So we're nearly there.

260
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,860
We just have

261
00:23:54,410 --> 00:24:02,720
one thing that I'd like to deal with and that's what happens if the user into something empty or something

262
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:05,090
which isn't a city.

263
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,250
And the answer is nothing which is fine at least.

264
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:12,100
The app doesn't crash.

265
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,640
And the reason it doesn't crash is because we've got all our exceptions and driving catches everywhere.

266
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:22,770
But it would be nice to give a message to the user if that fails.

267
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:35,880
So I'm going to just add that feature in to add a toast to the user in case of exceptions.

268
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:44,130
So I'll have toast make text

269
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,210
and then get

270
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:54,190
application context.

271
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,600
And so here will say

272
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,900
could not find whether

273
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:12,960
And then we'll have just toast length long.

274
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,860
So you can get a more detailed error message in there.

275
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:18,310
I feel like I'm just keeping it very simple here.

276
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:26,350
And so that will occur if they enter something that's not a valid you are el

277
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:36,100
or if that data connection isn't connected but there's also a possibility that we won't be able to get

278
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,350
anything from the Jason.

279
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:42,990
So I'm going to add another message that I'm just going to leave the message at the same thing.

280
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:47,740
But again you might want to have a different error message there or if we actually get an error with

281
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:53,410
the Jason that we'll need an error message as well.

282
00:25:53,410 --> 00:26:01,310
And finally what about cities that have spaces in their names or strange characters if we trumpet's

283
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:08,290
say San Francisco in that we'll currently give us an error because they won't be able to create the

284
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:12,840
U R L string because it has a space in it.

285
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:21,660
So what we'll do is we'll include it as a u r l and I'll show you what I mean by that.

286
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:23,470
So it will create a string

287
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:32,760
encoded city name which we're going to get from

288
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:44,380
that but we're going to use a u r l encoder.

289
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:45,150
Whoops

290
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:51,170
to encode it

291
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:01,330
and the usual format is UTF 8

292
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:10,420
and there's a possibility that will fail.

293
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:17,440
So once again we'll put it around try and catch and I'll pop these

294
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:32,000
in try and I'll just add the error message again to the catch.

295
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:40,350
And then we can put encoded city name in there.

296
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:41,050
All right.

297
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,110
Well of compiling.

298
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:45,870
I'll just show you what we're doing then.

299
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:53,140
So this is the u r l that we have when we don't need to come a UK at the end when we got something without

300
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,610
a space in like London.

301
00:27:54,850 --> 00:28:02,740
If I try and put San Francisco in there and see what happens you can see it converts it to 7 percent

302
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:10,200
20 Francisco and put that percent 20 is an encoded space and it's encoded in a format that you are or

303
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,640
else can read.

304
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:19,580
So the API open weather map will be expecting 7 percent 20 Francisco rather than Sun spites Francisco.

305
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:20,620
And that's what

306
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:24,750
this encoding will do.

307
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:30,980
So it will replace any strange characters like spaces or apostrophe's or anything like that with you

308
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:33,680
are el equivalent.

309
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:38,240
So let's just check for now put in San

310
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:44,260
Francis.

311
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,730
There it is.

312
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:46,980
What's the weather.

313
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,800
And apparently it's misty.

314
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,230
OK.

315
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:50,820
Great.

316
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:56,710
So that is our What's the weather app which can now cope with spaces in names as well.

317
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:58,650
And that takes us to the end of this section.

318
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:01,210
So congratulations for making it this far.

319
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:04,320
We'll see what we've covered in the next lecture.

320
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,910
For now give yourself a pat on the back.

321
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,960
Go have a cup of tea before getting ready to weps with maps and locations in Section 7.
