1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:07,160
Now that we're all set up with firebase we're going to add the Google AdMob modules and set ourselves

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:15,170
up to show that within our app while it is possible to use AdMob without firebase they are now strongly

3
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:22,400
integrated and with firebase you get a lot of analytics which will tell you how well your ads are doing

4
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:26,010
and how you might make them more effective.

5
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:35,120
So to find out how to add them I would just do a quick Google search for something like AdMob Android

6
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:43,590
firebase and that should get you an introduction.

7
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:49,130
So I'd go for the QuickStart link that make sure the link they are going into is five based on Google

8
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:52,020
dot com rather than firebase dot com itself.

9
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:59,690
Otherwise you'll probably be looking at old documentation sort of scrolling down here.

10
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,880
See we need to start by integrating firebase and the mobile apps software development kits.

11
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,860
So we've already integrated firebase.

12
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,900
So now let's add in the x component.

13
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,100
So I'm just going to copy that over

14
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:21,570
and paste it in to help build the graded file

15
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:36,830
that we get and next for quite a few of the changes that we need to make.

16
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,590
But but just before we do will rethink

17
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:47,750
our cradle files that will bring in the firebase module.

18
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,720
Well that's going that's open.

19
00:01:51,730 --> 00:02:00,880
Our main activity Java file and we'll get rid of the database code that we're no longer going to be

20
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,590
using and we'll add the next steps.

21
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:10,930
So first off we need to add the banner ID.

22
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:14,400
Now this one here is just a demo banner ID.

23
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:20,250
If you want to create your own banner ad ID you'll need an AdMob account.

24
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:34,440
And you can get one of those at apps dot AdMob dot com but it is a reasonably lengthy sign up process.

25
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:37,640
So I'm not going to guide you through the whole process here.

26
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,690
It's really straightforward because that's say quite lengthy.

27
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:45,000
You need to put in bank details and company details et cetera.

28
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:50,010
So go through that when you're ready to add a real ad.

29
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:59,330
But for now we'll just put in the test one and we'll do that down and strings direct Semmel where we

30
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:06,230
can store various important strings for our app.

31
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,820
So I'm going to paste that in there.

32
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:16,750
And this is going to be a banner ad unit ID and we can access that from anywhere within the app.

33
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,860
So getting back to our Atmore Quickstart Guide

34
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:37,560
we now need to place an ad in our activity out and also allow layout to access the ads schema so we

35
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:44,360
do that in lay out activity main as usual.

36
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:57,020
And then we'll add in the schema to the relative lay out we say and then we'll head back

37
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:03,920
and copy the options for our advantage.

38
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:13,410
Get rid of the text you them and replace it with the ADD V

39
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:24,640
so you can see it imported the unit ID there from the banner ad unit ID string variable.

40
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,650
And we've got some various lÃº guides there of course if you want to change the size or position of the

41
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:29,030
add.

42
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,830
Then you just change those in the usual way.

43
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:37,700
All right.

44
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,390
So we're nearly there.

45
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:47,260
We now need to initialize mobile ads within our app.

46
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,840
I'm going to copy that Kate into the main activity Java

47
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:05,820
and then old Enza will bring in the mobile apps module for us.

48
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:10,290
Okay.

49
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:10,890
And then

50
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,660
we need to set up our ad

51
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,180
using this card here.

52
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:28,080
So just pasting them as you can see we're creating an ad view called an ad view which we find it by

53
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,810
its ID.

54
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,530
So the ideas add value.

55
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,750
Obviously you can change that if you want.

56
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:38,110
That was created here when we pasted the code for the app view in

57
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:50,230
then we create an ad request which gets sent out for us and then we load the request in the AM and view

58
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,110
the ad view itself.

59
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:53,980
All right.

60
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:54,740
And that should do it.

61
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,600
So now let's just run it on the simulator.

62
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:05,250
And we should see our ad displayed at the bottom of the screen and there we go.

63
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:09,080
You can see they test displaying at the bottom of the screen there.

64
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:14,070
So it's a symbol of that to display ads within your app.

65
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:20,050
We're now going to go on and look at a great way of increasing engagement and interactivity with your

66
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:23,190
app and that's with introducing notifications.
