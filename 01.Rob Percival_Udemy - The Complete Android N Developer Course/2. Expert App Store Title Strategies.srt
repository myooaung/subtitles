1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:08,760
A good title is crucial if you don't optimize your title and you can forget about a good ranking on

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,040
an AppStore.

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:16,550
Unfortunately there is so much confusing information about this around the web.

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:22,980
It can be hard to figure out what is good practice and what isn't having a key word in your title can

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:32,470
improve your apps search ranking for that key word by an average of ten point three percent for IO apps.

6
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:38,290
There are actually two names associated with every iOS app.

7
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:41,330
The first one is called the app name.

8
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:46,000
It has a maximum length of 255 characters.

9
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:51,600
The app store product page will display about 75 characters or less.

10
00:00:51,720 --> 00:01:00,140
And keep in mind that the App Store search results on people's iPhones will show 35 characters or less.

11
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:04,450
The second is known as the bundle display name.

12
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:12,630
This is the name that appears under your app icon on the home screen of an iPhone iPod or iPad.

13
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:17,870
Here you don't need to worry about this name for ASIO purposes.

14
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:28,460
This will show only 12 to 14 characters for Android Google Play app titles have 35 characters allowed.

15
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,420
This makes it much harder to squeeze in your key word.

16
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:40,980
Compared to Apple for both what you need to know is make sure you put the essential key words in the

17
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,220
beginning.

18
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,450
Don't use names that are already in use.

19
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:50,860
It won't win you more downloads if you use the name of a popular app.

20
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,370
It will simply mean you get lost in the crowd.

21
00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:01,170
Make sure your app name is short easy to spell and easy to remember.

22
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:05,710
Try to reflect the nature of your app in its name.

23
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,480
You don't want users to get confused.

24
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,240
Always split.

25
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,160
Test your apps title.

26
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,540
OK I'll see you in the next lecture.
