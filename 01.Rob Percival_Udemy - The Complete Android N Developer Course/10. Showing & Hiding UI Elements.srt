1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:06,880
In this video then we're going to see how to show and hide user interface elements with our code.

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,890
I'm going to do this slightly differently to use you.

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:14,400
And for once I'm going to try not to teach you anything at all so I'm going to suggest that you go to

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,320
Google and figure out how to do this.

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,060
It really is not that tricky.

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:23,700
And then what I want to end up with is an app with two buttons one saying show and one saying height

7
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,690
and then a text label it doesn't matter what it is.

8
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:33,610
That of course when you tap hide it hides when you type show it shows.

9
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,840
Simple as that.

10
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,330
And I want you to make the whole thing yourself without me telling you how to do it.

11
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,040
Best of luck.

12
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:40,830
Go for it.

13
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:48,430
Did you manage it.

14
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,850
I do apologize if you feel that I'm getting you to do things that you don't know how to do.

15
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:55,250
But here's how easy it would have been.

16
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,380
I would expect you to search for something like Android.

17
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:06,860
Show Hide UI elements which is indeed the title of this video and that very top result there how can

18
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:11,560
I hide show an element when a button is presumably clicked or press Yep.

19
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,900
Perfect.

20
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,770
Then we have a little look there and we see.

21
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:20,250
Interesting so I don't really care about this table layout stuff but this set.

22
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,430
Visibility sounds perfect.

23
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:24,030
So that was it.

24
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:29,180
That's the only new bit of code which was very easily find a ball by Google.

25
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,040
Obviously I'm not doing this because I want to be lazy and to force you to work everything out for yourself

26
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:41,110
but I'm doing it because I want you to see how easy it is to learn new things completely on your own.

27
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,970
And of course at some point you're going to get to the end of this course and there's going to be a

28
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,490
bunch of new things that you still want to learn.

29
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:52,670
So learning this technique of what to search for what to look for going online and finding the answer

30
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,950
to your problems is very very important.

31
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,020
It also helps when debugging.

32
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:06,540
So now that we've seen that let's create application sharing and hiding UI elements.

33
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:20,310
And then all we need to do is create our two buttons and I'm going to use the default text that appears

34
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:26,680
there as my element to show and hide.

35
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,630
So it should be fairly straightforward.

36
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:41,120
Here we get sort of caught Hello World them double click to see the ID.

37
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,470
It's my only text view so I'm just going to call it text.

38
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:52,930
And then we're dragging two buttons.

39
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:59,740
So that first one is going to be show with an ID of show button

40
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:17,650
and you will update all of those and then hide it and we'll give it an ID of Hide button every guy.

41
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,580
Then we just need to set the own clicks.

42
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:23,620
Hyde

43
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:34,220
is going to be hide and show he's going to be show.

44
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,270
All right.

45
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:39,880
So now what we need to be is set up

46
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,690
reference to the label.

47
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:49,150
Now we're going to need to access that from other methods.

48
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:53,200
So let's set it up here first off is going to be a text

49
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,060
and it's called textfield

50
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:06,940
and then we find it down him so text free.

51
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,810
His equals a text free

52
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:23,340
find view by id Artaud ID dot text view.

53
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:29,660
OK then we just need to create our methods for the buttons.

54
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:36,810
So public Foyt show

55
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:46,900
it's called by the view.

56
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,940
So we need to be ready to accept that

57
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,510
the framework for a view and then we just need to take a text view.

58
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:05,200
And just in case you've forgotten what the code was it was set visibility and then viewed or visible

59
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:21,630
so set visibility few dot visible Exham sounds promising.

60
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:29,800
And then public voit hide exactly the same.

61
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:40,100
Well the text VI don't set visibility I don't think we need to google this separately.

62
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:49,870
Few dot invisible seems like it would be the code to make it invisible right.

63
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,970
So let's just check that.

64
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:59,440
Make sure it's behaving as we want it to.

65
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:07,350
We use the same device we use for the time app.

66
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:07,860
There we go.

67
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:14,400
So if we stay on the top hide first to do something and show hide show wonderful.

68
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,690
Simple as that.

69
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,750
I hope you did manage to figure it out using a bit of Google X to get to make a fairly substantial app

70
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,500
is going to be our brain train app.
