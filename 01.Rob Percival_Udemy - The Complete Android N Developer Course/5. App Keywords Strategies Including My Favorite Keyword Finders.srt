1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:05,280
Now we're going to discuss apt key strategies.

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,230
OK.

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:11,590
This only applies to iOS at this time in iTunes.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:19,210
They give you a field to include your key words you would like to rank for you have only 100 characters

5
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:25,710
a space under key words at the time I prepared the section of the course.

6
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:30,520
Google Play does not even ask the app developer for keywords.

7
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:37,140
They prefer to have people solely rely on your app title and app description instead.

8
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:43,420
However if they do in the future this section should help Android developers.

9
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:50,500
This part of ASIO is super important so be careful here and think hard.

10
00:00:50,500 --> 00:01:00,950
Now I recommend using a service such as a mobile DV headquarters to help you track your search rankings.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,400
Choose better key words analyze your existing keywords and spy on your competitors.

12
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:18,150
Another ASIO tool I suggest you use is called sensor Tower today finding single key words is going to

13
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,450
be a tough task to say the least.

14
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:29,520
So what I would highly recommend is start finding key word phrases or even longtail key words which

15
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:37,020
will help more people find your app and put your app in a less competitive environment.

16
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:45,780
Using keyword phrases will help you are ranking and giving you more exposure using relevant keywords

17
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,050
for your app in-app purchases.

18
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:56,900
I bet you didn't know that the app store actually indexes your key words you use for your in-app purchases.

19
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,870
Crazy I know but it's true.

20
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,710
So start using search friendly keywords that will help bring you more downloads.

21
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:14,610
Just don't use generic keywords such as full access or unlimited gems etc..

22
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,120
Now for Android.

23
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:23,700
Make sure you use your primary or most important key word you want to rank for in your apps title and

24
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,490
then mention your key words up to five times.

25
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,840
Only in your apps description.

26
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:38,430
It's been proven that mentioning your key word over five times has no effect in AppStore ranking.

27
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,970
Here are a few solid tips.

28
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:45,630
Use single words rather than multiple word phrases.

29
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:52,350
Mention your primary key word or key word phrase three to six times in your description and make it

30
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,160
look natural.

31
00:02:54,210 --> 00:03:01,510
Research your competitors keywords and go for ones that are untapped and less competitive.

32
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:08,490
Don't repeat words used in the title put key words in priority order.

33
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:15,990
Keep playing with your key words the ones that do not convert now might convert in the future as your

34
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:18,440
app becomes more popular.

35
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:21,070
Separate keywords with commas.

36
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,660
Don't use spaces.

37
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:27,050
Be sure to check the recommended links below.

38
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,350
Ok I'll see you in the next lecture.
