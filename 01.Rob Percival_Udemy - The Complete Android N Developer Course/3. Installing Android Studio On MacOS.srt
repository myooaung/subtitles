00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:05,350
In this video I'm going to show you how to download and install Android studio on Mac OS.

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,560
So if you're running Windows then you need to jump straight to the next video.

3
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:10,700
Still.

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:15,920
And your studio is the only piece of software that you need for this course.

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:23,040
It includes both a coding environment and a simulator so that you can run Android apps on emulated devices

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:29,980
phones and smart watches right there on your machine to download it just go to developer dot Android

7
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:35,990
dot come Ford slash studio and then click the big green button to download Android studio

8
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:47,320
then click to agree that you've read the Terms and Conditions click the big button and then it will

9
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,040
download and voice studio for you.

10
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,850
It's quite a big file.

11
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,710
So you might want to go make a cup of tea while you're waiting for it to download while it's downloading.

12
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:02,020
I'll let you know a quick bit of good news and that is this version of I studio you don't need to download

13
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,260
and install Java separately.

14
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:07,860
You can just download Android studio itself and that's it.

15
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:16,780
Java comes pre-installed within Android itself and that's now downloaded so I can open up the DMG file

16
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,210
just by tapping on it then.

17
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:24,730
And then once that's extracted you'll get to a screen like this and you just drag Android studio into

18
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:25,960
applications.
