who are actually looking for apps similar to yours is by creating a mobile search campaign.

3
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:25.320
Aside from using a different ad type this type of campaign is similar to search campaigns directing

4
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.160
traffic to your website within the search campaign.

Making it simple for users who click the ad to download remember app promotion ads are much smarter

12
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.920
than your average ad Android app.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:25.780
