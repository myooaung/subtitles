00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.210
OK let's talk about which platform should you consider first.

2
00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:16.020
Here we have the Android platform which has caught up and surpassed users and developers over the iOS

3
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.300
platform.

4
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:26.430
Believe it or not I believe developers once they saw the Android platform surpassed Apple users it was

5
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.300
a no brainer.

6
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:34.930
Plus in the past with Android developers they didn't have to go through a review process.

7
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:42.590
Unlike Apple they simply uploaded their app any time they wanted.

8
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.800
That was the big advantage Android had over Apple.

9
00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.520
Anybody can upload a piece of crap and it may or may not sell

10
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.250
update here.

11
00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:04.730
Google Play now uses both an automated and human reviewers to review all Android apps.

12
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.580
This process started approximately in January 2015.

13
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:17.110
Many app developers didn't even notice any slowdown but the word is now.

14
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:23.570
Gone are the days when you could upload your app without it being reviewed.

15
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:31.460
The automated process sifts through looking for viruses and other bad things one shouldn't have on the

16
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.030
app such as bugs or glitches.

17
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.450
Now Google Play has human reviewers in place to increase quality assurance.

18
00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.730
A human reviewer will only jump in to give the app a closer look.

19
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:56.540
When the automated process sends up a red flag if your app is Android then you have several app stores

20
00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:02.200
to add your app to of which I'll list for you a bit later.

21
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:11.540
Now the biggest decision you have to make or the deciding factor of which door you place your app in

22
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.850
is how you are making money.

23
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:24.470
If your app primarily makes you money from showing ads then you can place your app on every Android

24
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.440
app store on the planet.

25
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:35.780
If your app makes the majority of its money from selling in-app purchases then you need to set up an

26
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.100
app billing differently for each Android app store.

27
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.240
The one caveat or warning I have for you.

28
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:54.110
If you place a version of your app on all of these different Android app stores is beware of when you

29
00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.680
have an update.

30
00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.010
Now you have to make up the time management.

31
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:08.300
It costs you to update several versions of your one app with Apple.

32
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:16.420
The developer normally waits anywhere from 1 to four weeks until it goes through a rigorous review process

33
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:23.790
which might get your app disapprove the number of times until the problem gets fixed.

34
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:30.970
It typically takes eight days on average for an I O S approval these days for those that worry about

35
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.830
receiving bad reviews on the Google Play app store.

36
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.930
The remedy for that was quite easy.

37
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:45.510
You could easily remove the app rename it and poof there goes all the bad reviews.

38
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:51.850
This way you can improve your app very quickly whereas you would have to wait to go through Apple's

39
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:58.450
stringent long review process with each and every update.

40
00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:06.880
Please note that Apple's first review of your app takes the longest compare to any future updates once

41
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.600
your app gets approved of course.

42
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:17.980
My advice here is to still start on Android platform first because you can quickly get feedback from

43
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:27.040
your users and fix the problems with a faster review process versus Apple's review process.

44
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:35.200
Then when everything is fine and the feedback becomes positive to your satisfaction then go to Apple

45
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.740
with that updated fix version and upload it to iTunes App Store for review.

46
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:47.710
For those that want to put on a show and have a huge promotion then Apple is probably the way you want

47
00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:57.730
to start out with lastly but to make the most money for your app today you want to be on both platforms

48
00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.470
today.
