1
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:06,890
That very quickly before we look at working with text views I just want to show you how to open up the

2
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:09,630
sample projects that come with this course.

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,440
Essentially there are two ways to do it.

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:18,800
So if I start by closing down the current project which I'll just do by file closed project

5
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,360
so you can see what taken back to the under studio menu.

6
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,270
Now with a quick link to the app that we created.

7
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:31,640
But if we didn't have that quick link then I wanted to open an existing project.

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:37,760
I would just click that option and then find the project i.e. find the sample project that you've downloaded

9
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:46,640
and then I know it's an android studio projects and then if you've downloaded the project and unzipped

10
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,450
it it should appear right there with the name of the app and then you just click OK.

11
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,950
And that will open up the project for you.

12
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:00,030
The other way to do it is to find the file that you've just downloaded.

13
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:12,290
So in my case it's in Android studio projects and then open up the folder and double click on the build

14
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:20,010
dot cradle file and that will then allow you to essentially import the project from the cradle file

15
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:27,200
which essentially just creates the Android studio project for you to work with.

16
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,390
The first option opening from Andrews studio is a little bit faster.

17
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,180
So I'd recommend going for that one over the second but either will work absolutely fine.

18
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,330
So here we are back in our projects it's likely that when you open it up you'll see this big blank screen.

19
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:52,500
So you need to bring in project and then open up the app structure to get at whichever file you want

20
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,640
to get it.

21
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:57,720
To see how the appliques.

22
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,280
All right.

23
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:03,800
So that's how we open and work with the sample projects and with Andres Judaea projects in general in

24
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:04,300
the next video.

25
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:09,950
We'll see how to work with next few widgets and customize them to our desire.

26
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,150
So you.
