1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,980
Now they going to look in more detail at our first widget the text view.

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:11,060
So we can see it right there both in the componentry and in the app preview.

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:17,760
That is the text view that we're given by default in this absolute zoom in and see it in a bit more

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,140
detail.

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:27,510
So hello world is a standard starting point for all new apps and new app developers.

6
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:33,200
But let's customize that a little bit so we can start by just double clicking on it and you can see

7
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,550
we're then given the option to change the text and change the ID if we want to.

8
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,460
So just to try it out.

9
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,080
I'll change the text too.

10
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,190
Hello Rob and the ID.

11
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:50,790
We don't actually need at this point but we will need it later on to be able to refer to this text view

12
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,730
in our code and maybe change it or make it appear or disappear or bigger or smaller or whatever we want

13
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:56,910
to do to it.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,330
So

15
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:08,180
I'll call it Hello Rob text for you for now and then you can see that update straight away.

16
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:17,580
And let's just have a quick run of the app will choose our emulator that I've created a couple of years

17
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:25,670
ago just to make sure that the change that we've made here is reflected in the app itself.

18
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:28,470
And there we go that has updated.

19
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:34,860
I've also got a message that instant run has been applied to the current activity instant run is a new

20
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:40,620
feature in Android Studio 2 which makes changes to your app much much quicker.

21
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:46,110
So if for example I wanted to change this to Halo.

22
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,940
Dave you can then see that the play symbol has got a little lightning next to it.

23
00:01:53,250 --> 00:02:01,890
And if I then click that and go back to the emulator then it's not exactly instant but it's pretty quick.

24
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:08,730
And what happens is just that activity is updated and restarted which means that when you're testing

25
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:13,950
around playing with an app you don't have to relaunch the whole app waiting 30 seconds or so for the

26
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,330
app to update.

27
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,240
So it's really great for experimenting and tinkering.

28
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:23,690
Although if you make major changes to your app it will in many cases have to do the full relaunch.

29
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:30,980
But for now this will definitely save us a lot of time as we're experimenting with text views.

30
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:38,130
So for now I'm going to hide the log area at the bottom because we don't really need it.

31
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:41,120
And let's zoom out a little bit.

32
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:41,840
All right.

33
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:48,260
So let's just first see how we can add a new text view if we want to.

34
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,830
So we just drag it in from the left hand side and then you can see as we drag it around we're given

35
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,570
various options.

36
00:02:55,450 --> 00:03:00,160
You may remember I mentioned a relative lay out a couple of years ago and this is what we're working

37
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:00,590
with.

38
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,310
So we're dragging it in to our relatively out.

39
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:10,960
So for example if I laid it there that would be aligned to the parent which is the dotted orange box

40
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,260
around the edge there on the left and it will be

41
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,550
aligned below the Hello Dave label.

42
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:28,170
So if I now drag Hello Dave down then the new text is dragged down with it.

43
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,030
I'm going to use commands had to undo that.

44
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:35,890
Take it back to where we were before and the commands that again to get rid of in a text view.

45
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:41,890
And let's just drag it in again and just see what the options are I'm just spend a bit of time messing

46
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:45,840
around with this so we can align it to the top right for example.

47
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:52,870
So that is the top and right of the parent I in this case the relative lay out the container.

48
00:03:53,160 --> 00:04:00,260
I drag it down a bit then that's aligned to the top of the hello Rob text view.

49
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,650
Or it could be a line to the bottom of the Hallard subtext V.

50
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:08,700
Or I can center it in the middle I can center it vertically as well.

51
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,070
Etc. etc..

52
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:15,890
So this is now centered in the middle of the activity.

53
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:26,280
And if I switch for example to a Nexus 10 tablet view then it's still centered.

54
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,580
In the middle of the screen.

55
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:38,820
So actually that makes making apps for different screen size is pretty straightforward because you know

56
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:43,740
if it's centered in this way it's going to be centered on every device.

57
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:55,450
So that's very simply how we can change the layout of our app when we're dragging in new widgets.

58
00:04:55,470 --> 00:05:00,790
We'll see that a much more detail later on as we build more complex layouts.

59
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,660
For now they get rid of that textfield and go back to how.

60
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,670
Hello Dave as it is now and when you want to customize a widget its This properties area.

61
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,560
They are going to be spending most of your time.

62
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,700
So I'm not going to go into these in massive detail as you can see there's lots of them but I'll just

63
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,200
pick out the most important ones for now.

64
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:26,880
So with first of all this is the width of the whole of the text view.

65
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:31,460
So at the moment wrap content is just the width of the content.

66
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:39,660
But I could change it to for example Phil the parent and that would then fill the relative layout which

67
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,310
is the parent for this text view.

68
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:47,480
Same with the height I can use fill parent or match parent.

69
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:53,880
In this case that the same thing because there are no other elements in the relative layout which is

70
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,940
the parent for our text view.

71
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:03,030
So now got a very big text view as you can see that's the same but I'll get back to rap content which

72
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,340
is usually what you're going to want for a text view.

73
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,930
We can add in margins if we want.

74
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:19,400
So for example I could add a margin of 10 DP and you can see that's now moved it to the right and down.

75
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,280
It's worth getting clear.

76
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:29,670
What I dp is a DP issue for density independent pixel and the DP is essentially one one sixteenth of

77
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:30,490
an inch.

78
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:37,100
So 160 DP is of roughly one inch on any Android device.

79
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:42,990
So when you are designing your layouts DP is almost always the best option to use if for some reason

80
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:45,110
you need to be extremely precise.

81
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:53,070
You can use p x for pixels but that's generally quite a bad idea because it won't scale well on different

82
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:53,930
devices.

83
00:06:54,330 --> 00:07:00,040
So UDP for almost all measurements except for the exception that we'll see in a moment.

84
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:07,320
Now with margins of course we could set the mood to 10 DP or we could for some reason set the left margin

85
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:11,000
to 30 and the top margin to 60.

86
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,210
You can see that you get that effect there.

87
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:22,510
And again let's just remind ourselves that we can use the lightning refresh to see that in action and

88
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,310
there we get that's happened.

89
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,570
Nice and quickly.

90
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:35,250
OK so looking back on the text view here you can change the alignment of the text.

91
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:41,290
That's a reasonably straight forward so I'm not going to look at that in much detail now but it's worth

92
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,380
looking at the style here.

93
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:52,120
So we can pick a particular style or we can click on the menu to the three dots then to pick one of

94
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:57,230
the many many styles that comes with the theme that we're working with.

95
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:02,560
So you can see there's loads of different styles there and that will just bring in a bunch of different

96
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,230
sizes colors.

97
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,000
In some cases margins and layouts as well.

98
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:14,010
So again feel free to experiment with that.

99
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:23,160
For example if I just go for a large then that will set a bunch of those styles for me.

100
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:29,330
And there's a big advantage to doing that because that means that specific devices can set appropriate

101
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,310
settings for those styles.

102
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:36,560
You're letting the device choose how your app displays which is often a good idea because it means your

103
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:42,500
app will display well on that device but sometimes you might want to be very specific about how your

104
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,270
app is styled and then you might want to specify it yourself.

105
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:49,130
Moving down we've got the alpha.

106
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:54,220
Now this is a very useful way of making your user interface elements transparent.

107
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:00,000
So if for example I put point five in as the Alphie you can see that that fades slightly.

108
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:02,680
And what is essentially doing is becoming transparent.

109
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:08,570
So if there was an image behind that I would start to see the image through the text we're using alpha

110
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:14,820
in many places in the course but we'll just leave it as the default for now.

111
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,960
Jumping now to background.

112
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:24,700
So again looking at the options in the three dots that's how I'd recommend using a background.

113
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:27,490
I can now choose from a whole range of colors.

114
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:33,450
I'll go for a sort of yellowy Mudie's sort of background.

115
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,210
And there we go.

116
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:41,880
You can see you've got a nice yellow background and it might be clearer now if I do an Alpha no point

117
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:45,890
five possibly that's now slightly yellow.

118
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,910
So that's how we set the background color.

119
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:54,390
There's some more options for the background if we want to then.

120
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,040
I'm going to jump through these ones.

121
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,260
Funt is obviously pretty useful.

122
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:07,620
It's nice to be able to choose a particular font got loads of fun.

123
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:07,990
Then

124
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,570
I'll just choose one at random.

125
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,570
It's pretty much like what I had before.

126
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,770
And gravity is essentially alignment within the elements.

127
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:33,250
So if for example I changed the with to a full width of a van the margin of course I can then change

128
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:37,590
my gravity to align to the right.

129
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:43,360
And as you can see there's various other options for gravity as well with centering filling et cetera

130
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:43,910
et cetera.

131
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:49,130
So gravity is how you align your element content within the element itself.

132
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,610
I can change the height.

133
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:59,480
We've got the ID as we saw before the various options for input which we don't really need here.

134
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:05,200
Let us speccing if there are links within it we can choose whether to make this clickable or not.

135
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,890
We've got maximum minimum heights.

136
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:12,980
We've got some padding which is much like a margin but

137
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,820
it's within the element itself.

138
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:23,200
So if you've got a background it's useful to have a little bit of padding that doesn't go all the way

139
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,370
to the edge of the element.

140
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:31,590
Various other options we can change the text from there if we want to change the text color.

141
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:37,520
So once again we click on the three dots we can change that too.

142
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:45,420
Ok so I read a bit of text and we can change the text size.

143
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:49,010
And this is the one exception that I mentioned earlier to DP.

144
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:52,740
And I'd recommend using espies for text.

145
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:59,820
So if we change this to something like 20 Espey then turns out to be a little bit smaller than the people

146
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,840
that we have them.

147
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:08,970
Now when espie is short for scale independent pixel and essentially is the same as DP but it's also

148
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:14,080
affected by the user setting for the text zoom level.

149
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:19,230
So if for example a user wants to have all of their text a little bit bigger they can set that in the

150
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:23,500
Android default settings and the espie will then be affected by that.

151
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:29,310
So again it will need your design to be a little bit more fluid but it will be more usable by the user

152
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:35,190
if they need larger text because they're visually impaired then that will be reflected in your text

153
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,140
if you use espies.

154
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:46,030
So essentially the short hand is to use DP for everything except text and then use espies for text only.

155
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:53,990
Then we've got some more options for style theme and with the bottom there as well.

156
00:12:54,210 --> 00:13:00,420
So that's a bit of a whistle stop tour and I would thoroughly recommend playing with these in a little

157
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:04,030
bit more detail and just working out how they all fit together.

158
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:09,790
For now I'm going to give you a quick challenge and that is to recreate this text for you here.

159
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:11,320
So it's centered.

160
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,840
It's got a nice bit of padding.

161
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,950
It's pretty big.

162
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:19,430
The text itself is just off black and the background is green.

163
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:23,180
So nothing too tricky that you should be able to recreate that using what we've just learned.

164
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:28,100
So I'll give you a moment to pause the video and make the text for you go for it.

165
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,240
OK.

166
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,790
I hope that went well.

167
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,190
So I'm going to start by dragging in my text.

168
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,180
And we wanted it sent it.

169
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:53,740
So I'm going to go for sintered at the top and I'll start by double clicking to change the text.

170
00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:00,920
To my great app fabulous.

171
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:07,260
And then let's start by changing the text size.

172
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:08,620
So if something

173
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:17,510
nice and big 50 espie that looks great and I'll change the text color as well

174
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:34,180
I'll go for that arc pretty much black color grates and then we won't see add in a bit of a background

175
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,460
say

176
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:46,250
that's choose the green that I suggested.

177
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,350
There we go.

178
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,300
Lovely green background.

179
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:55,170
And finally a bit of padding.

180
00:14:56,330 --> 00:15:04,120
So scroll down to padding and of course the piece for padding.

181
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,060
There we go.

182
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:10,290
So very quick exercise doesn't look beautiful obviously but it gives us an opportunity to just practice

183
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,670
the various customizations that we've just learned.

184
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:14,930
Excellent.

185
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:20,400
So that sparely thought or introductions to text vees in the next video we're going to go on and look

186
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:26,250
at Buttons and this is where we'll actually start writing some code as well and start making our apps

187
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,310
interactive.
