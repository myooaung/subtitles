1
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,960
So I'm going to create a couple more cells here and I'm going to upload a new image that we haven't

2
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,040
actually seen yet and it's an image of a gorilla.

3
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:18,080
Will say CB2 read inside your data folder where we happened to have it.

4
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:25,040
We're going to upload gorilla japanned and we're going to upload it as a greyscale and let me also just

5
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:31,700
get the display function working on the copy and paste the display function from the notebook against

6
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:32,540
the display function.

7
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,300
We've always been working off display image or display.

8
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,910
So I'm going to run that and let's display the gorilla.

9
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:48,050
So will this play gorilla run that and actually let me clarify the c map is equal to gray run that.

10
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:49,920
And so here we have this picture of a gorilla.

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,240
It's quite a large image.

12
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:58,700
If you actually check out the gorilla shape it's about 30 100 by 2000 more or less.

13
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:04,050
So what we're going to do now is calculate the histogram and then we will equalize the histogram and

14
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:08,550
visualize the difference and that will run this again on the color version of this image.

15
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,730
So let's first do this in black and white.

16
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:14,230
What I would do is just calculate the histogram values here.

17
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:23,060
Say two values as for the gorilla image is Seabee to calculate just say gorilla

18
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:32,510
channels 0 because we're just focused on one channel and only has one channel greyscale.

19
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,730
We're not doing any mask.

20
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:38,570
The mask is none his size is equal to 256.

21
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:42,990
And then the range is equal to zero comma 256.

22
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:43,830
OK.

23
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,150
So this ranges.

24
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,390
There we go.

25
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:49,930
Then the next step is to simply just plot out those values.

26
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:57,480
So we will say Pulte plot just underscore values run that and there we see the actual histogram.

27
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,590
So here's the histogram on the greyscale image.

28
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:04,330
Looks like we have a lot more kind of lighter colors and then a couple of darker colors but not so much

29
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,350
pure black.

30
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:10,590
And if we take a look at the image it looks like a big chunk of those lighter colors are from the rock

31
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,600
behind this gorilla and the gorilla itself is actually pretty like color.

32
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,250
There's nothing too dark or too black maybe a little bit around that's for a little bit around here

33
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,160
on the edge.

34
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:23,500
But really you can see here there's just that little spike of dark but most of it seems to be a lighter

35
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,530
gray and it can tell just because a greyscale image.

36
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,990
Now let's show you how we could equalize the histogram.

37
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:36,700
So going to make a version of this called equalized gorilla or cube gorilla and the command is actually

38
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,690
really straightforward.

39
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:44,330
It's just you call equalize hissed and I encourage you to have auto complete that and then just pasand

40
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,710
gorilla.

41
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,300
And first off lushest display.

42
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,010
What that result looks like.

43
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,290
So I don't actually even need to calculate the color histogram to do this.

44
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:57,160
I can straight up just color on an image and then display the result.

45
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:00,860
So I noticed just how much the contrast has been increased here.

46
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,480
So when we equalize the histogram we've definitely increased the contrast.

47
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,590
Notice now that those light rays are essentially now the minimum value of 0.

48
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:13,300
And those darker values kind of around the hair for and over here on the edge Those are the max values

49
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,290
of black.

50
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:20,910
So compare these two images a lot more color depth here in gray and upon equalize in the histogram.

51
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:25,770
Now you see a much higher contrast and if you wanted to you could calculate the hyster values for that

52
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,500
equalized gorilla and display the result.

53
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:36,050
So let's go out and calculate that I going to copy and paste this command except now all passen the

54
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,910
gorilla run that an ellipse.

55
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,750
Make sure everything's OK.

56
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,030
Q underskirt gorilla.

57
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,670
There we go.

58
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:49,410
And we'll say appeal to plot his.

59
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,610
And I notice the behavior you get.

60
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:55,830
So you get these constant spikes down because there's zero value there.

61
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:00,620
But if we compare this to our original it's definitely been more flattened out.

62
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:07,340
So we can see here that we tend to kind of quickly decrease as we go past 50 and then if we come back

63
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:11,400
down here the decrease is much shallower as you go beyond 50.

64
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:15,070
So it's a much shallower drop compared to the original image here.

65
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,410
It was a much quicker drop.

66
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,330
OK.

67
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,970
So that's the difference.

68
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:24,850
And really the effect is a higher contrast and keep in mind you can actually do this exact same thing

69
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,360
for a color image.

70
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,610
So the way we do that is first going to read in the color gorilla.

71
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,140
So reading the image again except this time I was going to read it in as a color image will say CB2

72
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:40,520
read data forward slash gorilla.

73
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:46,220
And if I want to show the gorilla or create a show gorilla where it's convert it's the correct color

74
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,390
space.

75
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:56,980
So we say CB2 color pasand the color gorilla and then say color underscore BGR to r.g.

76
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,550
Display what the color version of the gorilla looks like we're going to say peel tea.

77
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:08,330
In fact we can actually just use the display function with the fine we'll say display or show gorilla.

78
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:10,830
So this is what the color version of that image looks like.

79
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,550
Here's the gorilla.

80
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:12,950
It's in full color.

81
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:17,630
If we actually want to equalize the histogram of a color image essentially increase the contrast of

82
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:25,010
a color image the way open CV works is you actually translate that first to an H S V color space.

83
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:27,860
Remember that's the hue saturation value.

84
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,020
So I mentioned earlier we really wouldn't be dealing too much of HSV.

85
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:36,030
This is one of the few instances where we do just because the way the equal ice histogram function works.

86
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:44,750
So what you will do is create an HSV version of the gorilla will say HSV is equal to CB2 and then change

87
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,400
the color space of the original color gorilla.

88
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:56,190
So we read in and we're going to change it from the default blue green red to hue saturation value.

89
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:01,670
So we have this HSV version of the gorilla and then we're going to do is grab that value channel because

90
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:04,110
the value channel is really the one we're interested in.

91
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:13,700
So we'll say HSV colon colon and the zero channel that's the hewe the one channel that's the saturation

92
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:14,850
and we're issued right now.

93
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,060
The value channel.

94
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,950
So this is going to be our value channel right here.

95
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,760
And if you check out kind of the minimax values here these are the ones that go from 2:55 to zero.

96
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:30,720
So we're going to do is we're going to equalize the value channel.

97
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:38,210
So I will copy and paste right here and then I'm going to set that equal to the results of CB2

98
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:44,750
equalize histogram of that particular channel.

99
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:49,630
So I'm taking that value channel equalising that value channel and then replacing the original values.

100
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,660
So we're going to run that.

101
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:56,800
And then what I'm going to do in order to display the results I'm going to convert this HSV gorilla

102
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,970
to the R.G. be that we're used to.

103
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:11,310
So we will say the equalized version of the color gorilla is equal to CB2 CVT color HSV and then we're

104
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:19,920
going to take that HSV and then convert it to color space from HSV to red green blue and now it can

105
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:24,550
display the equalized color gorilla.

106
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,920
And now we see here much higher contrast than in the original color gorilla image.

107
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:33,000
So if you come back up here we have a lot more color that seems to be a little darker.

108
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:37,010
And then when you come around here now notice the rock behind the gorilla is much brighter.

109
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:41,840
And over here on the edges it's much darker as we increase the contrast and we're able to do that simply

110
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:48,140
by just isolating that value channel in the HSV apply equalize hissed and replacing those original values

111
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:51,350
with the equalize histogram version and then converting it.

112
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:56,390
This is just for display purposes to R G B and then we have our high contrast gorilla.

113
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,110
OK.

114
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:02,330
So in this lecture we learn how to equalize histograms to create higher contrast images as well as how

115
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:08,080
to apply masks to only calculate the color histogram for a particular section of an image.

116
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,240
That ends our discussion with histograms.

117
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,750
We will see you at the next lecture.
