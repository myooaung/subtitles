1
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,530
Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,600
In part one of this lecture we're going to begin by talking about how you can actually draw on images.

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:16,410
So to start off with a couple of shapes such as rectangles and circles and they'll move on to things

4
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,600
like drawing text onto an image.

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,790
Let's get started by opening up a new notebook.

6
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,340
Laurie here I am at a new notebook.

7
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:28,010
We're going to start off with what is going to quickly become the basic imports we do every time and

8
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:28,970
that's going to be important.

9
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:36,110
Two important umpires and pee and then Matt plotless that pipeline's Pulte and stating my live in line.

10
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:43,280
Next we're going to say is create a blank image and the blank image is going to be the zeros.

11
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:51,700
And we're going to give it a simple shape of 512 loops by 512 and they're going to give it three color

12
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:59,470
channels and we're also going to specify that the data type for the type is equal to N P dot integer

13
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,540
16 bit.

14
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,820
So I N T 16.

15
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:04,060
OK.

16
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:05,920
So let's go ahead and check that out.

17
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,760
We're going to say Blinkx image.

18
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,780
The shape is five fold but five top three that 512.

19
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,600
That's just an arbitrary choice here.

20
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,310
So it's kind of small enough to show.

21
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,440
So when I say PTM show let's go ahead and show our blank image.

22
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:22,700
And as we suspect because everything is colored 0.

23
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,800
So there's three channels of just five top five top zeros.

24
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,180
That's going to show up as just pure black.

25
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:31,270
Now let's show you how you can actually draw different shapes onto the image.

26
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:35,120
I'm going to start off by drawing a rectangle on this image.

27
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:42,580
So the way this works is you call CB2 dot and then you call rectangle and then you pass in the image

28
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,750
that you want to draw on.

29
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:47,930
So in this case I want to draw on that blank image and then what's going to happen is it's going to

30
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:55,350
except two points point one which is a tuple and then point two which is another tuple of coordinates.

31
00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:00,970
So Point 1 that's going to be the vertex of the rectangle So the first vertex essentially the top left

32
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:04,860
corner and Point 2 is going to be the bottom right corner.

33
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,160
So let's see how this would work.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,960
Let's say I want point 1 to B.

35
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:13,660
X is equal to 384 and Y is equal to zero.

36
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,640
So I wanted to be somewhere around here.

37
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:23,260
So in that case I'll say go execute the three four and then go to zero and then point to where I could

38
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:29,900
say is go all the way close to the edge so I'll say go all the way to 5 10 not 5 12 that way.

39
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:36,770
It's not on the actual border but a little off the border will say five 10 and we'll go ahead and make

40
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:37,730
this one go down a bit.

41
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:45,290
So it's going to go let's say around 150 and then we can assign a color and the color is just going

42
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,820
to be R.G. be code.

43
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:53,390
So in this case I'll just make it one solid primary color and then the thickness is another argument

44
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,070
you can do.

45
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,250
And this is just how many pixels thick do you want it to be.

46
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:59,330
So if you want make it really thick will say 10 pixels.

47
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:00,050
Notice here.

48
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:02,300
This isn't actually going to return anything.

49
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,850
It's actually going to act directly onto the image.

50
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:10,050
So this is kind of a permanent marker that you can draw on the image so keep that in mind.

51
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:14,250
So now it went ahead and spit out the array.

52
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,500
But as I said this happens in place.

53
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,980
So if I take another look at this blank image.

54
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:28,130
In fact if I just copy and paste peel t him show blank image I'm going to paste here and you can see

55
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,520
I have my rectangle.

56
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:35,240
You can also see that my thickness looks a little different on the left one and bottom one of the sides

57
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:36,970
versus the top and the right.

58
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,770
That's because that thickness essentially starts at the middle of the line and then works its way out.

59
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:46,320
So it tries to do five pixels to the left and right and then five pixels to the bottom and top.

60
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:50,480
But since we're pretty close to the edge on some of these it was able to actually fill out all those

61
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,200
pixels which is why it looks a little on even.

62
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:59,120
So what we can do is either shift these points to be a little further off the edge so we can shift this

63
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:04,620
over to maybe like 500 and shift this over to actually have to be off 0.

64
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,370
So maybe we say 10.

65
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,750
Run that again and actually want to reload or blink image.

66
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,890
So Arisa our blank image.

67
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,550
We're going to run this again.

68
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,600
And then let's see if this works a little nicer.

69
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,690
So we run that and I can see the edges are a little more equal here.

70
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,480
OK.

71
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,480
So that's how you can draw a rectangle.

72
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:28,310
Again point 1 that's is top left corner and then point to the bottom right corner.

73
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:33,140
So you just find these two corners or the vertices and then it's going to automatically draw a rectangle

74
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:36,920
for you because you really only need those two corners and it's going to assume there's going to be

75
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:40,890
a straight line on the horizontal and vertical axes.

76
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:41,830
OK.

77
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:45,460
So let's practice by drawing a square right in the middle.

78
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,510
How would that work.

79
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:50,670
Well all we need to say is CB2 dot rectangle.

80
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,820
And then I need to pass in the image I want to draw all say person A blank image to draw on.

81
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:02,600
And then I need to choose my top left point and then my bottom right point.

82
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:07,800
So if I want this to be kind of right in the middle I know I have five hundred and twelve as kind of

83
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,290
a middle point on both.

84
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,390
So let's make point number 1.

85
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,850
Let's have that go let's say 200 200 right with these guys meet.

86
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,970
So we'll say two hundred.

87
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,080
Two hundred and ten point two.

88
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,800
We want that to be probably slightly off.

89
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:28,840
So saying let's go 300 300 300 300 and then we get to choose a color.

90
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:34,440
Again this is just an RG Because it's really up to you what color you want to 5.

91
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:38,260
And then let's go ahead and give it a higher thickness.

92
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:41,280
So say something like thickness equal to 10.

93
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,100
Run that it returns back the array in case you wanted to save.

94
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,410
That has all the updates you notice most of it zero.

95
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:51,160
These thoughts basically signify that there's more to the array that it's showing.

96
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:57,540
And let's actually say peel show the blank image and now we should see a nice blue square here with

97
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:58,460
even sides.

98
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,230
OK.

99
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,140
So again all for all you need to do for that is to find two corners.

100
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,890
The top left corner the top right corner at the x and y points for that to find some sort of color using

101
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:07,780
red and blue.

102
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:12,390
And then the final thickness as well as what image you want to draw on.

103
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,980
Now we're going to do is show you circles.

104
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:23,140
So for circles it's a very similar process we say CB2 circle and then you pass in the image a blank

105
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:23,980
image.

106
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:29,070
And I'm actually going to label these parameters that way you can clearly understand what they represent.

107
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,660
So I am JE's the first parameter.

108
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,510
Well that's just the image you want to draw on.

109
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:35,240
Then the next parameter is the center parameter.

110
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:38,460
So that's the X and Y of where the center of the circle is going to go.

111
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:42,360
So let's imagine I wanted a circle over here kind of at the top left.

112
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:46,330
Well that can be x is equal to a hundred and Y's equal to 100.

113
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:50,080
So the center will say is 100 100.

114
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:55,220
Then if you have the center of a circle you can define the circle with a given radius.

115
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:58,100
So how far from that center do you want to expand.

116
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,840
So we'll go ahead and give it a radius of 50 pixels.

117
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,210
And then let's choose a color for it.

118
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:11,400
Let's give it another primary color we'll say it's red so red green blue 205 on red 0 0 on green and

119
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:11,930
blue.

120
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,940
And let's give it a little bit thickness.

121
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,340
That way we can actually see it.

122
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:18,390
We'll say it's an arbitrary choice there.

123
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,770
And then right after that we'll say realty show.

124
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:25,360
Now we're going to show the blank image OK.

125
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,580
So there we have it.

126
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:31,820
There's our circle again kind of pixels but that's because we're dealing for pretty low resolution image

127
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:34,050
size 5:12 by 512 pixels.

128
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:40,190
That's you can do a circle if you actually wanted to have a filled in circle or he filled in rectangle

129
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,270
in order to do that.

130
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:46,460
All you need to do is actually just have the thickness be a negative one.

131
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:47,620
So let me show what I mean by that.

132
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:53,560
I'm going to copy and paste this code come down here and let's draw another circle but this time will

133
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,690
draw center over on the bottom right.

134
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:02,480
We'll go ahead and say that its center is going to be 400 400 and I'm going to have it be filled in

135
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:07,700
now by passing in a negative number into the thickness we'll say negative 1 thickness.

136
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,540
And then when I run this there is a circle.

137
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:14,680
And now it's filled in with negative one and the same thing applies for rectangles.

138
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:20,300
If you want to filled in using say negative 1 instead of providing an actual thickness then I want to

139
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:25,690
show you how to draw lines and text and we'll finish this off in part two by showing you how to do polygons.

140
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,550
So we're going to show you how to draw a line now to do that.

141
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:35,850
It's CB2 dot and you may have guessed it line and you need to do is provide the image you want to draw

142
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:42,310
on and then the first point of the line in x and y coordinates and then point to the second point of

143
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:46,470
the line and x y coordinates as well as some sort of color and some sort of thickness.

144
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:48,230
Very similar to what we did for rectangles.

145
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:53,350
Let's go ahead and just draw a line that goes from the top left corner to the bottom right corner.

146
00:08:53,400 --> 00:09:01,630
So that's going to be at 0 0 all the way down to Point two at the bottom right.

147
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:06,050
That should be 12 by 512.

148
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:13,900
And then the color will go ahead and say I just copied some red green blue codes that happened to show

149
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:26,070
teal and let's make the thickness equal to 5 or say peel t show and let's show the updated blank image.

150
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,260
We can go ahead and run that.

151
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,420
And now we see we have this line going from point 0 0 connected to in a straight fashion all the way

152
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,030
to point 512 512.

153
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:40,930
All right so now we know how to apply lines rectangles and circles.

154
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:45,960
And we also know how to fill in effect the color and effect the thickness of the actual circles and

155
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,520
rectangle lines.

156
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:53,360
Coming up next we're going to show you to finish this off and part two is how to write text onto a figure

157
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,780
and also how to create your own custom polygons.

158
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,870
So we're almost finished with this.

159
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,910
We'll just finished up those two topics in part to see if they're.
