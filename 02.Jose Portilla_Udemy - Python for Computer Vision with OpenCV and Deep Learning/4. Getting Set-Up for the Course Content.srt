1
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:09,090
Hello and welcome back everyone to finish off this section of the course we're going to get you set

2
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,180
up and install everything you need to be successful in the course.

3
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:16,520
So the first thing to do is download and install Anaconda.

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,010
If you've actually already downloaded installed Anaconda for other courses or maybe for your own environment

5
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,420
you should be good to go on that step.

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:28,480
Keep in mind if you have an insult Annacone will go ahead and walk you through how to do that as well.

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,580
Then once you've installed Anaconda we're going to create a virtual environment.

8
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:36,250
There's a couple of different files depending on your operating system so make sure you pay attention

9
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,550
when we go over that step.

10
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,770
Then we'll talk about how to open up Jupiter lab and then we'll quickly discuss how to work with both

11
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:44,620
notebooks and high scripts with Jupiter lab.

12
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:45,810
OK.

13
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:52,420
As a quick note if you're an advanced user of Python please feel free to use any ID or integrated development

14
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,490
environment you prefer in this course.

15
00:00:54,490 --> 00:01:00,560
We tend to stick with Jupiter lab and Jupiter notebooks just because that's the easiest for screen casting.

16
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:06,100
It's really nice and it allows us to write notes and explain and visualize everything in one single

17
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,400
screencast into one single notebook file.

18
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:14,170
However if you're an advanced users and maybe this like Jupiter please feel free again to use any idea

19
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:14,940
you prefer.

20
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:20,080
However if you are new to these sort of topics we highly recommend these are suggested in environment

21
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:22,750
and tools to avoid issues along the way.

22
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:27,270
So only advanced users should be using their own ID.

23
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,920
Quick note this lecture does have resource links.

24
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:33,970
So make sure to download the appropriate thought why a mail file for your operating system.

25
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:38,570
That thought why a mail file is what we're going to be using when we actually create our virtual environment.

26
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,340
But first let's download and install Anaconda.

27
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,530
Ok set to begin.

28
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:49,000
We need to go to the w w the Anaconda dot com slash download or simply google search Anaconda downloader

29
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:52,060
Anaconda Python and you should be able to find this link.

30
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,570
So let's head over to the browser and check it out.

31
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:54,860
All right.

32
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:57,860
Here we are at Anaconda dot com slash download.

33
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:02,870
Keep in mind sometimes Anaconda changes the look of this Web site so it may not look exactly like it

34
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:08,420
does on my screenshot here but more or less you should be able to find the download links for three

35
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,620
operating systems.

36
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,420
That is Windows Mac OS and Linux.

37
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:16,290
So all you need to do is click on your specific operating system.

38
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:21,020
So if you're on Windows you'll click on Windows and eventually what it does is it scrolls you down automatically

39
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:25,900
here that it has two versions one for Paice on 3.7 one higher price on 2.7.

40
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:31,640
You're going to want to install the python 3.7 version and you'll notice that there's usually two types

41
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,880
of installers here specifically for Windows.

42
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,950
There is a 64 bit and 32 bit.

43
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:39,070
If you're on a relatively modern computer it's probably going to be 64 bit.

44
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:44,000
So you go ahead and download that graphical installer so you just click on that and it will automatically

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,780
start downloading.

46
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:48,730
It's up to you whether you want to download Anaconda's a cheat sheet and given them your email but if

47
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,220
you just this you'll notice that it's already started the download for me.

48
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,530
Now keep mine.

49
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,640
They can also go to Mac OS.

50
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:00,470
Now if you're on Mac OS again I highly recommend downloading the graphical installer centrally just

51
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,890
the graphical installer that takes you through all the steps.

52
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:07,790
If you're on Linux go ahead and then click Linux and it will have installer here for you.

53
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,220
So choose the correct installer.

54
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:13,820
Depending on your operating system once you've installed that or what you've downloaded that installer

55
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:16,030
it's time to actually install Anaconda.

56
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:21,920
So a click opened here this executable file that downloaded for me and then you'll have the Anaconda

57
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,120
set up guy.

58
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:27,400
You'll go ahead and click next agree to the license agreement.

59
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,890
I would recommend just installing it for just me.

60
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,470
Then next go ahead and select the default hit next.

61
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:39,230
Then eventually you'll have the advanced installation options.

62
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,830
There's two advanced options here.

63
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,530
You'll notice that one of them has at Anaconda too my path environment variable.

64
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:51,760
If you've already installed Python previously maybe you've already installed Python from Python or than

65
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,940
actually highly recommend clicking and adding anaconda to my path environment variable.

66
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,120
I know it says here that it's not recommended.

67
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:04,600
But if you have previous versions of Python what ends up happening is when you download or install certain

68
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,660
files your computer gets confused.

69
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:12,400
As far as what's Python version it should use your previously installed Python or your anaconda one.

70
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:17,080
So if you've already installed python in the past from pipe from the org then I highly recommend adding

71
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,450
Anaconda's to your path environment variable.

72
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:23,710
If this is your first installation of an icon then python ever then it's actually not really necessary

73
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:24,980
to do that.

74
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:28,020
OK so once you're done with that go ahead and click install.

75
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,120
After installation we now need to download libraries used for this course.

76
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:35,980
The installation has installed the Anaconda prompt command line tool.

77
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:40,220
We're going to be using this command line tool for the next few steps.

78
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:45,460
The next step is to create and activate the virtual environment we provided for you.

79
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:49,410
This environment will download all the libraries you need for the course.

80
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,030
Please make sure to check the resource links for this lecture video and download the appropriate thought

81
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:56,840
why M-L file for your operating system.

82
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:02,500
We provide different Y.M. files depending if you are on Windows Mac OS or Linux.

83
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:08,020
So go ahead and pause the video and make sure you've downloaded the why M-L file.

84
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:11,270
You'll also want to make sure you keep track of the location of that.

85
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,550
Why a mail file you just downloaded.

86
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:16,420
We will need to know its location in order to use it.

87
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:20,690
So go ahead and put it somewhere like on your desktop or in your Downloads folder.

88
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:23,110
Now let's go ahead and use the Anaconda prompt.

89
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:26,400
So search for the Anaconda prompt on your computer.

90
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:31,970
So if you're on a Mac OS just go ahead and open up your spotlight search and then type in an icon that

91
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,770
prompt a should see it fill out.

92
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:38,630
You could also use your terminal if you're on a Mac OS or Linux or on Windows will go ahead and search

93
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,540
Intercon the prompt and then open it.

94
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,830
I'm right now on a Windows computer.

95
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,120
So let me go ahead and search for an icon the prompt.

96
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,480
OK here I am at my desktop.

97
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:51,560
Notice I'm on a Windows computer so I downloaded the C-v course underscore windows thought why a mail

98
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:56,410
file and I've placed it somewhere I know it is so right now it's under my downloads folder.

99
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:59,740
Make sure you know where the why mail file is on your computer.

100
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:03,740
Again you recommend either putting it on your desktop or your Downloads folder.

101
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,300
Now let's go ahead and open up the Anaconda prompt.

102
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:09,980
So on your computer just search for Anaconda prompt.

103
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,460
You should eventually see it pop up.

104
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:16,740
So go ahead and click that open and now we have the Anaconda prompt.

105
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:23,960
So the next step is to actually see the or change directory to or ever you say that why a mail file.

106
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:31,670
So do that you simply type C the space and then the name of the folder you downloaded it.

107
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:35,910
So we're going to say downloads and you can get tab to auto this.

108
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,960
So again we recommend either desktop or downloads.

109
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:46,070
So then hit enter and not inside my downloads directory and then I'm going to write out the command

110
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:52,210
that allows me to create an environment from this C-v course Windows that why M-L file.

111
00:06:52,430 --> 00:07:04,040
So the way this is done is we simply type out Konda SEO and da space e and V space create space dash

112
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,770
F and then you type out the name of the Y and L file that's in this particular folder.

113
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:17,840
So my case it's C-v course underscore Windows y and l an important thing to know is you should be able

114
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:24,200
to hit tab on your keyboard and have this autocomplete if you hit tab and it does not autocomplete.

115
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,790
That means the M L file is not in this location.

116
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:33,630
So particularly spelled this wrong so let me say C-v course wrong why M-L file.

117
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:38,650
Enter And if you find this error spec not found.

118
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,420
Can't process without a name.

119
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:44,920
That means that the why mail file doesn't exist in whatever particular folder you're in.

120
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:48,910
Or you maybe misspell the Y.M. file so keep that in mind if you get this error.

121
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:50,730
It means you're not in the right location.

122
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:54,850
And again you need to use CD to change directory into that correct location.

123
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,830
So now I'll try this again.

124
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,110
Again it's kinda envy.

125
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:05,410
Create that f See course and in this case and get a tab autocomplete So in my case it's Windows that

126
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:08,400
why MLA or on a Mac OS or Linux will be different.

127
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:12,890
Of course Mac OS Macalester Stevy course Linux then go ahead and hit enter.

128
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:18,100
So what this is doing is it's creating a virtual environment and it's going to download a bunch of libraries.

129
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:22,690
So this is going to take a little bit of time while it's preparing and verifying eventually it's going

130
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:26,720
to ask you if it wants you to allow it to create the environment.

131
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,520
So just hit y for yes and you'll go ahead and let it happen.

132
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:35,220
So in my case I already hit Y and it's ready to go once it's ready to go.

133
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:38,850
You should see a command here to activate this environment.

134
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:44,770
Use Conda activate and then I'll say Python underscore C-v course to deactivate the environment.

135
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:46,910
Use Konda de-activate.

136
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,000
OK so let's try it out.

137
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,860
You should be able to just say activate and see the course or deactivate.

138
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:56,550
Keep in mind if you are on a Mac OS or Linux will probably say.

139
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,100
Source.

140
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,170
Activate or source deactivate.

141
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:02,260
You should just do whatever command it tells you right here.

142
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,570
So let's try this out.

143
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:13,000
We're going to say Konda activates Python underscore C-v course hit enter and you'll notice.

144
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,210
Now imprint sees it says Python C-v course that basically tells me that hey the environment is activated

145
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:21,240
and you have the appropriate libraries now.

146
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:25,630
So in order to start Jupiter lab which is the environment we'll be working on.

147
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:33,430
We just did it now type out Jupiter Dasch lab and hit enter and you should see something pop up saying.

148
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:36,780
Copy paste this URL in your browser connect for the first time.

149
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:44,260
So if your browser that automatically pop up with the Jupiter notebook ready to go you may want to copy

150
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,280
and paste this.

151
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,950
Make sure not to do Control-C otherwise that actually kills the server here.

152
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:54,650
So in your browser you should see now something like this pop up let me bring it over.

153
00:09:54,670 --> 00:10:01,070
All right so here I am in my browser at localhost Colan 8 8 8 8 slash Lab..

154
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:04,870
When you actually launch Jupiter Lab. You should see something that looks like this.

155
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:08,050
And if you clicked that folder you'll actually see the current location.

156
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,040
Your at.

157
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:11,770
OK so we have all other downloads some downloads.

158
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:13,980
So this location in the Downloads folder.

159
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:19,180
This is where are you going to want to save and unzip the zip file for each of the sections of the course

160
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,160
in order to get those notebook files were going to be using Juber lab and we're going to be using both

161
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,800
notebooks as well as script files.

162
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:31,090
So it's quickly show you how you can create a notebook simply here on notebook.

163
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:34,350
Python 3 and you'll notice a little note book pops up here.

164
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,340
It's IPY and B.

165
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:40,520
These files can only be opened through Jupiter lab or Jupiter notebook and you can click on this little

166
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:47,280
folder file browser here it's kind of collapse that and then you should be able to say Prince Hello

167
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,150
world.

168
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:54,830
Zoom in here so you can see it a little better and then do shift enter in order to run that cell.

169
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,780
You should see the direct output.

170
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:01,050
And if you're familiar of Juber enough books is basically just kind of a different idea.

171
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:02,420
For Jupiter notebooks.

172
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:06,340
OK so that's it for actually running notebooks.

173
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:11,550
Now let's quickly show you how you can run Python scripts again or you're going to do is click on file

174
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:15,790
browser and you see the little plus button here indicates a new launcher.

175
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,820
So you hit that plus button has new launcher and instead of notebook what we're going to do is just

176
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:24,880
come over here and click on txt file.

177
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:29,490
So now we Harry have untitled text in order to run this as a Python script.

178
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:39,600
All I need to do is right click on this say rename and I'm going to rename this as my script py and

179
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,810
hopefully are already at the level of Python where this all makes sense to you.

180
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:48,750
And let's try Prince I am running a script.

181
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,140
Go ahead do control s to save that.

182
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:58,090
So now I have a Python script and if actually I want to run this script all I need to do is sit.

183
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:04,840
Plus over here and come down to where it says terminal that will launch a new terminal for me and then

184
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:14,010
I will say Python and say my scripts PI again I should be able to tab autocomplete this my script up

185
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:17,560
high so up to you if you want to type it up manually.

186
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:24,210
Or just do tab autocomplete but once you hit enter there you should see I am running a script or it

187
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,670
every happened say in that print statement.

188
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:27,000
All right.

189
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,410
So that's all there is to it.

190
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,640
We've learned how to install and create an anaconda environment.

191
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,390
We learn how to open notebooks and we've learned how to run the PI scripts.

192
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:40,560
That's everything you need to know if you have any questions feel free to post the Kewney forums and

193
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,810
we'll get you up and running as soon as possible.

194
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,420
Thanks and we'll see you at the next lecture.
