00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:06,240
Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,270
To finish off this section on video basics open C.v.

3
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:13,510
We're going to have a quick assessment project and this lecture will have an overview of the actual

4
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,850
Assessment Project and show you what the finished results should look like.

5
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:21,820
Feel free to also treat this as a code along by jumping over to solutions lecture and coding along with

6
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:22,360
us.

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,470
Let's get started.

8
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:25,720
All right so this is what your project task is.

9
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,940
You really just have one task and that is to create a program that reads and a live stream from a camera

10
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:35,860
on your computer or if you don't have a USP camera go ahead just open up a video file and then wherever

11
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:40,990
you click left mouse button down create a blue circle around where you've clicked.

12
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:44,110
So I'm going to show you an example of what the finished product should look like.

13
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,790
But I've also written a guide here to help you out.

14
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,320
Or if you want to make the challenge harder just go straight off this description.

15
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,610
Open up a new notebook and don't use our guide but there is a middle ground here for a couple of hints

16
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:56,430
as far as the different steps you should take.

17
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:01,660
And then if you scroll down you'll notice there's lots of code here that's basically commenting what

18
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,050
the next steps are to do.

19
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:07,780
So this is a really similar project to what we did over when we were drawing our red rectangle in the

20
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:08,800
previous video.

21
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,930
Now it's up to you to do something very similar except you're going to be drawing basically blue circles

22
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,420
on that video stream.

23
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:19,180
Let me show you what this actually looks like as a completed project.

24
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:20,410
OK here I am.

25
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:22,500
I'm running right now the live video stream.

26
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:27,310
And once you complete this project you should be able to then click on anywhere in the video stream

27
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,660
and see a blue circle that's empty pop up OK.

28
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:33,220
So that's it for the project in the next lecture.

29
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,810
We're going to be going over solutions.

30
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,700
I'll see you there.
