00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:06,230
Welcome back.

2
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:10,200
Let's complete this section with a quick assessment of your new skills.

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:11,510
Let's open up the notebook.

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:17,620
The note book is called zero for Dash image basics dash assessment and the next lecture will go over

5
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,780
the corresponding solutions notebook.

6
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:22,640
Let's get started with a quick review of the assessment.

7
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:27,340
OK when you open your notebook it should look something like this and basically just says always you're

8
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:31,090
going to have a bunch of tasks in bold that you need to complete.

9
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:37,720
So the first task is to open the dog underscore backpack that shape pick image that is located in the

10
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:41,770
data folder that goes along this course and display in the notebook.

11
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:47,870
And I've shown a little hint here that I want you to make sure you correct the R.G. order.

12
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,800
So if you open up the dog backpack a peg and try to display it right off the bat.

13
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,290
Remember that the coloring of red and blue may be switched.

14
00:00:55,290 --> 00:01:00,410
Sure can one make sure that you read it in the correct order and use open C-v to correct for that number

15
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:04,960
we show you the function for that that I want you to flip the image upside down and display it in the

16
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:11,140
notebook that I want you to draw an empty red triangle around the dog's face.

17
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,240
So here's what the dog looks like.

18
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:18,780
And then scroll down I draw a red rectangle around the dog's face.

19
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,770
So here's the dog with the rectangle.

20
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,750
And then here is now the rectangle.

21
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:27,490
It doesn't have to be perfectly centered around Doc's face but you can kind of guesstimate given the

22
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:33,210
x vector axis and the Y dimensions here where the actual corners should go.

23
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:38,620
So again this task just draw an empty red rectangle around the dog's face and display the image in that

24
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:39,270
notebook.

25
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,030
Then the next task is to draw a blue triangle in the middle of the image.

26
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,840
So kind of centered around the dog's face just as it were roughly in the middle of the image.

27
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,280
It can be lower it can be higher.

28
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,590
So don't worry too much about these exact points.

29
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,150
I just want you to be able to kind of guesstimate somewhere on the image and then draw the triangle

30
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:57,940
there.

31
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,230
So remember the size and angle of the triangle is up to you.

32
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,860
Here I made it in equal lateral triangle so all three sides of the same.

33
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,350
That's what was easiest that way these bottom points actually have the same height.

34
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,810
So along the y axis These are both around looks like 700.

35
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,500
So that's a little hint to kind of help you out there.

36
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:20,670
Again just drawing a blue triangle in the middle of the image and then we have a bonus task and the

37
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:24,610
first task is can you figure out how to actually fill in this triangle.

38
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:27,930
It actually requires a different function that we didn't show in the lecture.

39
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:32,190
So you have to use your stack overflow and google skills in order to figure out how you would actually

40
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:35,940
fill in a polyline object term or.

41
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,500
You're going to use a polyline to actually build that out.

42
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,170
And then I want you to figure out how you can actually then fill it in.

43
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:46,080
And there's a link here that gives you really strong hints on how to do it in case you get stuck on

44
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,540
that.

45
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,740
Again that's a bonus tasks since we didn't exactly show you how to do that.

46
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,610
During the lectures and if you scroll down you actually have one more task.

47
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,180
Sorry.

48
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,460
That final before but for this task.

49
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:01,920
Note that you may need to run this as a script specifically for Mac OS or Linux user where you're going

50
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,150
to be doing is creating a script that opens the picture.

51
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:09,930
This dog backpack picture that is and allows you to draw empty red circles wherever you click the right

52
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,260
mouse button down.

53
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:14,730
Let's quickly show you what the finished product should look like here.

54
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:18,900
So if you finish that task at the end that should look something like this where you have the dog backpack

55
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:19,340
image.

56
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:23,740
And if I order right click anywhere I get to see these empty red circles.

57
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,430
OK.

58
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,500
So that's it.

59
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,330
Best of luck on the assessment.

60
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,790
Coming up next we're going to go over the solutions see other

61
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:14,090
OK coming up next we're going to go for the solutions.

62
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:14,880
I'll see it there.
