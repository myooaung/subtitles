00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.240
Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.360
We just learned about the basics of machine learning as well as the basis of classification metrics.

3
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.480
Now it's time to have a series of lectures on an introduction to the learning the next series of lectures

4
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.510
will cover the following topics we'll talk about neurons the artificial neurons and how they are influenced

5
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.600
by biological neurons then will understand how to build our own your own networks using artificial neurons

6
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.560
and then we'll learn how that works actually work by using cost functions and learning about great sense

7
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.380
and back propagation.

8
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.710
All of these topics are fundamental to the way that deep learning and neural networks actually perform.

9
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.440
Keep in mind Piers is going to do all this for us on the back in just a few simple wind calls.

10
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.320
But it's important to have an intuition for what is happening behind the scenes.

11
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.660
So keep in mind that the next series of lectures again is just intuition and theory.

12
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.850
We're really just going to be looking at slides and I know it's a lot of theory and a lot of slides

13
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.050
yet but I promise you're going to be coding and we're going to start that in the course space it's lecture

14
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.820
if you already have some sort of fundamental intuition over neural networks and how they perform then

15
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.640
you could if you want to just jump ahead to the space it's lecture and continue on from there.

16
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.280
It's really up to you and your previous experience but we're going to assume that you have no prior

17
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.170
knowledge on this.

18
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.010
So we'll continue on with the next series of lectures.

19
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.900
We'll see if.
