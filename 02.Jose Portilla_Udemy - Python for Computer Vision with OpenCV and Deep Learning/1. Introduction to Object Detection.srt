00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:11,410
Welcome everyone to the section of the course on object detection the goals for the section are to understand

2
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:13,430
a variety of object detection methods.

3
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,570
And we're going to slowly build up to more complex methods as we go along.

4
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:21,510
In this section of the course so we're going to start off with template matching template matching is

5
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:27,000
probably the simplest idea behind object detection and all it does is it simply looks for an exact copy

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,390
of an image within another larger image.

7
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:34,990
Then we'll move on to just general detection methods like cornuta detection which is looking for corner's

8
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:40,090
edge detection which expands on this idea to find general etches of objects and then grid detection

9
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:45,190
which combines both concepts defined grid like patterns in images which is really useful for lots of

10
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:51,160
applications that will move on to talking about contour detection contrary detection allows us to detect

11
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:56,990
foreground vs. background images and also allows for detection of external versus internal contours.

12
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:02,140
For example grabbing the eyes and smile from a cartoon smiley face and realizing that those are internal

13
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:07,710
contours versus the external contour of the actual circle that holds the eyes and the smile and all

14
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,110
the work of that exact example later on.

15
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,290
That will move on to general feature matching.

16
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,030
And this is going to be one of the more advanced methods of detection specifically detecting matching

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,220
objects in another image and it's going to work even as a Tarka image is not shown exactly the same

18
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,210
in the image that we are actually searching.

19
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:31,390
Then we'll talk about the watershed algorithm and it's an advanced algorithm that allows us to segment

20
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:33,750
images into foreground and background.

21
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,430
And it also allows us to manually set seeds to choose segments of an image and we'll be working with

22
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:43,410
both those concepts that will move on to facial and eye detection.

23
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:46,730
We'll be using Haar cascades to detect faces and images.

24
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:49,190
Note that this is not yet facial recognition.

25
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:54,300
We're only going to be able to detect if there is a face or if there's a set of eyes in an image.

26
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:58,270
We won't be able to yet say whose face or whose eyes they belong to.

27
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:03,490
Later on when we talk about deep learning then we'll talk about actually recognizing unique faces or

28
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:04,560
unique images.

29
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,120
At the end we'll have a really cool project assessment.

30
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:12,920
We're going to build a full computer vision application that can actually blur license plates automatically

31
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,810
given an image.

32
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:19,580
So Ill see an image the where the license plate is and then we'll apply our own blur to that license

33
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,000
plate.

34
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,310
So it's going to be this really awesome application.

35
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,980
All right let's get started by talking about template matching.

36
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:25,990
We'll see at the next lecture.
