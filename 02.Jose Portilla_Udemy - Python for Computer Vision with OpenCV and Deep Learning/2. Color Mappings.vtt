00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:11.900
Welcome back in this lecture we're going to discuss color spaces so far we've only worked with RSGB

2
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.780
color spaces that is insane.

3
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:19.670
RG coding or red green blue coding colors are modeled as a combination of red green and blue.

4
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:27.750
However R.G. coding is actually a very old color coding and in the 1970s H S L or hue saturation lightness

5
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:37.770
and HSV hue saturation value where new color models developed as alternatives to R.G. be h s l n h s

6
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.330
v are actually more closely aligned the way human vision actually perceives color while in the course

7
00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:48.570
since we're just dealing with images we deal almost exclusively of RGV images or the painting and how

8
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.340
we open them.

9
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.840
BGR but the same rule applies.

10
00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.150
There's combinations of red green and blue.

11
00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.830
However even though we're mainly thinking of our G-B images it's a good idea to understand the very

12
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.590
basics of how to convert to sell an H S V color spaces.

13
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.770
So let's quickly describe these color spaces how they're different than R.G. be and they will open up

14
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.030
a notebook and briefly go over how you could convert an RG image to an HSF or HSP color space.

15
00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:21.790
So as we already know the R.G. B model is essentially going to represent a color as a combination of

16
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:28.120
blue red and green which we can describe this as a cube where we have some valley of blue from 0 to

17
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.250
255 some valley of red from 0 to 255.

18
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:37.330
And then some value of green and if we were to cut away from the cube we can see there we have a value

19
00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:43.200
of kind of the Teal ish blue there and we would say red is going to be one fifth.

20
00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.300
So it's not actually just one fifth of all values.

21
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.650
It's actually one fifth time's 255 and in green there's more green there so it's three fifths times

22
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.550
255 and then blue is for this time 255.

23
00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:00.460
So we can see they're just kind of how far along the scale of blue red and green we are for that particular

24
00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.200
color.

25
00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.670
So that's what we're already used to.

26
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:10.810
Now let's move on to talk about H S L and we can visualize this as a cylinder model the way h s l works

27
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:19.390
is we have hue saturation and lightness and an HSV we're going to have hue saturation and then value.

28
00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:20.760
So hue saturation.

29
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.720
Basically what this is is all around the cylinder.

30
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.560
There's going to be the actual different color that is the green the yellow the red what actual hue

31
00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:34.870
we're looking for and then saturation is just how much of that hue you end up having and lightness is

32
00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.630
how dark or light it is.

33
00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.450
So we can see here on the top of the cylinder all the values are actually pure white.

34
00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:41.470
They're all just as light.

35
00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.910
So the absolute lightness you can get is just pure white.

36
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.600
And at the bottom of the cylinder we have pure black which is essentially no lightness in the color

37
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.350
regardless of its saturation or hue.

38
00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:00.380
This is similar to an HSV cylinder model except instead of having a lightness we have a value.

39
00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:06.800
So again we have the hue color all around the circle and then saturation is going to define how close

40
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.190
we are to white versus how Satria we are in a particular hue.

41
00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.390
So notice now the top is basically the same hue all around and we're just deciding on a particular value

42
00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.550
depending on the hue and saturation.

43
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.690
And you may have played of some color pictures before that followed the sort of model but notice now

44
00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.650
the White is actually at the very center of that cylinder.

45
00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.150
So essentially no saturation of any hue by default is going to be white.

46
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:33.020
OK.

47
00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.840
So this lecture is going to be a quick review on using the CVT color function to change color spaces

48
00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.500
will actually have the cell or HSP based color images in the rest of the course.

49
00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.040
So this will just be a very brief lecture.

50
00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.770
We'll see you there.

51
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:47.200
OK.

52
00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:52.770
Let's quickly show you how to convert an image to HSV or H S L color space.

53
00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:58.490
All you need to do is say import CB2 And then if we want to actually display the results of these images

54
00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:09.590
we can say import plus lib that PI plot as Piel T and then we'll say that plot lib in line OK let's

55
00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.660
choose any image he wants we'll just say CB2 image read.

56
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.510
And in this case I will go and upload or download the puppy.

57
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.840
Let's go ahead and see that we'll say peel t him show and show that image.

58
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.460
And there's our puppy Lotus right now.

59
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:33.250
It's in its default color space farm open C-v which is blue green red.

60
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.590
However the image was actually coated like that.

61
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.400
So let's do a quick review in order to fix this.

62
00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:47.970
On it says image is equal to CB2 thought CVT color pasand the image and then say CB2 thought and in

63
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:54.540
all caps color and then the coating that it's in right now which is blue green red and then say to the

64
00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:01.320
coating the one added red green blue and if we display the image after that we'll see that we get the

65
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.410
nice puppy.

66
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.910
All right.

67
00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.700
So what happens when we try to convert this to HSV or h s l.

68
00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.830
Well it's actually a very similar process only do is copy the same code here and we'll go from now.

69
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.150
Remember now we have it in RSGB.

70
00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:21.240
And in fact what we can do if we want we can reload the image so we go from BGR but we'll go from RG

71
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:29.380
B and then we can go to and if we want to go to HSV you can just start typing and you'll see HSV there.

72
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:35.010
So if you show that image it's going to look really strange because now it's in hue saturation and value.

73
00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.150
So it won't really make sense to display it this way because the color channels weren't modeled like

74
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:44.940
that but that is the way you would actually convert image to be read in and you could convert it from

75
00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:53.150
RG B to HSV or if you happen to be reading it originally with M red you could also do BGR to HSV.

76
00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.820
So lots of different options here.

77
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.670
None of them make that much sense from HSV or H cell just because the original image was encoded that

78
00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:00.790
way.

79
00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:06.060
And as I mention those for HSV use saturation value it's basically the same thing.

80
00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:15.850
If you want to go from a red green blue image to h s or h l s excuse me he lightness saturation you

81
00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:18.140
can do it this way as well run.

82
00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:23.170
And now you see the results there again very strange kind of weird ugly results because the original

83
00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:25.210
image wasn't coded that way.

84
00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.820
Main thing you need to get in mind is there's various color spaces.

85
00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:32.410
If you ever need to do any sort of conversion they're pretty much all here for you just a color underscore

86
00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:35.500
tab and you'll see all the various options for you.

87
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:35.970
OK.

88
00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:36.240
So.

89
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:36.640
Tons.

90
00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:37.610
Tons of options.

91
00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:41.140
And usually you only need them in certain specific cases for the rest of the course.

92
00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:45.470
We're just going to be doing this blue going to red to red green blue.

93
00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:46.150
All right.

94
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:47.080
We'll see you at the next lecture.
