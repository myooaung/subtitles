Welcome back everyone in this section of the course.

2
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:13.660
We're going to talk about object tracking first start off by learning about the basic object tracking

3
00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:14.950
technique methods.

4
00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.960
We'll start with talking about optical flow and then we'll move on to mean shift and can shift object

5
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.130
tracking.

6
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.630
Then we're going to begin to understand more advanced tracking methods by reviewing the built in tracking

7
00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.580
API that are available with Open City.

8
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.780
All right let's get started with some basic object tracking.

9
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.030
Up next we'll begin talking about optical flow.
