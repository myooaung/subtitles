00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,950
Welcome back everyone in this lecture.

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,160
We're going to talk about histograms again and we can continue our discussion with two additional topics.

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:18,120
The first one being histograms on a masked portion of the image and the second one being histogram equalization

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,510
as you mentioned in the previous lecture we can actually select a specific region of interest and only

5
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,390
calculate the color histogram of that mass section.

6
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,880
We're going to show you how to create a mask and then achieve that effect.

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,610
That should be just kind of a brief little overview of applying the mask and then Cockley in the color

8
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:36,660
histogram.

9
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:42,060
The larger part of this lecture is histogram equalization and histogram equalization is a method of

10
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,510
contrast adjustment based on the images histogram.

11
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:50,700
Previously we saw how we could use gamma correction to increase or decrease the brightness of an image.

12
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:56,440
Now we're going to show you how to increase or decrease the contrast of an image through histogram equalization.

13
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,770
Here we have a little figure.

14
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:03,010
And on the left it shows what the original histogram or color histogram of the image looks like.

15
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,800
And we're essentially going to flatten it out or equalize it.

16
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,440
And we're going to walk through an example of what that actually looks like.

17
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:13,300
So here's an example of an original image is essentially just a bunch of.

18
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,050
So on the left here we have the actual color values.

19
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,810
And then in the middle we have just a small image.

20
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,630
There's not really anything there just a little white circle with lots of gray around it.

21
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:28,140
And then we see the original color histogram something to note here is that the histogram for this original

22
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:28,800
image.

23
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:34,470
It doesn't have any values at 0 or 255 so it doesn't have anything that's pure white and also doesn't

24
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:40,270
have anything that's pure black or we're going to do is apply histogram Equalization which is going

25
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:41,950
to reduce the color depth.

26
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,630
And what we mean by reducing the color that is you're actually reducing the shades of gray or if you're

27
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:51,730
working on a particular color channel then you're reducing the number of in-between colors between 0

28
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,290
and 255.

29
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,220
So again take a look at the original minimum and maximum values in the story.

30
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,900
I've highlighted them here for you.

31
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:04,690
Currently the minimum value is 52 and the maximum value is 150.

32
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:09,590
What we're going to do now is apply histogram equalization and definitely check out the resource link

33
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:13,480
in this lecture for the full mathematical breakdown of how this actually works.

34
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:15,830
It works for a cumulative distribution function.

35
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:21,060
But right now we're just concerned more of the effects of applying histogram equalization.

36
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:26,390
So after you apply histogram equalization notice what happens to those left values that minimum value

37
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:33,930
that was 50 to now gets transformed to 0 and that max value which was 154 then has transformed 255.

38
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:37,100
And let's take a look at what happens to the actual image itself.

39
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:43,820
So notice it's kind of just this blurry almost gray almost white circle there and now it's clearly been

40
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:47,490
high contrast so that the circle in the middle is clearly now white.

41
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:52,590
And then we have a clear border edge and the histogram is also now more flattened out.

42
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:57,410
And now it extends all the way from the minimum possible value of zero all the way to the maximum possible

43
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:04,310
255 so notice again how the minimax values have now been equalized to be 0 and 255.

44
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,560
We also now see less shades of gray.

45
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:11,120
So this results in a higher contrast.

46
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,590
Let's see though the results on a normal image.

47
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:17,740
So here we have a left hand side image of just some hills of some trees on them.

48
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,840
And then we have the actual histogram.

49
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,110
So the red represents the histogram for those grayscale values and then the black line represents the

50
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,860
cumulative histogram there.

51
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:30,750
And essentially what that does is it just keeps adding things up as you go towards the max possible

52
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,140
value.

53
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:37,190
And if you apply histogram equalization what happens is the cumulative then becomes kind of a linear

54
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,060
step function.

55
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:41,150
And we get much higher contrast in the actual image.

56
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:46,910
Again we're going from something with low contrast and if we apply histogram equalization then we get

57
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:50,890
something with high contrast and we've also flattened out the histogram a bit.

58
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,400
Keep my we don't make the histogram perfectly flat.

59
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,680
Instead we're really focused on is making that human live process.

60
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,020
So if we take the correspondence histogram in red versus the cumulative histogram in black we take that

61
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:07,120
human history and make that much more linear than before.

62
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:11,570
So that's the actual real process and the mathematics be high histogram equalisation really focus on

63
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:16,680
that aspect making that cumulative histogram a much more linear Okay.

64
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,330
So let's explore these concepts with open C.v.

65
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,970
Let's open up the Jupiter notebook.

66
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:24,510
All right here I am in the notebook from the previous lecture where we ended up calculating some color

67
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,350
histograms for various images.

68
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,110
I'm only starting off by using this rainbow image right here.

69
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,610
So let me copy these two lines of code.

70
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,780
And come back down here.

71
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,000
Run those.

72
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,420
So we've uploaded rainbow and show rainbow.

73
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,370
And let's quickly check the shape.

74
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:44,660
And in fact let's reassign rainbow just so we don't mess around with it too much.

75
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,830
Well re-assign it's image and English chick image shape.

76
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:52,920
OK so we're doing dealing with 550 by 413 on three color channels.

77
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,950
Now it's time to create a mask.

78
00:04:55,140 --> 00:05:02,270
So probably the easiest way to create a mask is just by using them pie will say a mask is equal to zeros.

79
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,760
And then check check the image shape.

80
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,160
And in this case we're only concerned with the mask on the x and y dimension.

81
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,130
It's not like we're going to mask certain colors out.

82
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:15,570
We just want this on the to the plane and then that mask will be extended to the three other channels.

83
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:18,060
So in that case we're only concerned with these first two.

84
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:21,780
So the shape is going to be Colan too.

85
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:27,630
And if you take a look at this what the actual result is it's the same as the first two indices.

86
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,400
So we have 550 in 413.

87
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,380
So that's all this is.

88
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:35,190
So it looks like a complicated man but it's really just grabbing the x and y components and the next

89
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,520
we're going to have the mask be an integer

90
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:45,770
and so if we take a look at our mask now what we're gonna do is reassign some of the points to be pure

91
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:46,420
white.

92
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,820
So remember right now the mask is pure black.

93
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:54,010
So if we were to say peel t him show the mask it's a bunch of zeros.

94
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,120
So it's pure black.

95
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:58,980
And let me actually make the same map here Gray so we can actually see that.

96
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:02,430
So in grayscale it's going to be completely black because they're all zeroes.

97
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,300
Now what I want to do is get a rectangle.

98
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,610
Kind of an arbitrary piece that you want to have you as a region of interest.

99
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,870
And that's what I'm going to choose as my mask.

100
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:15,050
In that case there's really no right or wrong answer as far as like what she amass or what should it

101
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:15,690
be amassed.

102
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,530
That's up to you.

103
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:22,240
But what we could do is take her mask and let's just take a slice of it will go from 300 to 400.

104
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,980
And then we'll say from 100 to 400.

105
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:29,270
So we're taking a slice about 100 pixels along this direction.

106
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:34,770
So from 200 to 400 over here on Y and then from 100 to 400 to this block over here.

107
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:40,100
So most of the X-axis there and going to reset those all equal to 255.

108
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,350
So they're all white.

109
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:48,550
And then once I'm done that let's show the results we'll say mask and then say See map gray and you'll

110
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:52,010
notice that from 300 to 400 on the Y and from 100 to 400.

111
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:58,150
Now we have an area that has been mass off and we've already seen mass a little bit with bit wise.

112
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:03,370
And in the bitwise OR operations and we're going to be using those same operations to essentially filter

113
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:06,720
through just on the white space the original rainbow image.

114
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:13,930
So remember the rainbow image if we say Show image this is the rainbow image and it's actually kind

115
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:17,440
of incorrect the way I'm showing right now I should be showing you show rainbow.

116
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:17,920
There we go.

117
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:22,340
So this is the color corrected that we're going to be doing is we're going to be masking that image.

118
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:30,400
So let's come at this out and then create a master version of that image by saying masked image is equal

119
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,760
to CB2 bitwise.

120
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:40,570
And now we're going to pass in the image twice and then say mask is equal to the mask we created.

121
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:43,800
So that is the masked image.

122
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:47,920
And we're also going to create a version of show mass image.

123
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:57,880
So it was a show masked image is equal to CB2 wise and then we're going to pasan show rainbow twice.

124
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,820
And then passen the mask.

125
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,120
OK.

126
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:09,270
So again the reason I'm doing both a masked image and they show masks image is this one is purely for

127
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,380
visualization purposes.

128
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:14,620
That way I can visually see the correct red green and blue color channeling order.

129
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:18,720
This one on the mask image that's for the actual histogram calculation.

130
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:24,520
OK so let's display what the actual image now looks like with our show masked image.

131
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,690
And there we have it.

132
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:29,580
And so now I'm only seeing this portion of the rainbow.

133
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:35,370
Notice now how this portion of the rainbow doesn't appear to have that much red compared to the original

134
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:35,930
image.

135
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,350
So we should expect that our color histogram also reflects that.

136
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:47,860
Let's calculate now the histogram asked values will say histogram mask underscore values and we're going

137
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,930
to just Kukla on the red channel.

138
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,000
So I'll say CB2

139
00:08:53,410 --> 00:09:00,100
calque hest and the way this works is as a list you're going to actually pass in the original image.

140
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:06,450
So we're going to pasan rainbow and then the channel we're looking for is the red channel which in this

141
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,730
case since open.

142
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,630
Remember it's the fall is blue green red that means red is an index too.

143
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:21,730
So we will say channels is equal to two and then we'll say mass is equal to the mass we created which

144
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:24,250
remember is up here.

145
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,530
This is the actual mask object.

146
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:31,980
OK so then we have the mass we created and then the other parameters we're going to say are the his

147
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,530
size and ranges.

148
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:42,880
So those are going to be the same as before we will say his size is equal to 256 and then Granges is

149
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,660
equal to zero to 256.

150
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:46,170
OK.

151
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:52,200
So a lot going on there but we'll go ahead and run that and let's do one more for good measure.

152
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:58,480
However this time we won't apply the mask so we will say just devalues red.

153
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:03,700
So I'm going to delete that and it will set mass equal to not just for comparison sake.

154
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,720
So let's run that and I'll actually plot these out.

155
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:12,340
We're going to say Piazzi plot and we're going to start off with just mask values red and I'm going

156
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:15,620
to title this just so we can understand what we're looking at.

157
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:26,750
This is the red histogram for mass at Rainbow and what is the actual mass rainbow looks like.

158
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,520
Well it looks like what we have up here.

159
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,680
Notice there's not a whole lot of red going on.

160
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,820
So let's actually run this and see what it looks like.

161
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:34,740
OK.

162
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:41,140
So you'll notice just as we predicted in this red histogram there are very low values for red and most

163
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,720
of the values are actually 0.

164
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:45,930
And then as we continue going on we see less and less pure red values.

165
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,570
So not a whole lot of red going on there.

166
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:52,600
Now let's check out what happens if we're to do the same thing for the full rainbow image.

167
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,360
Remember the full rainbow image.

168
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:55,830
We actually display it.

169
00:10:55,930 --> 00:11:01,540
Let me just explain quickly here guilty in show show rainbow.

170
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:06,010
This one actually has quite a bit of red including representation here in the purple area and Violet

171
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:06,760
area.

172
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:13,270
So we're going to do the exact same thing or to Kilty plot except in this case we'll do the no mask

173
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:18,050
values read and then we'll say for no more himbo.

174
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,640
And if we run that Lotus now we see way more red over here.

175
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:26,080
So we're pretty much doing the exact opposite of the mast and that's because we could see that much

176
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:30,550
more of the image is actually represented through the red channel and that's the basics of applying

177
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:33,100
a mask to a histogram.

178
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:38,140
So in general we really won't be doing color histograms that often and when we do do color histograms

179
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:42,430
we probably won't be applying a masks to any particular area but just in case we need to understand

180
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:46,720
that basically you can always just reference the code in the note book on how to create a mask which

181
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,950
you've seen a little bit of before and then how to actually just calculate it and then pass in that

182
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:51,730
mask.

183
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:56,860
And this step right here of mask image and show a mass image that is kind of an in-between step so we

184
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,300
can clearly see what was going on there.

185
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,270
But really all you need to do is create this mask right here which is essentially just creating black

186
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:09,220
and then filling in your particular region of interest with white and then you can create the mask that

187
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:09,950
way.

188
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:10,670
OK.

189
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:15,980
We're going to go ahead and then move on to the main part of this lecture which is the histogram equalization.

190
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,280
Remember that's a way we can display contrast.
