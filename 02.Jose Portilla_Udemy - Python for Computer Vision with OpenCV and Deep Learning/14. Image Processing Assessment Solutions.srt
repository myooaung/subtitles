00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:10,230
Welcome back in this lecture we're going to go over the solutions for the image processing assessment.

2
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,110
Let's open up the assessment notebook and work through solutions.

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,300
All right here we have the image processing assessment notebook.

4
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,150
Now let's work through the solutions.

5
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,930
We have some convenience code here for you so go ahead and run that.

6
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,360
We've ran in the imports and we'll set this display image.

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:30,390
Now our first task is to open and display the draft pick image that is located in the data folder.

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:37,300
Hopefully by now you're pretty much a pro opening files of say CB2 emerita and inside the data folder

9
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,510
we're going to call in giraffes.

10
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,970
Let's make sure it's actually I'm spelling it right.

11
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:43,750
Wraps.

12
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:44,800
There we go.

13
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:51,290
And because I want to display this I'm going to reassigned the color channels will say CB2 CVT color

14
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:59,780
lets say image CB2 color and by default we have BGR and we want to convert that to our job.

15
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:09,490
So if we run that wups CV to underscore that we up OK then we'll say peel t.

16
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,710
Actually we have the display image.

17
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,840
So we'll say display image.

18
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:19,080
I am g run that you should see these two giraffes somewhere in the savannah OK.

19
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:25,060
The next task was to apply a binary threshold onto the image first I can to you what happens if you

20
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:29,980
try to apply the binary threshold onto the raw image and then I'll show you how you can actually get

21
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,040
the results expected in the notebook.

22
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,010
Although depending on how you interpret this is technically correct.

23
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:44,920
So to say read and thresh one is equal to CB2 and the command here is just threshold and then we'll

24
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:51,750
pass in the image we pass in the midway point so that's commonly just between 0 2 5 5 1 to 7.

25
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:59,030
You can always add justice and then the max value is 2 5 5 and they'll say CB2 and call thresh.

26
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:01,690
And in this case we just on a binary threshold.

27
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:07,420
Now if you apply this directly onto this color image what's going to happen is it's going to apply that

28
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,690
binary across the three color channels.

29
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,640
So that is technically technically a binary threshold.

30
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:18,120
So you can display the image and show thresh one.

31
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,700
And this is a binary threshold on the image.

32
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:23,440
However it's doing it across all the color channels.

33
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,630
So if you actually want to fix that where you can do is reload the image in greyscale so you can just

34
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:31,520
come back appear load this.

35
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:37,500
And in fact we only need this first line and remember as the second parameter you can just say comma's

36
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,270
0.

37
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,300
Run that again and then you see this in grayscale.

38
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:49,270
And if you actually want the color mapping to be grayscale you can just provide the map Gray for that.

39
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,580
And then we have the binary threshold on the greyscale image.

40
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,030
So everything is either black or white.

41
00:02:55,070 --> 00:03:00,470
OK so then the next task was to open the drafts thought Jay pick file for the data folder and convert

42
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:03,700
its color space to HSP and display the image.

43
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:09,060
So you can say image is equal to CB2 image read.

44
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,800
In this case it's in the data folder.

45
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,640
It's called giraffes.

46
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:20,650
And if you want to convert to a different color space or meannesses image CB2 see color as in the image

47
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,680
CB2 dot color underscore.

48
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:30,970
And in this case we're going from blue green red to HSP and then we can display the results of that

49
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:35,870
image even though the kind of really what makes sense to be kind of a funky looking pair of drops.

50
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,390
So here we have it now and the HSV space.

51
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,410
OK.

52
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:45,430
The next task was create a low pass filter with a four by four kernel filled with values of 1 over 10

53
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,890
and then used to the convolution to blur the giraffe image.

54
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,540
So let's go ahead and try that out.

55
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:56,440
We'll start off by creating the kernel as asks a couple of the four ways you can do this but probably

56
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:01,310
easiest is to say N.P. ones shape is equal to four by four.

57
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,180
And then we may also specify the data type.

58
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:09,320
So we'll say data type is N.P. float 32 as we did in the lecture.

59
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,000
And this case was divided by 10.

60
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,470
So the lecture I think we divided by 25.

61
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,360
And if we display the kernel we get back to the expected results.

62
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,420
Let's now return the image afresh.

63
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:26,030
So it's easy to read and will pass in data and grab the giraffe's shape.

64
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:29,090
And I going to make sure to convert it to the correct color space.

65
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,240
I'll say whoops.

66
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,910
CB2 dot.

67
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,590
CVT color.

68
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:39,270
Pass the image and then will say CB2 color.

69
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:44,790
In this case we're going from again B G R to R G B.

70
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:46,870
OK.

71
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:56,140
Run that and then we'll say the result is equal to c v to filter to the.

72
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:02,080
And then we'll pass an image for the desired that we can keep the input that so will say negative 1.

73
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,960
And then we pass in the kernel and let's display the result.

74
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,410
So the splay image of that result.

75
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,560
Go ahead and show that and you can see here.

76
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:12,150
It basically looks a little blurred.

77
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,470
It looks a little brighter next.

78
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:20,760
We wanted you to create a horizontal Sobol filter so that's Sobol X from our lecture of a kernel size

79
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:25,860
of five of the Grayskull version of the draft's image and then display the resulting gradient.

80
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,220
So again we want to read this in greyscale.

81
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:39,900
So we just see a say image C-v to read elysÃ©e data giraffes run that and then we can say Sobol X for

82
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:53,500
the X gradient CV to Sobol and then we'll say image for the actual depth will define it as CV 64 f just

83
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:58,390
like we did at the lectures and then we'll say Remember it's the X that comes first.

84
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:05,020
So I'll say one for DX 0 for D-y and the kernel size again this kind of up to you but which is five

85
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:15,370
and then let's display that image so that splaying those results of simple X and whip's looks like we

86
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,510
forgot to read this in greyscale.

87
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,350
Let's try that again.

88
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:19,290
Zero.

89
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,040
Now we run it.

90
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,810
OK now it's making a lot more sense.

91
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:28,090
And then we can just say See map is equal degree.

92
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,830
OK so now we have the simple X gradient.

93
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:36,480
Then at the very end we want you to plot the color histograms for red blue and green channel.

94
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:42,830
The draft image is pretty much the exact same code that we did during the actual lecture color histograms.

95
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:53,890
Part one will see image CB2 Let's read in the first image data draft's or set my list of colors.

96
00:06:53,950 --> 00:07:00,190
So color say blue green and red.

97
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:08,690
We have it in the open C-v order and they'll say for I must see a well in enumerates color.

98
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:13,290
Will say the result of the histogram is C.V two.

99
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:20,840
And then we just call calque just in this case repassing the list or an image instead of a list.

100
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:26,860
The channel that we're looking for which is just the index I mean we're not using a mask and it will

101
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:32,830
say 2 5 6 as that max range value and we'll define that range there.

102
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:42,880
And then we can go ahead and then plot just our ok and then we'll say here fealty title really whatever

103
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,960
you want to call it my histo.

104
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:51,150
So if you run that you should see a histogram that looks more or less like this.

105
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:55,000
Keep in mind your default colors may be slightly different than the ones here.

106
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:03,070
So what we can do is we can say Piazzi plot and then set the color to equal to the color code.

107
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:06,940
So then when you on this night you get the matching color code so red is red blue is blue and green

108
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:07,580
is green.

109
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,360
OK.

110
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,290
So that's it for this assessment.

111
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:14,570
If you have any questions for the post to the Q&amp;A forums.

112
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:19,000
But keep in mind you can always reference the solutions note book and pretty much all of this was a

113
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,810
carbon copy.

114
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:21,610
At least the commands were for the lectures.

115
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,720
So if you got stuck on something definitely review the lectures because essentially all the code came

116
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,980
from the previous lectures.

117
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,390
Okay thanks.

118
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,440
And we'll see you at the next section of the course.
