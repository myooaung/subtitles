00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.280
Welcome back everyone in this lecture we're going to go over the solutions for the video basics assessment.

2
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.050
Let's get started.

3
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:12.410
OK.

4
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.460
I went ahead and copied and pasted the skeleton code that we left for you in the assessment notebook.

5
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:23.790
And the first thing to do is add an import CB2 and we want to be able to create a function based off

6
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.310
a CV to even go in order.

7
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.860
Notice that we already have the global variables center and clicked.

8
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.510
So we want to get a mouse click on down and track the center.

9
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:43.300
We can do that is say if event is equal to CB2 in this case we want events left button down.

10
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.720
We'll go ahead and grab the center that the center is defined as a tuple starting at 0 0.

11
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.970
So I'll say that the center upon being clicked is now defined as the x and y coordinates of that clicked.

12
00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:07.430
And then we can reset clicked equal to false and then we're going to do is we'll say if the events is

13
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:19.160
equal to to event left button back up then we'll say clicked is equal to true.

14
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.270
Now it's kind of up to you how exactly you want to do this.

15
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.250
You could just have a single left button down but the way we designed this actual event or the sexual

16
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.620
assessment I should say is that you don't actually draw the circle until you release the mouse button.

17
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.180
Now if you didn't quite do that sort of interpretation and you just went for single let button down

18
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.280
that's OK too.

19
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.420
You basically just would have said essentially would have to have the second tracking here of the left

20
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.350
button up.

21
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.820
So again you can check out the various ways to do this but we're going to say left button down.

22
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.840
And then once you release the button then you actually say click does it go to true.

23
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.590
Then we have center and clicked.

24
00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.290
False.

25
00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.320
We want to go ahead and capture the video.

26
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.240
We'll say the following we'll say Cap is equal to CB2.

27
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.950
And then we will say video capture zero.

28
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.100
And we want to create a named window.

29
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:17.630
We'll say CB2 named the window and we just call this window test and we're going to bind and this case

30
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.270
is actually not draw rectangle.

31
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.680
Draw a circle.

32
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.830
So let's fix that draw circle.

33
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:32.290
We'll say CB2 set mouse call back and I'm going to set test to be bound to draw circle.

34
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.310
So again we are binding it to this draw circle function then we're going to scroll down here we're going

35
00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.030
to capture frame by frame it will say something being return.

36
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:49.330
Let's make sure our spacing is right so capture frame by frame will say return frame is equal to cap

37
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.950
read.

38
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.250
So really in a frame by frame and then we use an IF statement to see if something's been clicked.

39
00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:01.040
So if we have clicked meaning something has been clicked we're going to say CB2 and we'll go ahead and

40
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.980
draw the circle on the frame where a center is equal to center.

41
00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.410
So that's the center of the circle.

42
00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.780
So to what radius you want to give it we'll just say go ahead and give it a radius of 50 kind of up

43
00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:12.200
to you.

44
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.640
What color.

45
00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:13.600
But I think we said blue.

46
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:21.890
So say 2 5 5 0 0 and then the thickness will just go ahead give it 5 pixel thickness and then we want

47
00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.620
to show the resulting frame.

48
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.810
Remember this is going outside of that if statement will say to show and I want to make sure that we

49
00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.330
have the same name there a test and then we're going to show that frame and then this command is just

50
00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:36.020
going to let us quit.

51
00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.290
So we say CB2 mixture my spacing is right.

52
00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.180
If C-v to waky.

53
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:51.510
So we'll wait one millisecond and we're basically going to check has a person hit the cue button so

54
00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:59.820
0 that should be Lorqess asks f f is equal to ordinal of Q And if that's the case then we will break

55
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:00.870
out of this loop.

56
00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:07.380
So once everything is done we're going to release a capture we'll say capture release and then CB2 destroy

57
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.070
all windows.

58
00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.440
And that's really all there is to it.

59
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.330
So it's pretty straightforward.

60
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.510
Let me just do a quick review of everything we're doing.

61
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.360
The main thing that may have tripped you up is the fact that we're asking for both left button down

62
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:19.720
and left button up.

63
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.580
And typically all we've been doing is just once you click that left button down and we've been drawing

64
00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.560
something in this case we're adding a second event check to see that the person has actually lifted

65
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.790
up that mouse button.

66
00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.390
So that's basically what the new component is here.

67
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.570
In this particular project that you haven't exactly seen before but you have all the skills and tools

68
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.440
necessary to account for that.

69
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:39.940
Now we have our global variables.

70
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.870
We're capturing the video connecting it to the callback function and then displaying it.

71
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.480
And if something has been clicked then we draw the circle.

72
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.200
So let's try this out make sure we don't have any errors.

73
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:54.260
I'm going to run this now and there I am going to click down once and there are the circles being drawn.

74
00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.640
OK.

75
00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:55.810
So that's all there is to it.

76
00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.710
If you have any questions feel free to post the Kewney forums.

77
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.120
We'll see you at the next section.
