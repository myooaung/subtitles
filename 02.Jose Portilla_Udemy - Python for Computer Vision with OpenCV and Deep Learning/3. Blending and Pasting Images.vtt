00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:06.300
Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.220
And this lecture we're going to discuss how to blend and paste images on top of each other.

3
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.690
Open C-v often.

4
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.840
We're going to be a work of multiple images an open city has many programmatic methods of blending images

5
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.140
together and pasting images on top of each other.

6
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.560
For blending images together this is done through the add a weighted function from open CV and it's

7
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.710
actually a really simple idea.

8
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.760
It just uses both images and combines some sort of weights attached to each image or each image pixel

9
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.660
adds them together and that results in your new pixel.

10
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.910
So the formula is essentially the following.

11
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.910
The new pixel in the new blended image is equal to some value alpha of your choosing times.

12
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:52.820
The first pixel in the first image plus some value Bayda that you also the side times the second pixel

13
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.760
a second image at the same location and then if you want you can optionals add in a gamma factor.

14
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.210
All you're doing here is you're doing a weighted sum.

15
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.850
If you want pixel 1 from the first image to be more represented you would just make a higher alpha value.

16
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.680
If you want the image from pixel to or the second image to be less represented in the blended version

17
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.470
you would just lower your beta value.

18
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.520
So I need to do is just alpha and beta to your choosing and you can have the image one show up stronger

19
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.480
in the blended image or image to show up stronger.

20
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.490
And if you want you can also add in a gamma value to manipulate the image.

21
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.260
Further for the blended image.

22
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.590
OK so if that being said we're going to explore the syntax for open in this lecture.

23
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.110
It gets a little bit complicated when your images are not the same size.

24
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.790
Yet the little bit of masking so will show you how to do that.

25
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.300
We're going to start off with some simple examples where we just blend in and add and paste images together

26
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.370
that are the same size and that will do a more complex example where we actually have images of different

27
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.100
sizes and then we blend them on top of each other.

28
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.980
Let's get started.

29
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.750
All right here I am at a new notebook.

30
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.380
I'm just going to import CB2.

31
00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.810
That's all we need for now.

32
00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.490
Let's open up the images that we're gonna be working with.

33
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.650
The first image is going to be the dog backpack.

34
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.540
Image will say CB2 image read and the pinning on where your data folder is.

35
00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:08.830
Go ahead and read it in.

36
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.120
In my case it's in the same directory as this notebook so I'm going to read in dog backpack and then

37
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.370
Image 2 is going to be CB2 in read and in this one.

38
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.340
We're gonna go ahead and grab what's known as a watermark so we'll say a watermark.

39
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.880
No copy and I'm actually then going to convert these to the right color because remember CB2 read them

40
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.930
in as blue green red and we actually want to read them in as red green blue which means right after

41
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:45.480
these lines we'll say image one is equal to CB2 thought CVT color and we'll pass an image one and then

42
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.220
whoops pass an image one and say CB2 and color.

43
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:59.810
We're going to say underscore are to our G-B and we're going to copy and paste this command and do the

44
00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.380
same thing for image too.

45
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.610
So just replace that one with Fatou there.

46
00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.480
OK so that loads them up and does the color correction.

47
00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:09.940
Let's do a quick showing of these.

48
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.830
If we want to show them we first set the import plot lib.

49
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:21.640
Hi plot's as Piazzi and also do that plotless in line for that you put in your book users will say fealty

50
00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.350
show and we're going to do here is show the first one.

51
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:26.380
So there it is.

52
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.940
There's that cute dog in the backpack.

53
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:34.980
And let's see the second one show image to and this is a do not copy.

54
00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.180
So something to note here is that these are actually not the same size.

55
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.590
And you can see this right off the bat with diamond and shown the dog in the backpack is from 0 to around

56
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.810
4500 on the y axis and 0.

57
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:54.890
Probably around 800 on the x axis and then Image 2 on the y axis goes from zero to a little over 200

58
00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.870
and then 0 to a little over twelve hundred.

59
00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:04.020
And if we actually check the shapes themselves to get the exact Minchin's you can see here the shape

60
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.100
of image Schwann.

61
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.130
So these them insurance plus the three color channels and then image too.

62
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:10.920
You can check the shape of that one.

63
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.370
And again it looks like it's almost square but it's actually not.

64
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.350
And then we have the three color channels.

65
00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.630
Let's start off by actually resizing these images so we can show you how you can directly paste images

66
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.860
on top of each other and blend them together.

67
00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.170
So I will resize the images so that they are equal to each other and let's resize them both to be twelve

68
00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:30.400
hundred by twelve hundred.

69
00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.630
That will the store this dog backpack image.

70
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:33.610
So keep that in mind.

71
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:39.000
But right now we're going to go with the simple example of not having to create a mask because often

72
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.950
when you look the sort of things up online they're conveniently the same size and then they don't show

73
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.480
you how to actually blend images together at different sizes so we're going to show you both if they're

74
00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.160
the same size.

75
00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.080
It's a lot easier if they're not same size.

76
00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.270
It's a bit trickier.

77
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.530
Let's start off with blending images that are the same size.

78
00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.740
We'll say blending images of the same size.

79
00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:01.270
OK.

80
00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:08.690
So first thing we do is just resize them we'll say image one is equal to CB2 number we can resize images

81
00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:15.980
and then we'll say told a hundred by 12 hundred on the copy and paste this command and then just change

82
00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:21.660
it from image 1 to image to and that will resize the images.

83
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.700
Now keep in mind they're going to be slightly distorted now.

84
00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:29.280
So I noticed the dog backpack Smith squeezed a little bit to these dimensions as well as the do not

85
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.420
copy although it's much closer to the Do Not copies original dimensions so it really doesn't look that

86
00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:34.470
squeeze.

87
00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:40.170
Now let's go ahead and blend the images using that image formula that we saw earlier the way we do this

88
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.700
is actually pretty simple.

89
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:50.490
All we do is we say blended or whatever variable you want to use when it is equal to CB2 And then when

90
00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.970
we use that add weight add function dimension and the ADD weighted function if you do shift tab here

91
00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.410
on Jupiter it'll show you it take source 1.

92
00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:02.530
That's the first image plus some alpha value that you want to multiply sourced one by then source 2

93
00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.720
plus some beta value that you want to multiply it by and then an optional gamma.

94
00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:08.240
Let's try it out.

95
00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:15.360
We're going to say that our source one image is the dog backpack image so image one and we'll have that

96
00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:25.370
be alpha 0.5 source 2 is going to be image number two and we'll have that beta value also be equal to

97
00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:26.120
0.5.

98
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:31.970
So essentially we're going to see both images more or less the same amount and I don't want anything

99
00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:33.750
else so I'll say Gamma's equal to zero.

100
00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:40.800
And could play around at these values as you see fit will say you'll see him show blended.

101
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:45.800
And if you check up blended we have equal amounts of representation from the dog and the backpack image

102
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.900
as well as do not copy image.

103
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.250
Notice that the do not copy had white as a background.

104
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:55.130
So you do see that white showing up on top of that dog backpack image which is why the dog backpack

105
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.660
looks a little more faded.

106
00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:01.700
Now let's imagine that we really wanted image want to shine a lot more so we could give it a much higher

107
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:05.120
alpha value and give image to a much lower beta value.

108
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.140
And if you were to rerun this you'll notice now you can barely see the do not copy.

109
00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.040
On top of the original image.

110
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:15.740
So that's how you can manipulate the actual blending through the Alpha and Beta values.

111
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:19.840
And then you can also experiment with the gamma and see if that affects anything.

112
00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:23.630
Oftentimes the really most important parts are the alpha and beta.

113
00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:29.260
OK so now let's go ahead and show you how you can overlay images of different sizes.

114
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:32.190
So far we've been lucky these two images were the same size.

115
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:37.680
If you try to do this exact same process of images that are different sizes you end up getting air.

116
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:39.800
So we're going to show you two operations.

117
00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:47.540
The first operation we're going to show is how can you make it appear to overlay a small image on top

118
00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:49.090
of a larger image.

119
00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:58.180
And this is going to be with no blending so no blending and all this is actually going to be it's essentially

120
00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:02.880
going to be a numb pie reassignment operation.

121
00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:08.080
So we're just going to take the values of the larger image and reassign them to equal the smaller image

122
00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:10.060
in a particular section of the larger image.

123
00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:11.580
So we're going to work through that one.

124
00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:21.970
And then the second one we're going to show you is how you can blend together images of different sizes.

125
00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:27.590
Essentially the same thing as we're going to do here except we will be blending the images together.

126
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.320
So in this first one we're going to do a straight up overlay.

127
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.380
You won't see the original image underneath.

128
00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:34.720
And then the second one will actually blend them together.

129
00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:39.070
But unfortunately when you're blending them together you can no longer use this add waited.

130
00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.610
So this ad wait it only works when the images are the same size.

131
00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:46.100
It's a little bit more complicated if your images are different sizes.

132
00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:51.070
Let's start off with the simpler overlaying small image on top of a larger image.

133
00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:51.920
OK.

134
00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:57.800
In order to make sure this works I'm going to reload the images so we'll come up here and a copy and

135
00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:04.050
paste these four lines of code that loaded the images going to run that.

136
00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:06.390
And let's take image.

137
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.470
That's the smaller SD watermark.

138
00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:09.290
No copy.

139
00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:14.140
And I'm going to resize it to be a lot smaller so let's make it 600 by 600.

140
00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:20.070
Well say image 2 is equal to CB2 resize.

141
00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:26.090
I'll take that image too and then I will resize it to 600 by 600.

142
00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:27.020
OK.

143
00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:29.200
So let's check out what that looks like now.

144
00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:36.490
I'll say it show on image 2 and notice now it's dimensions only go from 600 to 600.

145
00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:42.890
And if I take a look at the dog backpack image which is now image one that goes from zero all the way

146
00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:49.530
to 4800 on the y axis and 0 all the way to around a 100 something on the x axis.

147
00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:51.700
So I can easily fit the 600 by 600.

148
00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:59.030
Do not copy somewhere onto this larger image and it's a lot easier to keep track of the images if you

149
00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:02.090
label one large image and another one small image.

150
00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.100
Let's do that now.

151
00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:07.910
I will say large image is equal to image 1.

152
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:12.980
The dog backpack image and small image is equal to image 2.

153
00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.730
That is the resized do not copy.

154
00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:22.310
And then what I need to do is figure out the actual logic of taking a chunk of the larger image pixel

155
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:28.570
values and replacing them with the entirety of this smaller image and it's actually pretty straightforward.

156
00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:36.470
If you feel comfortable with some pie slicing So all you need to do is say X offset and y offset.

157
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:42.860
These are going to this is going to stand as your markers of where you actually start the image and

158
00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.140
where we're actually going to overlay the image.

159
00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:47.370
In this case we'll start at the top left corner.

160
00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:52.150
So I will set my X and Y offset to 0 and then later I'll play around these values.

161
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:59.990
So basically what that means is I intend to paste this do not copy image over here at 0 0 0 0 0 0 that's

162
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:01.170
the top left corner.

163
00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:04.310
So that will be my X offset and my y offset.

164
00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:12.470
Then I need to figure out where I'm going to end my X slice and where I'm going to end my y slice.

165
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:17.780
Keep in mind we usually don't make all these variables just do this as a simple command but I think

166
00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:19.630
it's a little helpful in the explanations.

167
00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:24.590
If you actually provide the variable names so we have X offset in our way offset how are we going to

168
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:32.110
define X and well X and is essentially your offset plus the length of x in the smaller image.

169
00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:40.840
So all we need to do is say X offset plus the length of X and the small image which in our case is going

170
00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:43.390
to be equal to the actual columns.

171
00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:47.470
So that's the second or index one of the small image shape.

172
00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:51.760
So we'll take the small image grab that shape which remember returns a tuple.

173
00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:55.040
So if we check this out we'd run this.

174
00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:59.010
So along the x that's actually this number right here 600.

175
00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:05.660
So we're going to say grab that one and it's a really similar logical process for white ends.

176
00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.060
It's just your offset.

177
00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:14.200
Plus how tall your small images and your small image how tall it is equal to shape 0.

178
00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.310
OK so we're going to run that.

179
00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:23.660
And now we have x and y end and then all we need to do is say take the large image and you're going

180
00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:33.500
to grab some chunk of X and then some chunk of y and reassign it to be equal to the small image and

181
00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:38.360
it's a little backwards that we have to think about it because of the way Pye's thinking about X and

182
00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:41.520
Y versus the way your image is thinking about X and Y.

183
00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:50.330
So notice PI thinks of these columns as the x axis here and these y values those are essentially non-pilot

184
00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:51.080
rows.

185
00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:55.660
So keep in mind it gets a little tricky thinking about which one comes first the x or the Y.

186
00:12:55.670 --> 00:13:02.840
So in this case when we're seeing large image it should be from the Y offset first sliced all the way

187
00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:11.090
to y ends Khama the X offset sliced all the way to the X end.

188
00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:12.400
Let's run that.

189
00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:21.240
And now if I check out what my large image looks like I have successfully overlaid the do not copy starting

190
00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:22.040
at this point.

191
00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:28.890
00 So again all we're really doing here is just measuring out a chunk of the larger image that happens

192
00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:34.860
to have the exact same dimensions as the small image and then we're just replacing out those values.

193
00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:36.610
Notice here there is no blending.

194
00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:41.340
All we're doing is we're grabbing a chunk of the original large image and then replacing it with a smaller

195
00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:42.080
image.

196
00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:43.200
It's as simple as that.

197
00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:45.160
And we can do that with simple non-pay.

198
00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:49.920
You don't have to do all these in-between variable steps you could just put this all in one giant one

199
00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:50.420
liner.

200
00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:55.720
But for explanatory purposes I think it's a little easier to see out the variables in your actual notebook.

201
00:13:55.740 --> 00:14:01.470
We don't take this extra step of X and Y and we just stick those out into this large image re-assignment.

202
00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:02.250
OK.

203
00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:07.650
So that's how you can overlay images at different sizes essentially just swapping out original information.

204
00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:12.450
Now we're going to do is show you in the next lecture how to blend images of different sizes.

205
00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:13.270
We'll see you there.

206
00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:14.800
Continue right where we left off.
