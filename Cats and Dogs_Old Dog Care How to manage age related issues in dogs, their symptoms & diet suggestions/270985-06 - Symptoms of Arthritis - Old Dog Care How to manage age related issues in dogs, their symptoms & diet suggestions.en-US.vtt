00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.550
arthritis,

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:02.570
in simple words,

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:04.850
means inflammation of the joints.

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.610
It is the most common health problem in order.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:08.400
Canines,

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.630
though there are many forms off arthritis.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:17.460
But what we are going to discuss in this course is osteoarthritis or degenerative joint

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.060
disease,

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.750
as this is the mean arthritis found in senior doors.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.240
If your foot is in his golden years,

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.650
you should keep a close eye for the symptoms off this disease.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:34.110
The initial signs of arthritis are very mild and becomes apparent only when major damage

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.730
has been done.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.970
If arthritis is detected in its initial stage,

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.280
it is much easier to manage and treat this condition.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.680
Therefore,

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.730
as a back period,

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.180
it becomes imperative for you to understand the subtle signs that can indicate that your

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.450
dog is suffering from this joint disease.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:58.850
If he can't sit comfortably or takes extra precaution while getting up or lying down,

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.150
this condition happens because off the pain in his joints.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.790
If you observe stiffness in his book,

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.750
it can be an indication that your dog is suffering from arthritis.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.410
A dog suffering from this condition.

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.050
We often limb or re favor one or more off his legs.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.740
If you notice excessive looking off joints by your pooch.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.460
It can be a possible symptom off this condition.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.680
One of the certain symptoms of arthritis is that change in his personality,

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.450
and he seems to be depressed and irritated all the time.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.690
But if he hesitated to jump and struggles to get on the couch or into the car,

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.750
if he's reluctant to play and faces problem by climbing stairs,

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.350
it may be due to the pain in his joints.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.470
Another symptom can be if he's lethargic and sleeps more than the usual.
