00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.430
can I in cognitive dysfunction,

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:03.660
or CCD?

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.810
As a dog enters his golden years ves back.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.810
Parents limit our imagination only to physical changes in him,

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.840
like being less energetic and enthusiastic.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.610
But it may commence help price to many of you that dogs to go through mantles in your

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:21.380
moments.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.410
Human artists that he gets stuck behind the couch or forgets to breed you at the door when

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:28.350
you come back home.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:34.380
It might be that he's that he's suffering from memory loss similar to dementia or

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.790
Alzheimer's in humans.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.660
This condition in dogs is called canine cognitive dysfunction,

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:47.300
but you need to be very regional and so identify the symptoms off CCDI as many times.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.140
These symptoms can be due to some other medical conditions as well.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.250
Initial symptoms off so city are very mild and or fund worsened as the time progresses.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.740
In veterinary studies.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:00.610
Generally,

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.990
the shy Cronin is used to identify and characterize.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.080
The teen is associated with CCDI.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.480
No,

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.150
let's discuss each one off them in detail.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.660
1st 1 on the list is disorientation.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:19.470
If you don't get stuck in family A places like in the corner of a room or behind the

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.850
furniture this confusion and inability to make sense off the space around him signals

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.180
towards disorientation.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.520
Your dog staring at the blank walls without any purpose or wandering aimlessly in the house

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.880
should also be a cause of concern for you.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.430
Dogs are fond of food,

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.400
and therefore it can be a potential signal off.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.450
See city if you find stubble in finding his favorite food and water bowls,

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.300
if you find him walking in cycles,

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.980
there is a clear indication that he's suffering from this disease.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.320
It is a very sad state,

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.320
if you put forgets that route off his daily VOCs,

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.210
though you have been going on the same route for all these years.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.180
But because of Mandalay Klein,

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.050
he's unable to remember the route,

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:12.050
but it is suggested to first take him to a vet to rule out the possibility of brain human

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.650
alderden directions.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.460
You will start observing our difference in his interactions with everyone around him.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.880
You're one socially active dog.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.190
Me now prefer to be left alone in one corner of the host and may get in more in fewer

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.600
social in directions.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.790
He even develops compulsive disorders like excessive barking and licking himself without

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:35.490
any reason,

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.850
he might also not be able to recognize familiar people and objects around him.

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.990
But for this first,

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:49.820
ensure that he's not suffering from hearing impairment or blindness sleep cycle are disturb

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.820
.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.950
Sleep pattern is one of the more specific indicators for CCDI.

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:59.080
If you're so that your dog is having older sleeping and waking cycles,

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.810
that is,

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.140
if he sleeps during the day and remains awake and confused at night,

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.850
it is a clear sign that he is suffering from this condition.

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.550
How sweetly,

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:15.680
if you don't loses control over his bladder and peeps are poops inside the house,

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.270
even after being house doing it can be a possible signal for this condition.

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.530
In such cases,

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.980
it is recommended to first too loud that there are no other medical issues like urinary or

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.290
fecal incontinence,

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:37.920
kidney infections or diabetes activity level those suffering from CCD or functionally

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.770
please response to the external stimulation they know more like to explore this around

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:43.130
these,

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.500
as they earlier used to.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.980
For example,

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.980
if you stopped responding to your command booties,

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.680
his favorite bowl or toys,

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.290
But first rule out,

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.950
he's not suffering from any mobility disorder or blindness.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:02.250
It might be disheartening to see your job not greeting you at the door like I used to.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.900
But this is one of the harsh realities that you need to accept if your dog is suffering

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:08.780
from CCDI.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.750
If he gets more anxious and infuriated than before,

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:20.360
it is also a signal that he's suffering from this condition or if he shows less interest in

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.800
food and toys,

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.840
which used to entice him earlier,

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.310
can indicate that the dog is suffering from C City.
