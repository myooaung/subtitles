00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.840
fall.

00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.670
Other lister action points you case your dog is having a seizure.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.050
The first step for you is to stay calm and not a penny.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.770
However dreadful and disturbing the seizures may appear.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.040
They're not being full for your dog.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:21.690
Don't try to move your dog unless he's at the place where he can hurt himself like near a

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.190
staircase or a balcony.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.060
And even in case you are required to move him,

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.880
do this by gently dreading his rear legs.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.830
If possible,

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.940
it is suggested to clear off all the objects near him that might hurt your dog.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.650
Like to use table or any other sharp objects.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.500
A dog can never sell Lewiston,

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.420
so it is recommended not to put your hands in or near his mouth as he may inadvertently

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.150
injure your head because he's not in his senses during this situation,

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.670
trying to time and record the seizure,

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:56.670
if possible,

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.710
as it can be,

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:04.210
great clue for you yet to determine the type and because of the seizure during seizures are

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.360
don't my defecate or urinate involuntarily,

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.040
so placing some newspapers or plastic sheets under him might be useful.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.200
No long seizures may lead to overheating in your door.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.430
Therefore,

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.590
try to cool him down by putting some cold water on his pose in case off the seizure,

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.110
lasting for more than five minutes immediately concerned.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:33.880
You it in case your dog has a history of seizures and you feel that another one is about to

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:34.550
happen.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:35.850
Follow these steps.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.250
Take him to a comfortable,

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.580
safe and soft area where there is minimal chance off him getting hurt and show that there

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.850
are no shot objects lying around in that area.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.010
If possible,

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.550
bringing him outside on the soft grass might help him.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:02:00.550
Newspaper and plastic sheets shall be placed under him to manage any soiling accident.
