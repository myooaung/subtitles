00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900
loss of hearing across,

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:09.820
primarily if transfer of sound waves to interfere or from here to brain is impeded several

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:10.490
situations.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:16.500
Leading toe hearing loss can be awaited by taking proper precautions and care off your dog

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:16.500
,

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.050
but this can only be achieved if you're aware of the underlying causes for these conditions

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.050
.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.020
The most common reason for hearing loss in senior dogs is now degeneration,

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.150
similar to what we human space in our old age.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.230
The function off these knows,

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.840
is to transfer the sound waves from here to bring so any damage,

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:37.520
injury,

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.590
inflammation or degeneration off these nerves can lead to a poor transmission or no

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.250
transmission to the brain does leading to hearing impairment.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:53.240
Sometimes infection or the position of excessive X in the ear can block the transmission

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.510
off sound signals and just leading to hearing laws.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.400
But this condition is template E and can believe us if treated properly.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.970
Any injury in the year or in the brain can also lead to a state of deafness as it impacts

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.050
the transmission and reception off sound signals.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.830
Occasionally,

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.940
this condition also results from the side effects of certain drugs.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:17.630
They're deep,

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.190
which has taken in the bust.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.440
What it can be due to exposure to certain has are this heavy matters like lead,

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.250
arsenic and mercury.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.980
So it is always recommended to keep household items containing these metals like pains

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:33.500
plumbing,

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.240
materia,

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.320
gold bull,

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.920
etcetera out of reach of your bets.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.090
Consistent and repeated exposure to loud noises can also lead to a state of deafness.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.350
For example,

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.010
noise off heavy machinery,

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.740
loud music and sound of fire arms therefore,

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.550
actually people to minimize exposure to such low noises,

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:55.870
after all,

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.190
and also prevention is worth a pound of cure.
