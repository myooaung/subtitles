00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.190
Hello and welcome to the lesson.

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.515
In this lesson, I want to explain why you should create and sell FFTs.

00:00:07.515 --> 00:00:11.085
The first reason is to expand your product line.

00:00:11.085 --> 00:00:13.364
If you are painting, for example,

00:00:13.364 --> 00:00:15.495
they don't need me to tell you,

00:00:15.495 --> 00:00:19.510
allowed it is to survive just home setting paintings.

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.824
As a painter, you can turn your paintings into an NFT.

00:00:23.824 --> 00:00:25.295
And by doing that,

00:00:25.295 --> 00:00:29.285
you have just created for yourself and additional stream of income,

00:00:29.285 --> 00:00:32.045
you are creating these additional stream of income,

00:00:32.045 --> 00:00:36.590
not by creating a brand new painting that might take you days,

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.560
weeks, months, or even years to create.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.795
But by converting your existing painting into an NFT.

00:00:44.795 --> 00:00:49.894
Also, you will not sell this NFT in a dormant market,

00:00:49.894 --> 00:00:53.630
but you will be sending it in a violent goin market,

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.845
which is where our world seems to be going towards.

00:00:57.845 --> 00:01:04.295
The secondary reason for creating and selling NFT is to create passive income streams.

00:01:04.295 --> 00:01:07.235
This point is really a game changer.

00:01:07.235 --> 00:01:08.930
When you sell your NFT,

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:15.350
you can include a computer program which is called spot contract inside your NFT,

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:21.110
which will enable you to get lifetime royalties from selling that NFT.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.970
Which means that if your buyer will decide to sell that NFT to someone else,

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.780
you will get a certain loyalty form that sale,

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.695
the failure isn't, is to protect your work as an artist.

00:01:33.695 --> 00:01:37.160
Nft will let you protect your walk by assigning

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.105
ownership to the person was bought your NFT.

00:01:41.105 --> 00:01:43.654
When a person buys you NFT,

00:01:43.654 --> 00:01:46.715
she becomes the owner of your NFT.

00:01:46.715 --> 00:01:51.665
The next reason is the relatively easy product creation process.

00:01:51.665 --> 00:01:58.565
Creating and selling a product is very odd and time-consuming task for many people.

00:01:58.565 --> 00:02:02.120
But the time and effort that you spend on creating

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.445
an NFT and selling it is relatively quick, easy, and affordable.

00:02:07.445 --> 00:02:10.550
Another reason is the no submission limits,

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.240
meaning you don't have to just sell one NFT.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.225
You can create an unlimited number of

00:02:17.225 --> 00:02:21.485
FTEs and each NFT can become a new income stream for you.

00:02:21.485 --> 00:02:27.305
The next reason is that your walk is sold all ill and to all the world.

00:02:27.305 --> 00:02:31.310
You can sell you my Nephthys on multiple NFT marketplaces,

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.320
which are visited by people from all around the world. 24, 7.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.225
You don't need to hire a gallery or an agent to sell your artwork.

00:02:41.225 --> 00:02:46.385
You said your outlook yourself on the various NFT marketplaces.

00:02:46.385 --> 00:02:49.145
Another reason to create and sell NFT is,

00:02:49.145 --> 00:02:54.965
is to be involved in a business which is creative and futuristic.

00:02:54.965 --> 00:02:57.980
Though many businesses that you can start,

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.840
which might make you money,

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.705
but are also very bowing in gray.

00:03:02.705 --> 00:03:06.800
So why not get into a business which is not only

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.165
cutting edge and the way our society seems to be going towards,

00:03:11.165 --> 00:03:13.865
but it's also extremely colorful,

00:03:13.865 --> 00:03:17.990
creative, and most importantly, not bowing.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.790
And the last reason that they want to share with you in this lesson is that selling

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.755
FTEs gives you the option to build a devoted community.

00:03:27.755 --> 00:03:30.725
You can create a community around your out.

00:03:30.725 --> 00:03:34.580
A fan base of people will engage with that

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.870
like what you do and care for who you are as a person,

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.360
a community which will wait for every NFT that you release to the market.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.370
Okay, so that's it for this lesson,

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.995
and I will see you in the next lesson.

00:03:48.995 --> 00:03:50.760
Goodbye.
