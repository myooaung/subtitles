00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.755
Alone, Welcome to the lesson.

00:00:01.755 --> 00:00:06.210
There is a free website that I constantly use to modify my images.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.880
And this website is called Photo Mania.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.210
You can find this website by simply typing Photo Mania on

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.530
Google and clicking on the search result.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.095
Photo effects, vertical line, photo mania.

00:00:20.095 --> 00:00:22.550
This is the website Photo Mania.net.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:23.960
And once you're on it,

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.565
just click the big pink button in the middle of the screen, edit your photos.

00:00:28.565 --> 00:00:32.660
Then the website will ask you to upload the photo that you want to modify.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.270
And you can either click the Facebook photos

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.810
option to upload photos from your Facebook account.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.005
All you can simply click the Upload photo option

00:00:42.005 --> 00:00:45.905
is I will do now to upload a photo from your computer.

00:00:45.905 --> 00:00:51.095
So I will just locate the photo that I want to modify on my computer.

00:00:51.095 --> 00:00:55.430
Then double left-click it or simply click it one time and then click

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:03.120
the Open button at the bottom of the open window to upload it to the photo mania website.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.555
Okay, so once I see the picture on the big display area in the middle of the website,

00:01:10.555 --> 00:01:12.475
I can either start working on it,

00:01:12.475 --> 00:01:18.010
will upload another picture by clicking the change Photo button at the top of the screen.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.740
Once you are happy with the photo, you upload it,

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.570
you can start modifying it by simply clicking on the different effects.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.550
On the left side of the screen.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.770
We have filter sketch, painting, watercolor, magical,

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:39.760
vintage textures, cartoon, pop out, and romantic filters.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.540
You can scroll between the different effects with the middle mouse button.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.715
If you have a mouse as this button,

00:01:46.715 --> 00:01:50.690
or you can simply scroll up and down by clicking and then moving

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:56.194
the gray scale bow right next to the effects representing images.

00:01:56.194 --> 00:01:59.060
I, for example, I really like the sketch effect.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.420
So I will click on the Sketch Image option and then we will

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.020
see a list of different sketches that we can choose from.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.240
And then we just need to click on the Sketch effect that we want to try out on our image.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.460
Again, we can use the school bell Oh,

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:20.030
our middle mouse button to scroll down and up and bows for the different effects.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.120
I really like the use of the Crayola effect,

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.655
so we'll click on it for this example.

00:02:25.655 --> 00:02:30.020
Great. The effect has been applied to my image and all I really need to do now,

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.520
our two simple things.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.820
Number one, remove the Photo Mania watermark at

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.405
the bottom right side of the image by simply hovering my mouse over it.

00:02:38.405 --> 00:02:41.480
And then by clicking the remove watermark option

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.945
that will appeal above the photo mania watermark.

00:02:44.945 --> 00:02:48.950
Okay, And the second thing I need to do is to download the modified image

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.255
to my computer by clicking the tiny down arrow button,

00:02:53.255 --> 00:02:55.205
which we will find above the image.

00:02:55.205 --> 00:02:56.000
That's it.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.030
The website will shortly start the download.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.804
The end the image will be on my computer.

00:03:01.804 --> 00:03:03.725
Okay, so that's it for this lesson,

00:03:03.725 --> 00:03:07.980
and I will see you in the next lesson. Goodbye.
