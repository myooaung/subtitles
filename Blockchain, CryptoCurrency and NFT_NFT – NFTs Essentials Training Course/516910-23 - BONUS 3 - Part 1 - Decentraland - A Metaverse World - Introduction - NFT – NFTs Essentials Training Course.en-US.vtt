00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.100
Bill, in this course we have

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.830
a lesson about the story of NFT.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.110
And in that lesson I briefly explained

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.840
about the dissenter land for the world.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.575
Now, in this lesson and in upcoming lessons,

00:00:13.575 --> 00:00:16.950
I want to talk about the decentralised virtual world in

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.970
more depth and explain how we can all benefit for me.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.020
If you're familiar with ONE and virtual platforms such as

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.120
Second Life or if you're familiar

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.430
with some of the open world games,

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.235
for example, then I guess that you will feel right at

00:00:32.235 --> 00:00:35.770
home when you first visit the central atom.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.745
Second Life, for example,

00:00:37.745 --> 00:00:41.690
you can explore a gigantic virtual map and interact with

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.310
the objects and people

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.310
inside the virtual wall in real time.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:47.540
Second Life also as

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.940
a virtual marketplace where they can buy and sell

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.245
virtual items with a virtual coin called Linden dollars.

00:00:54.245 --> 00:00:57.020
In the dissenter in the marketplace, you can do the same.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.540
You can buy and sell virtual wearable

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.780
for alpha taus with the dissenter and virtual coin,

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.510
which is called manner more or fail in

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.250
the same way that you can buy and sell

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.320
virtual land inside Second Life,

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.270
you can buy and sell virtual land inside the central end.

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.010
And again, like in Second Life,

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.950
you can build the structure else like ours, for example,

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.230
on your virtual and sang this,

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.510
there is a major significant difference

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.820
between Second Life and the central.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.460
And, and the difference is that in Second Life,

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.815
you don't control the platform.

00:01:30.815 --> 00:01:34.205
If Linden Lab, the company behind Second Life,

00:01:34.205 --> 00:01:36.380
goes out of business or decides to

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.815
change the walls of the Second Life virtual world.

00:01:39.815 --> 00:01:43.460
Usu Zealand need to hope that the changes will not

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.420
out what we have accomplished inside that digital world.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.844
Just as an example,

00:01:48.844 --> 00:01:51.440
if you have a virtual job inside the world of

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.830
Second Life and suddenly Linden Lab, again,

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.620
the company behind Second Life, decides to Ben,

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.300
you form the virtual mode,

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.055
then you lose your salary

00:02:01.055 --> 00:02:03.619
from that virtual job overnight.

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:05.960
Also, as I mentioned previously,

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.090
you can buy virtual land and build

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.565
structures on it in Second Life.

00:02:10.565 --> 00:02:12.200
But again, if Linden leg bends,

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.530
you change it soils or goes out of business.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.155
All the digital assets on your land,

00:02:18.155 --> 00:02:21.110
which might have taken you months or even eels to create.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.500
And also maybe a lot of money can vanish overnight.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.375
Now, the beauty of the central end

00:02:26.375 --> 00:02:28.040
is that I like Second Life,

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.080
that each ton assets that UL,

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.620
inside the central and belong to the community and

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.355
not to a single entity like Linden Labs.

00:02:37.355 --> 00:02:39.920
So in the same way that people like the idea that

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.550
the blockchain is not controlled by any bank.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.240
So do people like the idea that the digital assets are

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.975
not in the ends of a company who can appeal,

00:02:50.975 --> 00:02:52.745
bend them for whatever reason,

00:02:52.745 --> 00:02:54.560
or change its source,

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.035
not in the favor of the night.

00:02:57.035 --> 00:02:58.730
It is glad to know that in the

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.410
central and the virtual real estate

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.354
belongs to the community and not to any one entity.

00:03:04.354 --> 00:03:06.230
But it is also good to know that each

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.600
virtual wasted is not fungible,

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.940
meaning a unique item.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.925
Do you see how amazing all of this is?

00:03:13.925 --> 00:03:15.770
You see with a lesson in

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.825
this course about what admin FTEs.

00:03:17.825 --> 00:03:21.500
And in that lesson explain that an NFT means

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.460
non-fungible token or in other words, a unique item.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.975
So the Filter1 lens inside the central and really FTEs,

00:03:29.975 --> 00:03:31.490
they are unique items,

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.250
a token on the filename blockchain.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.935
Actually, they are very unique and very

00:03:36.935 --> 00:03:40.565
collectible and then have a bias on NFT marketplaces,

00:03:40.565 --> 00:03:42.140
such as open sea,

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.660
while willing to pay me and some dollars to

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.480
buy those scarce virtual lens.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.235
It might not be instant,

00:03:49.235 --> 00:03:50.945
but like with Second Life,

00:03:50.945 --> 00:03:52.370
the more hours you spend

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.580
inside central in the virtual world demo,

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.610
I believe you will see how much potential it is.

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.130
You can buy and sell virtual or real estate.

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.410
You can buy and sell wearables.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.760
And if T is in virtual art galleries and much, much more.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.365
Now in order to not

00:04:09.365 --> 00:04:11.855
overwhelm you with too much information,

00:04:11.855 --> 00:04:14.390
I will stop now, but I will continue adding

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.720
more lessons to discuss about the central end.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.295
So that's it for this lesson,

00:04:19.295 --> 00:04:23.190
and I will see you in the next lesson. Goodbye.
