00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.650
Hello and welcome to the lesson.

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.830
In this lesson, I want to share with you a website which

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.265
will let you turn your image into a work of art.

00:00:08.265 --> 00:00:10.755
The name of the website is go out.

00:00:10.755 --> 00:00:14.220
And to which it will simply need to go to Google type,

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.620
go out and placenta.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.530
Then let's click on the search result that starts with

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.995
the word go out, vertical line, photo.

00:00:22.995 --> 00:00:24.600
Then once we reach the website,

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.210
we will want to click on the Get Started caption,

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.500
which we can find inside the circle in the middle of the website.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.470
Then I will just locate the image on my computer,

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.865
click on it, and then click the Open button in the bottom of the windows.

00:00:38.865 --> 00:00:44.905
Open window. The image might take some time to load,

00:00:44.905 --> 00:00:48.010
but after it loads, you will see that the small images at

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.940
the bottom of the website below your picture will be clickable.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.495
Each of the images below represent another art movement.

00:00:55.495 --> 00:00:58.195
And you'll notice that when you click on one of them,

00:00:58.195 --> 00:01:00.025
it will affect your big Joel.

00:01:00.025 --> 00:01:03.520
Please notice that there is an arrow right next to

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.970
the last small image and the right side of the website,

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.870
which will uncover even more images for you to choose phone.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.885
You'll be able to click on the arrow a few times,

00:01:13.885 --> 00:01:15.610
and each time you click,

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.535
a new batch of OUT options will be revealed.

00:01:18.535 --> 00:01:21.220
And once you click on the arrow one time,

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.980
you will see that there is a new arrow on the left side of

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:29.390
the first image that will let you go backwards to see previous images.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.645
Once you like the effect that you have applied on your image,

00:01:32.645 --> 00:01:34.310
you can click the save option,

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.285
which is an option you will find above the last image.

00:01:38.285 --> 00:01:40.175
Okay, so that's it for this lesson,

00:01:40.175 --> 00:01:42.380
and I will see you in the next lesson.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.040
Goodbye.
