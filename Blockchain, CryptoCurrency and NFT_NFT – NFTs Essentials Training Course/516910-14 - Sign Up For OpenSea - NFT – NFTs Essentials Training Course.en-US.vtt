00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.735
Hi there.

00:00:00.735 --> 00:00:03.090
In this lesson I want to show you how to open

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.425
an account with the website that we are going to sell our nFET is on.

00:00:07.425 --> 00:00:09.990
The website is called open sea.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.640
And it is one of the biggest marketplaces in the entire Internet to set

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:20.520
NFT to which the website I will just clean my browser's address line, type open.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.505
See that i o and press Enter.

00:00:23.505 --> 00:00:24.960
Once you reach the website,

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.350
you'd want to avoid your mouse over the profile icon at

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.670
the upper right-hand corner of the website and click on the File option.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.900
Then you can either sign in with

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.740
the MetaMask wallet that we have created in a previous lesson.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.020
Or you can click, they use a different wall that

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.200
link if you are using another digital wallet.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.100
In this example, we will be using the MetaMask wallet.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.955
So let's click the blue Sign In button to sign-in.

00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:59.465
Then open civil want to connect to your MetaMask wallet.

00:00:59.465 --> 00:01:01.580
And that's what we want to do.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:07.099
So let's click the blue next button at the bottom of the pop-up window to continue,

00:01:07.099 --> 00:01:10.700
then we need to give our final consent that we want

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.465
to allow the Open Seaside to view our MetaMask wallet.

00:01:14.465 --> 00:01:17.660
And we can confirm our consent by simply clicking

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.115
the Connect button again at the bottom of the popup window.

00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:25.550
Okay, So a few seconds after we've clicked the Connect button,

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.290
we will be able to click on the main open sea website window and

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.945
confirm that our MetaMask wallet is now infect connected to the open sea website.

00:01:35.945 --> 00:01:39.080
We can confirm that by seeing the colored icon at

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.140
the upper right hand corner of the website and in the middle

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:48.260
of the website and the world are named under the color icon in the middle of this site.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.165
Okay, so that's it for this lesson,

00:01:50.165 --> 00:01:53.700
and I will see you in the next lesson. Goodbye.
