00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.755
Hello and welcome to the lesson.

00:00:01.755 --> 00:00:04.860
In this lesson I want to explain what an NFT,

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.580
these FFT stands for, non-fungible tokens.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.940
Non-fungible means nano replaceable,

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.055
or in other words, unique.

00:00:14.055 --> 00:00:16.125
Now, in the physical world,

00:00:16.125 --> 00:00:22.005
what items do we consider unique and what items do we consider non-unique?

00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:27.580
A great way to understand that is to simply open one of the lawyers in your house.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.180
In your house dwells,

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.145
you might find a few $1 bills and you might find a baseball card.

00:00:34.145 --> 00:00:37.235
Now, how this relates to unique end,

00:00:37.235 --> 00:00:40.685
non-unique items in the physical offline world,

00:00:40.685 --> 00:00:43.250
a baseball card is unique item.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.135
Why?

00:00:44.135 --> 00:00:47.825
Because different baseball cards as different values.

00:00:47.825 --> 00:00:52.925
The value of a baseball card is determined by the player on the Cloud,

00:00:52.925 --> 00:00:56.210
the counts condition and the carts reality.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.575
Those factors give different basal coats, different values.

00:01:00.575 --> 00:01:03.695
So a baseball card is unique item.

00:01:03.695 --> 00:01:06.230
Now, what is a non-unique item?

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.210
A $1 bill, for example,

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.785
is a non-unique item.

00:01:09.785 --> 00:01:12.650
If you have a few $1 bills in your Doyle,

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.660
it will not matter which one of those you will take with you to a all foods supermarket,

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:23.420
for example, to buy apples because all $1 bills all the same value.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.005
So the basal code and the $1 bill,

00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:32.615
I'll physical items in our physical toil in the physical world.

00:01:32.615 --> 00:01:35.450
But we also have a digital world, the Internet.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:43.010
Digital drawables, meaning computer folders and digital assets, aka digital files.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.965
Digital file, exactly like physical items,

00:01:45.965 --> 00:01:48.619
can also be unique and non-unique.

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.775
Let's take, for example, non-unique digital file.

00:01:52.775 --> 00:01:54.365
A Bitcoin, for example,

00:01:54.365 --> 00:01:55.865
is a non-unique file.

00:01:55.865 --> 00:02:02.210
In the same way that you can buy apples at all foods with anyone of you $1 bills.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.160
You can buy apples at all foods with any one of your Bitcoins.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.290
All bitcoins have the same value.

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:14.435
And there isn't a certain Bitcoin wolf more than another Bitcoin.

00:02:14.435 --> 00:02:17.885
So bitcoins are non-unique digital files like

00:02:17.885 --> 00:02:22.130
the $1 physical bills that we might find in our oil.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.020
But what about the baseball card that we may also find in our Doyle?

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.390
What is the equivalent of a retro baseball card in the digital world?

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.715
The equivalent is a real file,

00:02:34.715 --> 00:02:37.805
demo, where the file is demo itself.

00:02:37.805 --> 00:02:40.580
Now, how does a digital file becomes,

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.800
will it become swell in the same way that a physical item becomes?

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.590
Well, if a certain person creates a file,

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.580
let's say, a digital image that many people want to have.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.260
And it is one of a kind,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.770
for example, then this file becomes will.

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.660
This was exactly the case in

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.730
the world's first live auction for Digital out in debt auction,

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.340
digital card called homeopathy was sold for $420 thousand.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.150
So now going full circle to what NFT means.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.739
As I said, n F stands for non-fungible, meaning nano replaceable,

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.805
a unique item like digital owner pepper cod,

00:03:22.805 --> 00:03:25.130
end the letter T in the world.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.665
Nft stands for token,

00:03:27.665 --> 00:03:30.110
meaning a digital certificate.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.075
When you buy a digital file,

00:03:32.075 --> 00:03:34.925
you also get a digital certificate that

00:03:34.925 --> 00:03:39.065
proves that you are the only rightful owner of that file.

00:03:39.065 --> 00:03:45.530
So we can also say that NFP stands for unique digital certificates.

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.760
Now, some may think that the digital file that was sold

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.080
for $320 thousand was just a rebel Cohen's.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.340
And that digital out-of-box overall can sell for much.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.770
But nothing can be further from the truth.

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.385
Digital art pieces sold all the time.

00:04:04.385 --> 00:04:06.575
For example, an NBA Topshop,

00:04:06.575 --> 00:04:10.265
basically a basketball highlight of Jim slab one,

00:04:10.265 --> 00:04:13.805
sold for nearly $400 thousand.

00:04:13.805 --> 00:04:16.235
The music band Kings of Leon,

00:04:16.235 --> 00:04:20.750
as made nearly $2 million from NFT album sales.

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.390
The CEO of Twitter, Jack Dorsey,

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:29.090
is first tweet was sold as an NFT for 2.9 million dollars.

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:35.675
There is also the Altis Grimes who has sold NFT is for a total of $6 million.

00:04:35.675 --> 00:04:40.340
Lastly, in my list of examples that digital art is people sold

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.875
a single digital Outlook as an NFT for $69 million.

00:04:45.875 --> 00:04:47.705
Okay, So that's it for this lesson.

00:04:47.705 --> 00:04:49.850
And I will see you in the next lesson.

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.540
Goodbye.
