00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
Hello and welcome to the lesson.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.030
In this lesson, I want to give you an exercise that I would love for you to complete.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.565
It is not a difficult exercise at all.

00:00:08.565 --> 00:00:12.134
All you'll need to do is to simply go for the previous lessons

00:00:12.134 --> 00:00:16.560
and then implement the tasks that I outlined in the checklist.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.795
So let's go over these checklists together.

00:00:18.795 --> 00:00:21.970
I will include this checklist in the resource area.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.240
Step 1, decide on what NFT you want to create.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:33.455
Do you want to show a cat in your NFT or maybe it will be an NFT that shows us step 2,

00:00:33.455 --> 00:00:35.975
choose the format of the NFT.

00:00:35.975 --> 00:00:41.570
Will you NFT be an image and audio and animation or maybe a video.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.135
Step 3 created the NFT.

00:00:44.135 --> 00:00:47.540
The NFT creation videos that I've included in this training

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.305
can help you with that step for setup and MetaMask wallet.

00:00:51.305 --> 00:00:54.770
Step 5, sign-up with open, see that I owe.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.310
You can also choose to sign up with livable.com,

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:03.785
mean double.com, or with any ideal NFT marketplace that lets you sell FFTs.

00:01:03.785 --> 00:01:06.560
Step 6, create an open sea listing,

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.990
meaning upload your file to open C and then create the listing that will sell it.

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.305
Step 7, fund your MetaMask wallet.

00:01:15.305 --> 00:01:18.350
Once open C shows you the listing fee that

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.515
you will need to pay to list your item on the website.

00:01:21.515 --> 00:01:26.735
You can then add funds to your MetaMask wallet so it will cover the listing fee.

00:01:26.735 --> 00:01:29.585
Step 8, the open sea listing fee,

00:01:29.585 --> 00:01:32.150
and least you NFT step 9,

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.000
create a social media account on Instagram,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.625
on Tiktok, on YouTube, and settler.

00:01:37.625 --> 00:01:42.980
Step then promote your open sea account on your social media account.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:43.790
That's it.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.535
If you've completed the 10 steps and you now have an NFT listed in your open sea account,

00:01:49.535 --> 00:01:51.919
then you can send me a link, a screenshot,

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:55.880
or a video that shows your NFT in your open sea account.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.765
You can also feel free to include your exercise in your portfolio.

00:01:59.765 --> 00:02:03.485
You have my permission and say that this is something that you have made.

00:02:03.485 --> 00:02:08.165
And it is, I feel that this lesson is one of the most valuable lessons in this course.

00:02:08.165 --> 00:02:11.570
Because if you complete all the tests in the checklist,

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.000
then you can really tell yourself that you have

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.730
understood the lessons that you have watched.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.505
Not just theoretically, but practically,

00:02:19.505 --> 00:02:25.160
there is something about doing things ourselves and overcoming obstacles that we

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.325
encounter along the way when we learn anything new

00:02:28.325 --> 00:02:31.865
that make us really understand a topic passively,

00:02:31.865 --> 00:02:34.340
listening to videos doesn't do it,

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.645
at least not for me.

00:02:35.645 --> 00:02:38.465
I know that not all the people are like me.

00:02:38.465 --> 00:02:39.740
Now if you get stuck,

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.160
then just re-watch the previous lessons in this course.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.760
And of course, I'm always here for you if you need my help.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.365
So that's it for this lesson,

00:02:48.365 --> 00:02:50.585
and I will see you in the next lesson.

00:02:50.585 --> 00:02:52.290
Goodbye.
