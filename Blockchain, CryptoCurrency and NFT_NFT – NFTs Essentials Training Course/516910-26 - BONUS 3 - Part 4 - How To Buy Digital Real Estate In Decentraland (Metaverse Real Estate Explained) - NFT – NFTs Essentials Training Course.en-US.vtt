00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.830
Hello and welcome to the lesson.

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:05.130
In this lesson, I want to show
you how people buy, sell,

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.670
and even a rent virtual
real estate in the central

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.170
and LMP in the central and
ease non-fungible token.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.065
Digital asset, meaning an NFT

00:00:16.065 --> 00:00:18.345
and one cylinder
has been purchased.

00:00:18.345 --> 00:00:21.900
The owner of the land gets
a unique token which is

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.560
maintained in helium
smart contract.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.130
In simple words, when a person
buys a landing the central

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.630
and the transaction is

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.835
recorded on the
filename blockchain.

00:00:32.835 --> 00:00:36.930
And then the new owner as
proof that he or she is

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.050
the owner that lend

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.260
the central end lengths
extremely desirable,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.615
and thus they sell
for a lot of money.

00:00:44.615 --> 00:00:49.055
Some of those plots of land
sold for millions of dollars.

00:00:49.055 --> 00:00:50.990
The owner of the land can build

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.210
structures on easily Ireland

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.640
almost different kinds of events

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.030
and create different
types of activities.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.830
For example, the owner of

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.990
the land can also
end ease away or

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.490
lend to other people who
websites such as the CLV,

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.330
thing.com, rentable.com,
and on Open.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.235
See that i o, for example,

00:01:13.235 --> 00:01:15.260
the different kinds of lens

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.405
that one can purchase
on the central and

00:01:17.405 --> 00:01:22.225
the vowel one-by-one land
plots called paresis.

00:01:22.225 --> 00:01:26.290
Quarterly, there are 90,601

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.915
pill cells in the
central and in total,

00:01:28.915 --> 00:01:31.570
and the dimensions of 52 feet by

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.875
52 feet or 16 by 16 meters.

00:01:35.875 --> 00:01:37.690
If you use the metric system.

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.340
And owner can buy two or
more directly adjacent cells

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.130
and create form then any state.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.740
Now a person can
purchase land on the

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.440
central and form two
different marketplaces.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.705
One is the dissenter
in marketplace

00:01:52.705 --> 00:01:55.360
and the other is the
open sea marketplace.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.355
And just as a reminder,

00:01:57.355 --> 00:02:00.130
lens on the central
end and FTEs.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.910
And thus after the
purchase that transaction

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.165
we be stored on the
filename block chain.

00:02:05.165 --> 00:02:06.470
So the new Arno,

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.810
we live a poof of ESOL,

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.535
ownership of the client.

00:02:10.535 --> 00:02:13.100
Now you can access the
Decentralized marketplace

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.680
for the official
decentralized website,

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.265
which you can find if you go
to the central end that OK.

00:02:19.265 --> 00:02:22.040
Once you're on Central and.org,

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.080
just click the marketplace link

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.520
at the top of the website.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.015
And then you will be directed
to the marketplace website,

00:02:29.015 --> 00:02:30.690
which is located on

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.025
a market that the
central and that OK.

00:02:34.025 --> 00:02:36.290
The first thing we will
want to do once we reach

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.830
the marketplace is to click
the Start browsing button.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.515
Now we can see that
the central and map,

00:02:42.515 --> 00:02:45.710
the light blue highlighted
areas that see

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.540
on the map are the only areas

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.145
that are currently for sale.

00:02:49.145 --> 00:02:51.035
And if we press their own cell

00:02:51.035 --> 00:02:53.615
toggle button at the
right side of the screen,

00:02:53.615 --> 00:02:56.600
it will turn off and
then we will just see

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.975
the areas on the map
that are not for sale.

00:02:59.975 --> 00:03:03.635
If we click the white icon
next to the toggle button,

00:03:03.635 --> 00:03:05.630
we will be able to
see the marketplace

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.970
listing full a different view.

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.500
Left with a toggle button.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.715
We have a drop-down list,

00:03:10.715 --> 00:03:13.865
which by default shows
us the newest listings.

00:03:13.865 --> 00:03:15.965
And we can click
the drop-down list

00:03:15.965 --> 00:03:18.245
to change the order
of the listings.

00:03:18.245 --> 00:03:20.780
For example, let's
select cheapest to see

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.840
the cheapest lens that
are currently for sale.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.580
The price or selling manner,

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.080
which is the coin that is

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.825
used in the decentralized world.

00:03:29.825 --> 00:03:31.190
And again, as before,

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.435
we have the same preview,

00:03:32.435 --> 00:03:35.705
teaser information about
the land under the image.

00:03:35.705 --> 00:03:37.535
And if we click the
lens, the image,

00:03:37.535 --> 00:03:38.780
we can go inside it's

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.180
listing and get some
more information.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.790
There are also different
sorting options that we

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.775
can choose from at the
left side of the page.

00:03:46.775 --> 00:03:49.295
Now let's turn that
toggle button back on

00:03:49.295 --> 00:03:52.115
so we can see the lens which
are currently for sale.

00:03:52.115 --> 00:03:53.450
We can now, for example,

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.750
just hover over one of the
lens which are for sale.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.080
And once we place our mouse
on one of those lens,

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.435
we will immediately
see a black window,

00:04:02.435 --> 00:04:06.365
which will provide us with
information about the land.

00:04:06.365 --> 00:04:07.790
Inside the black window,

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.545
we can see the name of the lend,

00:04:09.545 --> 00:04:13.385
its coordinates, meaning
its location on the map.

00:04:13.385 --> 00:04:14.885
And it's Spice.

00:04:14.885 --> 00:04:16.940
Again, we can get more
information about

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.400
the land by simply
clicking on it.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.380
Once we click it, we can scroll

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.720
down and see the
name of the land,

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.515
the Netbook that the land
is on, and its price.

00:04:27.515 --> 00:04:29.885
And if we are interested
in this land,

00:04:29.885 --> 00:04:32.240
then we can simply click
on either the bead

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.180
or buy buttons at the
right side of the screen.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.115
Now, like in real life,

00:04:37.115 --> 00:04:40.535
many people don't just
buy or Baden lens

00:04:40.535 --> 00:04:44.240
before they actually see them
and determine their value.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.670
And thus, near the
name of the land,

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.635
we have a jump in button

00:04:48.635 --> 00:04:51.305
which will teleport
us to that land.

00:04:51.305 --> 00:04:52.940
So we can teleport to inside

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.680
the decentralized world and

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.810
examined the land
before we place a,

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.840
B, donate, put an
offer on it or bite.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.884
The Python dilemma will be
determined by a few factors.

00:05:02.884 --> 00:05:04.400
And again, like in real life,

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.250
the factors I'll
supply and demand,

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:08.510
the size of the land,

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.580
and the lens location.

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.110
For example, in real life,

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.855
if you own the land inside
him at opening city,

00:05:14.855 --> 00:05:17.750
you will usually pay
more for it than if you

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.960
bought the same size of
land in a remote CT.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.150
The same goes inside the central

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.820
and an end which gets
a lot of traffic.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.190
Meaning land which
is very populated,

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.320
will usually be
more expensive to

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.140
purchase or rent, then I'll end.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.075
That gets less traffic.

00:05:35.075 --> 00:05:37.160
Now, as I mentioned previously,

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.770
that is central in the
marketplace is not

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.995
the only market place from
which you can purchase land.

00:05:42.995 --> 00:05:44.480
And you can also purchase

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.444
land on the open
sea marketplace.

00:05:46.444 --> 00:05:48.500
To do that, you can go
to the official page

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.570
of the central and one open sea

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.820
which is located
on Open see that

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.100
i o forward slash collection,

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.185
forward slash the central end,

00:05:57.185 --> 00:06:00.170
and then review the listings
that are offered for sale.

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.170
End like on the Decentralized
marketplace with

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:05.570
different drop-down lists that

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.060
we can use to sort the listings.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.650
We can click on any of

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.050
the listings that we
see to learn more

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:16.100
about the land that is up
for sale and place a bid,

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.455
put, an offer, all buy the land.

00:06:18.455 --> 00:06:20.615
The buttons will change based on

00:06:20.615 --> 00:06:23.390
our own l configured
the listing.

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:25.130
So on some of these
things we will

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.125
see a place be the option,

00:06:27.125 --> 00:06:31.085
and on others a buy button
and a Meccano Fill button.

00:06:31.085 --> 00:06:32.990
Okay, so that's it
for this lesson,

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.450
and I will see you
in the next lesson.

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:37.140
Goodbye.
