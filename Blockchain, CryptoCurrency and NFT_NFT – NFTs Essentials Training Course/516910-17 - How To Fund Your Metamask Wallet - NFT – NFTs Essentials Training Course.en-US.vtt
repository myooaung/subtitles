00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.125
Hi everyone.

00:00:01.125 --> 00:00:05.610
In this lesson I will show you how to deposit money to your MetaMask wallet.

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.130
So the first thing I will do is to click on

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.225
the MetaMask extension icon at the upper right side of the screen.

00:00:12.225 --> 00:00:16.380
Now if you have installed MetaMask on a Google Chrome browser like me,

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.695
and you can find a MetaMask extension on your browser,

00:00:19.695 --> 00:00:22.080
then this might mean that is Eden,

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.450
and you can unhide it by simply left clicking the puzzle piece icon that

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:33.175
is located to the left of the browsers user icon at the upper right side of the screen.

00:00:33.175 --> 00:00:38.450
Once we click on it, we will see that we can pin or unpin extensions from the toolbar.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.335
Pitting an icon will make it visible and unpin.

00:00:42.335 --> 00:00:44.135
It, will make it eat in.

00:00:44.135 --> 00:00:46.805
Okay, So once we see the MetaMask wallet icon,

00:00:46.805 --> 00:00:49.370
we just need to click on it to activate it.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.810
Now if you see that you need to reject transactions at the bottom of the window,

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.700
then reject them first.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.970
Next, we will want to click on the icon at the center of

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.490
the MetaMask wallet window to start

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.180
the purchasing process of buying EFL, we have two options.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.175
Now we have the option at the top,

00:01:07.175 --> 00:01:09.215
which is 2 by ETH,

00:01:09.215 --> 00:01:13.715
which means that we can deposit the fill with our debit card.

00:01:13.715 --> 00:01:15.620
And we also have the option below it,

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.720
which is to direct deposit the cell which we have bought on another marketplace.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.600
I prefer to use my debit card to deposit a fill,

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.450
but you can choose any option that you pre-fill.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:33.180
So I will now click on the Continue to while white button at the top of the window.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.965
I will now type the listing fee,

00:01:36.965 --> 00:01:39.440
maybe a dollar more just to be on the safe side.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.980
If the listing price will change while I am depositing money,

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.145
then I will scroll down and choose between Ping Fu,

00:01:46.145 --> 00:01:48.155
Apple Pay to cut payment.

00:01:48.155 --> 00:01:50.720
I will choose the default cout payment option.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.300
Then I will take that tiny box at the bottom of

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.960
the screen next to the message I authorize while to debit

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:03.680
my account indicated for the amount above on today's date and I agreed to wire stems.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.260
You can click on the whale stems, tweet it.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.765
The terms opens in a new tab.

00:02:08.765 --> 00:02:11.390
After I tick the tiny box,

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.485
I will click the blue next button to continue to make my payment.

00:02:15.485 --> 00:02:17.675
Then after you make it a payment,

00:02:17.675 --> 00:02:21.335
you can go back to open sea to pay for the listing fee.

00:02:21.335 --> 00:02:26.435
Now it may take a few minutes for up in C2 ListView item once you pay the fee.

00:02:26.435 --> 00:02:29.270
But once open sea will list of item,

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.685
it will be available for the pies you choose for it on open C dot io.

00:02:34.685 --> 00:02:36.500
Okay, so that's it for this lesson,

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.870
and I will see you in the next lesson.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.560
Goodbye.
