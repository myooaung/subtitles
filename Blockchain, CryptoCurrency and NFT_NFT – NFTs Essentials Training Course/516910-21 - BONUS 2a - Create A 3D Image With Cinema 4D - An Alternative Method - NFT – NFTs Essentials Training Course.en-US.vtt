X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.080
Idle.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.119
So, not so long ago,

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:11.069
I found these online article

00:00:11.069 --> 00:00:13.559
that explains our digital realities.

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.575
That goes by the name VPL was able to sell

00:00:16.575 --> 00:00:21.254
a single digital image as an NFT for 69 million dollars.

00:00:21.254 --> 00:00:23.850
This NFT was part of a project which is called

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.220
Everyday is basically people

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.709
created and published a new digital image

00:00:28.709 --> 00:00:31.740
every day for the past 14 years.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.229
And the effort is image that was sold for

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:36.660
69 million dollars was an image that

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.789
contained all the images that the pill is

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:42.635
created for our sales up until that point.

00:00:42.635 --> 00:00:46.960
B pill is a name is Mike Lincoln Lynn said that he

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.165
creates all these digital out by using

00:00:49.165 --> 00:00:51.835
a 3D computer animation software,

00:00:51.835 --> 00:00:54.384
which is called Cinema 4D.

00:00:54.384 --> 00:00:58.179
So I wanted to follow my footsteps by creating and

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:02.379
uploading a new NFT each and each and every day.

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.114
I started doing that on October 1st, 2021.

00:01:06.114 --> 00:01:09.805
And now it is the simple free 2021.

00:01:09.805 --> 00:01:12.220
So there's been two months since I started

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.120
this challenge and I haven't missed a day in this lesson,

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.710
in the upcoming lessons,

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.000
I'm going to show exactly

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.589
how it started from a place of not

00:01:20.589 --> 00:01:22.539
knowing or knowing very

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:24.749
little about designed to replace well,

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:27.770
I create a brand new design from scratch each and

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.994
every day and upload it to Instagram.

00:01:30.994 --> 00:01:33.305
Now, as I mentioned,

00:01:33.305 --> 00:01:36.560
Mike Winckelmann didn't start creating digital out

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.179
yesterday and it took him

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:40.730
many ills of outlook and consistency.

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.350
And T was able to build

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.949
a fan base and achieve this level of success.

00:01:45.949 --> 00:01:49.970
So I understand that it can be a very long journey.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.610
And then I'm going to share my journey with you in

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.760
this lesson and in future lessons.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.670
Usually, my lessons are scripted,

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.330
but I will try to make my design is since not scripted.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.085
So there will be more fun to watch because the,

00:02:07.085 --> 00:02:08.540
because the lessons I'm not going to

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.580
be because the lesson

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.094
some are going to be scripted

00:02:12.094 --> 00:02:14.374
and my native language is not English.

00:02:14.374 --> 00:02:16.729
I might make mistakes while talking.

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:20.405
So I hope you will not get angry with me.

00:02:20.405 --> 00:02:22.939
Now, like always, if you have any questions

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:25.669
after watching this lesson or in the future,

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:29.210
then feel free to contact me and I will try to help.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.969
So let's start the journey together.

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:34.490
So this is the outlook that people is

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.219
created and was sold for 69 million donors.

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:39.109
And if you want to install

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:41.224
the software that the police using,

00:02:41.224 --> 00:02:45.664
just need to type cinema 4D inside Google.

00:02:45.664 --> 00:02:47.870
And you will have which this page

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.589
where you see the search results.

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:51.280
And you know what, you want to click

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.929
on the Cinema 4D, the option,

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:56.140
you, once you click this option,

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.449
you will be directed to the maximum.

00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:01.299
This is the company that created the cinema 40.

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.189
They'll be directed to the website.

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:04.809
And you can tie all the software.

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:06.189
It's a, it's a paid software,

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:08.440
but you can try it out by just clicking

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.024
the option at the top of the website.

00:03:12.024 --> 00:03:15.969
Then just click the blue download the mixin app button.

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:17.620
And it will maybe be

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.989
a different version by the time you see this video,

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.079
because you already know these divisions,

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:25.239
they are always there are always new versions,

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.760
so you just need to install it like you install

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.300
any other software on your computer and and that's it.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.099
Basically, I already have mine installed.

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.459
So I'm using this, say my venture.

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.804
And by the way, I will show you,

00:03:40.804 --> 00:03:42.920
I will show the fastest way to use this,

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.514
say the fastest way that I know to use the software.

00:03:45.514 --> 00:03:48.229
But if you want to go more in depth and

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:51.454
learn the software as I did initially,

00:03:51.454 --> 00:03:53.780
you just need to go to Google

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.419
again and just type cinema 4D tutorial.

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:58.909
And then when we see scena,

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:02.224
scena udacity.com, just click on this link.

00:04:02.224 --> 00:04:05.404
And getting started with Cinema 4D release 20.

00:04:05.404 --> 00:04:07.880
And you'll be able to see step-by-step,

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.589
step-by-step videos.

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:11.690
And that will guide you through

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.824
the process on the right from the very beginning.

00:04:14.824 --> 00:04:17.030
As you can see, there are many videos, zeal,

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.769
and you'll be able to learn

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.799
the software really good as I did.

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.710
But I will show you how I do it every

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.935
day to create my images.

00:04:27.935 --> 00:04:30.819
So as I said, I have the software installed.

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:32.704
This is the software and

00:04:32.704 --> 00:04:35.630
the box that you've seal is the viewport.

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.210
It's the main area that we would be walking at.

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:39.710
But if you want to change it from

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.810
the perspective view that we now see,

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.804
you just need to click this tiny icon,

00:04:43.804 --> 00:04:45.170
this tiny box icon,

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:50.015
let's say at the upper right end side of the window.

00:04:50.015 --> 00:04:53.509
And you just need to do another way on another one.

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:56.449
We have the perspective with the top one that I default.

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:58.610
Once you see one

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.829
that you want to look at, just click on it,

00:05:00.829 --> 00:05:03.439
and then just click hold and just

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:06.500
blast the middle mouse button.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.495
Okay, so when we now inside

00:05:08.495 --> 00:05:11.359
the top view and now you can see the models from the top.

00:05:11.359 --> 00:05:14.780
And if you want to go back, you can either just by same,

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.090
just click this button, a book sale on,

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.810
just place the middle mouse button and

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.880
go to perspective mode again by

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.195
just pressing on it with the middle mouse button.

00:05:26.195 --> 00:05:28.429
So this is the view area.

00:05:28.429 --> 00:05:30.439
And the buttons on

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:34.214
the keyboard that I use most often are the number one.

00:05:34.214 --> 00:05:36.775
Keyboard key, you just need to press on it

00:05:36.775 --> 00:05:39.759
and pressing this button,

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:42.759
you need to place on the left mouse key and

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:45.849
then just move your mouse while pressing the two buttons.

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:48.729
And this will just make it the

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:52.614
viewport move from left to right, like this.

00:05:52.614 --> 00:05:53.949
And if you do the same thing,

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:55.359
but instead of the number one,

00:05:55.359 --> 00:05:56.935
you just press the number 2 button.

00:05:56.935 --> 00:05:58.690
And again, you need to also to

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.525
press the left mouse button.

00:06:01.525 --> 00:06:06.145
When you do that, you can just go form a.

00:06:06.145 --> 00:06:07.825
You can still get an Incan zoom out.

00:06:07.825 --> 00:06:10.044
You can also zoom in and zoom out with

00:06:10.044 --> 00:06:13.314
the middle mouse button.

00:06:13.314 --> 00:06:16.725
And then at the end.

00:06:16.725 --> 00:06:21.694
Lastly, if you press the three key number freak 123,

00:06:21.694 --> 00:06:24.185
and I'm a free key on your keyboard.

00:06:24.185 --> 00:06:25.309
And while you place it,

00:06:25.309 --> 00:06:28.610
you place the left mouse button,

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.560
you can all Tate.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.249
So those are three very apt for

00:06:34.249 --> 00:06:35.419
buttons that you would want to

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:37.790
use during your creation process,

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:39.244
during the creation process.

00:06:39.244 --> 00:06:41.180
So the first thing I usually do,

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.759
and of course there are many ways this is a very,

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:47.359
very brittle Paul Glenn, very complex organ.

00:06:47.359 --> 00:06:49.474
And there are many ways that you can,

00:06:49.474 --> 00:06:52.070
you can use the software that I use

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:54.755
it is first of all to create the ground.

00:06:54.755 --> 00:06:57.979
So the way I paid the ground simply

00:06:57.979 --> 00:07:01.859
by placing the left mouse button on these,

00:07:01.859 --> 00:07:05.014
on these say shape on this cube.

00:07:05.014 --> 00:07:08.090
And then by picking that plane.

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:10.594
So I'm just clicking on it.

00:07:10.594 --> 00:07:15.529
And it will release the plane. Here it is.

00:07:15.529 --> 00:07:19.069
Okay, and again, in order to see it, I want to go down.

00:07:19.069 --> 00:07:22.490
So I just place the number one thing on the cable and

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:24.170
click the mouse button and

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:27.095
just go down the left mouse button.

00:07:27.095 --> 00:07:28.355
Okay?

00:07:28.355 --> 00:07:32.585
So this is the plane and this would be the ground.

00:07:32.585 --> 00:07:35.164
And I can also make sky if I just

00:07:35.164 --> 00:07:38.509
left-click on this icon here with the flow,

00:07:38.509 --> 00:07:42.215
and then without loosing my old on the mouse button,

00:07:42.215 --> 00:07:46.085
I just go to sky and then release the old.

00:07:46.085 --> 00:07:47.779
These creates sky.

00:07:47.779 --> 00:07:49.850
Now we want to maybe put

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:52.415
some colors on the ground and on the sky.

00:07:52.415 --> 00:07:54.619
So you just double left-click the cilia here,

00:07:54.619 --> 00:07:56.119
the books at the very bottom.

00:07:56.119 --> 00:07:58.460
And this will create the material that you can use.

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:00.919
The default value will be

00:08:00.919 --> 00:08:03.995
the yellow color, this white color.

00:08:03.995 --> 00:08:06.349
And you can just rename it if one,

00:08:06.349 --> 00:08:08.615
but I've left clicking the Met

00:08:08.615 --> 00:08:13.054
a text and just cried, for example, ground-up.

00:08:13.054 --> 00:08:15.139
Like if it with whatever you know,

00:08:15.139 --> 00:08:16.445
whatever way you like.

00:08:16.445 --> 00:08:20.309
So I will just type colon for example.

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:24.215
And then I just left-click it.

00:08:24.215 --> 00:08:26.150
And without releasing my old on the button,

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.219
on the left mouse button,

00:08:28.219 --> 00:08:30.199
I suggest for that it until I

00:08:30.199 --> 00:08:32.645
reach the plane and then top it will,

00:08:32.645 --> 00:08:34.235
and it will turn to white.

00:08:34.235 --> 00:08:35.929
And the singles for the sky can

00:08:35.929 --> 00:08:38.479
just left-click the material celiac,

00:08:38.479 --> 00:08:40.715
and it will create a new material.

00:08:40.715 --> 00:08:43.115
And I can pick the black color,

00:08:43.115 --> 00:08:45.409
is can see on the right side of

00:08:45.409 --> 00:08:49.699
the on the screen we can change color.

00:08:49.699 --> 00:08:53.000
So I'm picking the black color and then

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.449
left clicking it and just pushing it to the sky area.

00:08:56.449 --> 00:08:58.789
So anyway, ill would be fine and then

00:08:58.789 --> 00:09:03.470
just ate opening down and everything is now black.

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:06.020
The next thing I want to do is to create some light.

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:07.715
So it will light at the area.

00:09:07.715 --> 00:09:09.679
We have different kinds of lights and,

00:09:09.679 --> 00:09:12.395
but usually I just click,

00:09:12.395 --> 00:09:16.715
left-click on the light and then left-click

00:09:16.715 --> 00:09:19.279
or so of I don't release

00:09:19.279 --> 00:09:21.710
my old when I say the target light option.

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:24.019
And this will create the target light,

00:09:24.019 --> 00:09:28.580
which we walk on this area that I kill on the ground.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:33.545
And you can go up again by placing the number one button

00:09:33.545 --> 00:09:37.700
and blessing the left mouse button

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:40.625
and moving your mouse down by holding the buttons.

00:09:40.625 --> 00:09:43.865
And once you reach the light,

00:09:43.865 --> 00:09:45.980
you receive free and

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.469
host the choline day of it and the blue.

00:09:48.469 --> 00:09:51.784
And in order to move the light,

00:09:51.784 --> 00:09:54.559
you just need to click on

00:09:54.559 --> 00:09:59.989
the blue arrow and move it to the top like this.

00:09:59.989 --> 00:10:02.225
And this will create more light, them all up.

00:10:02.225 --> 00:10:04.490
You put it, the more light it will blink.

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:07.580
And again, I'll just move them

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:12.440
a view area and zoom out with my middle mouse button.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:15.515
So I can see the entire viewport.

00:10:15.515 --> 00:10:20.540
And I'm just going to move it up so we see more light.

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:23.480
And now the area is Lighten.

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.564
And what I want to do now,

00:10:25.564 --> 00:10:29.329
once I do that is to blink some a,

00:10:29.329 --> 00:10:33.559
to import some modal students to inside Cinema 4D.

00:10:33.559 --> 00:10:36.289
And there is a website which is called turbo squid.

00:10:36.289 --> 00:10:38.209
And inside this website you can

00:10:38.209 --> 00:10:41.644
name, download some motives.

00:10:41.644 --> 00:10:44.010
So let's go.

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:48.400
Two, Tomas query.com and

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.530
you need to create a free account.

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:53.200
And after you create a free account, you can skew,

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:57.145
can simply type the 3D model that you are looking for.

00:10:57.145 --> 00:11:00.279
Self, for example, let's say that I'm looking to

00:11:00.279 --> 00:11:06.400
create a hotel to import in a desert texture.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:12.830
So I just type the result n plus n tau.

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:18.099
And in, although there are many kinds of options,

00:11:18.099 --> 00:11:20.499
seal and most of them or some of them are paid

00:11:20.499 --> 00:11:21.789
options that you need you need

00:11:21.789 --> 00:11:23.304
to pay in order to download them.

00:11:23.304 --> 00:11:25.540
But I'm just looking in this tutorial for

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:28.219
the fleet images to free models.

00:11:28.219 --> 00:11:29.960
So in order just to see the Fremont

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.760
thus I can just click on

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:36.959
the price drop down list steel and just click on free.

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:42.065
And I can also click on the formats option.

00:11:42.065 --> 00:11:44.899
And just click on OBJ,

00:11:44.899 --> 00:11:47.870
which are the kinds of files that woke.

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:50.570
We'd seen him a 4D and this will refresh the page and

00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:53.825
just show us flee images free or OBJ.

00:11:53.825 --> 00:11:55.355
Obj images that we can,

00:11:55.355 --> 00:11:58.654
OBJ not images models that you can do that we can use.

00:11:58.654 --> 00:12:00.049
So different one Cl,

00:12:00.049 --> 00:12:02.119
not many because the download page

00:12:02.119 --> 00:12:04.835
and let's take this fund,

00:12:04.835 --> 00:12:07.594
these desert terrain fantasy,

00:12:07.594 --> 00:12:10.159
I'm not sure what it is, but let's tie them,

00:12:10.159 --> 00:12:11.450
just clicking on it and

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:13.069
then I will click the Download button.

00:12:13.069 --> 00:12:15.559
We can see a preview of how it's going to look.

00:12:15.559 --> 00:12:17.630
Let's click the Download button at

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:19.909
the very bottom of the page.

00:12:19.909 --> 00:12:22.860
We can close this window.

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:27.739
And in a few seconds we will see the new model.

00:12:27.739 --> 00:12:30.245
And all the models that you all had a seal

00:12:30.245 --> 00:12:32.630
are models that have previously downloaded.

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:34.250
So they have to file

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:36.229
synonym can see more files if we click

00:12:36.229 --> 00:12:40.340
on the plus icon next to the show on captions.

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:43.490
And what we are looking for different files seal,

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:45.740
but we are looking for the OBJ file.

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:48.184
We don't we are not looking for the Autodesk,

00:12:48.184 --> 00:12:50.794
all the free these next,

00:12:50.794 --> 00:12:52.894
we're looking for the OBJ.

00:12:52.894 --> 00:12:54.650
And if you haven't, if you don't have

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:57.394
a software that open zip file,

00:12:57.394 --> 00:13:01.909
you need to go to Google's simply and you can,

00:13:01.909 --> 00:13:03.859
for example, download and

00:13:03.859 --> 00:13:07.475
extracting software which is called wind wow.

00:13:07.475 --> 00:13:09.680
And just click on the window,

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:10.910
download free and support.

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:12.530
We can download the software.

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:15.575
It's a free software and install it on your computer.

00:13:15.575 --> 00:13:16.999
Once you install it, you will be able to

00:13:16.999 --> 00:13:19.354
open zip file is and how files.

00:13:19.354 --> 00:13:24.289
So let's click on the File option,

00:13:24.289 --> 00:13:26.880
the OBJ file, there'll be j.

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:29.509
So I clicked on it.

00:13:29.509 --> 00:13:31.130
And then I can,

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:32.930
for example, click the Save button

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:34.595
to save it on my computer.

00:13:34.595 --> 00:13:36.529
And then once the file is on

00:13:36.529 --> 00:13:38.585
a computer, I can click on it.

00:13:38.585 --> 00:13:42.065
And this will open the extraction software.

00:13:42.065 --> 00:13:44.690
We can close this notification and

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:47.570
then just take this file and for example,

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:49.670
drop it on my desktop.

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:52.190
I just need to left-click it and then drag it

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:55.639
until I reach the bottom of the well for the Windows,

00:13:55.639 --> 00:13:57.829
VM is clean and then I will go ahead and just

00:13:57.829 --> 00:14:00.559
going to drop it on my desktop.

00:14:00.559 --> 00:14:03.919
Now usually I prefer to create a folder.

00:14:03.919 --> 00:14:08.179
Will I just get on my end if t is all my images.

00:14:08.179 --> 00:14:11.030
So I have the folder called every day,

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:13.859
so I'm just going to double left-click it.

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:18.830
And another for the 2021.

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:20.870
And I'm going to pick descend on

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:23.449
because this is demands that we are calling clean.

00:14:23.449 --> 00:14:26.614
And let's just call it,

00:14:26.614 --> 00:14:29.584
for example, new quantile.

00:14:29.584 --> 00:14:31.489
I'm going to call it, I don't know how

00:14:31.489 --> 00:14:33.349
and when to call it quits. It's a new project.

00:14:33.349 --> 00:14:37.115
I don't have any idea in mind what I'm going to create.

00:14:37.115 --> 00:14:41.524
So let's just call it my idea,

00:14:41.524 --> 00:14:44.044
just a random generic name

00:14:44.044 --> 00:14:46.144
that they're going to change later on.

00:14:46.144 --> 00:14:47.945
So once I clear this folder,

00:14:47.945 --> 00:14:50.249
I can simply again the leg it but

00:14:50.249 --> 00:14:53.315
this time to this folder.

00:14:53.315 --> 00:14:55.219
Okay, so it's inside there.

00:14:55.219 --> 00:14:57.350
I can now go back to

00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:59.480
Cinema 4D and what they need to do in order

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:04.669
to bring these this model to my project,

00:15:04.669 --> 00:15:06.904
I just need to click on the File menu

00:15:06.904 --> 00:15:10.469
and then click on the Manage option.

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:15.319
Then I just need to pick. Just a second.

00:15:15.319 --> 00:15:18.000
I'm going to go to the right folder.

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:21.724
Just going to the right folder where it is,

00:15:21.724 --> 00:15:22.969
it is my idea.

00:15:22.969 --> 00:15:24.979
And then just going to click on it,

00:15:24.979 --> 00:15:26.870
you can eat a W2 left-click or

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:29.809
click the Open button at the bottom.

00:15:29.809 --> 00:15:33.950
And then just click on the Okay at the bottom.

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:38.960
And this will import the desert modal inside the same.

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.720
We'll take a few seconds and then we'd be

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:45.154
able to see it and use it on our scene.

00:15:45.154 --> 00:15:47.510
So you might not be able to see

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:49.909
the page depends on the size of the file.

00:15:49.909 --> 00:15:51.170
But if you want to see it,

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:52.730
it seems like it's too small.

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:54.800
You need to place the T button on

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:57.184
your keyboard and wind plus the T button.

00:15:57.184 --> 00:15:59.525
Press the left mouse button as we did previously,

00:15:59.525 --> 00:16:01.655
and just move your a,

00:16:01.655 --> 00:16:06.109
move your mouse to the top of to me,

00:16:06.109 --> 00:16:10.744
I mean, either moving up or down and it will extend.

00:16:10.744 --> 00:16:13.219
The model.

00:16:13.219 --> 00:16:16.489
May take some time depending on the size of

00:16:16.489 --> 00:16:22.175
day in the more than it is.

00:16:22.175 --> 00:16:23.314
Now.

00:16:23.314 --> 00:16:25.219
Let's rotate it again.

00:16:25.219 --> 00:16:26.600
If I want to want it, they need to place

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:29.239
the Free button and the mouse button,

00:16:29.239 --> 00:16:32.550
the left mouse button, as I can see.

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:39.279
Okay, So I need to all data the same model.

00:16:39.279 --> 00:16:40.420
In order to audit the model,

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:42.550
I need to click hill what it says,

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:44.679
so what it at the top.

00:16:44.679 --> 00:16:47.244
And then just click on

00:16:47.244 --> 00:16:50.020
either the blue and the green or the red lines

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:51.190
in order to vote in the image.

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:53.720
Let's take for example.

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:57.715
Oh, okay, and vaulted in alterity.

00:16:57.715 --> 00:17:00.714
Now I'm going to click on the Move icon.

00:17:00.714 --> 00:17:04.045
And then again, I need to move the mouse,

00:17:04.045 --> 00:17:07.299
the move to it'll move the st and then click on the blue.

00:17:07.299 --> 00:17:09.159
It would be to become isolated,

00:17:09.159 --> 00:17:12.309
the loyal, and just move it up.

00:17:12.309 --> 00:17:14.890
Still not okay, so I'm going to use

00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:20.780
the old it icon again and we just all like debt.

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:23.539
And again, I'm going to use the Move key,

00:17:23.539 --> 00:17:25.579
the Move icon, and move it.

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:28.940
You actually don't need the flow,

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:33.150
so I can just click on it and first the done button.

00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:35.600
Now I'm going to place

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.639
the T button on the keyboard again and

00:17:37.639 --> 00:17:39.469
the left mouse button and move

00:17:39.469 --> 00:17:42.660
the mouse up so it will extend again.

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:50.479
Okay, so now we

00:17:50.479 --> 00:17:52.430
can go back to turbo squid and

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:54.559
see if we have some colored seal texture.

00:17:54.559 --> 00:17:59.369
See on that we can put on the on the ground.

00:17:59.369 --> 00:18:03.820
I don't see any, but sometimes the images, JPEG images,

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:06.580
for example, in other files that you can

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:10.419
use a tomb to make it a go and look better.

00:18:10.419 --> 00:18:13.389
Or the other mode is on modus in January.

00:18:13.389 --> 00:18:15.655
So let's just create a color

00:18:15.655 --> 00:18:17.515
and just put it on the ground.

00:18:17.515 --> 00:18:18.685
So double left-click.

00:18:18.685 --> 00:18:20.170
And then I'm going,

00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:23.334
for example, to take the yellow column.

00:18:23.334 --> 00:18:24.849
And once they pick a color,

00:18:24.849 --> 00:18:26.964
just left-click on this collar,

00:18:26.964 --> 00:18:28.465
I can if I want,

00:18:28.465 --> 00:18:29.829
change it to ground,

00:18:29.829 --> 00:18:32.439
got to change the name to oncologist,

00:18:32.439 --> 00:18:35.030
can just rename it

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:43.205
and left-click on it and then dopey deal, gulp.

00:18:43.205 --> 00:18:49.205
Well, okay, looks nice.

00:18:49.205 --> 00:18:53.329
Now we want to import our delay models

00:18:53.329 --> 00:19:01.550
inside of a project so we can go to again the homepage.

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:05.225
I'm just going to click on the turbo squid logo wheel

00:19:05.225 --> 00:19:06.815
on the left titled the page.

00:19:06.815 --> 00:19:12.274
And then let's call this sample type men.

00:19:12.274 --> 00:19:14.690
And then placenta.

00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:18.290
And again, I'm going to change it applies to fleet

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:23.945
and the formats to OBJ.

00:19:23.945 --> 00:19:27.710
Obj, OBJ in it isn't just going to click

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:30.949
on the tiny box and show me the OBJ files.

00:19:30.949 --> 00:19:32.870
So they'll be friend.

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:35.939
And what this let's take this guy,

00:19:35.939 --> 00:19:40.130
he'll, let's click on it and then download button.

00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:45.079
As you can see, it's really isn't close this window.

00:19:45.079 --> 00:19:48.229
And if I already, I think that I already downloaded

00:19:48.229 --> 00:19:50.119
this and I'm sure that I

00:19:50.119 --> 00:19:52.069
have already downloaded the same model,

00:19:52.069 --> 00:19:54.169
so it's not going to appear at the top.

00:19:54.169 --> 00:19:56.750
So I need to look for, look for it and I can search,

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:58.880
use the search function at adopt and just

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:02.819
type a, just like men.

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:05.929
And, and press Enter.

00:20:05.929 --> 00:20:09.754
And I'm going to seal all the models that as the name,

00:20:09.754 --> 00:20:12.919
that if the name men inside them,

00:20:12.919 --> 00:20:15.350
I'm just going to go full on them.

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:17.390
Others will take a few seconds and

00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:20.465
find the one that I'm looking for.

00:20:20.465 --> 00:20:22.340
I can also do it manually,

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:25.040
just call down and find it like this.

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:26.780
Because I see that he takes too long.

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:33.769
I will stop it. Let's try to find find it like that.

00:20:33.769 --> 00:20:36.680
I can just press the Control and F buttons

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:39.380
together when I came out and look for the world of men.

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:43.650
And then click the LK to find it.

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:48.730
Welcome everyone to take this one.

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:50.904
This one looks like she bit till.

00:20:50.904 --> 00:20:54.100
I usually like to create so we'll outlook.

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:56.814
So this one, we worked perfectly.

00:20:56.814 --> 00:21:00.155
And I would just again click on the OBJ file.

00:21:00.155 --> 00:21:02.125
Now it's not zipped this file.

00:21:02.125 --> 00:21:04.360
So I can just just downloaded

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:07.644
directly to the folder without even opening means,

00:21:07.644 --> 00:21:10.255
without extracting some, just going to click on it.

00:21:10.255 --> 00:21:13.509
And then I'm going to search for the folder.

00:21:13.509 --> 00:21:15.309
And a nice thick that they usually

00:21:15.309 --> 00:21:18.775
do is once I locate the folder that I'm walking,

00:21:18.775 --> 00:21:21.850
walking on a name,

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:24.369
I'm just going to copy the web or

00:21:24.369 --> 00:21:26.650
the list, put it inside.

00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:28.909
Note that, for example.

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:32.349
And then instead of going all the time to

00:21:32.349 --> 00:21:35.439
the same place and time to find the right folder.

00:21:35.439 --> 00:21:38.380
I can just copy and paste it inside

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:41.709
the web or Dallas area and go down directly.

00:21:41.709 --> 00:21:43.450
So this is the area

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:45.040
where you can adequately name the file,

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.480
for example, can call it,

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.879
for example, face because this is

00:21:48.879 --> 00:21:53.215
a face and supported to keep the OBJ.

00:21:53.215 --> 00:21:55.660
Or maybe you can remove it just a phase because the,

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:57.999
the extension it save this and then OBJ,

00:21:57.999 --> 00:22:01.915
we will see a slightly move it and just place,

00:22:01.915 --> 00:22:04.825
just click the Save button at the bottom.

00:22:04.825 --> 00:22:09.189
Okay, now let's go to seem of a Friday.

00:22:09.189 --> 00:22:11.950
Go to File Neo4j.

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:15.010
And as you can see, the file is still downloaded.

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:16.645
It will take a few seconds.

00:22:16.645 --> 00:22:18.655
As you can see, it's a big file.

00:22:18.655 --> 00:22:22.614
The bigger the file, the more time it takes.

00:22:22.614 --> 00:22:24.654
So let's wait.

00:22:24.654 --> 00:22:26.140
We'll take three minutes.

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:31.120
In the meantime, let's look for Adele images.

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:33.280
O other, let me show something else.

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:34.510
In the meantime, we'll take

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:39.325
two minutes and you can change colors.

00:22:39.325 --> 00:22:41.199
Then the color of the light,

00:22:41.199 --> 00:22:43.704
if you just click on the delight,

00:22:43.704 --> 00:22:45.535
the right side of the page,

00:22:45.535 --> 00:22:46.990
it will be highlighted.

00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:48.820
And then you can

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:51.579
interchange the light by changing the colors here.

00:22:51.579 --> 00:22:52.780
Okay?

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:55.519
As you can see, the light changes.

00:22:55.519 --> 00:22:57.050
So you can, if you want, for example,

00:22:57.050 --> 00:22:58.940
to have a wet surface,

00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:02.480
just switch it to whether Connecticut blue surface if

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:06.469
you change it to blue or green.

00:23:06.469 --> 00:23:08.599
And you can also just click

00:23:08.599 --> 00:23:11.030
the use temperature will tiny book sale.

00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:13.879
And to create an intent to color temperature,

00:23:13.879 --> 00:23:17.280
to create a new light and new column.

00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:21.124
Okay, Let's take the right one for example.

00:23:21.124 --> 00:23:23.420
I'm not sure why, but let's take it.

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:28.535
And still with still three minutes to go.

00:23:28.535 --> 00:23:32.909
So again, we will see something else in the meantime.

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:38.960
So a, we can also change the settings of our project.

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.460
We can do it by just pressing

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:43.775
Control B together on our keyboard.

00:23:43.775 --> 00:23:45.904
And this will open this window.

00:23:45.904 --> 00:23:47.420
And you can change the width

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:49.069
and the height of your scene.

00:23:49.069 --> 00:23:51.350
I, for example, put it on

00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:58.400
1920 and we can change other fingers.

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:02.179
You note the resolution and under seal and the flames,

00:24:02.179 --> 00:24:05.585
if you just want to a C1 flame or mole,

00:24:05.585 --> 00:24:06.889
sometimes you have an animations,

00:24:06.889 --> 00:24:08.599
you want to have more friends,

00:24:08.599 --> 00:24:10.024
but I just use the cone,

00:24:10.024 --> 00:24:12.379
the cone flame for these because I just want

00:24:12.379 --> 00:24:16.040
to aim to export an image.

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:18.049
So this is the output.

00:24:18.049 --> 00:24:19.070
I'll put menu.

00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:21.650
We also have the Save Menu and

00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:24.860
you can change the format of the image that we export.

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:26.195
So I'm going to change it to

00:24:26.195 --> 00:24:29.899
PNG image and to a 16 bit image.

00:24:29.899 --> 00:24:32.210
And the name of the file will be

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:34.400
the structure often of the phi

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:37.770
would be like this name, 0, 0, 0.

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:40.970
So the last thing I want to do is

00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:43.955
just to change the folder in which the,

00:24:43.955 --> 00:24:46.910
in which I said the file that will be exported.

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:50.104
Just going to click on the Free Thoughts button ill.

00:24:50.104 --> 00:24:54.560
And just pick the folder,

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:55.910
the 10 walk in at the end.

00:24:55.910 --> 00:24:59.119
As I said, I can just copy this URL that I

00:24:59.119 --> 00:25:02.869
said previously and paste it inside these,

00:25:02.869 --> 00:25:04.579
whether the Assyria and placenta

00:25:04.579 --> 00:25:06.695
and bring me to the right folder.

00:25:06.695 --> 00:25:08.719
And I can just type a name.

00:25:08.719 --> 00:25:10.279
I'm don't know I don't know what to

00:25:10.279 --> 00:25:12.545
white light now to type right now.

00:25:12.545 --> 00:25:16.325
But let's say, let's call it. My idea.

00:25:16.325 --> 00:25:18.365
Just as I said,

00:25:18.365 --> 00:25:20.254
this is a random generic name,

00:25:20.254 --> 00:25:22.369
just for now, just as a place holder.

00:25:22.369 --> 00:25:25.340
And I will just click the Save button at the bottom.

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:29.240
And the last thing I usually do is just click on the No,

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:31.130
not the last thing, but one of the things that they do,

00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:35.419
It's just click on the realizing aim option and

00:25:35.419 --> 00:25:37.459
then change it to from geometry

00:25:37.459 --> 00:25:40.605
to best so the quality will be better.

00:25:40.605 --> 00:25:43.270
And another thing I will do is

00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:46.249
just all the file is finished downloading.

00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:49.585
Okay?

00:25:49.585 --> 00:25:52.704
The last thing I do, I just click on the effect option

00:25:52.704 --> 00:25:55.959
and big ambient occlusion

00:25:55.959 --> 00:26:00.849
and also global illumination

00:26:00.849 --> 00:26:02.845
and it will make the scene look better.

00:26:02.845 --> 00:26:06.130
And I'm just going to close with the x.

00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:08.635
Okay, so now the file is on the computer.

00:26:08.635 --> 00:26:11.935
I can just click the file and nudge.

00:26:11.935 --> 00:26:15.699
And now I can just click on face and open.

00:26:15.699 --> 00:26:17.394
And like before,

00:26:17.394 --> 00:26:20.140
I can even change the scale if I wanted the,

00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:22.969
the, the model to look beyond just and

00:26:22.969 --> 00:26:26.610
change it for example to 10 and placenta.

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:32.479
Now we're going to import the file and the cosine

00:26:32.479 --> 00:26:35.885
recording the same tutorial.

00:26:35.885 --> 00:26:39.200
It will take a lot more time than usual to upload,

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:41.269
to print both things because it'll

00:26:41.269 --> 00:26:43.700
really make it the computer go slow,

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:45.379
but our client the best that I can.

00:26:45.379 --> 00:26:48.950
So I'm going to press the T button again and left and

00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:51.440
the left mouse button and just move the mouse

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:54.364
up until I will see the ED coming up.

00:26:54.364 --> 00:26:57.739
And if it doesn't, I just again go to the same place

00:26:57.739 --> 00:27:01.805
near the model to st and again move it up like this.

00:27:01.805 --> 00:27:05.699
It might take a few times until it looks.

00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:08.960
Again, I'm going to click on the voltage to

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:12.125
rotate it like this.

00:27:12.125 --> 00:27:13.684
It is.

00:27:13.684 --> 00:27:19.370
And I'm going to click the Move icon at the top.

00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:22.084
And then they glean arrow to move it up.

00:27:22.084 --> 00:27:25.339
And the unit is, let's put it like this.

00:27:25.339 --> 00:27:26.960
But it's a little bit dark,

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:30.155
so maybe I need to know another source of flight.

00:27:30.155 --> 00:27:32.270
So now instead of the tonic light,

00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:35.000
which I really like, I can also select the light.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.310
If you need a new source of light,

00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:39.740
just click on the light and UV it will just ideally,

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:41.690
I can also click on the LED light,

00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:44.030
but it's toll, it's those Tongji Ilia light for me.

00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:47.129
So I'm just going to click on light.

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:48.829
Okay.

00:27:48.829 --> 00:27:51.005
I'm just going to move it up.

00:27:51.005 --> 00:27:53.359
Okay.

00:27:53.359 --> 00:27:56.794
Snow longer read but I'm changing later.

00:27:56.794 --> 00:27:59.150
They wanted to place the flea button on my keyboard,

00:27:59.150 --> 00:28:00.679
then the left mouse button,

00:28:00.679 --> 00:28:04.324
and just move it then the number one button.

00:28:04.324 --> 00:28:05.869
Okay.

00:28:05.869 --> 00:28:07.880
Some ways and ultimately live with

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:10.160
a colleague of the gown.

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:12.155
So I'm going to change the white.

00:28:12.155 --> 00:28:13.414
Okay.

00:28:13.414 --> 00:28:15.229
And I'm not sure why, but I really like it.

00:28:15.229 --> 00:28:17.809
They white, black and

00:28:17.809 --> 00:28:21.155
the red cardinals think data with the best.

00:28:21.155 --> 00:28:24.799
And then our soil, the soil out.

00:28:24.799 --> 00:28:28.640
So I'm going to make it bigger again,

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:31.890
T button in the left mouse button.

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:35.699
And I'm just going to move it up.

00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:39.409
And again, I don't think that the light is enough.

00:28:39.409 --> 00:28:43.980
I'm going to just pick a target light.

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:46.760
Okay, and I can change,

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:48.410
it. Won't get aids.

00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:56.315
We devoted key and move it up.

00:28:56.315 --> 00:29:00.570
I'll maybe just put it like this.

00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:04.369
Okay? Okay, so I

00:29:04.369 --> 00:29:06.470
can click the light to the one that I created now,

00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:08.435
and of course I can just double left-click it

00:29:08.435 --> 00:29:11.060
as I do for the materials and change the name.

00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:12.559
A lead two is okay,

00:29:12.559 --> 00:29:14.104
but that can change an infant one.

00:29:14.104 --> 00:29:15.679
And again, I can just change

00:29:15.679 --> 00:29:18.629
the candidate fell on different Carlo.

00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:24.844
Okay.

00:29:24.844 --> 00:29:25.759
It looks good.

00:29:25.759 --> 00:29:28.729
And I put fell. It was to save my walk every time.

00:29:28.729 --> 00:29:30.214
So if something crashes,

00:29:30.214 --> 00:29:32.539
I only have a backup.

00:29:32.539 --> 00:29:34.459
So just File Save and

00:29:34.459 --> 00:29:36.754
save it inside a folder that you are walking,

00:29:36.754 --> 00:29:38.029
let's call it demand.

00:29:38.029 --> 00:29:39.995
Now, if a better clear,

00:29:39.995 --> 00:29:43.020
good idea about what I'm creating.

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:46.770
So I saved it.

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:49.360
Sometimes you just do, you know,

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:53.470
it's enough just to export your image like this.

00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:55.750
But if you want to walk in it some more

00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:58.360
like I'm going to do, can do it.

00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:02.470
Let's let a double left-click this area and peak,

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:04.959
for example, another color.

00:30:04.959 --> 00:30:06.490
And let's see if it looks better.

00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:08.680
I just experiment with different colors,

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:10.210
different lights, until I read,

00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:14.259
soften that looks and equal to, we know.

00:30:14.259 --> 00:30:16.135
I'm just going to press Control Z

00:30:16.135 --> 00:30:17.934
on my keyboard because I

00:30:17.934 --> 00:30:21.775
prefer the white kind of a battle and it just looks told,

00:30:21.775 --> 00:30:24.489
extolled the last change.

00:30:24.489 --> 00:30:26.979
And suffering is missing.

00:30:26.979 --> 00:30:28.935
And look, just want one model.

00:30:28.935 --> 00:30:30.319
Let's take another model.

00:30:30.319 --> 00:30:32.794
Let's go back to turbo squid.

00:30:32.794 --> 00:30:40.320
And let's look for something else inside a models folder.

00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:50.165
What should I pick at this less control F?

00:30:50.165 --> 00:30:53.810
And just take, for example, let's take deal.

00:30:53.810 --> 00:31:00.305
Notice this one and click the OBJ.

00:31:00.305 --> 00:31:03.050
As you can see, it always repeats the positive bits.

00:31:03.050 --> 00:31:05.659
So it would be very easy for you to do the same

00:31:05.659 --> 00:31:08.599
because I'm not using a lot of a thing,

00:31:08.599 --> 00:31:11.329
so just focus on what they know.

00:31:11.329 --> 00:31:13.310
And as I said, I'm going to take

00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:16.039
the URL to thank saved and just copy it and

00:31:16.039 --> 00:31:18.139
paste it inside the web or the

00:31:18.139 --> 00:31:20.780
Assyria and then save my file.

00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:22.565
So we now have a deal.

00:31:22.565 --> 00:31:25.235
You just need to import it inside the same.

00:31:25.235 --> 00:31:27.860
So I'm going to pick fine now

00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:32.100
and going to big deal and then open.

00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:39.185
It's changed then an MPhil and I would feel okay.

00:31:39.185 --> 00:31:40.145
It's funny.

00:31:40.145 --> 00:31:44.559
It's it's actually like it when he, sometimes,

00:31:44.559 --> 00:31:47.469
what happens is that when I impulsively important

00:31:47.469 --> 00:31:51.429
in a model and he just comes into the scene,

00:31:51.429 --> 00:31:52.570
sometimes come to the scene

00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:54.324
to two places where I actually like,

00:31:54.324 --> 00:31:56.545
I didn't think about those places in the beginning.

00:31:56.545 --> 00:31:58.899
But once I see them, see the modal there,

00:31:58.899 --> 00:32:00.820
I think maybe I will go with it

00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:03.955
because I like the design aspect of it.

00:32:03.955 --> 00:32:05.709
Let's move it till you see I

00:32:05.709 --> 00:32:07.120
didn't think about this idea.

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:09.099
Now, it looks okay,

00:32:09.099 --> 00:32:13.839
I'm going to just make it bigger like that.

00:32:13.839 --> 00:32:15.895
And you know, you can actually

00:32:15.895 --> 00:32:18.339
like it's coming from is Nick.

00:32:18.339 --> 00:32:21.340
This is really nice. In my eyes.

00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:22.164
At least.

00:32:22.164 --> 00:32:25.795
What I wanted to say is that if you want to

00:32:25.795 --> 00:32:28.899
Duplicate the modal, just need to press

00:32:28.899 --> 00:32:32.019
the Control button on your keyboard and WSU old.

00:32:32.019 --> 00:32:34.029
But why are you ordering the Control button?

00:32:34.029 --> 00:32:36.970
Just click the left mouse button

00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:38.904
on one of the arrows that you see.

00:32:38.904 --> 00:32:40.690
For example, I want to move to

00:32:40.690 --> 00:32:42.520
duplicate the motor to the light.

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:45.100
So I'm going to left-click the

00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:48.595
blue able and not really smiled also,

00:32:48.595 --> 00:32:52.135
not when it's my old or so on the mouse button,

00:32:52.135 --> 00:32:55.240
we're just going to click on the blue pill and move

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:59.034
my mouse to the right and declare that duplicate.

00:32:59.034 --> 00:33:00.400
And now for example,

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:08.120
I can click and devoted icon and move it like this.

00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:12.239
Okay?

00:33:12.239 --> 00:33:16.149
Not sure if I want to manipulate these.

00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:19.860
Okay, Let's move it like this.

00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:21.705
I'm not sure if it's denied idea.

00:33:21.705 --> 00:33:23.625
Maybe we change it later,

00:33:23.625 --> 00:33:25.349
then I'm just going to move it.

00:33:25.349 --> 00:33:29.144
You said you were going to move it to the light a place.

00:33:29.144 --> 00:33:32.219
So I'm going to just kick David L and move it.

00:33:32.219 --> 00:33:35.310
And I can even click this button on my keyboard and

00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:38.939
the left mouse button to find d divides both,

00:33:38.939 --> 00:33:43.424
they need to move it to so it will look more accurate.

00:33:43.424 --> 00:33:46.215
Okay, you need to play with it a little,

00:33:46.215 --> 00:33:50.740
a lot with the software in order to really master it.

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:55.059
Took me a few months.

00:33:55.059 --> 00:33:58.969
But if you walk into a room, 613, the end.

00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:07.944
Okay. Usually they,

00:34:07.944 --> 00:34:11.005
the elements in Cinema 4D to tell you is most

00:34:11.005 --> 00:34:13.509
often the colleagues sandy delight

00:34:13.509 --> 00:34:16.869
because sometimes you can get really good results by just

00:34:16.869 --> 00:34:20.229
playing with him for ELLs home until you find something

00:34:20.229 --> 00:34:24.649
that they really jumps at you.

00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:28.599
Sometimes when you click on the Okay,

00:34:28.599 --> 00:34:30.040
you will see this thing like it's

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:31.675
Blake's eat but at the element.

00:34:31.675 --> 00:34:34.045
So if this happens to you,

00:34:34.045 --> 00:34:35.410
just make sure that first of all,

00:34:35.410 --> 00:34:38.065
you click on the element on the right side of the page,

00:34:38.065 --> 00:34:40.554
on the right side of the screen in these cases a deal.

00:34:40.554 --> 00:34:42.249
So I'm just going to click on it and

00:34:42.249 --> 00:34:44.499
then move it like this,

00:34:44.499 --> 00:34:47.329
and then it will not break.

00:34:48.390 --> 00:34:50.769
So this looks really nice.

00:34:50.769 --> 00:34:52.419
And you know, when you start

00:34:52.419 --> 00:34:54.340
creating your start, come with ideas.

00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:56.185
If you stop, come up,

00:34:56.185 --> 00:34:57.639
come up with ideas, even if you

00:34:57.639 --> 00:34:59.454
didn't initially thought of l and m.

00:34:59.454 --> 00:35:03.250
So now that I see the two deals inside the center thing,

00:35:03.250 --> 00:35:04.359
maybe I can create

00:35:04.359 --> 00:35:09.219
another view and maybe they still will look at them.

00:35:09.219 --> 00:35:13.434
And finally to add that the cell Inside,

00:35:13.434 --> 00:35:17.300
Inside an ad like this.

00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:20.760
So you don't know if he is looking for a slave to

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:23.279
the ED or maybe he looks at his friends.

00:35:23.279 --> 00:35:26.099
So on the IELTS mit die inside the head or

00:35:26.099 --> 00:35:30.195
maybe find all of this situation funny.

00:35:30.195 --> 00:35:31.784
I'm not sure if

00:35:31.784 --> 00:35:33.720
this is what I like about this kind of felt that if

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:37.800
I take this out to his own world,

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:41.130
but what I want to do is change the column.

00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:43.229
And if you're not sure which column to use,

00:35:43.229 --> 00:35:46.589
what I usually do is simply go to Google.

00:35:46.589 --> 00:35:48.059
And this is something that I found out

00:35:48.059 --> 00:35:49.860
recently because I'm not

00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:53.894
using soft of I'm not using software a lot.

00:35:53.894 --> 00:35:56.039
So what you can do is

00:35:56.039 --> 00:35:59.119
just look for the world, for example, deal.

00:35:59.119 --> 00:36:02.755
And go to click on images for example.

00:36:02.755 --> 00:36:05.724
And then you can install from the Google Console

00:36:05.724 --> 00:36:13.074
and can install an extension that is called column peak.

00:36:13.074 --> 00:36:14.890
The appeal.

00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:20.185
Let's look feats. Peak. I told them.

00:36:20.185 --> 00:36:23.029
Okay, so you just click on it

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:26.500
and download and install it.

00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:29.184
And once you do, you will see it.

00:36:29.184 --> 00:36:30.549
And if you don't see the icon,

00:36:30.549 --> 00:36:31.974
once you install it,

00:36:31.974 --> 00:36:35.695
you just click on the icon.

00:36:35.695 --> 00:36:38.499
And again, just been feeding formula and then need to

00:36:38.499 --> 00:36:40.764
feel that once you haven't

00:36:40.764 --> 00:36:43.839
installed and you see it on your bio zone,

00:36:43.839 --> 00:36:46.180
you can walk, walk, but you can do is just

00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:48.310
click on it and then

00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:50.349
click on one of the deal cell and

00:36:50.349 --> 00:36:53.065
it would show you is Xcode.

00:36:53.065 --> 00:36:55.029
So I'm going to click on it.

00:36:55.029 --> 00:36:57.310
This is the Xcode. I'm going to right-click on it

00:36:57.310 --> 00:36:59.499
and then copy and then go to

00:36:59.499 --> 00:37:02.710
cinema 4D and then

00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:07.629
create another material to put it on the deal.

00:37:07.629 --> 00:37:10.644
And then wanted to, once I click again on the Casio,

00:37:10.644 --> 00:37:13.480
I can just click on the books,

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:16.030
heal and change dx code,

00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:18.370
just WWF tickets, so it will always be

00:37:18.370 --> 00:37:21.130
highlighted and I click on Paste.

00:37:21.130 --> 00:37:24.639
And it would change the kinda to bomb.

00:37:24.639 --> 00:37:27.415
So I'm going to click on this area.

00:37:27.415 --> 00:37:32.665
Then anti-malaria, and you'll see that it's Bao now.

00:37:32.665 --> 00:37:34.720
So I'm going to rotate the area

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:38.080
and just put the chameleon as well.

00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:42.129
And now we have a deal.

00:37:42.129 --> 00:37:44.304
I think I want to keep

00:37:44.304 --> 00:37:47.559
the white collar for those deals because.

00:37:47.559 --> 00:37:51.280
The deals with the status

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:53.724
look like they look like a status,

00:37:53.724 --> 00:37:57.655
a statue with a deal sending someone to keep them,

00:37:57.655 --> 00:37:59.770
as is what I

00:37:59.770 --> 00:38:02.139
am going to change his delight. I don't need that.

00:38:02.139 --> 00:38:04.570
I'm going to use a lot of flights equals maybe add

00:38:04.570 --> 00:38:07.839
more light so we'll change the quantize a lights.

00:38:07.839 --> 00:38:11.290
So we get a bit though, big jump.

00:38:11.290 --> 00:38:16.070
So let's see if I can see something that I like.

00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:21.760
I'm just going to change them into

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:23.710
something we'll both end in

00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:28.880
delayed equaled IDF out to show the image.

00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:35.369
So again, I can find what I'm looking

00:38:35.369 --> 00:38:37.200
for assembling to create another source of

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:39.629
flight of town get lied.

00:38:39.629 --> 00:38:48.900
Maybe this one m. I'm

00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:50.159
going to use the chit temperature

00:38:50.159 --> 00:38:53.729
maybe hasn't yet been built.

00:38:53.729 --> 00:38:56.535
So maybe I will just delete some nights.

00:38:56.535 --> 00:38:58.484
I'm just going to click on the light

00:38:58.484 --> 00:39:01.425
and then press the Delete button on my keyboard.

00:39:01.425 --> 00:39:04.979
If I'm just, I just have too much, too many lights.

00:39:04.979 --> 00:39:06.360
And again, find the lines that I

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:08.565
want to just delete everything.

00:39:08.565 --> 00:39:12.560
And start again.

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:14.830
Let's keep living on the lines,

00:39:14.830 --> 00:39:17.139
on the lights and create a new light.

00:39:17.139 --> 00:39:20.330
Sometimes, sometimes it doesn't.

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:26.514
And I'm going to go up,

00:39:26.514 --> 00:39:29.965
up, up, up and change it.

00:39:29.965 --> 00:39:32.785
Just a second. Let's see.

00:39:32.785 --> 00:39:34.790
Okay.

00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:44.830
It looks much better.

00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:48.759
I'm going to create another light double-click

00:39:48.759 --> 00:39:51.205
and just move it like this.

00:39:51.205 --> 00:39:53.769
So it will show me into like another area

00:39:53.769 --> 00:39:58.960
of the face. Okay.

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:05.329
Looks good. Maybe another Latina.

00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:07.900
Okay. Like this.

00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:09.684
This looks good.

00:40:09.684 --> 00:40:12.654
Sometimes you just need to move the light until

00:40:12.654 --> 00:40:15.890
you find an area that you like.

00:40:16.110 --> 00:40:20.229
To write. Nice.

00:40:20.229 --> 00:40:23.305
Now, I'm going to change the cutoffs again.

00:40:23.305 --> 00:40:25.794
Suddenly want an idol and people might do.

00:40:25.794 --> 00:40:29.994
And then this looks clean and nice.

00:40:29.994 --> 00:40:34.430
I like this. Let's change the sign.

00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:41.739
Mm-hm. Hey, this late

00:40:41.739 --> 00:40:49.129
now. Looks good.

00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:54.130
F to tell you that I'm not an expert,

00:40:54.130 --> 00:40:56.020
so don't think that I'm an expert in this and

00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:59.199
just using it individually in a very basic way,

00:40:59.199 --> 00:41:01.029
just out that learning the software,

00:41:01.029 --> 00:41:02.839
I'm not an expert, I'm not a designer.

00:41:02.839 --> 00:41:05.120
That I do my best.

00:41:09.570 --> 00:41:12.460
And I'm not sure why I like it so much

00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:19.429
that this looks really nice.

00:41:19.530 --> 00:41:26.020
So this can be an NFT LexLeader

00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:30.470
leading eyes up and of course add some more moderns.

00:41:31.050 --> 00:41:37.104
Alright, that's just one we deal.

00:41:37.104 --> 00:41:39.505
When you play someday.

00:41:39.505 --> 00:41:41.560
Different elements that they would be highlighted to

00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:44.950
know which one to use, which one.

00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:49.749
Opening night.

00:41:49.749 --> 00:41:52.159
Looks good.

00:41:52.410 --> 00:41:55.975
It's amazing that every time that you will get a cannula,

00:41:55.975 --> 00:41:57.339
you get a decent still

00:41:57.339 --> 00:42:04.520
we will exclude not sure what and when to use.

00:42:04.590 --> 00:42:07.359
And what does it like to zoom really

00:42:07.359 --> 00:42:11.210
close to the elements to them once.

00:42:12.570 --> 00:42:16.210
But I'm a student missing sof and suf means VCE,

00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:18.909
want something else in the same.

00:42:18.909 --> 00:42:24.619
Usually what I like to do is it's going to swindle.

00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:28.539
We find it funny but philosophize on and until.

00:42:28.539 --> 00:42:31.239
I found out that if you edit

00:42:31.239 --> 00:42:35.289
bed to the scene, it looks better.

00:42:35.289 --> 00:42:41.050
I'm not sure why. Let's take this one over J.

00:42:41.050 --> 00:42:43.510
And again, you have the textual zip file.

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:45.280
If you see a textual text,

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:47.140
choose the zip file,

00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:49.540
you know that inside them down image files that you

00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:52.509
can put on the on

00:42:52.509 --> 00:42:54.909
the element and we'll change it to osha and we show

00:42:54.909 --> 00:42:58.690
now that's big festival along the a bit OBJ file.

00:42:58.690 --> 00:43:03.400
And let's just paste it.

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:08.869
Let's copy this un until and then put the deal.

00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:13.570
And when you see this about the spokes,

00:43:13.570 --> 00:43:15.369
you know that it's finished downloading.

00:43:15.369 --> 00:43:18.700
A and I'm also now going to use,

00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:21.460
first of all, let's import it to the same.

00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:23.844
So again, as we said, fine,

00:43:23.844 --> 00:43:29.020
manage and we are now looking for the BID.

00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:30.730
Don't remember which one it was,

00:43:30.730 --> 00:43:33.685
but you can see by the IOL which one is the latest.

00:43:33.685 --> 00:43:35.289
So if you click this one,

00:43:35.289 --> 00:43:36.985
it'll get them look mistaken.

00:43:36.985 --> 00:43:39.085
It changed, for example, too thin.

00:43:39.085 --> 00:43:40.720
And you can change it for centimeters.

00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:42.939
One that was used sentiment us.

00:43:42.939 --> 00:43:44.779
Okay.

00:43:52.290 --> 00:43:54.489
Thanks a lot of time.

00:43:54.489 --> 00:43:57.159
I think this because of the recording software.

00:43:57.159 --> 00:43:59.274
And I'm going to move it up.

00:43:59.274 --> 00:44:02.979
And plus T on the keyboard and the left mouse

00:44:02.979 --> 00:44:07.570
button a few times until it's smooth,

00:44:07.570 --> 00:44:09.769
it negated on seed.

00:44:10.350 --> 00:44:16.119
So I'll take it, I'll know it's not died

00:44:16.119 --> 00:44:18.460
one and 12 percent the Delete button to delete

00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:20.890
it and maybe I'm wrong,

00:44:20.890 --> 00:44:22.735
it will still not the right one.

00:44:22.735 --> 00:44:24.835
What is the name of the file?

00:44:24.835 --> 00:44:26.739
It's called?

00:44:26.739 --> 00:44:31.730
If b, the c will free.

00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:40.190
If B, D, It's this one.

00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:43.755
Let's go back.

00:44:43.755 --> 00:44:47.055
If b, d, e, feel free open.

00:44:47.055 --> 00:44:50.950
And then 10, for example.

00:44:57.320 --> 00:44:59.084
If it is.

00:44:59.084 --> 00:45:01.710
So one to move it, right?

00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:04.140
This is just the second one to look at this

00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:07.590
clean like this. It looks good.

00:45:07.590 --> 00:45:09.540
I will just select that talk to you.

00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:11.789
Sometimes when you import in and more than

00:45:11.789 --> 00:45:14.849
it looks a bit better than what you had in mind.

00:45:14.849 --> 00:45:16.980
I thought about maybe putting

00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:20.039
the baby on the deal on the bed for some reason,

00:45:20.039 --> 00:45:22.864
but this looks better when it's huge like that.

00:45:22.864 --> 00:45:25.750
While I have an idea and you see another idea

00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:28.900
come to mind, what I'm going to do.

00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:33.219
What I am going to do is to festival.

00:45:33.219 --> 00:45:35.650
You can just click on the object that you

00:45:35.650 --> 00:45:36.939
want and click it on delights

00:45:36.939 --> 00:45:38.785
actually to take everything.

00:45:38.785 --> 00:45:43.134
And then I'm going to a, what is the name of this?

00:45:43.134 --> 00:45:45.520
This is zed blush.

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:47.575
I can just click on zed lash,

00:45:47.575 --> 00:45:52.360
the D5W and the deal file together

00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:54.310
just need to press the Shift button on

00:45:54.310 --> 00:45:57.699
the keyboard and the zed Bosch.

00:45:57.699 --> 00:46:00.039
So it also notice the shift, shift,

00:46:00.039 --> 00:46:03.249
shift just islet everything that is between them.

00:46:03.249 --> 00:46:06.669
So I'm going to place the teal object in the end,

00:46:06.669 --> 00:46:08.334
the Control button on this advice.

00:46:08.334 --> 00:46:11.559
So we do a highlight them both.

00:46:11.559 --> 00:46:15.050
And the other V is deals as well.

00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:21.400
And just see the book idle.

00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:23.500
And if you want to meet them together all the time,

00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:25.509
you just need to right-click once you iodide,

00:46:25.509 --> 00:46:27.265
then we did a control button.

00:46:27.265 --> 00:46:30.549
I click and then you can just click

00:46:30.549 --> 00:46:31.989
the coop objects and it

00:46:31.989 --> 00:46:33.744
will make something that is called the null,

00:46:33.744 --> 00:46:36.894
which just encapsulates all the elements together.

00:46:36.894 --> 00:46:39.969
And now we are as a b,

00:46:39.969 --> 00:46:41.470
there will always be together until you

00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:43.929
right-click on it and then ungroup the objects.

00:46:43.929 --> 00:46:48.069
So I'm going to move it like this to you.

00:46:48.069 --> 00:46:55.100
And just forget about the texture on the printed texture.

00:46:56.730 --> 00:47:00.595
Let's make everything bigger than allergenic infant.

00:47:00.595 --> 00:47:03.970
All of them look big hill by just clicking on

00:47:03.970 --> 00:47:08.094
this Nile and using this icon,

00:47:08.094 --> 00:47:09.249
the scale I can get.

00:47:09.249 --> 00:47:10.480
You can also do it by person,

00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:12.204
the T button on your keyboard.

00:47:12.204 --> 00:47:15.115
And you just need to click the left mouse button

00:47:15.115 --> 00:47:18.819
and they will all be in inst together.

00:47:18.819 --> 00:47:23.995
So I'm going to put in male. Looks great.

00:47:23.995 --> 00:47:25.750
Now, if you miss the place will

00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:28.165
a URL on the screen and you just,

00:47:28.165 --> 00:47:29.965
you just lost your self.

00:47:29.965 --> 00:47:32.785
Lose yourself inside this huge Alia.

00:47:32.785 --> 00:47:34.690
And see it's a very Julia.

00:47:34.690 --> 00:47:36.309
If you missed the place where you,

00:47:36.309 --> 00:47:38.920
I'll add just a foil.

00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:41.785
Anything is just click on the icon

00:47:41.785 --> 00:47:44.860
and just click on Canada and then Omega.

00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:47.410
Well, you will be in the early Alpha is,

00:47:47.410 --> 00:47:49.419
let's say that you allele.

00:47:49.419 --> 00:47:50.680
If you just double click

00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:52.794
the camera icon that you come back to,

00:47:52.794 --> 00:47:55.429
we'll place completely missing.

00:47:55.560
