00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.695
Hello and welcome to the lesson.

00:00:01.695 --> 00:00:04.425
In this lesson, we will be installing MetaMask,

00:00:04.425 --> 00:00:10.080
which is a virtual wallet that lets you conduct commerce with NFT marketplaces.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.470
Metamask is a cryptocurrency wallet and it

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.965
is available as a browser extension or a mobile app.

00:00:16.965 --> 00:00:21.450
In this lesson, I will show you how to install MetaMask on your compound,

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.080
but you can install Meta mask on other browsers as well.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.285
Metamask is a virtual wallet,

00:00:27.285 --> 00:00:29.790
but it works similar to a physical wallet.

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.010
Meaning you can store your money, Dale,

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.115
and you can use this money in different marketplaces on the Internet.

00:00:36.115 --> 00:00:37.610
Which means, for example,

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.410
that you can sell an NFT on a certain marketplace and then use the money

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.420
you earned from selling that NFT to buy an NFT on another marketplace.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.610
The bottom is quality is not a part of the website but about of your browser,

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.540
so it will follow you and be usable wherever you go.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.405
The other good thing about MetaMask is that it creates

00:00:59.405 --> 00:01:02.719
the password and the keys on your own computer.

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.430
So you don't have to be afraid that someone will act the marketplace that you are

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.440
trading on and studio details and use them to make connections.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.330
Okay, So let's begin.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.240
So the first thing we would need to do in order to set up

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.915
a MetaMask wallet to go to MetaMask data IO.

00:01:20.915 --> 00:01:25.280
And it is important that you will do exactly as I do and directly type

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.680
the web address MetaMask that i o in your browser's address line and placental.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.060
The problem with searching for MetaMask data IO on Google is debt.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.390
We might click on a fraudulent website, tiny steak,

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.169
and those sorts of sites might try to steal our details.

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:43.595
Okay, let's continue.

00:01:43.595 --> 00:01:46.475
So once you own the MetaMask data IO website,

00:01:46.475 --> 00:01:51.260
just click on the blue Download button at the upper right hand corner of the website.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.505
Then you will see three tabs on iOS and Android.

00:01:55.505 --> 00:01:59.975
And because we now want to instrument the MRTK on our composer,

00:01:59.975 --> 00:02:04.190
we will keep the default com option selected and just call

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.020
down and click the blue install MetaMask for calm blue button.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.320
You can see below the button the other browsers that you can

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.190
install MetaMask gone if you are not using Google Chrome.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.620
So I'll click the Install MetaMask for

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.745
calm blue button and I will be directed to the Chrome Web Store.

00:02:22.745 --> 00:02:26.450
Once they'll, Let's just click the blue Add to Chrome blue button.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.920
And then we'll just need to click

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.710
the Add extension white button to install the MetaMask extension onto our browser.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.290
Okay, so once the extension has been installed on our bow,

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.570
so we can see that by day.

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.600
Welcome to MetaMask notification on our screen,

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.410
we can click the blue Get Started button that we see on the page.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.290
To continue, you will now be asked if you want to create

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.840
a new MetaMask wallet or if you want to use

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.900
a MetaMask wallet that you have created in the past.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.380
So if you've already installed MetaMask in the past,

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:11.395
then you can click the Import wallet blue button to import your old MetaMask wallet.

00:03:11.395 --> 00:03:15.280
This is an option that you would want to use if you have deleted your Basel,

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.514
deleted the content on your computer,

00:03:17.514 --> 00:03:20.355
or if you switched to another computer,

00:03:20.355 --> 00:03:23.960
you now want to install the MetaMask extension again.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.250
Yet in this example,

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.900
we don't have a MetaMask wallet.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.545
So click the Create a word blue button under the yes,

00:03:30.545 --> 00:03:34.220
Let's get set up caption to set a blend.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.750
You want it on this page,

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.900
MetaMask asks if we want to share usage data,

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.990
information with them for the purpose of improving MetaMask.

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.095
And you can do that if you like by clicking the I agree.

00:03:45.095 --> 00:03:47.315
Blue button at the bottom of the page,

00:03:47.315 --> 00:03:49.235
but I prefer not to do that.

00:03:49.235 --> 00:03:51.920
So we'll just click No, thanks.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.995
Gray button next to the blue button.

00:03:54.995 --> 00:04:00.950
Okay, so now MetaMask to create a best model for our MetaMask wallet.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.405
So we'll type my password in the blank line under the new password caption,

00:04:05.405 --> 00:04:07.670
and then type my password again in

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.750
the second blank line under the confirm password caption.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.930
You will not want to show this password with anyone,

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.360
so no one will have access to your wallet.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.745
Once you are done, just click the terms of use,

00:04:19.745 --> 00:04:21.395
toyed the terms of use.

00:04:21.395 --> 00:04:24.980
And if you go into them, just tick the tiny box next to the caption.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.380
I have read and agree to the terms of use,

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.730
and then click the blue Create button below the tiny books to continue.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.990
Okay, So on this page you can learn about

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.500
the recovery phase and how to keep your digital wallet safe.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.045
We're going to talk about the recovery phase on the next page as well.

00:04:44.045 --> 00:04:47.795
I suggest that you watch the video eel and the dispatch.

00:04:47.795 --> 00:04:49.070
And then once you're done,

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.040
scroll down and click the blue next button

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.340
at the bottom of the page to continue to the next page.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.095
Now will be presented with the secret back of phase page.

00:05:03.095 --> 00:05:04.250
And on this page,

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:09.590
MetaMask will give us a phrase that we need to write down and store in a safe place.

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.090
If you remember on the page,

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.935
will MetaMask asked us if we want to import an old wallet or create a new one.

00:05:15.935 --> 00:05:18.635
We have picked the option to create a new account.

00:05:18.635 --> 00:05:21.825
But if we had wanted to import an old account,

00:05:21.825 --> 00:05:26.470
then we could have chosen the other option on the page and use our Phase 2,

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.390
we store our old account.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:33.170
So I will click the clicker to Iwill secret votes message.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.710
And just write down the phrase that I get in a secure place.

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.935
And MetaMask actually give you tips on how to

00:05:41.935 --> 00:05:45.475
securely store your phase on the right side of the page.

00:05:45.475 --> 00:05:46.945
There isn't that then I'll show you.

00:05:46.945 --> 00:05:49.930
My face is just for explanation purposes.

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.045
And in the same way that you want,

00:05:52.045 --> 00:05:55.420
want to show your password to anyone, you also want,

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.690
want to show you a secret phrase to anyone and basically

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.260
only use it if you ever want to store your wallet.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.080
I will of course not use this wallet the time now creating ever again,

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.620
because everyone now can see my secret phase.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.725
Of course, each person who creates a wallet will get

00:06:12.725 --> 00:06:16.580
a unique place once you've written down your phrase and skew,

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:21.710
or did you just need to click the blue next button below the secret phase to continue.

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.520
We are now on the confirm your secret backup phrase page.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.855
And on this page,

00:06:26.855 --> 00:06:30.695
we will need to confirm our secret phrase by just matching the words

00:06:30.695 --> 00:06:35.060
in our secret phrase to the words on the screen in order.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.470
So I will do it now.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:10.180
Once done, just click the blue Confirm button below or the phases.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.770
And that's it.

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:17.095
Metta masks shows us a congratulations page and below the congratulations caption,

00:07:17.095 --> 00:07:22.599
the again tips on how to store your secrets seed phrase safely.

00:07:22.599 --> 00:07:24.010
As you can see below,

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:27.415
MetaMask will not be able to recover your seat phase.

00:07:27.415 --> 00:07:30.770
So it is extremely important not to lose it.

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:32.405
So that's it for this lesson.

00:07:32.405 --> 00:07:34.985
And I will see you in the next lesson.

00:07:34.985 --> 00:07:36.630
Goodbye.
