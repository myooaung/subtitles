WEBVTT

00:01.500 --> 00:04.760
So in this video we'll continue with the latest Office section.

00:04.980 --> 00:09.940
In the last video we added the hate mail for the free supper offers.

00:10.010 --> 00:16.760
And in this video we're going to be adding the csx to make it look more like the finished projects.

00:16.830 --> 00:23.130
So we're going to be adding the purple buckram colour for the full section will also be change in the

00:23.130 --> 00:29.700
background and text colour for free individual offers will also be making sure that the pricing circle

00:30.150 --> 00:36.840
is positioned horizontally in the middle of the div and also overlap and at the top and will do that

00:36.840 --> 00:38.750
with some absolute position.

00:39.390 --> 00:42.110
So if we go over to I will see SS.

00:44.820 --> 00:46.530
We can create a new section.

00:49.580 --> 00:50.650
Let's do this at the bottom.

00:50.650 --> 00:52.360
Just before the mobile style.

00:53.150 --> 00:55.510
So this is the latest offers.

01:00.150 --> 01:05.430
So the latest offers section had the idea of latest offers.

01:06.720 --> 01:12.930
And will just use this to create the purple buckram colour and set the funchal at a White House so make

01:12.930 --> 01:15.600
sure that all the text is aligned.

01:15.780 --> 01:19.250
So first of all we'll said the text a line to be in the centre.

01:20.300 --> 01:27.060
Because we use in a purple background colour or dark buckram colours we want the div to have white text.

01:29.140 --> 01:30.980
And the purple buckram colour.

01:31.910 --> 01:37.170
Has the idae of 9 7 6 8 9 see.

01:39.030 --> 01:40.460
Let's take a look at the browser.

01:44.250 --> 01:51.030
Okay so we've now got the purple buckram colour and the white text so I can move on to the free individual

01:51.030 --> 01:52.230
offer device.

01:52.560 --> 02:01.320
So if we look back into the index page the free offers will give them a custom class offer and were

02:01.320 --> 02:05.070
used on all freelon so we can select that now.

02:09.700 --> 02:11.760
So the class of offer.

02:11.860 --> 02:15.040
So when I said the Darth buckram call a first.

02:15.280 --> 02:21.320
So the bucknam for the free offers has an idea of four year five to five f.

02:24.870 --> 02:29.750
There we go because these will be containers for the price circles.

02:29.880 --> 02:32.490
We're going to set the position to be relative.

02:36.340 --> 02:42.120
To make them a little bit taller will add a minimum height of 350 pixels high.

02:43.730 --> 02:45.240
And a little bit padding.

02:45.810 --> 02:53.000
So when out 40 pixels on the top and bottom and then 10 pixels on the left and right.

02:57.870 --> 03:05.340
Then next we can start uddin the price in circles so the price and circles were wrapped in a spam tag.

03:08.990 --> 03:12.930
So I can select them use any offer class and then spun.

03:14.680 --> 03:17.630
So let's start by changing the background colour.

03:20.310 --> 03:24.450
So the circles will have the killer of 8 a BBB one.

03:26.110 --> 03:28.770
And the display is going to be said to block.

03:31.020 --> 03:35.230
We'll give these a height and width of 100 pixels.

03:40.200 --> 03:45.270
Because the price is going to be inside will set the text allowing to be centre.

03:48.280 --> 03:50.570
So let's take a look and see how things look and so far.

03:51.520 --> 03:51.840
Okay.

03:51.880 --> 03:56.410
So we've got the free price and Dave's appear and we've got a different background colour.

03:56.470 --> 04:02.050
So next we need to make them a circle and then we need to look up position in the circles where we want

04:02.050 --> 04:02.510
them.

04:03.990 --> 04:08.070
So to make those circles we can just add a border radius.

04:09.720 --> 04:11.160
Of 100 percent.

04:14.950 --> 04:16.590
That makes them into a circle.

04:17.790 --> 04:23.520
And then to make the text vertically aligned we can also set the line height.

04:25.160 --> 04:29.820
To be 100 pixels which is the same as the full height of the div..

04:31.150 --> 04:34.380
And moves the price into the middle of the circle.

04:37.430 --> 04:44.590
So because we've got a relative container to work from we can set these price in circles to have a absolute

04:44.590 --> 04:45.370
position.

04:49.380 --> 04:53.520
So we'll start reference in the circles from the left hand side of the container.

04:53.910 --> 04:57.660
So we'll add some margin left of 50 percent.

05:04.810 --> 05:07.720
To put that into the middle of the container.

05:07.720 --> 05:13.720
Now it's not quite in the middle because we need to compensate for half of the width for the circle.

05:14.820 --> 05:16.650
So let's do that now.

05:16.710 --> 05:25.860
So if we set the left we can set the value to be negative 50 pixels which is half of the width and that

05:25.860 --> 05:29.120
should make them horizontally centred.

05:29.170 --> 05:33.070
And then next we can reference the circle from the top.

05:33.240 --> 05:34.690
So let's at the top.

05:35.100 --> 05:41.850
Now if we would set the value of the top to be zero what would happen is a circle would go to the top

05:41.850 --> 05:43.020
of the container.

05:43.020 --> 05:45.480
But we need the circle to be orval up.

05:45.510 --> 05:47.280
By half of the height.

05:47.280 --> 05:49.640
So instead of Certainly top to be zero.

05:51.040 --> 05:55.960
We can set the top to be negative 50 which is half of the height.

06:00.850 --> 06:01.190
There we go.

06:01.180 --> 06:04.080
So that's the position in exactly where we want it.

06:04.270 --> 06:09.150
Just to finish off the price in section we'll just add the font size and the font weight.

06:12.040 --> 06:13.800
So the font size.

06:15.160 --> 06:16.700
We changed it to two Ms.

06:18.010 --> 06:19.750
And lastly the phone wait.

06:21.270 --> 06:22.660
He is going to be bold.

06:26.340 --> 06:27.390
There we go.

06:27.390 --> 06:29.660
And then next will create some space in.

06:29.850 --> 06:33.360
So the offer name is in a level three haddin.

06:33.600 --> 06:39.390
So let's add some margin to the bottom just push the techs further down and can also increase the font

06:39.390 --> 06:43.310
size to or below the span's action.

06:44.370 --> 06:48.020
We've got the class of offer and then hate free.

06:50.240 --> 06:53.960
So margin bottom is 50 pixels.

06:54.380 --> 06:57.200
And also let's change the font size.

06:58.160 --> 07:00.140
To be one point two Ms.

07:04.100 --> 07:06.400
That gives us a little bit more space below the head.

07:07.800 --> 07:10.690
And I'm also going to add some spacing between the two lines below.

07:10.830 --> 07:16.750
By adding some extra line height so the two lines were in petersburg's.

07:16.980 --> 07:18.820
So the offer p.

07:22.010 --> 07:24.690
Were going to increase the line height to to Ms.

07:30.340 --> 07:32.620
Now gives us a little bit more vertical space in.

07:34.480 --> 07:40.420
No let's create some space between the divider and also the free special offers sections.

07:40.420 --> 07:47.890
So if you remember back in the index page in the first row which had the level to head in and the divide

07:47.890 --> 07:53.560
image we also added a custom class of margin bottom.

07:54.710 --> 07:57.160
So I can add that in our customer success.

08:00.030 --> 08:03.880
Pushed the fryday of dharm let's set the margin bottom.

08:04.920 --> 08:06.900
To be 70 pixels.

08:09.510 --> 08:11.650
And see how that looks great.

08:11.670 --> 08:12.990
That's exactly how I want it look.

08:12.990 --> 08:17.000
And on the rest of the if we shrink the browser down.

08:18.120 --> 08:19.860
Down to a mobile size.

08:20.680 --> 08:23.300
Then scroll down to the free offers.

08:23.300 --> 08:29.150
We just need to make it a little change on the margin bottom because the free device blend into one.

08:29.640 --> 08:33.270
When the stacked on top of each other and we can easily fix that.

08:35.970 --> 08:46.200
If we find the section with the offer class and then we can add some margin onto the balm of 60 pixels

08:47.010 --> 08:48.880
and let's see how that looks.

08:49.970 --> 08:54.110
That's a lot better now so we've got space between the three special offers on the mobile.

08:55.240 --> 08:59.120
So that it's lutts the end of the latest offer section.

08:59.140 --> 09:01.380
Thanks for listening and we'll see in the next video.
