WEBVTT

00:01.630 --> 00:05.320
Okay so in the last video we completely hedged him out on the C.

00:05.340 --> 00:11.610
As for the head section and next if we take a look at the finished website we're going to start moving

00:11.610 --> 00:12.000
down.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.910
I'm going to start with the welcome section.

00:14.940 --> 00:16.730
It's quite a simple section.

00:16.730 --> 00:20.760
There's just a level two heading up the top.

00:20.760 --> 00:26.980
There's also a divide image and then falling into different parts of the website.

00:27.420 --> 00:29.260
So let's get started.

00:29.280 --> 00:35.480
So head over to your index page and then copy the comment for the feature section.

00:37.990 --> 00:41.120
Amlin style work working just below the close and had its arg.

00:44.130 --> 00:45.010
Paste that in.

00:47.070 --> 00:50.070
And second to be the welcome section.

00:52.220 --> 01:00.800
So the welcome section is going to be in the section tags and the Section tigg is going to have an idea

01:01.820 --> 01:06.010
of welcome so we can use that in the CSA.

01:06.930 --> 01:15.990
The whole div needs to have a class of container so unlike the previous sections would just gone to

01:15.990 --> 01:23.640
use a set which container would only stretch to wide and then within the container we add the usual

01:24.240 --> 01:26.370
div with the class of row.

01:30.850 --> 01:37.770
Now we'll set the number of boost up columns so we want the level to head in and also the divider image

01:38.010 --> 01:40.090
to be half the width of the web page.

01:40.200 --> 01:43.190
So we'll set the number of columns to be 6.

01:43.400 --> 01:46.770
I will add an offset of free on the left on side.

01:47.600 --> 01:54.420
So will surround the text on the image with a div with a class of coal.

01:55.320 --> 01:56.190
S.

01:57.180 --> 01:57.950
6.

01:59.100 --> 02:00.730
And also for the offset.

02:01.790 --> 02:04.980
Call S M offset.

02:05.000 --> 02:05.620
Free.

02:10.100 --> 02:12.180
And then the level 2 heading.

02:12.440 --> 02:14.410
Which is welcome to tranquil spa.

02:20.780 --> 02:27.430
Then just below the heading will add the image so the image source this image is also in our images

02:27.430 --> 02:31.790
folder so images slash divider.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.370
Purple dot.

02:34.380 --> 02:35.430
P N G.

02:36.060 --> 02:42.030
So if we look at the finished project you can see that the divider purple is on the by buckram collar

02:43.000 --> 02:45.650
both fervid arm we've got a purple buckram collar.

02:45.870 --> 02:50.710
We've also got a divider with the silver parts so we use the.

02:50.730 --> 02:53.250
Divide a silver on these sections.

02:55.000 --> 03:01.260
So after the file path can add the old text or divider.

03:03.270 --> 03:05.180
And close that image off.

03:05.670 --> 03:08.730
Then let's just copy the closed div comments.

03:10.060 --> 03:12.640
So the first one is for the columns.

03:15.140 --> 03:17.680
The next one is for the rows.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.200
And the last one is for the container.

03:23.860 --> 03:28.230
So let's see how Let's look back into the browser and refresh.

03:34.060 --> 03:39.820
There was also the image and the text is centred when to do a little bit work with this.

03:39.830 --> 03:41.790
Yes yes but that's okay for now.

03:43.120 --> 03:46.850
And then next will create the four images.

03:46.860 --> 03:48.880
The four links just below.

03:49.240 --> 03:55.690
So back into the text editor to start just below the last clause and row but still would in the main

03:55.690 --> 03:56.490
container.

03:58.670 --> 04:00.850
Let's create a new row.

04:01.280 --> 04:03.850
So a div class of row.

04:08.310 --> 04:10.910
I will also add a custom class.

04:12.330 --> 04:13.540
All facilities.

04:15.120 --> 04:17.300
So can use in the CSA s.

04:17.520 --> 04:26.520
So each of the individual links is gonna take a free columns so i can create 4 different divs with a

04:26.520 --> 04:28.560
class of call S M free.

04:30.580 --> 04:31.670
So the first one.

04:32.690 --> 04:33.000
Div.

04:32.990 --> 04:34.400
Class of call.

04:34.420 --> 04:35.810
As N free.

04:38.830 --> 04:44.240
So both the image and the text is going to be a link so will add the a page ref.

04:45.220 --> 04:49.300
I want just leave the blank would in the link.

04:49.720 --> 04:55.160
Let's add the image first the image source of images.

04:56.350 --> 04:58.700
And the first image is make up.

04:58.750 --> 04:59.800
PRNG.

05:01.540 --> 05:05.000
With the old text which reads sidebar.

05:05.020 --> 05:06.790
So that old text.

05:08.950 --> 05:09.890
Is her.

05:11.670 --> 05:12.430
Make up.

05:13.790 --> 05:17.990
So then just after that image you can add the text for the link.

05:18.290 --> 05:27.540
So hair an end to get the symbol we use the unpersoned Then a ampie semicolon.

05:28.880 --> 05:30.090
And then make up.

05:32.470 --> 05:35.530
Then add some comments to the clothes and Dev's.

05:38.090 --> 05:40.430
So the outside one is for the role.

05:43.140 --> 05:46.540
Then the inner one is for the freak Island.

05:47.460 --> 05:52.930
So because we're going to be using this free column div four times let's copy this section.

05:54.640 --> 05:57.590
And then paste in below three more times.

05:59.870 --> 06:02.470
And save that and check it out in the browser.

06:07.270 --> 06:08.160
And refresh.

06:09.940 --> 06:15.730
Great artwork and we've got the four images all hyperlinks we can see the underline wants to hover over

06:16.050 --> 06:18.330
and also the text is there.

06:18.340 --> 06:21.110
So let's now change the images and the text.

06:21.430 --> 06:23.700
So the first day of it is fine.

06:23.950 --> 06:30.130
Let's move down to the second image and the second image has a name of candles.

06:31.560 --> 06:32.620
Dot PRNG.

06:33.420 --> 06:36.140
The alt text is spa facilities.

06:41.780 --> 06:44.250
And also the text is spa facilities.

06:48.530 --> 06:53.000
And in the third section has an image called Lake.

06:53.830 --> 06:57.890
Dopping n.j. and the text is lakeside retreat.

07:02.810 --> 07:04.970
And also the same for the old text.

07:09.960 --> 07:15.820
And finally the last one the image name is pool doppie n.j..

07:17.510 --> 07:19.580
The text is all our facilities.

07:25.370 --> 07:27.100
I will copy copied off of the old text too.

07:31.940 --> 07:32.240
OK.

07:32.270 --> 07:33.790
So let's see the browser.

07:35.010 --> 07:35.870
Refresh.

07:37.080 --> 07:38.610
OK that's fine for now.

07:38.790 --> 07:42.200
Next and then move on add some see says For this section.

07:42.210 --> 07:46.360
Want to make sure that the level 2 heading is centralized.

07:46.670 --> 07:50.170
When many times spacing in above and below the images.

07:50.340 --> 07:55.970
We're also going to centralize the text and remove the underline way and hovered over.

07:57.010 --> 07:59.290
L will also change the text colour.

07:59.590 --> 08:02.830
So let's do that in the custom C S S.

08:04.290 --> 08:09.530
When to start with the level to head in because we'll be using this many times over on the site.

08:09.840 --> 08:17.820
When I put this in the global section at the top so just blow the image I can add the hate to there.

08:18.560 --> 08:21.710
So we need to text the line centre.

08:24.610 --> 08:26.320
The font size.

08:27.000 --> 08:32.140
To be to MS and also to create a little bit space on the top and bottom.

08:32.280 --> 08:34.090
Let's add a little bit margin.

08:35.360 --> 08:39.260
So much in top 30 pixels.

08:40.680 --> 08:45.100
And also some margin on the bottom to be 20 pixels.

08:47.260 --> 08:49.450
So let's save that and check that out in the browser.

08:52.030 --> 08:53.620
So get the text in the middle.

08:53.640 --> 08:59.940
And also a little bit space a button below the wire wall so in the global section we can remove the

08:59.940 --> 09:03.480
on the line from the hyperlinks when we hover over.

09:04.740 --> 09:09.200
So just below the hate to let's select a.

09:14.460 --> 09:19.150
We could remove the underline by send the text decoration to be non.

09:20.690 --> 09:23.140
And it's also set the text call while we're here.

09:25.200 --> 09:30.420
So when hovered over it needs to be 9 7 6 8 9 see.

09:32.500 --> 09:38.370
So now when we hover over the exchange used to purple and underline has been removed.

09:39.360 --> 09:43.270
Because we've set the hate to font size to be two Ms.

09:43.560 --> 09:47.550
That's probably going to be a little bit too big when we get down to the mobile size.

09:47.730 --> 09:50.190
So let's head down to the media query.

09:53.490 --> 09:55.540
Below the feature text.

09:55.790 --> 09:57.360
That's our debate too.

09:58.400 --> 10:00.300
I would just reduce the font size.

10:01.870 --> 10:03.550
To be one point six.

10:05.440 --> 10:10.530
So now we've added the global styles we can start by adding a welcome section and add some of the whelk

10:10.870 --> 10:12.520
specific styles.

10:12.910 --> 10:15.030
So let's copy the comment.

10:17.020 --> 10:22.200
For mobile stylin I will paste it just above the mobile style section.

10:24.480 --> 10:26.850
Let's call this with the welcome section.

10:33.860 --> 10:37.980
So the welcome section would give a idees of welcome.

10:38.930 --> 10:41.650
Under welcome section has got a white buckram colour.

10:44.920 --> 10:48.400
And let's us on into the bottom of the section.

10:49.430 --> 10:51.720
So overing blow doesn't get too close.

10:51.830 --> 10:54.280
So we'll set the poem bomb to 30 pixels.

10:55.190 --> 10:59.050
I will also say all the text in this section to be in the centre.

11:02.180 --> 11:02.870
Okay.

11:04.570 --> 11:08.670
So in the global section we change the colour of the links when we hovered over them.

11:08.980 --> 11:13.710
But now we need to set the colour to override the default blue.

11:14.160 --> 11:23.870
So welcome and then a because air links and the caller is going to have the value of 494.

11:24.910 --> 11:26.190
Six for six.

11:28.080 --> 11:30.770
Which is the darker grey colour.

11:30.780 --> 11:37.880
So next in this section with the images and the text will want to make the text a little bit bigger.

11:38.100 --> 11:44.360
And also the individual images we've got to make them a little bit smaller and add some margin on the

11:44.370 --> 11:46.850
top and bottom to space on a little bit more.

11:47.250 --> 11:55.500
So surrounding this roll look back in the cage general the four individual divs were all surrounded

11:55.500 --> 12:01.280
with a roll and we'll give that roll a custom class of facilities.

12:01.440 --> 12:02.770
So let's use that now.

12:06.040 --> 12:10.150
So let's increase the font size so font size.

12:10.150 --> 12:12.470
That said that's a one point five Ms.

12:15.130 --> 12:18.670
And also the facility's image.

12:21.040 --> 12:24.480
So that said the display to be block.

12:26.090 --> 12:27.920
To make them a little bit smaller.

12:28.130 --> 12:31.540
We can set the maximum width to be 60 percent.

12:35.300 --> 12:36.560
So it looks a little bit better.

12:36.610 --> 12:38.160
And then to add the space in.

12:40.170 --> 12:48.500
Well set the margin of 30 pixels on the top and bottom and set the left and right to be auto.

12:55.340 --> 12:55.910
So there we go.

12:55.920 --> 12:58.520
So that's us finished now with the welcome section.

12:58.520 --> 13:00.060
That's the end of this video.

13:00.110 --> 13:05.120
If you join me in the next video we'll continue with the website and we'll move down to growing the

13:05.120 --> 13:07.140
latest offers section C there.
