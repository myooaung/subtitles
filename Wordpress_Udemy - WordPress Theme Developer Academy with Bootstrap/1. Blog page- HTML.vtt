WEBVTT

00:01.870 --> 00:02.470
Welcome back.

00:02.470 --> 00:04.180
We've now finished our index page.

00:04.210 --> 00:10.900
Our bootstrap template and in this next few videos we're going to be great in the last few pages to

00:10.900 --> 00:15.300
finish off our bootstrap template and then start converting to Wordpress.

00:15.310 --> 00:20.450
So in this video we're going to be starting with the blog page so we you take a look at the finish projects

00:20.830 --> 00:23.660
and get an idea of what we're going to be creating.

00:23.740 --> 00:28.220
So were the reason we had this section and also the background image.

00:28.300 --> 00:34.530
But will a change in the text to trunkless spa fishell blog and then scroll down.

00:34.720 --> 00:38.280
We're going to have the individual blog posts on the left hand side.

00:39.670 --> 00:42.110
I will put free those in our template.

00:42.630 --> 00:45.800
We'll have some links to older and newer posts.

00:46.100 --> 00:51.210
And on the right hand side will have a sidebar and a sidebar have a little bit a text about the website

00:51.920 --> 00:55.940
we'll have an archived page where all the blog post will be stored.

00:55.950 --> 01:01.560
Buy one for year will also be separating the blog posts into categories and then if you go a little

01:01.560 --> 01:04.930
bit further down the page will also be reused in the foot section.

01:06.030 --> 01:09.240
So most of the sidebar will just be empty links for now.

01:09.240 --> 01:14.790
These will be generated dynamically in Word Press so we'll just be adding them in Bootstrap as empty

01:14.790 --> 01:17.870
links to get the look and feel the site right.

01:18.120 --> 01:19.310
So let's get started.

01:19.320 --> 01:21.640
So head over to our text editor.

01:21.780 --> 01:27.870
Weird Al project and then create a new page and saves up as Blog.

01:28.100 --> 01:33.540
Or hate him I'll make sure that's saved in the same level as the index page.

01:34.750 --> 01:41.500
And then if you go into the index page that we finished earlier and select all and copy.

01:43.860 --> 01:47.280
And then we can use this as a starting point for our blog page.

01:49.090 --> 01:50.930
Um peyster in Seoul.

01:50.950 --> 01:56.170
As I mentioned earlier will be using the same head is selection sort of scroll down to the end of the

01:56.230 --> 01:57.510
close in header tag.

02:00.250 --> 02:01.780
Which is just.

02:02.870 --> 02:04.980
We can start by deleting the welcome section.

02:08.830 --> 02:10.670
And the latest Office section.

02:10.730 --> 02:13.850
I keep going all the way down to the start to the footer section.

02:15.230 --> 02:16.280
And then delete.

02:17.770 --> 02:20.950
So as it stands you've just got the header and footer section.

02:21.280 --> 02:26.940
So the first thing I'm going to change is the feature text which going to change is too tranquil spa

02:26.950 --> 02:27.930
official blog.

02:33.840 --> 02:34.530
There you go.

02:35.710 --> 02:39.590
And then we're gonna use a bootstrap template for old blogs.

02:39.770 --> 02:43.460
So if you head over to get boost up dot com.

02:47.800 --> 02:53.360
And then select the Getting Started section and then scroll down to the bootstrap templates.

02:54.380 --> 02:56.240
You'll see this on default templates.

02:56.270 --> 02:57.770
Boost provides.

02:57.810 --> 02:59.650
There should be one called blog.

03:01.560 --> 03:07.400
So we select the blog I am going to be select and some of the parts of this website to use the template.

03:07.670 --> 03:12.180
So the side buys on the right hand side and also the blog post on the left.

03:12.240 --> 03:15.000
So this is going to create a good start point for our blog.

03:15.380 --> 03:21.180
So to get the coal for this we need to control click right click go to view page source.

03:22.920 --> 03:26.660
OK it's all going to copy the code with the blog post unsober.

03:26.940 --> 03:31.770
So if you just scroll down a little bit further and willing to copy the container which you did below.

03:31.770 --> 03:40.470
The blog must read or copied the open container and then down past the posts.

03:41.840 --> 03:44.400
Only to copy it all the way down to the sidebar.

03:45.510 --> 03:49.520
So at the end of the sidebar end of the row the end of the container.

03:49.560 --> 03:51.190
So copy all that section.

03:52.030 --> 03:54.360
And then go back into the text editor.

03:55.980 --> 03:57.850
Tween the header on the footer section.

03:58.670 --> 03:59.700
Let's pay for it.

04:02.120 --> 04:05.270
To make things a little bit more clearer I can add some comments.

04:06.350 --> 04:09.290
So let's add the first comment to the sidebar.

04:11.340 --> 04:14.860
So look for the end of the blog and paste it just below.

04:18.080 --> 04:20.300
Change the name to the sidebar section.

04:22.730 --> 04:23.520
Scroll up.

04:24.760 --> 04:29.280
And then up to the open in blog post which is.

04:30.950 --> 04:32.430
Just above the container.

04:32.800 --> 04:34.070
So I'll paste it in.

04:34.450 --> 04:36.160
This can be the blog section.

04:39.340 --> 04:40.180
Oh Kate.

04:40.380 --> 04:45.900
So next we'll take a look at how that look and so far now we'll see what changes we need to make.

04:46.220 --> 04:52.120
OK so we got our header section and then we've got the sample blog post on the left and the sidebar

04:52.180 --> 04:53.770
exactly we want it.

04:53.940 --> 04:56.810
We've got the footer section at the bottom.

04:57.850 --> 05:03.780
So back into the text editor or she want to remove the bouchra blog heading up the top.

05:04.120 --> 05:05.250
So let's do that now.

05:06.410 --> 05:09.300
So I would just leave the full day of the blog.

05:10.970 --> 05:11.680
Well great.

05:15.070 --> 05:16.050
Let's take a look at that.

05:17.770 --> 05:18.040
OK.

05:18.140 --> 05:22.210
That's the head in removed and by default on the bootstrap template.

05:22.210 --> 05:23.250
That would be copied.

05:23.390 --> 05:26.340
There's three different styles of blog posts.

05:26.480 --> 05:28.720
So to keep our website consistent.

05:28.940 --> 05:31.230
I'm going to use the word blog post.

05:32.300 --> 05:39.710
So go back into the blog section and each individual blog post has a class of blog post.

05:39.710 --> 05:40.410
So we're nowhere.

05:40.430 --> 05:42.600
Each blog starts and ends.

05:42.740 --> 05:44.390
So this is a first one.

05:45.430 --> 05:50.300
I scroll down to the close in time for the blog post and delete this one.

05:57.510 --> 06:00.030
I was going to delete the second blog post.

06:01.600 --> 06:04.320
So look for the closed if the blog post.

06:06.170 --> 06:08.050
And select that and lete.

06:08.900 --> 06:11.850
And then we just left with the third and final blog post.

06:11.930 --> 06:15.060
So to put this back in when a copy this style.

06:17.460 --> 06:19.670
And then paste it back in twice below.

06:22.280 --> 06:23.650
And the second the browser.

06:25.790 --> 06:28.890
So what's now got free blog posts buckin or page.

06:28.890 --> 06:34.740
But there are consistent style and their necks will change the text in the bult a section on sidebar.

06:36.070 --> 06:42.460
So scroll down to the sidebar section and if we look at the about section we can just delete the sample

06:42.460 --> 06:46.970
text between the petersburg's and what we don't actually own.

06:47.020 --> 06:50.410
So welcome to the official tranquil spa blog.

06:55.820 --> 06:56.340
OK.

06:57.490 --> 06:59.470
And a second sentence just below.

06:59.740 --> 07:01.180
Also in petersburg's.

07:01.510 --> 07:03.970
So he will find all the latest news.

07:14.010 --> 07:15.880
And what's going on here at the spa.

07:22.160 --> 07:22.830
Well go.

07:24.110 --> 07:29.790
Suttie but was section will keep the archives as it is for now and will make this work dynamically in

07:29.890 --> 07:31.720
wordpress later on in the course.

07:32.790 --> 07:35.820
Elsewhere a section that changes to categories.

07:38.130 --> 07:40.230
Let's add some categories in there for now.

07:40.250 --> 07:45.010
So the first one can be changing to news and then offers.

07:46.480 --> 07:48.580
And then lastly on categorize.

07:52.890 --> 07:57.920
And they will put our social media section in so with a copy of the sidebar module div..

08:00.050 --> 08:04.900
And patience in just below you can change the categories to followers.

08:08.450 --> 08:12.230
And because we've got all the social media links already in the footage section.

08:13.050 --> 08:15.710
We can just go back into our index page.

08:17.030 --> 08:20.520
Can locate the social media icons.

08:22.610 --> 08:25.040
Down at the very bottom in the footer.

08:25.190 --> 08:27.790
So if a copy of the five social media links.

08:30.110 --> 08:32.570
And then paste these black into the blog section.

08:35.300 --> 08:37.120
Dillie those first and paste them in.

08:39.350 --> 08:41.730
And then let's save that and see how it's looking in the browser.

08:46.110 --> 08:46.340
Okay.

08:46.360 --> 08:48.900
That's a fine we've got the about text.

08:48.990 --> 08:54.460
We then got the archives the categories section and the social media section.

08:56.560 --> 08:59.080
So it's nearly finished with the placatory mail.

08:59.220 --> 09:04.130
Just one more little thing I'd like to change is if we go to the container for the blog.

09:08.900 --> 09:14.450
So one thing I'd like to change for the number of columns on the blog Undy sidebar.

09:14.690 --> 09:22.040
So by default bootstrap has the blog section taken up a parts on the smaller devices like I used to

09:22.040 --> 09:29.140
be 12 columns wide smolla devices and then changed to 8 on Medium devices.

09:30.200 --> 09:33.260
And then we also need to go down to the sidebar section.

09:36.100 --> 09:42.570
And do the same for the sidebar wrapper to make the I buy go full width on small advices you can change

09:42.570 --> 09:44.050
up to 12 gollum's.

09:45.310 --> 09:48.700
And then change it to call Andy free.

09:49.830 --> 09:56.560
Steak free columns on Medium devices and then because we change up to medium will also change the offset

09:57.430 --> 10:03.940
on the medium devices to one just was a little bit distance between the blog post on the sidebar and

10:03.940 --> 10:04.750
saved up.

10:05.060 --> 10:08.300
OK so let us finish for the hate mail for the blog section.

10:08.380 --> 10:13.360
If you join me in the next video we'll continue our blog page by Add in the C S S.
