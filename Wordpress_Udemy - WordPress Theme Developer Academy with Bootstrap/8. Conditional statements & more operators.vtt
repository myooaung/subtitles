00:03.130 --> 00:03.820
Welcome back.

00:03.820 --> 00:10.210
In this video going take a look at conditional statements and some more useful operators conditional

00:10.210 --> 00:15.400
statements use when Want to check if a certain condition is true.

00:15.400 --> 00:18.790
If so we can then tell the program what to do next.

00:19.290 --> 00:25.830
For example you can check if a user is logged in and if they are then making sure the user's information

00:26.280 --> 00:29.250
on the screen such as the username.

00:29.250 --> 00:33.440
So let's first get started by looking at the most basic conditional statement.

00:33.720 --> 00:34.970
The if statement.

00:36.080 --> 00:40.210
Sort of begin by creating a couple of variables to work with.

00:40.630 --> 00:48.520
So you see a dollar sign and the first variable is gone to be logged in an on set list to a boolean

00:48.520 --> 00:49.360
value.

00:49.420 --> 00:53.530
So if you remember that could be true or false.

00:53.680 --> 00:56.030
So let's initially said that too true.

00:58.030 --> 01:00.130
And then the second variable.

01:01.010 --> 01:04.190
This is gonna be the user's name.

01:04.190 --> 01:06.760
So this is a string.

01:07.230 --> 01:09.820
So when I add the user name into the.

01:10.860 --> 01:15.080
And then when I use a IF statement to check if a condition is true.

01:15.660 --> 01:22.800
So begin by youzhny if keyword and then after that a set brackets so inside there.

01:22.800 --> 01:25.700
This is the condition that we need to check against.

01:25.950 --> 01:28.880
So we want to check if the user is logged in.

01:29.690 --> 01:32.080
So to test if logged in is true.

01:32.360 --> 01:36.120
Just insert the variable name of logged in.

01:36.560 --> 01:37.640
Inside there.

01:39.430 --> 01:42.470
And then we add the pair of curly races.

01:42.760 --> 01:49.450
So if this condition is true then we run the code which is between the two curly braces.

01:49.450 --> 01:55.670
So as an example if I were use it is logged in would have gone to echo to the browser a message just

01:55.690 --> 01:57.570
saying welcome bark.

02:01.270 --> 02:08.470
Then a comma and then and just add with the period for the dot the user name which is stored in the

02:08.500 --> 02:10.990
variable called user.

02:14.020 --> 02:17.160
And then don't forget the semicolon at the end of the statement.

02:17.710 --> 02:21.060
So I'll just save that and then when I go over to the browser.

02:22.240 --> 02:28.930
And then refresh this so great so we got the message saying welcome by Chris because our condition is

02:29.020 --> 02:29.900
set to true.

02:30.990 --> 02:37.840
If changes to be false we shouldn't get anything on the screen so our message is not displayed.

02:38.890 --> 02:41.060
So that's a basic if statements.

02:41.080 --> 02:45.800
So now we're going to move on to taking a look after using comparison operators.

02:45.870 --> 02:47.020
Some went ahead earlier today.

02:47.050 --> 02:49.580
That will be free schools website.

02:49.970 --> 02:56.890
I'm on the comparison operators section so I can also use these comparisons with IF statements so I

02:56.890 --> 02:59.590
can check if two values are equal.

03:00.540 --> 03:02.750
And the double equals is for checking.

03:02.760 --> 03:11.040
If two values are equal value and is also a triple equals which checks if the two values are equal value

03:11.250 --> 03:12.840
and also the same type.

03:13.140 --> 03:17.480
So by type 1 mean if they're both a string or both a number.

03:18.490 --> 03:23.060
You can also combine wade in exclamation mark to do the exact opposite.

03:23.560 --> 03:25.050
So this would be not equal.

03:25.890 --> 03:32.800
We can use the less than or greater than symbol to check if condition is less than a smaller one.

03:32.820 --> 03:37.920
We can also use less than or equal to a greater than unequal two.

03:38.250 --> 03:42.090
So let's put these inside other statements as an example.

03:43.080 --> 03:45.750
So I'm going to use a new variable.

03:45.960 --> 03:51.460
So this is a number and I'll set this to be a initial value of 10.

03:54.320 --> 03:59.160
So now we'll check in if the variable of no.

04:00.070 --> 04:02.150
Is greater than 5.

04:03.540 --> 04:09.400
Then can do a echo same statement is true.

04:14.330 --> 04:17.120
So let's check that so our number is great in a 5.

04:17.120 --> 04:21.090
So we should get the statement is true printed to the browser.

04:21.190 --> 04:23.720
So let's just check the refresh.

04:23.990 --> 04:25.030
And of course we do.

04:26.410 --> 04:28.600
Changes to be less than.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.530
This of course is false.

04:32.800 --> 04:34.280
So the tech should disappear.

04:35.320 --> 04:41.470
And just like on the doubly free schools website we can check using any of these operators so we can

04:41.470 --> 04:44.180
use less than or equal to.

04:45.210 --> 04:46.630
So we've said this to be 10.

04:46.710 --> 04:48.950
This is of course equal to 10.

04:49.020 --> 04:51.030
So this statement should be true.

04:52.380 --> 04:53.200
Which is.

04:54.570 --> 04:59.180
So we'll have before at the double and the triple equal symbol.

05:00.930 --> 05:03.200
So let's begin with the double equals.

05:04.160 --> 05:05.480
And rather than no.

05:05.840 --> 05:11.680
Let's put this inside the causations sewn into a string.

05:11.930 --> 05:15.690
So let's just say that in refresh and see what happens.

05:16.580 --> 05:19.730
OK so we've got the statement as being true.

05:20.360 --> 05:22.880
So all of the values above 10.

05:23.000 --> 05:28.600
This is a number and this is classed as a string because in the quotations.

05:29.530 --> 05:36.420
So let's just put a third equal symbol into there and save and then see what happens.

05:36.610 --> 05:44.020
So will lose the text say in stayman is true and this is because using a tribble equals checks Borf

05:44.050 --> 05:45.870
the value.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.020
So the value is equal and also a type.

05:49.740 --> 05:54.230
So the type is not equal because this is a string and this is a number.

05:55.320 --> 05:55.650
OK.

05:55.700 --> 06:01.250
A usent is statements are really good if we only want to test against one outcome.

06:01.250 --> 06:07.740
But if want to test against more than one outcome we need to use a if l statements or even else.

06:07.760 --> 06:11.860
If so let's first begin by using if else statements.

06:12.710 --> 06:16.550
Unless it changes Bach to be a number.

06:16.800 --> 06:24.770
So if number is less than 10 that changes to be the number is less than an.

06:28.270 --> 06:32.020
So as you know the estate will check if the number is less than 10.

06:32.290 --> 06:34.580
And then print it to the screen.

06:35.110 --> 06:38.860
But you can also provide a second outcome to test against.

06:38.860 --> 06:42.160
In case this is not true solver can use the.

06:42.160 --> 06:48.460
Else key word and then inside the curly braces you can provide a second Echo.

06:49.150 --> 06:59.920
So no is n less than 10 and the semicolon soul will initially check if this statement is true and if

06:59.920 --> 07:02.030
not this will be printed to the screen.

07:03.040 --> 07:06.380
So let's say that and then refresh.

07:06.940 --> 07:09.580
So no is not less than 10.

07:11.830 --> 07:14.220
And of course it isn't because it is number 10.

07:14.770 --> 07:21.470
So you can just put a number operator in there so to test if the number is less than or equal to 10.

07:22.760 --> 07:23.710
So save that.

07:24.020 --> 07:27.000
And this should now change to say number is less than 10.

07:27.950 --> 07:29.230
Or in fact equal to.

07:30.160 --> 07:34.420
But what if you wanted to test against free or more conditions.

07:34.420 --> 07:41.050
Well this is where else if comes in and was put these on separate lines just to make it look the more

07:41.050 --> 07:41.920
readable.

07:47.340 --> 07:55.500
So in between the if and the else were can changes to be ELSE IF and then use the brackets for a condition

07:55.530 --> 07:57.490
to test against.

07:57.490 --> 08:03.410
So first of all check in if the number is less than 10 will can then use the L safety test.

08:03.420 --> 08:06.010
If the number is equal to 10.

08:07.010 --> 08:11.070
So again the variable of no equal to 10.

08:12.390 --> 08:15.960
Well change is to be number is 10.

08:16.850 --> 08:22.870
And then finally if these options are both false will get the buckle up so can set the else statement

08:22.870 --> 08:26.110
back into there as a fallback.

08:26.140 --> 08:35.500
So it's standard and Acco number is not less or equal to 10.

08:37.680 --> 08:38.870
So let's test this.

08:39.800 --> 08:43.140
So first of all we'll set the number to be less than 10.

08:43.820 --> 08:45.880
So should get number is less than 10.

08:47.270 --> 08:48.350
Refresh.

08:49.100 --> 08:50.530
So number is less than 10.

08:51.960 --> 08:54.410
If the number was changed to be equal to 10.

08:54.540 --> 08:56.450
Of course we should get this statement.

08:57.900 --> 08:59.370
Of number is 10.

09:00.440 --> 09:07.940
And then finally if the value is greater than 10 so should at 14 we should get.

09:07.950 --> 09:10.540
No it's not less or equals 10.

09:12.540 --> 09:13.800
So refresh.

09:14.020 --> 09:20.620
And there were golts that I can use if else and ELSE IF statements to test against multiple outcomes.

09:22.100 --> 09:27.910
Okay so the final thing I want to take a look at in this video is logical operators.

09:27.910 --> 09:34.330
So let's go back over to the doubly free schools example and let's take a look at the logical operators

09:35.230 --> 09:36.890
which is a little bit further down.

09:38.610 --> 09:44.610
So as well as a test that we use before to test if conditions are less than greater than or equal to

09:44.610 --> 09:48.190
for example you can also use the and operator.

09:48.930 --> 09:53.230
To check if more than one condition is met and.

09:53.750 --> 09:56.860
We can also check if one value or another is true.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.780
And also the exclamation mark.

09:59.830 --> 10:02.090
The test if a condition is not true.

10:05.150 --> 10:05.370
OK.

10:05.390 --> 10:08.100
So I want to start by creating two variables.

10:08.340 --> 10:09.750
So number one.

10:10.800 --> 10:13.370
And then also number two.

10:15.690 --> 10:17.990
And as far as you can be 10.

10:19.570 --> 10:23.860
Then they could remove everything else apart from the IF statements.

10:24.950 --> 10:25.180
OK.

10:25.220 --> 10:30.290
So you wanted to test against both of these conditions rather than just one.

10:30.350 --> 10:35.410
So if number one was equal to 5.

10:36.650 --> 10:39.820
I also want to check if number two is equal to 10.

10:40.380 --> 10:45.420
So we can use the double ampersands or the key word.

10:46.140 --> 10:47.840
So when we use these.

10:47.940 --> 10:49.950
So number one is equal to five.

10:50.280 --> 10:54.330
And also number two is equal to 10.

10:56.620 --> 10:59.850
So I call stayman is true.

11:06.430 --> 11:08.580
Shetter BACK to be the dollar.

11:09.010 --> 11:09.910
They have a go.

11:09.910 --> 11:11.650
So of course both these statements are true.

11:11.650 --> 11:13.700
So will she get this print into the screen.

11:18.010 --> 11:22.100
But if even of these two statements return false.

11:22.100 --> 11:24.420
We shouldn't get anything at all.

11:24.530 --> 11:27.010
So let's change that to be too.

11:27.150 --> 11:29.410
So of course no one is not true.

11:30.250 --> 11:36.750
Our money both for these to be true for this to be printed signed off with save a refresh we should

11:36.750 --> 11:38.620
get the message moved.

11:41.690 --> 11:46.790
A good change is to be or which is the two pipes.

11:47.210 --> 11:51.090
So just like we've seen before we can use two pipes or.

11:51.120 --> 11:51.430
Or.

11:51.440 --> 11:52.550
Operator.

11:54.460 --> 11:58.150
So now will need one of these statements to evaluate to true.

11:58.630 --> 12:00.600
So number two is true.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.410
Number one is false.

12:02.890 --> 12:08.700
So now they should get the message printed again on the screen said etches test.

12:09.160 --> 12:10.880
And then refresh which we do.

12:12.190 --> 12:12.500
Okay.

12:12.510 --> 12:13.910
That's it for this video.

12:14.080 --> 12:18.890
And that's a basic look at conditional statements and some page be operators.

12:19.880 --> 12:21.510
So thank you and I'll see it again.
