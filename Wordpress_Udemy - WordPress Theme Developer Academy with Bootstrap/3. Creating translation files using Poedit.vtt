00:02.270 --> 00:10.550
OK so now a theme is already to be translated so I will show you next how to do a process call localization.

00:10.580 --> 00:19.160
This mainly consists of create a template file called a pot file and it stands for portable object template.

00:19.160 --> 00:25.460
And this will basically be a directory or a catalogue of all the translatable words in the theme.

00:25.760 --> 00:32.330
And then we use the content of this profile to create a peel file which will actually hold the Translate

00:32.330 --> 00:35.550
strings in in a language your choice.

00:35.570 --> 00:39.200
So we're going to get started with some software called p-o edit.

00:39.200 --> 00:44.780
So I'm going to go to Google and search for p-o at it.

00:46.150 --> 00:49.600
And then select peel at it dot net which should be the top one.

00:51.130 --> 00:56.910
Peel and it will be the software we use to actually do the language conversion and it's free to download

00:56.920 --> 00:59.670
for Mac Windows or Linux.

00:59.770 --> 01:04.720
There is a pro version which makes it a little bit easier but we don't need that for now.

01:04.960 --> 01:09.000
So simply click on the free download for your operating system.

01:10.880 --> 01:12.980
And give us a few moments just to download.

01:16.200 --> 01:17.800
So once it's downloaded.

01:18.570 --> 01:19.610
Unzip the file.

01:21.060 --> 01:22.610
Download it in the usual way.

01:25.880 --> 01:28.440
So then I put mine in the applications for the.

01:33.680 --> 01:34.850
So want to get started.

01:34.850 --> 01:38.040
You should see a welcome window similar to this.

01:38.050 --> 01:43.820
No we to create our pot or template file in pln it go to file and then new.

01:44.680 --> 01:47.850
And then select the language of your theme.

01:47.980 --> 01:51.250
So mine is English and then press enter.

01:51.440 --> 01:52.080
Okay.

01:53.220 --> 01:57.970
So then if you go up to the catalogue at the top and then go to properties.

01:58.810 --> 02:04.600
So start with some project information and we'll call mine tranquil new.

02:05.200 --> 02:11.920
And then we need to tell people where the sources of the translatable words so go to the sources key

02:11.920 --> 02:12.920
words tab.

02:13.970 --> 02:15.860
And then to add some key words.

02:15.860 --> 02:18.630
Select the second button which is for the new item.

02:19.160 --> 02:25.490
So you want to get started with the two underscores and the two underscores was the prefix that we use

02:25.490 --> 02:26.800
for these functions.

02:26.900 --> 02:28.860
So add that up and hit enter.

02:31.550 --> 02:36.970
And then again add one more which was the underscore and E which was the echo function.

02:38.190 --> 02:39.330
So enter.

02:39.900 --> 02:41.600
I'm going to also add one more.

02:42.740 --> 02:45.970
Four escaped strings so escape.

02:47.020 --> 02:51.360
SC underscore our tribute on this score.

02:52.700 --> 02:54.320
So that also that one in.

02:54.840 --> 03:00.430
And any of the key words that you use in your themes make sure you add these in to and then go to okay.

03:02.120 --> 03:04.560
And then go to extract from sources.

03:04.670 --> 03:07.370
I will need to say this file first before I would do that.

03:07.670 --> 03:10.720
So go to file and then save us.

03:10.880 --> 03:13.080
And then this is gonna be our pot file.

03:13.100 --> 03:19.880
So when I say this into our theme of the theme folder and make sure that the languages folder that were

03:19.880 --> 03:22.610
created is open.

03:22.610 --> 03:27.910
So the Feme name were added was tranquil hyphen new.

03:28.100 --> 03:36.140
And then when he'd say this as a pot file but by default it shouldn't nose do that it will automatically

03:36.170 --> 03:38.030
say was a peel file.

03:38.030 --> 03:39.520
So you can just use p o.

03:40.090 --> 03:42.840
And then I can just manually change the extension.

03:43.030 --> 03:44.990
If you go into the languages folder.

03:46.090 --> 03:52.050
So just click on the file which is created and change the file extension to p o t.

03:53.550 --> 03:54.580
And then use that.

03:56.740 --> 03:56.950
OK.

03:57.010 --> 04:01.810
So then go back into p or edit and when to extract the text to be translated.

04:01.810 --> 04:04.720
So sled extract from sources at the bottom.

04:06.020 --> 04:09.990
Okay so next will add the path to our Were our theme.

04:09.990 --> 04:17.580
So underneath the pass click on the plus icon and go to add folders and then select the theme folder

04:18.560 --> 04:22.240
and then select the truckled WP theme and then open.

04:23.180 --> 04:24.590
And then click on OK.

04:26.660 --> 04:32.070
So now our pop file has instructed all the text strings from all thien.

04:32.090 --> 04:35.690
This is now our catalogue that we can use as a template.

04:35.690 --> 04:36.950
So save up.

04:37.100 --> 04:44.600
And next we can use this template create a peel file which will hold the Translate strings Sogo to create

04:44.600 --> 04:51.320
new translation and then we need to select the language of the translation that we want so we can just

04:51.500 --> 04:54.580
select a language that you like to translate to.

04:54.920 --> 05:01.170
So I'm going to pick a random one syllable for Greek and then.

05:01.190 --> 05:01.840
Okay.

05:03.240 --> 05:10.560
So now if you look at the top of the page we've got a l file called E L which is the Greek prefix.

05:10.800 --> 05:12.200
So and when I say the.

05:13.350 --> 05:17.570
And again make sure this is in the languages folder and then hit save.

05:19.380 --> 05:21.030
So now one go through the.

05:21.150 --> 05:25.960
Strings will consider that some translation suggestions appear on the right.

05:26.130 --> 05:31.680
Or we can manually typed them in up the bottom so is just a case of selecting the text if we want to

05:31.680 --> 05:32.410
translate.

05:33.210 --> 05:40.440
And then uddin that inner angle for these monthly admin or click on the suggestions and then get the

05:40.440 --> 05:42.870
Greek translation appearing on the right.

05:43.440 --> 05:46.430
So once you finish it up just hit the save button.

05:46.470 --> 05:52.980
So now when you go back in to the theme and the language is folder which should now have the port file

05:52.980 --> 05:59.340
which is a template and then we should have two files with the file name of the country you've selected

05:59.880 --> 06:08.010
and want an end in P L which is the translation and then bossiest a m o file which if you go back into

06:08.010 --> 06:15.370
the documentation you can see this is the actual compiled machine readable version of the kill file.

06:15.480 --> 06:17.820
So we also need that too.

06:18.180 --> 06:18.660
So that's it.

06:18.660 --> 06:22.450
That's how you translate your theme into different languages.

06:22.470 --> 06:28.710
You may not necessarily have to add the piel files into your Feme bore as long as we've got the template

06:28.710 --> 06:34.610
file on the file we can allow end users to translate into their own particular language.

06:35.190 --> 06:36.760
So there goes the function watchin.

06:36.810 --> 06:39.080
And that's the end of the translation section.
