WEBVTT

00:01.380 --> 00:02.010
Welcome back.

00:02.010 --> 00:06.240
In the last video we created the hate gym for the Harris section.

00:06.240 --> 00:14.520
We included the top nomination bar with the menu links the main background image and also the featured

00:14.520 --> 00:15.500
text.

00:15.540 --> 00:21.890
So in this video we'll go on to make our website look more like the finished project by uddin the CSA

00:21.880 --> 00:22.640
s.

00:22.860 --> 00:29.460
So going to change the link colour and background for the navigation and we're also going to style the

00:29.490 --> 00:35.510
text and make sure that it's horizontally and vertically aligned to the background image.

00:36.450 --> 00:41.760
We'll also take a look at the bootstrap grid system and I'll show you how to add a column so our website

00:41.780 --> 00:43.170
to make it responsive.

00:44.020 --> 00:46.490
So let's get started in our text editor.

00:48.860 --> 00:55.750
We need to pull up the side bar and go into our custom see SS So just below the body still wouldn't

00:55.760 --> 00:57.170
the global section.

00:57.230 --> 01:02.630
The first thing needs art is a max width for the images.

01:02.710 --> 01:05.230
I am going to set them to 100 percent.

01:06.150 --> 01:06.680
Which stops.

01:06.690 --> 01:08.630
Image is stretched too big.

01:09.480 --> 01:13.710
So let's create a comment for the nut bar section.

01:18.790 --> 01:25.340
So we're going to get started with the nut bar section and the main navigation has the class of mudbath.

01:25.630 --> 01:30.540
So this is a PA will be style first so dot and then move bar.

01:32.860 --> 01:35.440
So we need to add the purple background colour.

01:36.340 --> 01:43.250
So the background is gone have a number of 9 7 6 8 9 C.

01:44.320 --> 01:44.720
Let's check.

01:44.740 --> 01:45.830
That's working okay.

01:46.730 --> 01:48.730
So the background colour has changed.

01:48.860 --> 01:55.000
But we need to get rid of the margin which is at the very bottom and push in the background image down.

01:55.970 --> 01:59.220
So we simply do that by changing the margin bottom.

02:00.180 --> 02:01.130
To be zero.

02:04.870 --> 02:05.870
Okay.

02:06.330 --> 02:09.820
And the next thing I want to do is remove the default border.

02:09.890 --> 02:15.990
It's pretty hard to see the default border around the navigation bar but we can remove the by just send

02:16.040 --> 02:19.070
the border to be zero.

02:22.310 --> 02:26.740
And then now we need to change the text for the logo and the navigation.

02:26.960 --> 02:32.840
So bookstop has a lot of classes and a lot see assess which is included as standard and it can be sometimes

02:32.840 --> 02:36.890
difficult to find exactly which class we need to amend.

02:36.890 --> 02:43.340
So one of the easiest ways to do that is to go into the browser developer tools so when Chrome need

02:43.340 --> 02:46.240
to right click and select inspect element.

02:50.920 --> 02:53.540
And then if you select the magnifying glass.

02:55.400 --> 02:58.090
And then just hover over the element we need to change.

02:59.510 --> 03:00.390
And click.

03:00.500 --> 03:06.980
And then we should get a list of the classes which is affecting this particular element so we can see

03:06.980 --> 03:14.140
the first element is the killer for the nut bar default nut bar brun's and that's in the bootstrap mini

03:14.150 --> 03:17.250
fied version so we can change that colour.

03:17.670 --> 03:19.370
So I'm going to copy.

03:21.100 --> 03:23.470
The class which effects that colour.

03:24.740 --> 03:27.890
And then back into our custom Yes.

03:29.370 --> 03:30.490
Let's paste this in.

03:31.830 --> 03:33.620
And change the colour.

03:35.740 --> 03:36.690
To be white.

03:40.760 --> 03:42.990
And that changes the colour of the logo.

03:43.290 --> 03:46.910
We need to also do the same for the navigation links.

03:47.780 --> 03:48.970
Which is a home blog.

03:48.990 --> 03:50.570
Our latest news.

03:50.630 --> 03:51.200
Solar gain.

03:51.200 --> 03:52.400
Do the same.

03:52.460 --> 03:56.660
Select the magnifying glass and choose one of the links.

03:59.540 --> 04:06.160
And again we can override the standard defog grey colour by copying the bootstrap class.

04:07.550 --> 04:12.100
Because we also want this to be a white book in our dis in the same section.

04:18.110 --> 04:19.690
And that changes those to white.

04:20.510 --> 04:26.540
And then on the smaller mobile view we also want the free icon bars to be white too.

04:26.570 --> 04:29.250
So again select the magnifying glass.

04:29.300 --> 04:35.420
If you can just select one of the icon bars and make sure we can find one which controls a background

04:35.420 --> 04:36.250
colour.

04:38.810 --> 04:42.440
Copy the glasses and then let's put those into.

04:42.440 --> 04:43.570
I will see SS.

04:47.020 --> 04:49.550
And let's change the default back runkel.

04:53.770 --> 04:55.120
We changed to white.

04:58.070 --> 04:58.980
Refresh.

05:03.850 --> 05:06.680
Great There we go so that icon bars are white now.

05:06.810 --> 05:12.880
So it's all the style and we need to add to the top navigation bar so we can move down to the featured

05:12.880 --> 05:18.280
area and we can start working on position in the image and the text.

05:19.400 --> 05:21.830
So let's create a new comment for the feature section.

05:31.010 --> 05:33.910
And so I can add the text over the image.

05:34.020 --> 05:40.520
We need to use some relative arm absolute position and so we need to make the contain a relative token

05:40.550 --> 05:40.980
position.

05:40.980 --> 05:42.590
The text would in it.

05:42.900 --> 05:46.120
So the container for the feature section.

05:49.280 --> 05:54.390
Had a class of feature which is a custom class we added ourself.

05:54.470 --> 05:59.820
So let's start by adding that set in the position to be relative.

06:01.640 --> 06:08.140
And because we want the buckstone image to stretch to be the same as a browser we need to override the

06:08.170 --> 06:10.750
maximum width of 100 percent.

06:12.600 --> 06:14.570
By us in the feature.

06:15.240 --> 06:16.260
Image class.

06:17.100 --> 06:20.070
And instead of mucks with would it's going to set the whit.

06:21.170 --> 06:22.840
This time of 100 percent.

06:23.690 --> 06:29.030
And this means that the image can stretch slightly larger or slightly smaller than the original size

06:29.030 --> 06:29.980
of the image.

06:31.100 --> 06:37.770
So now we've got the container position relative we now need to change the text to be absolute.

06:37.910 --> 06:45.160
So we added a custom class surrounded text which was a class of feature text.

06:47.480 --> 06:49.250
So next let's start with that.

06:53.100 --> 06:56.390
So first position is going to be set to absolute.

06:57.870 --> 07:02.410
Because we use an absolute position in openness above the top.

07:03.220 --> 07:04.860
And the bond position.

07:07.010 --> 07:08.170
To be equal.

07:08.210 --> 07:10.000
So they're both going to be zero.

07:10.990 --> 07:13.210
Another because our position absolute.

07:13.450 --> 07:15.730
The text now appears all over the image.

07:15.970 --> 07:20.030
So you can start work in getting it horizontally and vertically aligned.

07:23.110 --> 07:26.330
So going to start by a vertically line in the text now.

07:26.530 --> 07:32.460
So first of all I'm going to just typed this out and then I'll explain what this is do and afterwards.

07:32.860 --> 07:35.180
So the feature text class.

07:36.080 --> 07:37.400
And then before.

07:40.210 --> 07:43.420
So set the content to be empty.

07:45.680 --> 07:48.540
The display type to be inline block.

07:51.250 --> 07:55.720
Hate to take you 100 percent of the container.

07:57.580 --> 08:00.340
And lastly vertical the line to be middle.

08:02.480 --> 08:07.580
And we'll come back to that just in a moment we'll just first of all the styles for the text.

08:07.670 --> 08:09.430
So the feature class.

08:13.090 --> 08:14.390
And then the P.

08:15.250 --> 08:17.070
Which surrounds the text.

08:20.150 --> 08:24.410
So this is going to also have the display type of inline block.

08:26.320 --> 08:27.830
And will all come clear soon.

08:28.650 --> 08:31.600
Also a vertical line to be middle.

08:33.400 --> 08:36.700
The text alone will be centralized in the div..

08:38.010 --> 08:41.410
The to be 100 percent of the container.

08:42.510 --> 08:49.270
So if we go back into the browser and if we take a look at the finished project there's a back from

08:49.270 --> 08:56.570
quilla quite faint but it surrounds the text which has rounded edges and it also semitransparent.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.370
So let's add that now.

08:59.250 --> 09:01.960
So to start work in the background colour.

09:03.080 --> 09:05.930
Which has a r.g. BE a value.

09:07.720 --> 09:12.340
So first of all we need to add the Red Queen and blue values.

09:12.340 --> 09:14.240
So to create the grey colour.

09:15.600 --> 09:17.610
The first value is 74.

09:18.990 --> 09:19.860
82.

09:21.270 --> 09:22.920
95.

09:23.100 --> 09:27.310
And then the last file is the alpha posti.

09:27.470 --> 09:29.730
So I want that to be not point two.

09:30.500 --> 09:33.380
Which is the same as 20 percent or pass city.

09:34.530 --> 09:40.270
The background is got roundly Connors which you get by in a border radius.

09:42.780 --> 09:46.880
Of 10 pixels the text colour is white.

09:51.490 --> 09:54.830
Okay so there's the background for the text in place.

09:54.830 --> 10:01.660
So basically what we do in here is we create in some text and we're adding some styles to it and then

10:01.680 --> 10:08.710
were adding a fake element just before the text so we can use that as a full height reference to align

10:08.750 --> 10:10.440
the text in the DIV.

10:10.550 --> 10:19.130
So before the text were creating an empty div which has no content were set and bowl for the big div

10:19.190 --> 10:23.620
and the text to be in line block so they appear side by side.

10:24.640 --> 10:29.160
Because the fake element as a height of 100 percent.

10:30.200 --> 10:33.440
This will take up the full height of the div..

10:34.280 --> 10:40.190
And then because this is the height of the div well can then set the vertical line to be middle and

10:40.190 --> 10:44.250
this will cause the text to be aligned in the middle of the div.

10:44.450 --> 10:50.510
So you get this trick to work would it need to do one more thing because by default inline block has

10:50.540 --> 10:54.800
a gap between elements we need to remove this.

10:55.100 --> 10:59.170
So we need to add a property which is zero width.

10:59.330 --> 11:03.430
So it would change the font size to be zero.

11:03.470 --> 11:07.820
That will remove the gap between the fake elements and the text.

11:08.650 --> 11:15.130
Because we have set the font size to busy roll will there need to add the font size in the Peter Higgs.

11:16.480 --> 11:19.060
So when I was to be forty eight pixels.

11:20.220 --> 11:22.190
So let's say that and check on the browser.

11:23.840 --> 11:24.130
Okay.

11:24.140 --> 11:24.920
That's looking good.

11:24.920 --> 11:29.300
That's now vertically aligned to the background image.

11:29.510 --> 11:32.850
Um I can also see the semitransparent buckram colour.

11:33.830 --> 11:38.020
So let's just a little bit a pun in just of 3 percent.

11:39.440 --> 11:41.860
And space out the line height.

11:43.100 --> 11:44.830
To be 80 pixels.

11:46.690 --> 11:48.390
Well let's save and take a look at that.

11:49.350 --> 11:49.680
Great.

11:49.680 --> 11:51.440
That's looking a lot better now.

11:51.480 --> 11:55.770
The next thing we need to do is align it horizontally in the diff.

11:55.890 --> 11:59.430
So we're going to do that by adding some bootstrap columns.

11:59.430 --> 12:03.270
So if we head back to get booster up dot com.

12:04.420 --> 12:06.740
And then it will go in the CSA section.

12:09.820 --> 12:12.330
And then select the grid system on the right.

12:13.890 --> 12:21.280
And then scroll down to the grid options so bootstrap hires a 12 column grid system and to access that

12:21.670 --> 12:29.260
we use the class prefix of call and end dush and then we can use the access for the number of columns

12:29.260 --> 12:38.050
wide with Bonzi and extra small devices S M for small devices or tablets m.d. for medium devices or

12:38.050 --> 12:41.830
desktops or LG for large desktops.

12:42.010 --> 12:47.230
So we can create divs which display differently on smaller or larger devices.

12:47.230 --> 12:54.040
So there's an example below if we want to create a div which has two parts and spans a full width of

12:54.040 --> 12:59.320
the page each div needs take up six columns each and the same.

12:59.320 --> 13:05.180
If we want to create free column side by side we'll give each div a class of four columns.

13:06.240 --> 13:11.610
So let's put this into practice in our project back into the index page.

13:11.610 --> 13:15.460
If we look for the div which surrounds the text.

13:16.380 --> 13:22.410
Just after the feature text class we'll go into the bootstrap columns.

13:22.410 --> 13:29.710
So I want the text to take up all the available space on a mobile view so I can ask cole X X Factor

13:29.730 --> 13:32.490
small devices 12.

13:32.650 --> 13:37.700
So I'll take up the full 12 columns on a small device.

13:37.700 --> 13:41.630
If we don't want it to be full width on larger devices.

13:42.840 --> 13:50.570
We can I'd call and eight 8 Start will take up a part of 12 or two thirds.

13:51.590 --> 13:57.050
And then larger still on large desktops call LG 6.

13:57.140 --> 14:00.460
So that will take up half the width of the web page.

14:00.500 --> 14:02.590
So let's say that and take a look.

14:04.560 --> 14:09.960
So if I scroll down to the small size you can see the text takes up the full width.

14:11.500 --> 14:13.650
But once we hit the medium devices.

14:15.230 --> 14:21.410
This div is only taken up eight parts because it's only taken up a party to leave in four columns on

14:21.410 --> 14:22.830
the right hand side.

14:22.880 --> 14:28.250
So to make sure that this device stays in the middle of the page we can add an offset on the left hand

14:28.250 --> 14:29.200
side.

14:29.360 --> 14:32.700
So decentralizes do we need to add an offset of two.

14:34.060 --> 14:40.180
And the way we do that is call to the first one is mdi then dush offset.

14:42.520 --> 14:44.650
And then off say two columns.

14:44.650 --> 14:45.710
You said that too.

14:46.660 --> 14:49.200
So let's say that unci that's working okay.

14:49.240 --> 14:49.690
Great.

14:49.690 --> 14:51.960
So the 8 column div is in the middle of the page.

14:51.990 --> 14:58.520
We have two columns each side now and we'll do the same for the large devices because the large devices

14:58.520 --> 15:00.640
is taken up six parts.

15:00.640 --> 15:02.820
We need to add an offset of free.

15:04.130 --> 15:06.990
So call LG.

15:08.480 --> 15:09.770
Offsets free.

15:10.770 --> 15:11.530
There you go.

15:11.750 --> 15:18.110
And the boost of documentation's got some more information about the grid system and offset in there's

15:18.150 --> 15:21.770
also saw more examples you can take a look at in the ostende section.

15:23.830 --> 15:25.630
So that's video nearly finished.

15:25.630 --> 15:32.350
Just one more thing we need to add before we go is if we shrink the browser down the text is pretty

15:32.350 --> 15:33.210
large.

15:33.310 --> 15:40.450
So we'll get down to the small tablet or mobile sizes we need to make sure that the text is smaller

15:41.290 --> 15:45.650
so we can do that in our See assessed by adding a media query.

15:45.850 --> 15:48.210
So let's add a mobile style comment.

15:51.610 --> 15:53.490
Just at the very bottom of the page.

16:03.020 --> 16:05.450
Okay so let's add a media query.

16:05.450 --> 16:07.450
So art media.

16:08.540 --> 16:09.390
Screen.

16:11.270 --> 16:15.230
And will target the devices with a max.

16:16.330 --> 16:23.990
We're out of 768 pixels by utzon seven hundred and sixty eight pixels.

16:24.010 --> 16:27.260
This keeps in line with bootstraps media queries.

16:27.430 --> 16:30.570
So it will go back up to the top of the grid system.

16:31.510 --> 16:35.050
You can see the media query's site is a bootstrap uses.

16:35.370 --> 16:43.090
So were set in media query for extra small devices less than 768 pixels.

16:45.520 --> 16:46.110
Okay.

16:46.140 --> 16:51.430
So to reduce the font size we need to add the class of feature text.

16:54.580 --> 16:55.380
P.

16:57.200 --> 17:00.060
And space after and there we go.

17:00.410 --> 17:03.560
So we need to reduce the font size.

17:04.540 --> 17:07.450
Let's set this to 28 pixels.

17:07.460 --> 17:13.220
And also the line height like can be the same that can also be 28 pixels.

17:14.120 --> 17:17.240
So let's save that and head back into the browser.

17:19.370 --> 17:23.530
So we go back into the project and then shrink the browser down.

17:24.050 --> 17:30.430
You can see that the text now scales down on the smaller devices arm fitted in the container.

17:30.620 --> 17:33.830
And as we get larger and head demelza query.

17:34.910 --> 17:38.580
We'll get the larger text sites look at the birth.

17:38.600 --> 17:45.560
So while we're in the media query we can also just make the Freeling in the mobile view appear in the

17:45.560 --> 17:50.600
centre of the page we can add that in the eye a section.

17:52.850 --> 17:55.770
Because he's our list item hyperlinks.

17:55.860 --> 17:58.370
So text the line centre.

18:01.090 --> 18:01.920
There we go.

18:04.120 --> 18:05.880
So great so that's it for this section.

18:05.920 --> 18:09.340
That's all the CSF completed for the header.

18:09.460 --> 18:15.010
So if you join me in the next video we'll continue with the website and move down to the welcome section.
