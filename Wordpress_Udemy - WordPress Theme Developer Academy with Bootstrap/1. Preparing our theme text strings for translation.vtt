WEBVTT

00:02.210 --> 00:02.450
OK.

00:02.510 --> 00:08.390
So when buildon were press themes it is really important we consider non English speakers who may be

00:08.390 --> 00:09.720
using morphemes.

00:09.800 --> 00:11.220
So this section is all Bob.

00:11.230 --> 00:18.040
Parents were fine and provide the ability for people to translate the theme into two different languages.

00:18.410 --> 00:23.870
So now most of us don't have the ability to fully translate the film ourselves.

00:23.870 --> 00:30.770
However what we can do is develop whole field so we can be easily translated by others or in other words

00:30.770 --> 00:33.100
make or Feme translation ready.

00:33.270 --> 00:39.320
And this process is known as internationalisation and is also another term that you may come across

00:39.320 --> 00:41.130
call localization.

00:41.340 --> 00:43.510
I will look at this more in the next video.

00:43.640 --> 00:47.540
This is the process of actually translate in the words in the theme.

00:47.720 --> 00:53.420
But in this video which you can look at the actual preparation or the internationalisation to actually

00:53.480 --> 00:57.750
make an offering translation ready it's not as difficult as it may sound.

00:57.770 --> 01:03.920
There's a few steps you need to take such as adding a function to all functions file create new languages

01:03.920 --> 01:06.800
folder to store all the translations in.

01:07.070 --> 01:12.530
And we also need to look through our Feme templates to let WordPress know which words we'd like to make

01:12.680 --> 01:14.160
available for translation.

01:15.210 --> 01:22.170
So to get started over to the text editor or actually go over to the themes folder.

01:22.620 --> 01:25.460
So go into the tranquil WP for the.

01:25.650 --> 01:30.190
Then when I add one new folder and call it languages.

01:33.090 --> 01:39.750
And then we need to go into the functions file and link this in the VM set up so over to the functions

01:39.750 --> 01:40.790
of P HP.

01:42.010 --> 01:49.510
I would add this would in the tranquil WP set up function so right at the top when it uses function

01:50.320 --> 01:53.730
load theme text demesne.

01:57.190 --> 01:58.310
And then the brackets.

01:58.420 --> 02:04.330
And if you remember the text main We said that in the style dotsie says in the comment are the very

02:04.330 --> 02:05.410
top.

02:05.560 --> 02:09.770
So we need to make this the same as the text main which you put in there.

02:09.770 --> 02:10.970
So we can copy it up.

02:12.250 --> 02:14.040
Then back into the functions.

02:15.290 --> 02:19.800
The first prometa would in the quotations is the text main.

02:20.790 --> 02:26.970
And then when it's put inside the file path to our languages folder we just created so separate by a

02:26.970 --> 02:30.680
comma get template our actory.

02:36.180 --> 02:40.810
Then the brackets and only to conquer up on to the end.

02:41.130 --> 02:42.810
The languages folder.

02:43.590 --> 02:45.480
So within the template directories.

02:47.660 --> 02:48.430
This spot the right.

02:48.560 --> 02:56.480
So within the template directory we then have the languages folder Susie was lush and then languages.

02:59.040 --> 03:01.150
And then that would a semicolon.

03:01.730 --> 03:06.880
OK so now the next step is to locate any techs or strings which you want to make.

03:06.880 --> 03:11.420
Translatable in this video would just be concentrate on the text strings.

03:11.420 --> 03:15.330
But in the next video I'll take a look how to translate function calls.

03:15.350 --> 03:21.730
So for now let's start by going into the four or four page aliona stuff from the top.

03:21.860 --> 03:23.460
So I'll start with the four or four.

03:26.930 --> 03:29.490
So need to identify any text strings.

03:29.600 --> 03:34.920
So in the four or four page so the top will echo to the browser some text.

03:35.150 --> 03:37.930
So want to make this available for translation.

03:38.180 --> 03:42.410
So the way to do that is just after the text out a comma.

03:44.130 --> 03:52.020
And simply between quotations paste in the text domain of trunk called w.p. and then saved up and then

03:52.020 --> 03:54.060
down to the archives page.

03:54.210 --> 03:56.200
We need to look at any text rings.

03:57.420 --> 04:02.170
So skogland Down there's an echo function so willing to translate this text.

04:02.340 --> 04:09.660
So again would you separate the text would a comma and then in the quotations put in the text the main

04:10.290 --> 04:12.210
So word press can identify it.

04:12.630 --> 04:16.310
And that should be off and I will look at the functions in the next video.

04:16.440 --> 04:20.370
So save that and then moving down to the comments.

04:20.430 --> 04:27.330
So because this is zy Commons file for the 2014 thing I'm going to use a search and replace.

04:27.480 --> 04:34.370
So he can see that some of the functions that are already there includes the 2014 text domain.

04:34.440 --> 04:36.560
So we need to replace all of these.

04:36.630 --> 04:41.420
So I will go through and do those individually or do a search and replace.

04:42.260 --> 04:50.870
So in brackets you've got to find replace and look for the word 2014 and replace that weird tranquil

04:50.870 --> 04:55.440
w.p. or your text main and it Buch.

04:56.660 --> 05:00.920
So there's eight matches in there and replace and then saved up.

05:01.280 --> 05:04.680
So the next one is the content hyphen facilities.

05:05.490 --> 05:09.110
So we need to do the links for this page.

05:09.240 --> 05:15.420
So at the minute we just plain text for the four links so we want to change that to be.

05:15.420 --> 05:20.430
AP HP akol function so start with the P HP tags.

05:21.010 --> 05:28.690
No use each shot and which is the underscore and then e and then surrounds the text in the brackets

05:28.720 --> 05:34.150
on the quotation with the semicolon at the end showing a two.

05:34.150 --> 05:42.490
And so now we've got the texturing use the comma to separate that and then put in the text domain.

05:43.210 --> 05:49.660
So just to speed this process up and showing a copy of this and then moved down to spa facilities.

05:51.170 --> 05:53.050
And replace the head and make up.

05:54.440 --> 05:57.470
With the spa facilities text.

05:57.550 --> 06:02.120
So base day in and get to close appear to be tags off.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.600
Just to.

06:07.020 --> 06:08.040
So copy that.

06:08.310 --> 06:11.500
And then next we've got the lakeside retreat.

06:12.540 --> 06:20.880
So again copy the text and replace barfs solis's with the lakeside retreat text.

06:22.100 --> 06:24.500
And they would do the same for the very last link.

06:29.860 --> 06:33.790
So could that text and paste the last one into there.

06:35.350 --> 06:36.200
And that's the last one.

06:36.220 --> 06:40.840
So again because we've got the text the main immediately following the string.

06:41.720 --> 06:44.600
Wordpress knows it want to translate this.

06:45.020 --> 06:47.250
I will show you how to do that in the next video.

06:47.280 --> 06:52.190
So save that file and we'll move on to the footer doppie HP OK.

06:52.260 --> 06:55.200
All star with the level 2 heading at the top of.

06:55.200 --> 06:56.300
Keep in touch.

06:56.340 --> 07:05.050
So the need to transform this to a eco soul patch be an easy shorthand underscore easy.

07:05.760 --> 07:07.890
And then the text in brackets.

07:09.470 --> 07:12.110
And also put this in single quotes.

07:13.100 --> 07:16.290
And then straight after the string put in the text amoun.

07:18.560 --> 07:20.690
So tranquil w.p..

07:21.730 --> 07:26.290
And then after the brackets some Ã©cole on and then close off the P HP.

07:26.290 --> 07:28.870
So just a couple more to do on this page.

07:29.020 --> 07:31.580
The first one is the fourways text.

07:32.110 --> 07:34.120
So we should be getting the hang of it now.

07:34.140 --> 07:41.740
So happy HP and then echo and then surround the string in the brackets.

07:43.190 --> 07:51.510
Get the quotes separated by a comma paste in the text the main trunk called wpe.

07:52.710 --> 07:55.810
The semicolon and close off.

07:56.090 --> 08:01.160
And then in the foot section there's the tranquil a name at the very bottom.

08:01.160 --> 08:03.500
So I did copy the e p p.

08:05.110 --> 08:06.360
Just to speed that up.

08:06.460 --> 08:10.630
And then in the place of the tranquil spa text peyster in.

08:14.250 --> 08:17.120
And then changed back the text at trunkless bar.

08:22.270 --> 08:25.310
And then say that all the text for the footer area.

08:25.450 --> 08:28.660
So after the footer it's the front page.

08:31.190 --> 08:34.880
So from the top we need to change the level to head in.

08:34.880 --> 08:37.400
So I'm going to paste in the page B.

08:39.240 --> 08:48.520
Gotcha tidies up a little bit and indent and then copy the cut out the title and replace the following

08:48.540 --> 08:57.060
section and say that stitch copy this again and then scroll and down the page for more strings.

08:57.060 --> 08:59.460
We need to do the same with the latest offers.

09:02.030 --> 09:08.700
So we do exactly same as before but it could old at this level to head home and paste this in.

09:12.880 --> 09:16.820
No keep going on the page so scroll on further down.

09:19.100 --> 09:21.850
The next one is the level two hidden again.

09:22.130 --> 09:23.530
I'll shop online.

09:26.730 --> 09:29.730
So put this out and add this to the.

09:31.120 --> 09:31.780
String.

09:36.560 --> 09:38.550
And then it's gone down a little bit further.

09:38.600 --> 09:42.320
We've got the shop here text which is part of the button.

09:42.350 --> 09:45.530
So again Jason the pitch ping.

09:46.770 --> 09:49.200
And change a text to be shop here.

09:53.430 --> 09:54.150
There we go.

09:54.150 --> 09:59.860
So hit Save and we'll keep moving on page so we don't need to do anything in functions.

09:59.940 --> 10:05.560
So next it's The headed up his HP and a dolphin is anything we Action needs change in the header.

10:07.260 --> 10:09.250
So when the title which is dynamic.

10:09.990 --> 10:15.670
We've got the navigation menu at the top but all the page names are pulled in dynamically.

10:16.050 --> 10:19.760
So they'll be set to whatever the language the user preferred anyway.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.240
So keep going down.

10:22.160 --> 10:24.780
So not as an off interchange in the header.

10:25.010 --> 10:28.010
So next is the index page.

10:28.010 --> 10:31.150
So scroll down take a look for any eckle functions.

10:31.640 --> 10:39.310
So we've got the category the so straight after the cusi rename put in the text domain of tranquil WP.

10:40.470 --> 10:42.690
And then keep going forward on the page.

10:42.690 --> 10:45.140
There's also the read more text.

10:45.330 --> 10:47.970
So exactly the same in that trunk will wpe.

10:52.680 --> 10:54.920
And that's it for the next page.

10:54.920 --> 10:56.830
So next we've got the page about.

10:59.500 --> 11:02.180
So we've got the Bowles level to head in.

11:02.350 --> 11:07.990
In fact consider making these translatable will actually make it dynamic or change up to the underscore

11:08.350 --> 11:09.080
title.

11:10.090 --> 11:12.090
RS We do want some of the sections.

11:13.310 --> 11:15.010
So that's fine to leave as it is.

11:15.880 --> 11:20.010
So we've got the the main paragraph of the about is taxed.

11:20.230 --> 11:25.240
So I'm going to leave this section because this would probably be better as a custom field to allow

11:25.240 --> 11:27.740
the user to type in that information.

11:27.850 --> 11:33.600
So I will just save this one for now and take a look at the page from contact.

11:36.680 --> 11:38.600
So we've got the title already in there.

11:42.000 --> 11:46.400
Anything that's actually okay to leave that's not going to change on there.

11:46.440 --> 11:48.500
So down to the news page.

11:49.790 --> 11:52.170
Let's take a look for any strings to translate.

11:54.330 --> 12:01.530
So but the category so change up to have the text imane in the trunk called w.p..

12:04.650 --> 12:08.560
Again the same as index page will do the same for the read more text.

12:10.810 --> 12:12.260
So tranquil w.p..

12:15.710 --> 12:19.210
The pager the older a new post election the translate to.

12:19.330 --> 12:23.450
But we'll do that in the next video on a slightly different way so we can just leave the news page for

12:23.450 --> 12:24.030
now.

12:25.330 --> 12:30.550
So down to the page top hat be so our basic page damply.

12:30.940 --> 12:33.000
We've got the equal fortuner.

12:33.160 --> 12:40.480
So when I add the text made straight after the trenkle w.p. and don't forget to say that.

12:40.990 --> 12:45.210
And then next after the page is the search template.

12:46.780 --> 12:48.640
So take a scroll down.

12:48.640 --> 12:51.010
And again we've got the category.

12:53.050 --> 12:54.110
So change it up.

12:55.940 --> 12:57.690
We've got the read more.

13:05.710 --> 13:05.920
OK.

13:05.980 --> 13:08.210
So now I'll move on to the sidebar.

13:09.210 --> 13:11.300
So there's no strings to translate in.

13:11.430 --> 13:13.820
So move down to the single lockpick HP.

13:15.640 --> 13:18.200
And take a look at that's what the dynamic at all.

13:18.250 --> 13:20.300
I think going we need to do the category.

13:24.740 --> 13:26.010
Scroll up further down.

13:26.990 --> 13:28.650
We've got the error message.

13:29.090 --> 13:30.790
So are the text main into there.

13:35.390 --> 13:40.970
So that has pretty much finished the response to actually go to the functions page because we did add

13:40.970 --> 13:43.370
some strings into there.

13:43.400 --> 13:49.190
We had our feature techs function till just one or two strings need to change in there.

13:49.190 --> 13:51.360
So I do exactly the same.

13:51.590 --> 13:55.390
The text I mean I forgot to copy this one.

13:56.030 --> 13:58.450
So I'll paste on one in just below.

14:00.110 --> 14:02.540
I could do the same for the browsing text.

14:03.060 --> 14:04.090
So I'll paste it in.

14:07.670 --> 14:10.430
And then just one or two more at the bottom.

14:14.910 --> 14:19.450
And because this one's got formatting we're gonna actually leave that undo and the next video.

14:19.640 --> 14:21.340
When I do that in a slightly different way.

14:23.600 --> 14:27.440
So I think that it for all the text rings so I'll save that page.

14:27.710 --> 14:33.110
So when we download the software to make this translatable later on we should get all these tech strings

14:33.110 --> 14:34.710
available to translate.

14:35.210 --> 14:37.190
So that's it for all of the text strings.

14:37.190 --> 14:41.470
But if the text is part of a function we need to do it in a slightly different way.

14:41.600 --> 14:44.370
And if he jeimy in the next video I'll show you how to do that.
