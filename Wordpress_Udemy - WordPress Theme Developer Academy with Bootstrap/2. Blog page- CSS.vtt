00:00.850 --> 00:03.150
So we've got our blog page all in place now.

00:03.330 --> 00:08.450
So let's make it look a little bit more like the finished project by adding this C S S.

00:08.460 --> 00:15.210
So we need to answer a divide image blog the blog title for each post will also be out in the outline

00:15.210 --> 00:18.110
for each of the individual posts under the sidebar.

00:19.810 --> 00:23.790
I will also be margins and paddings to make it look a little bit better.

00:23.980 --> 00:27.560
So let's get started with the blog post title.

00:27.610 --> 00:32.320
We need to make that look a little bit better and also the image just below.

00:32.410 --> 00:39.490
So the way we do that if we look at each individual post the level to head in as a class of blog post

00:39.490 --> 00:40.450
title.

00:40.510 --> 00:43.270
So let's head over to our CSA section.

00:45.120 --> 00:47.160
So let's start with our blog section.

00:47.160 --> 00:49.740
Just blow the keep in touch section.

00:49.920 --> 00:51.310
So copy the comment.

00:52.360 --> 00:57.070
And paste it in and we'll call this the blog section.

00:58.590 --> 01:00.820
So we'll start with the blog post title.

01:05.990 --> 01:12.380
So to get the background image just below the level to head home you can add the background.

01:12.950 --> 01:13.830
You are old.

01:14.060 --> 01:20.250
And then in brackets you can put the path to a were divider purple that we've used in the index page.

01:20.390 --> 01:21.620
So we use dot dot.

01:23.250 --> 01:31.300
The man in the images folder we shove the divider purple dot PRNG and then to set the position.

01:33.010 --> 01:34.210
Let's centre.

01:35.790 --> 01:36.880
I move the side bar.

01:38.740 --> 01:41.190
And set the image to be no repeat.

01:42.510 --> 01:43.890
So let's take a look at that.

01:47.130 --> 01:51.770
So we've got an image now but it's spreading the full width of the level to head in.

01:51.780 --> 01:53.690
So we need to change the positioning.

01:54.150 --> 01:56.230
So first of all we'll set the height.

01:57.820 --> 01:59.410
To be 80 pixels.

02:01.230 --> 02:03.500
And this is the height of the full day.

02:03.880 --> 02:08.770
So next we can set the size of the image on the can do this in background size.

02:11.070 --> 02:16.940
So set the background size to be three hundred pixels wide and 40 pixels high.

02:18.290 --> 02:19.000
Take a look.

02:20.860 --> 02:24.230
So it's looking a little bit better but it's still oval up in the text.

02:24.520 --> 02:27.190
So let's move the background position.

02:32.140 --> 02:35.560
So first of all we'll set the exposition to be Centre.

02:36.580 --> 02:39.890
And then the Y will set up to 35 pixels.

02:39.900 --> 02:42.670
Now I should push the image down a little bit.

02:43.060 --> 02:46.490
Got to know the images clear of the level to head in.

02:46.570 --> 02:51.470
So next I'm going to add a little bit a margin on the bottom of the div just to push the text away.

02:52.560 --> 02:54.220
Also at the margin bottom.

02:55.390 --> 02:56.900
Or 30 pixels.

02:59.010 --> 03:02.120
And then next letters are the outline to the post.

03:02.300 --> 03:03.830
So look at the finished website.

03:03.900 --> 03:09.600
Each individual blog post has got the one pixel outline with the rounded corners.

03:09.600 --> 03:10.820
So let's do it now.

03:13.160 --> 03:20.390
So if we take a look back in the blog dot HMO you can see that each individual blog post has a class

03:20.390 --> 03:21.600
of blog post.

03:21.980 --> 03:23.610
So let's copy it up.

03:25.360 --> 03:26.340
And paste it in.

03:29.510 --> 03:32.470
So first of all up the border.

03:33.120 --> 03:35.030
And that's going to be one pixel.

03:36.830 --> 03:37.930
Solid line.

03:38.210 --> 03:41.490
And the colour is going to be foreknown while 6 4 6.

03:42.700 --> 03:43.990
And it's get the wrong corners.

03:43.990 --> 03:45.970
Let's add the border radius.

03:47.040 --> 03:48.380
Of 10 pixels.

03:49.350 --> 03:51.360
And then next we'll add some margin.

03:52.420 --> 03:57.940
So to make sure that the blog posts have some space in on the top and bottom we can add a margin of

03:57.940 --> 04:02.450
30 pixels on the top and bottom and zero on the left and right.

04:04.460 --> 04:09.250
And then a little bit apart in just inside the div of 20 pixels.

04:10.710 --> 04:12.060
Let's see how it's look.

04:14.520 --> 04:16.500
So it's looking a lot better now.

04:16.570 --> 04:18.500
So next move on to the side bar.

04:18.500 --> 04:22.730
I will make these sidebar modules look a little bit more like the blog posts.

04:24.680 --> 04:27.650
So first of all let's copy the comment.

04:30.900 --> 04:32.950
This could be the blog sidebar.

04:38.910 --> 04:43.600
So to style the sidebar we can use the class of side bar module.

04:47.160 --> 04:53.280
Because going to be using the same style of border that were just used in the blog post we can just

04:53.280 --> 04:54.620
copy our CNS.

04:55.650 --> 04:56.680
Paiste I know.

04:59.140 --> 05:00.220
And let's take a look.

05:02.670 --> 05:03.040
There we go.

05:03.040 --> 05:08.210
So now the sidebar modules now match the stylin of the blog posts.

05:10.200 --> 05:15.030
I'm not evillest video funks watchin and I'll see in the next video where we'll be creating the above

05:15.030 --> 05:15.880
was page.
