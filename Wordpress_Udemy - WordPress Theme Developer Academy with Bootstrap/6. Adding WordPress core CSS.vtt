00:01.800 --> 00:02.520
Okay welcome.

00:02.520 --> 00:09.620
So so far we've added all our boost up CFS and we've also added some custom he says but this is just

00:09.620 --> 00:11.420
gonna be a quick video.

00:11.570 --> 00:19.400
Just to add in some word press quasi SS which is required for the Feme So we head over to Google and

00:19.400 --> 00:23.900
search for wordpress quasi us.

00:25.900 --> 00:29.770
And the first resort should be the Codex with the CSA section.

00:30.130 --> 00:31.420
So select that.

00:33.690 --> 00:39.960
And then if you scroll down you should find there is a call WordPress section which you going to copy

00:40.290 --> 00:41.680
place in morpheme.

00:41.730 --> 00:49.360
Now the majority of this is for captions and aligning images and a little bit for accessibility.

00:49.610 --> 00:50.580
And these are required.

00:50.580 --> 00:54.410
Wordpress cost Isle's so and want to copy this section.

00:56.550 --> 00:58.060
All the way down to the very bottom.

00:59.510 --> 01:01.300
It's also an area for screen readers.

01:02.720 --> 01:03.870
So Copy that.

01:04.790 --> 01:09.240
And then over to our feet folder into the style that see assess.

01:09.540 --> 01:14.380
We're going to paste it just above the global section and then save that.

01:15.340 --> 01:18.550
So we've got the cso S4 screen readers.

01:20.180 --> 01:25.500
Got some custom starlin for captions and the caption text and images.

01:26.820 --> 01:29.420
There's also margin added to the captions.

01:30.320 --> 01:35.920
And also some styling for the align for the right left centre.

01:37.130 --> 01:40.280
So I'm going to save that and that's it.

01:40.280 --> 01:42.020
That's all I wanted to show you in this video.

01:42.070 --> 01:47.090
Just wanted to make sure that the cost aisles were missed out of all Feme So that's it.

01:47.120 --> 01:48.660
And we'll see in the next video.
