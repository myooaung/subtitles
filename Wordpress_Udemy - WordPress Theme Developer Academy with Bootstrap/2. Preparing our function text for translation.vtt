00:01.780 --> 00:02.920
Okay welcome back.

00:02.920 --> 00:06.470
So now we've got all those strings available for translation.

00:06.470 --> 00:09.780
We want to move on and do the same for functions.

00:10.060 --> 00:11.710
So we're mentioned in the last video.

00:13.380 --> 00:18.390
That function such as the pager for the next on the previous posts.

00:18.390 --> 00:20.800
They also have text inside the brackets.

00:20.820 --> 00:24.380
So we need to do this in a slightly different way than we did before.

00:24.390 --> 00:25.790
It's still very easy to do.

00:25.980 --> 00:32.370
So we start with a similar kind of wait before so we use the comma and then put in the text the main

00:33.240 --> 00:34.890
of tranquil w.p..

00:35.850 --> 00:42.990
But this time before and after one a strong D in some extra buckets and then used to undo scores and

00:42.990 --> 00:47.990
then close up broke off at the end and then do the same in new posts.

00:48.180 --> 00:59.070
So the colmer BE text main tranquil w.p. then and the open in brackets are the two underscores.

00:59.980 --> 01:02.790
And then close our second brucker off there.

01:03.010 --> 01:06.470
And was he got a pager in the news template.

01:06.700 --> 01:12.740
So he'd go to the page for news and then down at the bottom will do exactly the same.

01:12.770 --> 01:16.690
So for the all the posts in a text the main.

01:20.260 --> 01:28.890
Tranquil wpe and any extra sorona brackets the two underscores close off.

01:29.970 --> 01:32.030
And the same for the new posts.

01:41.270 --> 01:42.420
There we go.

01:42.500 --> 01:45.170
And there is one or two to change in the functions file.

01:45.250 --> 01:50.530
So head to the functions drop the HP and then exchange the browser text.

01:50.530 --> 01:55.260
But it looks as though you jumped the gun in the last video and added the text the main in there.

01:55.390 --> 02:02.920
But this is actually a function so we need to do the same A4 with the brackets the two and the scores

02:03.930 --> 02:05.810
and then close the second brucker off.

02:06.900 --> 02:08.100
And then let's look for the.

02:08.120 --> 02:15.870
Print a statement so scroll down to the bottom so the way to do this with a variable in there is by

02:17.030 --> 02:18.930
adding need to underscores scores in the.

02:19.670 --> 02:25.570
And then after the string are in the text the main of tranquil WP.

02:27.050 --> 02:28.230
And then say that.

02:28.760 --> 02:34.420
OK I said that it's just a slightly different way of preparing the text if it's part of a function.

02:34.860 --> 02:37.560
OK that's all were female translation ready.

02:37.680 --> 02:42.980
We know told WordPress which words want to make available for translation.

02:43.440 --> 02:45.670
Okay so that's it soul will leave that video there.

02:45.880 --> 02:50.950
And if you join me in the next video will download some software which will pull out these words which

02:50.950 --> 02:56.190
you've made translatable and it will put them all into a template and allow us to actually translate

02:56.190 --> 02:58.360
the words we'll see there.
