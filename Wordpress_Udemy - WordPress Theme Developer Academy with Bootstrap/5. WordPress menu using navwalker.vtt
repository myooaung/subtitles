00:02.100 --> 00:02.710
Welcome back.

00:02.700 --> 00:07.130
In this video we're going to be concentrating on getting another nation up and running.

00:07.470 --> 00:13.980
So because Word Press and bootstrap used different custom classes for the menu set up we need to include

00:13.980 --> 00:17.390
a way of converting our bootstrap classes to Wordpress.

00:17.400 --> 00:20.760
Now luckily somebody has already created a useful tool.

00:21.490 --> 00:23.690
Called the bootstrap nub Walker.

00:23.860 --> 00:31.190
So if you go over to Google and have a search of bootstrap not walker.

00:34.770 --> 00:37.910
Then should get the first link which is the get home page.

00:38.870 --> 00:40.000
And you can see the name walk.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.690
It is a custom Wordpress.

00:41.780 --> 00:49.520
Walk class to implement Twitter Bootstrap into our WordPress custom themes so we can start by in the

00:49.520 --> 00:50.760
download button.

00:53.170 --> 00:53.530
Dunno.

00:53.560 --> 00:55.840
Quite quick it just is it file.

00:55.840 --> 00:58.210
And then if you go down to the installation.

00:59.300 --> 01:01.750
So the installation is pretty simple to follow.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.420
We start by copying the function.

01:05.580 --> 01:10.400
So copy that and then head to the functions dot the HP.

01:10.700 --> 01:15.500
And this is going to be included in the trunk or WP set up function.

01:15.500 --> 01:19.100
So just underneath the title type function.

01:19.100 --> 01:20.100
Paste it in.

01:23.320 --> 01:27.310
This includes the nub Walker file into our project.

01:27.310 --> 01:29.450
So Mike over to the browser.

01:30.330 --> 01:33.730
And then for the usage copy the nut Walker array.

01:36.540 --> 01:41.440
And then go over to a text editor into the head adopt p.

01:44.450 --> 01:46.640
And if we locate the navigation.

01:48.960 --> 01:54.810
So we need to find the main navigation which is on the home page which has the links for the index page

01:54.870 --> 01:57.440
the blog and also the latest news.

01:57.450 --> 02:00.640
So we need to replace the full on ordered list.

02:00.710 --> 02:02.570
So going to leave all of this section.

02:04.050 --> 02:09.990
But make sure you leave the surround and div with the class of collapse and then paste in the array

02:09.990 --> 02:12.840
between these types.

02:14.360 --> 02:16.050
Want to tidy up a little bit.

02:16.240 --> 02:22.990
So this array correctly form what are were pressfield to include a bootstrap dropped menu so we can

02:22.990 --> 02:26.150
leave all the defaults as they are on the right unsigned.

02:26.170 --> 02:29.620
The only thing we need to change is the menu class.

02:29.620 --> 02:33.730
So I will bootstrap menu classes were enough not enough.

02:33.880 --> 02:42.150
And then also another bar right because our menu was right aligned so everything else we can leave as

02:42.190 --> 02:45.680
default and back over to the browser.

02:48.030 --> 02:49.860
Next me to register the menu.

02:50.250 --> 02:59.550
So copy the register not menus and then into functions doppie HP just below where we've included the

02:59.670 --> 03:06.150
navigation Walker link just blow lamacq and paste this in there and it registers the navigation with

03:06.150 --> 03:07.020
the fien.

03:07.470 --> 03:09.030
So it which ties up.

03:11.720 --> 03:14.450
And then change the theme name to tranquil w.p..

03:16.720 --> 03:17.880
And say that.

03:18.110 --> 03:23.810
So this sets the menu with the Home link and the blog links at the top of the web page to be our primary

03:23.810 --> 03:24.460
menu.

03:24.620 --> 03:29.260
And we'll come back to this later on in the course and will register the photo menus.

03:29.490 --> 03:29.760
OK.

03:29.780 --> 03:36.680
And the leasing we need to do is hopefully that download of pheno head to your downloads and then unzip

03:36.680 --> 03:38.810
the package it would just onload.

03:41.600 --> 03:42.620
Open up.

03:43.750 --> 03:48.220
No one needs a drug the HP file into a custom frame.

03:49.380 --> 03:50.720
Then also open up your.

03:50.790 --> 03:51.710
In folder.

03:54.360 --> 03:57.920
And then drug inside the EPA HP folder.

03:58.680 --> 04:03.270
And paste it in at the root directory the same as the index page.

04:05.230 --> 04:08.320
I'm going to be that now so none that should all be working.

04:08.320 --> 04:13.640
So if I go to the text editor and then say that and then in2 Chrome.

04:15.100 --> 04:16.840
In two word press.

04:17.750 --> 04:19.580
And then refresh Wordpress.

04:23.230 --> 04:25.170
Then create a main menu.

04:25.390 --> 04:31.120
So in the dashboard on the left hand side go to appearance and then menus.

04:32.990 --> 04:34.730
And then create a menu.

04:36.020 --> 04:38.470
And then change the menu name to Main Menu.

04:42.060 --> 04:42.900
Then scroll up.

04:42.970 --> 04:48.350
Well let's check the two boxes at the bottom and this makes sure that the main menu is the primary menu

04:49.130 --> 04:54.720
and also that the new pages that we create automatically get added to the menu.

04:55.250 --> 04:56.390
So say that.

04:58.640 --> 05:01.370
Now let's visit the site and see the menus work and okay.

05:03.120 --> 05:08.490
OK it's all menus work and we can see subperiod up the top of the page so we've only got the holeman

05:08.490 --> 05:10.210
the sample page link for now.

05:11.200 --> 05:14.520
Because we haven't created the blog or the latest news section.

05:15.250 --> 05:15.820
But that's fine.

05:15.820 --> 05:21.640
That means everything's working correctly so that it will leave this video for now so I'll see you in

05:21.640 --> 05:25.050
the next video will fix all the links for the images.
