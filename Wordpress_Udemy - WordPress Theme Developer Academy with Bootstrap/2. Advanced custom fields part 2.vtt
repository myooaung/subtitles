WEBVTT

00:01.370 --> 00:07.340
OK so now we understand a little bit more about how to use advanced custom fields by changing the featured

00:07.340 --> 00:08.550
text area.

00:08.600 --> 00:12.020
We're going to continue with the front page and I will show you how to do it.

00:12.020 --> 00:14.030
For the latest off the section.

00:14.730 --> 00:16.980
So go back into the dashboard.

00:17.550 --> 00:23.620
And then the custom fields tab and then click on the front page.

00:24.000 --> 00:29.340
And because we're going to be creating these free special offer actions which are going to be pretty

00:29.340 --> 00:34.040
similar I'm going to add a tub to Section these off.

00:34.260 --> 00:39.010
So as a new field and the label for this can be offer one.

00:41.260 --> 00:45.460
And the field type is gonna be a tab.

00:47.550 --> 00:48.430
And then that.

00:51.470 --> 00:57.300
Then a second tab for the offer to change the text field to be a tab.

01:01.420 --> 01:03.490
And the same for the offered no free.

01:07.400 --> 01:09.640
The can change had to be a tub.

01:11.540 --> 01:12.490
And then close up.

01:13.870 --> 01:16.250
So now let's get started with the offal one.

01:16.480 --> 01:25.300
So this time we'll add a field and this field will be the offer price I would use the generated field

01:25.300 --> 01:25.860
name.

01:26.760 --> 01:30.500
And because this is a price we need to change it from text to be No.

01:31.540 --> 01:32.100
Required.

01:32.110 --> 01:32.870
Yes.

01:35.240 --> 01:37.730
And I would just close our field.

01:38.500 --> 01:40.560
So now we've got the offer price.

01:40.690 --> 01:47.500
This is going to be for the first offer so we can just drag and put this under the offer one tub.

01:48.730 --> 01:53.410
So then we'll create Now the offer name.

01:55.920 --> 01:59.750
It's going be okay as text required Yes.

02:01.130 --> 02:02.340
And then close up.

02:04.090 --> 02:07.310
And then put this off the name just underneath the offer price.

02:09.880 --> 02:16.120
And then because each one of these special offers has two lines of text will do two separate fields

02:16.480 --> 02:20.470
so offer line one.

02:22.470 --> 02:27.480
We'll put that as required to then also AARD off line too.

02:30.450 --> 02:30.940
So okay.

02:30.960 --> 02:32.160
Text required.

02:32.180 --> 02:33.110
Yes.

02:34.740 --> 02:38.020
And close our fields and also close that one.

02:40.920 --> 02:43.400
And then drag these up in the first tub.

02:46.660 --> 02:53.200
Now because of going to the same fields for the offer to offer free you would just go into the off one

02:53.200 --> 02:55.090
fields we can just click on duplicate.

02:56.100 --> 02:58.920
I one keeps the off the price text as the same.

02:59.140 --> 03:03.680
But we need to change the field name change to offer price too.

03:06.330 --> 03:08.100
And close up.

03:09.190 --> 03:16.180
So the one that we just created which is the offer price to then drive this down underneath the offer

03:16.180 --> 03:18.590
to tab which is just Dir.

03:19.000 --> 03:23.010
So underneath the offer price will duplicate the offer name.

03:26.070 --> 03:33.180
Just remove the copy and changes to offer name to for the unique feel name.

03:35.360 --> 03:44.360
And then close this and offer name to drag this down to the offer to UB Well Neith the price.

03:44.880 --> 03:48.050
So many to duplicate the off the line one and off line too.

03:48.390 --> 03:49.870
So duplicate that one.

03:51.230 --> 03:53.100
So off line one keeper at that.

03:53.150 --> 03:58.390
So this rung on a change the unique name to offer to line one.

04:01.300 --> 04:02.890
And then close up.

04:06.650 --> 04:13.330
So off to line one drag this Starn into the second section again just below the name.

04:13.550 --> 04:14.920
Can duplicate this.

04:15.950 --> 04:18.100
This time it's off line too.

04:21.390 --> 04:24.910
So this time it's offer to lying to.

04:26.520 --> 04:27.730
Close up.

04:31.070 --> 04:32.610
So hold that makes sense of us.

04:32.610 --> 04:35.200
We've got the tab for off line 1.

04:35.630 --> 04:43.100
And the first offer has a price and name and then the two lines and then a second tab for the offer

04:43.100 --> 04:51.770
two and again with the price name and two lines making sure each one has a unique for your name.

04:51.820 --> 04:55.170
Now we need to do it a third time for the offer free.

04:55.400 --> 04:57.540
So duplicate the price.

04:59.690 --> 05:03.600
Keep the name the same offer price than befre.

05:06.600 --> 05:09.670
Then add that feels closer feels.

05:12.240 --> 05:12.640
And.

05:12.640 --> 05:16.060
The offer price three down to the offer free.

05:17.080 --> 05:20.000
So after off the price we need off a name again.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.870
So duplicate.

05:22.830 --> 05:24.290
Offer name free.

05:27.270 --> 05:28.210
Then close up.

05:30.030 --> 05:32.840
Drag author name free Dumbo the price.

05:34.210 --> 05:38.180
And there were nearly finished now which need to copy the line on a line too.

05:39.520 --> 05:41.140
So often I am one.

05:41.490 --> 05:45.880
Then the feel name is offer free.

05:47.470 --> 05:48.220
Line one.

05:50.240 --> 05:52.050
Then close.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.080
Drug that into his right place.

05:58.010 --> 06:06.900
A duplicate line to this time the unique name is offer free line too.

06:12.740 --> 06:15.440
Then drag that down to the very bottom.

06:17.700 --> 06:20.450
So now would that hit the uptake burn.

06:22.090 --> 06:24.330
I assure you I will put it in tubs now.

06:24.520 --> 06:30.220
So if you go over to the home page and then select edit page.

06:30.220 --> 06:35.670
So now we've got the awful worn off to an offer free in individual tubs.

06:37.110 --> 06:39.120
Whereas if would put the tubs in.

06:39.120 --> 06:43.210
Would you set up a long list of fields and it may get confused for the user.

06:44.220 --> 06:50.810
So them if you go into the front page doppie HP and Imogen up ADP.

06:50.820 --> 06:53.480
Pete's link to the coursen fields.

06:53.520 --> 06:55.970
So go and answer the latest Office section.

06:57.740 --> 06:59.610
It really is sidebar to you a small room.

07:01.380 --> 07:07.080
So first of all if would delete the price of the first offer and then open up the page.

07:07.900 --> 07:10.030
No we use the same as the last video.

07:10.050 --> 07:14.030
The underscore field and then in brackets.

07:14.190 --> 07:15.630
Type in the field name.

07:15.960 --> 07:17.450
So the first one.

07:18.490 --> 07:22.870
If I go back into the dashboard on the custom fields.

07:25.800 --> 07:32.030
The offer price had the field name of offer one Scott price so willing.

07:32.030 --> 07:33.130
I know.

07:34.410 --> 07:35.500
Then copy this.

07:38.120 --> 07:42.590
And paste this in place of the level Free had him.

07:42.610 --> 07:44.650
This is called The Offer name.

07:46.970 --> 07:49.670
So change offer price to offer a name.

07:52.900 --> 07:59.160
The family Bill pays to be hpn and that is the offer alone one.

08:01.660 --> 08:08.390
So offer on the score line on this gold one.

08:08.590 --> 08:09.920
Great day out.

08:11.870 --> 08:13.630
Estranges you off the line too.

08:18.860 --> 08:24.270
So what if the first field solver saves up and then go over to the home page.

08:26.940 --> 08:32.670
And scroll down so we should now see that we've got an empty latest Office action because we've not

08:32.670 --> 08:39.310
put in the text in place on the edit page so often one causes or blank.

08:39.360 --> 08:42.390
We've got enough showing not but will fix up soon.

08:42.480 --> 08:45.380
So keep going down to the second offer.

08:47.670 --> 08:51.120
And this is offer price underscore too.

08:55.730 --> 08:57.620
Then offer name to.

09:00.650 --> 09:02.270
Firstline a text.

09:04.730 --> 09:09.770
We need to change that to offer to like one.

09:14.440 --> 09:17.030
Then offer to line two.

09:21.620 --> 09:23.170
Then down to the third one.

09:23.240 --> 09:25.360
So lastly the price.

09:25.460 --> 09:28.370
So offer price free.

09:28.880 --> 09:32.570
And then underneath It's offer name number three.

09:35.910 --> 09:37.380
So often name three.

09:37.590 --> 09:40.190
And then the text.

09:40.790 --> 09:42.290
So it's offer free.

09:43.110 --> 09:46.130
Well I am one.

09:47.130 --> 09:49.840
And then lastly it's off a free line too.

09:55.090 --> 09:59.290
So so up and now our home page should be blank.

10:00.420 --> 10:02.760
Or at least the offer should be blunt anyway.

10:03.390 --> 10:08.290
So all that's left now is put the content back in in the edit page section.

10:08.500 --> 10:11.570
So you want to go off and do that yourself feel free to do that.

10:11.910 --> 10:15.450
If not follow along with me.

10:15.480 --> 10:19.140
So the first of all the offer price was 60 dollars.

10:19.140 --> 10:21.750
The offer name was commonly offer.

10:24.200 --> 10:26.490
My mom was fondly pool.

10:29.400 --> 10:30.970
Great day out.

10:36.530 --> 10:41.980
And Gods offer to sell this was a hundred twenty dollars.

10:42.480 --> 10:45.130
The offer name was for the bride.

10:47.530 --> 10:49.680
Off the line one was hair and make up.

10:54.970 --> 10:57.560
Line two was a full pompa package.

11:04.350 --> 11:12.910
And then on to offer number three the price was ninety dollars and this three weekend pass.

11:13.200 --> 11:15.350
My mom was modern facilities.

11:18.530 --> 11:21.650
Then 90 was perfect gift.

11:25.070 --> 11:25.920
Update that.

11:28.190 --> 11:32.580
And go to the home page and let's take a look at that.

11:33.730 --> 11:36.650
So I would just missing one of the fields.

11:36.810 --> 11:38.400
So let's see what the problem is.

11:41.090 --> 11:43.700
So offer free online too that looks okay.

11:44.030 --> 11:45.870
So we go onto the dashboard.

11:46.930 --> 11:48.690
Into custom fields.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.980
Let's take a look at that and see what the problem is.

11:58.290 --> 12:01.590
I think we've got to yeah we've got to underscore there.

12:01.650 --> 12:03.820
So let's just update that.

12:05.690 --> 12:08.720
And head back to the front page refresh.

12:12.960 --> 12:20.080
So still no men minutes added back in no changed each field name so often on the free you would need

12:20.090 --> 12:22.130
to add the perfect gift into the.

12:25.060 --> 12:26.760
Now an update.

12:34.020 --> 12:35.220
OK so there we go.

12:35.220 --> 12:36.740
That's all work in now.

12:36.910 --> 12:41.240
Just one and a white horizontal real just to separate the two lines there.

12:41.430 --> 12:46.380
So just a difference between the off alignment and off line too.

12:47.670 --> 12:54.510
So off alone one just after the close and piece I add a rachana then copy.

12:56.110 --> 12:58.080
And the same off off line too.

12:59.260 --> 13:01.300
Do the same in the second offer.

13:03.800 --> 13:09.790
After line one and two and the same in the third four to save.

13:10.340 --> 13:11.640
Then refresh the browser.

13:13.130 --> 13:13.710
So there you go.

13:13.730 --> 13:17.570
That's how you use advanced custom fields in wordpress beams.

13:17.630 --> 13:22.460
Feel free to carry on and add as many fields as you want to the website brung one leaves up there for

13:22.460 --> 13:23.050
now.

13:23.300 --> 13:25.890
So thanks for listening and we'll see in the next video.
