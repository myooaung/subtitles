WEBVTT

00:01.430 --> 00:05.810
Okay so now we're going to make our way ahead section and the footer more dynamic.

00:06.090 --> 00:11.950
Were press friendly so back in a text editor if you go to the head stop HP file.

00:12.990 --> 00:15.710
So at the moment vonnegut Started Kate's jamile.

00:15.780 --> 00:20.490
So we want to make this dynamic by and in some word press functions and some p.

00:20.510 --> 00:24.350
P So let's start by making the language dynamic.

00:24.360 --> 00:30.830
So rather than hony language at the top we want to open up the p p tags.

00:32.930 --> 00:35.130
In exactly the same way as were done before.

00:38.040 --> 00:41.790
And then within the page P Lord's art language.

00:42.990 --> 00:44.560
Underscore attributes.

00:47.610 --> 00:51.230
And then because it's a function we use the brackets and the semicolon.

00:52.440 --> 00:58.130
And this allows were pressed to add the language dynamically and then next go into the character set

00:58.140 --> 00:59.370
dynamically.

00:59.460 --> 01:04.100
So rather than half in the character say equal to utf 8.

01:06.100 --> 01:08.690
Will can allow WordPress to do this dynamically.

01:08.740 --> 01:10.720
So again nippi HP.

01:11.850 --> 01:13.790
Opening and closing tags.

01:13.830 --> 01:19.280
Now if you want to copy these paste to mean rather than retype and you can do.

01:20.480 --> 01:23.060
So we use the blog in full function.

01:24.010 --> 01:26.170
And then inside the brackets.

01:26.720 --> 01:34.070
And then we add the character set back in between the quotations and then the semicolon at the end.

01:34.980 --> 01:38.060
Now be careful when type on the page P functions.

01:38.370 --> 01:45.120
Because as you seen in the last video with the debugging if we just have one character mis typed out

01:45.120 --> 01:48.240
of place the chances are that you're going to get a white screen.

01:48.450 --> 01:49.570
So be careful of that.

01:50.490 --> 01:55.590
And then rather than a worse static tranquil spa title Let's change that to allow our were pressed to

01:55.590 --> 02:04.170
include that sort of game between the p p Tigers were in the Word Press title with WP underscore title

02:05.900 --> 02:12.720
and then inside the brackets just leave the empty quotation marks and then the semakula UP THE END.

02:13.380 --> 02:16.310
And then scroll down just before the closing head.

02:17.460 --> 02:18.540
Just at the end there.

02:18.590 --> 02:25.710
If we just find the line just before another one going to include the w.p. head function which basically

02:25.770 --> 02:31.410
allows WordPress to add scripter data back into the head section when it needs to.

02:31.740 --> 02:37.600
So a game between a p-h pre-tax type in w.p. underscore head.

02:40.410 --> 02:42.770
Then the brackets on the semicolon.

02:44.560 --> 02:48.930
And then in the open body type we can add the word press what class.

02:48.970 --> 02:55.020
So between the P P We use the body underscore class function.

02:56.140 --> 03:01.790
And the brackets and the semicolon and then were press will add the body class into the right section.

03:03.020 --> 03:09.560
Okay so let's scroll down to the head a section and the next one a change is the tranquil spa and the

03:09.560 --> 03:16.460
tranquil spa link is the one at the top left of the home page which is our logo section and I will link

03:16.460 --> 03:18.330
back to the home page.

03:18.530 --> 03:21.270
So there's two pieces appear to be we need to include here.

03:21.670 --> 03:24.010
I'm trying to get rid of the sidebar for an old issue.

03:24.050 --> 03:25.430
It was somare room.

03:25.430 --> 03:32.510
So first of all we need to change the name of the website which is tranquil spa amineh to include the

03:32.570 --> 03:35.260
P to make this named dynamic.

03:35.480 --> 03:39.500
So I'll paste in the e page P opening and closing times.

03:40.930 --> 03:43.700
And I put it on a separate line just so it's more clear.

03:47.020 --> 03:55.870
So between the B so p p uses the echo name to echo the contents of the browser and then we use the word

03:55.870 --> 04:00.660
Press function of get blog info.

04:04.700 --> 04:08.310
On the blog info we want is the name of the site.

04:08.570 --> 04:10.080
So put your name in there.

04:10.960 --> 04:13.030
And the semicolon at the end.

04:13.600 --> 04:13.850
OK.

04:13.900 --> 04:18.860
So now were press E generating the name of our website which is tranquil spa.

04:19.130 --> 04:23.960
That's going to be the text which appears in the top left hand corner where the logo is.

04:24.080 --> 04:30.770
We need to make this text a active link so because we don't have an index dot hates GMO anymore because

04:30.770 --> 04:32.430
we use an HP.

04:32.540 --> 04:37.630
We need to tell were pressed to link this name back to our home you are real.

04:37.700 --> 04:43.780
And again we do that in the between the HP tags and then echo.

04:44.700 --> 04:47.820
So there's a couple of different ways that we can do this in wordpress.

04:48.060 --> 04:50.810
But I want to use the escape.

04:51.150 --> 04:57.630
You are real which sanitizes the are real and make sure that there's no malicious code in there.

04:57.720 --> 05:00.370
So eco escape you are real.

05:00.510 --> 05:10.020
And then in the brackets afterwards when I put the link to the home you are well and then open and close

05:10.020 --> 05:11.630
and kind of brackets again.

05:11.970 --> 05:13.500
And then the semicolon.

05:13.950 --> 05:21.240
So there's two pieces appear to be the first one provides the link to the home you are L and the second

05:21.240 --> 05:23.650
one provides the name of the website.

05:25.110 --> 05:31.740
And then back up to the head section we'll go on to the settlings in a slightly different way.

05:31.830 --> 05:39.450
So if would delete the link for the custom C S S and also the boot straps we assess Amwell are those

05:39.450 --> 05:42.210
buckin in the functions File in just a moment.

05:43.160 --> 05:48.440
So save that and then open up our sidebar and head up to the foot of the HP.

05:49.330 --> 05:51.900
So there's not a lot we need to do with the footer.

05:52.060 --> 05:55.060
So one of the things I want to change is the.

05:55.240 --> 06:00.950
So because we want this to change dynamically each year we can add some p HP to the bomber here.

06:00.980 --> 06:08.390
So rather than hum in 2015 hardcoded work in Echo out to the browser the date.

06:09.340 --> 06:17.560
And then between the brackets we can put the capital Y which is the way HP adds the year and you can

06:17.560 --> 06:23.350
pay eight per You can also add these days and the monks in various formats will look and see that in

06:23.350 --> 06:26.110
more detail one would do with the blog posts.

06:26.810 --> 06:32.270
And then right at the very bottom of the page and then just before the close and body type.

06:32.390 --> 06:39.090
So in he were going to add an AP HP function which is the wpe underscore footer.

06:43.110 --> 06:44.620
Our missiles were pressed.

06:44.900 --> 06:47.100
Scripter data to the foot section.

06:47.430 --> 06:48.610
So save that.

06:49.660 --> 06:56.510
And then delete the bootstrap javascript and will link this with this access in the functions file.

06:57.830 --> 07:00.980
Because WordPress already comes with Jay Query.

07:00.980 --> 07:02.330
We can delete this too.

07:06.770 --> 07:11.190
Time is up a little bit and then hit save.

07:12.200 --> 07:18.860
OK so now weve taken off the CSA s or the head section under the scripts or the foot section.

07:18.920 --> 07:22.900
So we need to allow word to these back into the website.

07:22.900 --> 07:28.820
Are we going to do this in the way the WordPress recommends by enqueue in the scripts and the way we

07:28.820 --> 07:33.180
do that is if we go to the functions doppie HP.

07:33.770 --> 07:41.930
So if you go to the bottom section after the US action make sure we still would in the HP tags.

07:42.200 --> 07:49.740
So lets create a new HP function and this one is going to be called tranquil underscore scripts.

07:52.150 --> 07:55.780
And then the brackets and then afterwards the curly braces.

08:02.650 --> 08:03.850
So what was the comment in here.

08:03.850 --> 08:05.460
So we know exactly what were doing.

08:05.650 --> 08:11.130
So this section is going to be adding the styles to the function.

08:15.080 --> 08:22.290
So to properly and these back into the Feme we need to use the word press a WP enqueue.

08:23.790 --> 08:24.790
And then style.

08:26.560 --> 08:30.410
And then were in the curly brackets and also between the quotes.

08:30.520 --> 08:33.490
Were going to give the first stylesheet a name.

08:33.490 --> 08:35.600
So this is the bootstrap.

08:37.750 --> 08:38.430
Call.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.210
Then separated by a comma.

08:42.630 --> 08:48.100
Then the second prometa we need to include is the file path to the bootstrap csx.

08:48.300 --> 08:53.860
So to add this in Word Press we typing get and then template.

08:54.830 --> 08:57.860
Directory.

08:58.680 --> 08:59.870
And then you are right.

09:02.910 --> 09:07.590
And then the racquets and then the file path by using the Dot.

09:08.960 --> 09:12.350
And there were in the quotes we add the link to our bootstrap file.

09:12.620 --> 09:17.600
So forward slash us forward slash bootstrap.

09:21.070 --> 09:23.520
Men don't see us.

09:24.700 --> 09:27.220
And then the semicolon up the end.

09:27.370 --> 09:31.690
Now to get real at sidebar for an hour or so and here we are given this style sheet a name and then

09:31.790 --> 09:39.240
add in the template directory and then underneath the template directory the file path for the C S S.

09:39.370 --> 09:48.700
So because we've got a bootstraps vss and we've also got the custom CSA working just copy this and then

09:48.700 --> 09:50.660
paste it straight in below.

09:52.360 --> 09:54.810
Would you need to change the name on the file path.

09:55.050 --> 09:57.550
So this is for our custom file.

09:58.370 --> 10:04.520
And then we also include Get a template directory and then we need to change the five off.

10:04.520 --> 10:11.510
So because were custom style she is in the document route rather in the CSA folder working just changes

10:11.530 --> 10:14.850
to style dot CNS.

10:16.640 --> 10:26.440
And then we do a very similar thing to a D script Buckingham or other comments of other scripts.

10:26.440 --> 10:31.560
So the other word javascript buckin it works in a similar kind of way to the style sheet.

10:31.870 --> 10:35.260
So if we just copy this link and paste it in.

10:35.440 --> 10:41.170
But this time instead of enqueue style we include the script.

10:42.140 --> 10:44.590
And then we add the name at the start.

10:45.170 --> 10:47.590
So I'm going to call it the boost up g.f..

10:51.470 --> 10:54.560
We use get a template directory in the same way.

10:54.560 --> 10:58.370
But this time the file path is in our geegaws folder.

10:59.650 --> 11:05.680
Don't forget the forward slash before and then when it's linked this to the bootstrap magnified version.

11:07.660 --> 11:12.310
Bootstrapped min dot j Yes.

11:13.400 --> 11:16.500
This replaces the javascript from the footer section.

11:17.120 --> 11:18.970
And after that add a comma.

11:19.750 --> 11:23.890
So I've included the scrip name the script source.

11:23.900 --> 11:29.840
Now next we need to include any dependencies nutcombe bootstrap requires Jay Query.

11:30.050 --> 11:36.710
We need to make sure the jaquie reloads before boot stop so we do it by adding an array error in brucker

11:36.710 --> 11:41.250
to put the name of the dependency which is a query.

11:44.970 --> 11:49.970
So separated by a comma the lost volume what's put in is a boolean of.

11:49.990 --> 11:51.200
True.

11:51.360 --> 11:54.680
This enables the script to billing to the footer section.

11:54.990 --> 12:03.510
So in the footer dumped P P We included the WP footer function and because we added this in were pressed

12:03.510 --> 12:07.070
knows exactly where to add this script now.

12:07.910 --> 12:10.350
Okay so now this function is all set up.

12:10.350 --> 12:14.560
We need to do a similar thing that we do on early on for the themes set up.

12:14.610 --> 12:24.330
We need to add the action so outside the function blow the last curly brace look of paste in the action.

12:25.060 --> 12:30.060
And replace after Feme set up with WP enqueue.

12:32.520 --> 12:33.380
Scripts.

12:35.410 --> 12:42.310
And then the second prometa is the name of all function which is tranquil underscore scripts so he can

12:42.310 --> 12:43.990
copy and paste that in.

12:47.110 --> 12:53.410
And say that because got debugging and to be enabled will refresh the browser hopefully we shouldn't

12:53.410 --> 12:57.900
get any problems and he can start to see there are some things are changing.

12:58.060 --> 13:01.660
So we've got some colours appear room which means up the custom.

13:01.720 --> 13:03.160
Most thrilling properly.

13:03.900 --> 13:10.530
And also the boost upsy assessed must be lean correctly because you can see that the grid system such

13:10.530 --> 13:13.590
as the free sections are set up properly.

13:14.110 --> 13:16.990
Well missing images but would take care of those soon.

13:16.990 --> 13:18.290
That's nothing to worry about.

13:19.450 --> 13:25.050
And lastly if would a shrink the browser down to a smaller size to the Mobile or trouble at size.

13:25.990 --> 13:30.460
Well can check of the javascript is working by clicking on the dropped button.

13:31.680 --> 13:33.090
So it was just all work and fine for you.

13:33.090 --> 13:33.850
That's great.

13:33.990 --> 13:37.100
If you've got a drop down that means that the javascript is working.

13:37.960 --> 13:41.280
So congratulations on getting this far and I'll see in the next video.

13:41.290 --> 13:43.340
Will add the WordPress navigation.
