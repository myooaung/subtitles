00:03.240 --> 00:03.580
OK.

00:03.630 --> 00:10.270
So if I go on to our website all of these pages as it done safely responsive premium spa Feme for word

00:10.270 --> 00:17.340
press at the top and that goes for the home page the blog page and any other pages that were going to

00:17.340 --> 00:19.350
be crain's such as the latest news.

00:19.350 --> 00:21.060
The contact was in about us.

00:21.120 --> 00:26.760
So I want to make sure that the feature text at the top of the Page reflects what page Baronne rather

00:26.760 --> 00:28.650
than a just been static text.

00:28.980 --> 00:34.390
And the reason the same text on every page is because if we're only headed up his HP.

00:35.250 --> 00:39.350
We've just got suttie case and I'll say I want a change to this video.

00:39.570 --> 00:45.180
By adding a p HP function so delete all the text between the Peter legs.

00:45.270 --> 00:51.960
But make sure the tags is still in place and then open up the HP And in the close and buckets.

00:53.510 --> 00:58.480
We're going to add in our own custom function and I'm going to call this feature text.

01:02.740 --> 01:04.690
The brackets and semicolon.

01:04.960 --> 01:06.590
So that's all we need to do in.

01:06.640 --> 01:11.930
We had a section on when to create this feature it's a function in the functions doppie HP.

01:13.080 --> 01:19.290
Then it got onto the bottom of the functions page just underneath the last function but still in the

01:19.290 --> 01:20.830
page petersburg's.

01:23.110 --> 01:24.910
Make a little bit a room for ourselves.

01:25.120 --> 01:33.340
So the function key word then a function name which was feature text in the brackets then pair of curly

01:33.340 --> 01:34.110
braces.

01:37.510 --> 01:40.760
So inside this function has going to be an F L statement.

01:40.870 --> 01:45.120
So a press will be checking if a certain page is being viewed.

01:45.250 --> 01:50.620
And if that certain page had been viewed then were going to set the correct text display in the feature

01:50.620 --> 01:51.700
text.

01:51.700 --> 01:55.500
So start off by using its statement.

01:56.860 --> 02:01.020
So if is front page.

02:03.340 --> 02:09.790
So for current of you in the front page then want to echo to the browser the text at which it cuts out

02:09.790 --> 02:17.220
of the headers section which is fully responsive premium spa theme for wordpress so fully responsive.

02:20.250 --> 02:21.370
Break time.

02:26.050 --> 02:27.980
Premium spa fame.

02:30.490 --> 02:34.430
Followed by the great tag for wordpress.

02:37.030 --> 02:37.950
And say that.

02:38.370 --> 02:44.110
Then just after the codebase there were going to use else if rather than else because we can use as

02:44.110 --> 02:50.890
many else if we want So as we go through the website everytime we create a new page it's busy.

02:50.910 --> 02:56.440
Contactless stage will create a new condition for that page and then we'll print out the appropriate

02:56.440 --> 02:59.640
text so else if.

03:01.730 --> 03:03.070
Then the curly braces.

03:03.290 --> 03:06.820
So the condition for the blog is with check.

03:06.860 --> 03:08.160
Is home.

03:10.730 --> 03:16.880
So were press classes the home page as the area where the main blog posts are being displayed.

03:16.910 --> 03:24.020
So we've got the front page we've got is home for the home of the blog posts and we'll check out the

03:24.020 --> 03:30.700
browser and cynical and at the end of the first one too.

03:31.490 --> 03:32.690
So I called the browser.

03:32.690 --> 03:37.710
If it's the blog you want mr say tranquil spa official blog.

03:44.380 --> 03:45.080
Okay.

03:45.460 --> 03:46.840
Let's save that and take a look.

03:46.840 --> 03:47.860
If this is work.

03:48.250 --> 03:50.580
So refresh the WordPress website.

03:50.650 --> 03:56.730
That seems to work and so far we've got the blog page selected and the text is changed to tranquil spa

03:56.730 --> 04:00.330
fish blog now well buttered a whole page.

04:00.520 --> 04:02.370
We'll get the original text that we set.

04:02.380 --> 04:08.390
So that's all work and fine so we'll leave that for now and we'll keep on to the functions every time.

04:08.530 --> 04:09.310
A new page.

04:09.310 --> 04:10.020
The blog.

04:10.420 --> 04:11.470
So fun to watch in.

04:11.530 --> 04:16.280
And in the next video I'll create the page template to display the full single blog post.
