00:01.630 --> 00:02.190
Welcome back.

00:02.200 --> 00:08.560
In this video we're going to create the facility for users to comment on posts and the way we do that

00:08.590 --> 00:10.630
is going to create a new page.

00:10.780 --> 00:12.970
And this is going to be a page template.

00:12.970 --> 00:15.910
So say this are comments Dopp.

00:15.930 --> 00:16.940
P.

00:19.440 --> 00:22.560
And service in the same directories as also AP HP.

00:25.710 --> 00:27.840
And then for this well I'm going to reinvent the wheel.

00:27.940 --> 00:35.130
We're just going to copy the comments page from the 2014 theme which is included with the word press

00:35.130 --> 00:36.210
download.

00:36.210 --> 00:40.550
So if you go to your WordPress installation in the page to docs.

00:43.380 --> 00:51.090
And then open up tranquil w.p. and then if you go into the content and themes and when you use the 2014

00:51.090 --> 00:55.220
theme and then open up the common stock page B.

00:57.170 --> 00:58.990
So select all copy.

01:00.230 --> 01:06.470
And then paste the content in two common stock plan B and say that.

01:09.140 --> 01:15.650
So we're really pretty much all of the comment stoppie HP as it is will just move the word press 2014

01:15.680 --> 01:24.280
references just from there are certain benefits of using the template from one of the included themes.

01:24.470 --> 01:30.770
It had some nice features such as chicken if a post is password protected and has only one or two little

01:30.770 --> 01:32.420
things we need to change.

01:32.450 --> 01:40.010
If I scroll down to the printer F line and I want to customize it slightly by changing one fought to

01:40.070 --> 01:47.810
comment and then on the next line change for its two comments and then saves up.

01:48.920 --> 01:57.110
And then to include this back in to our theme we need to go to the single dot HP template and then when

01:57.110 --> 02:03.860
put it underneath the pager we need to tell WordPress where to bolt in the blog post we want the comments

02:03.860 --> 02:04.730
to appear.

02:05.690 --> 02:07.650
And its usually at the bottom of the post.

02:07.790 --> 02:14.900
So let's put this just below the pager and then add a comment just in here.

02:15.210 --> 02:19.300
This comment and when I say load up the common template.

02:24.220 --> 02:27.060
And then after that open up the page petersburg's.

02:32.340 --> 02:34.610
And then use the comments template function.

02:39.470 --> 02:44.650
And save an ID for go over to a blog post and refresh.

02:44.650 --> 02:50.080
You should see at the bottom of the post that we have got the ability now to leave comments.

02:50.260 --> 02:52.680
Let's go ahead and on a few sample comments.

02:55.280 --> 02:57.510
Chick it's all working okay.

02:59.530 --> 03:03.480
So those are first comments and also reply to the comments.

03:06.590 --> 03:08.590
Say hello on an impulse to comment.

03:08.610 --> 03:09.930
JC It's all work in.

03:11.080 --> 03:13.610
So there's are two comments on Nurse That's good.

03:14.050 --> 03:16.470
So next I want to go into the CSA.

03:16.640 --> 03:22.660
Add some custom styling and make sure that the comments fit in a little bit more with the rest of the

03:22.660 --> 03:23.550
website.

03:23.950 --> 03:27.010
So head over to our style of SS.

03:27.990 --> 03:31.080
And then when I add some style into the bottom of the page.

03:32.240 --> 03:34.210
So copy the comments.

03:35.730 --> 03:42.440
Are this just below the blog single post and change the comment to be the comment section.

03:50.770 --> 03:57.070
So to get started I will make sure that the comments section at the bottom has a similar missile into

03:57.070 --> 04:06.100
the sidebar modules and also the blog posts are underway to do that is by copying the same style as

04:06.100 --> 04:08.120
we used in the sidebar module.

04:09.440 --> 04:11.460
So did copy this section.

04:15.700 --> 04:17.870
And then find the Selecter.

04:18.040 --> 04:20.520
So we open up the chrome developer tools.

04:22.380 --> 04:30.680
We'd inspect element we need to find the idae of the container which surrounds all of the common section.

04:30.920 --> 04:32.750
So click the magnifying glass.

04:35.220 --> 04:37.510
And find the surrounding container.

04:37.510 --> 04:43.180
So it's the div with idea of comments and then a class of comments area.

04:43.360 --> 04:47.520
So let's add that in now.

04:47.620 --> 04:56.990
So the idea of an I.D. of comments in the class of comments hyphen area.

04:59.380 --> 05:01.460
And then paste in the stylin.

05:02.700 --> 05:04.460
Let's see how that looks.

05:10.170 --> 05:13.680
Goods that stylin now matches the rest of the page.

05:13.770 --> 05:19.770
And next I just want to highlight the comments just so stunned that a little bit more from the rest

05:19.770 --> 05:26.880
of the background so we get this a dark grey background and also add a board around and also a little

05:26.880 --> 05:29.040
bit a margin just to separate them out.

05:29.850 --> 05:35.690
So the class or a need is comments body.

05:38.720 --> 05:43.890
So first of all we'll start with the background and buckram quilla is e.

05:45.440 --> 05:47.420
And then the border radius.

05:49.670 --> 05:58.840
Is 10 pixels to much the rest of the site and then the margin put 30 pixels on the top and bottom and

05:58.930 --> 06:01.660
zero on the left and right.

06:01.900 --> 06:04.340
So let's save refresh.

06:04.610 --> 06:10.710
Next I want to add the divider image between the header and the comments.

06:10.930 --> 06:12.990
So let's find out the Selecta for the.

06:14.950 --> 06:16.670
So click on the magnifying glass.

06:17.670 --> 06:18.580
And the header.

06:18.940 --> 06:25.250
So that's got a plus of hate to comments title sites are by now.

06:25.960 --> 06:27.130
So hate to.

06:27.580 --> 06:32.190
And then the class of comments from title.

06:35.290 --> 06:41.830
And then ascribe the same styling that were used in the blog post title so we scroll up to the blog

06:41.830 --> 06:44.730
section and look for the blog post title.

06:44.980 --> 06:51.060
We can copy the exact same s s which gives us the image and also East Ireland.

06:53.110 --> 06:57.040
And paste this into the comments title section and save.

06:57.900 --> 06:59.510
And let's take a look.

07:01.480 --> 07:02.590
So that's a good.

07:02.590 --> 07:07.360
So next I want to add a little bit a margin onto the bottom of the comments.

07:07.510 --> 07:12.260
And also a dashed line across to separate the reply section.

07:14.920 --> 07:19.510
So to do that we need to use the class of comment list.

07:20.640 --> 07:28.710
So let's add some margin margin to the bottom of 60 pixels and then bored on to the bottom.

07:29.760 --> 07:32.980
Of one pixel and a dashed line.

07:35.430 --> 07:36.320
Now take a look.

07:37.420 --> 07:38.420
So there we go.

07:38.830 --> 07:39.870
And then we're nearly there now.

07:39.880 --> 07:42.740
Let's do a little bit of style into the reply section.

07:42.940 --> 07:46.370
So and when make the textarea to be the full width.

07:46.660 --> 07:48.360
So let's get the class for that.

07:50.140 --> 07:53.730
So this elective for that is text area with the idea of comments.

07:58.620 --> 08:00.400
So type in text area.

08:02.320 --> 08:04.050
The idea of comments.

08:06.140 --> 08:09.760
So said the textarea wit to be 100 percent.

08:11.680 --> 08:16.680
And add some margin on to the bottom of 20 pixels.

08:18.610 --> 08:21.780
And then refresh sanaz full width.

08:22.240 --> 08:28.420
And the last thing and I want to do is style the submit button and I want to make it the same as the

08:28.420 --> 08:30.940
submit button that we used on bootstrap website.

08:31.180 --> 08:34.670
So it's got the same blue colour as the rest of the website.

08:34.890 --> 08:37.210
So let's find out what the slichter is.

08:38.030 --> 08:41.840
So the import has an idea of Submit.

08:42.320 --> 08:49.730
So we can just submit idae on to the button defaults up in a global section.

08:51.240 --> 08:54.240
So just after button default separated by a comma.

08:55.550 --> 08:57.300
Also the idea of Submit.

08:58.300 --> 09:00.790
And then do the same in the hovell state.

09:03.570 --> 09:04.040
Submit.

09:04.080 --> 09:05.070
Hover.

09:06.020 --> 09:08.010
And then back down to the comment section.

09:14.280 --> 09:19.180
So under the text area section also are the submit idae.

09:19.500 --> 09:22.690
And let's make the button much the textarea.

09:22.710 --> 09:25.520
By giving a width of 100 percent.

09:28.540 --> 09:30.560
So let's say that and see how that look.

09:32.790 --> 09:34.580
And refresh.

09:34.970 --> 09:37.120
And we don't need the developer tools anymore.

09:37.260 --> 09:38.750
So that took a about an hour today.

09:38.760 --> 09:39.960
Good.

09:39.960 --> 09:45.330
So one thing that you may not know is so far when we've been out in the comments and we click on the

09:45.330 --> 09:53.340
Reply button as soon as we hit reply were taken to the bottom of the screen to add a reply and this

09:53.340 --> 09:53.730
is fine.

09:53.730 --> 09:59.860
For now one morning I got one or two comments on a page that's caught tens or hundreds of comments would

09:59.880 --> 10:02.410
only be taken right down to the bottom of the page.

10:02.460 --> 10:08.470
We want the comment box to appear just underneath the post of a comment and on and luckily WordPress

10:08.490 --> 10:14.560
has some javascript to do this so the wolken other Javascript in is by her notes to the functions of

10:14.720 --> 10:16.170
HP.

10:16.250 --> 10:26.020
If will look for the enqueue script section in the Feme set up just underneath the bootstrap javascript.

10:26.020 --> 10:34.650
Go going to add the common reply script so I will check first if the post is singular.

10:36.710 --> 10:43.560
No one kulis script just as above with WP in queue scripts.

10:45.480 --> 10:48.020
The script name is comment reply.

10:52.110 --> 10:54.200
In a semicolon at the end of the.

10:54.580 --> 10:55.640
So save that.

10:55.860 --> 10:59.730
And if he go over to press and refresh.

10:59.830 --> 11:06.330
Now if you click on the Reply button answers not work on some reason or just check why whistle tech

11:06.370 --> 11:07.900
to bomb the page.

11:08.150 --> 11:11.370
So I'll take a look with this.

11:12.680 --> 11:17.020
I will need to make sure that it's within the code braces.

11:17.080 --> 11:24.550
So could this section are they were just done and paste it would in the code races or add in the function.

11:24.620 --> 11:28.050
So save that and let's see the work in now.

11:28.130 --> 11:33.810
So click on the reply and no golts now rather than being taken to the very bottom of the page.

11:33.860 --> 11:37.190
We now have the javascript enabled and this make sure that the.

11:37.190 --> 11:37.610
Box.

11:37.610 --> 11:41.190
A pig is just below the comments that were replying on.

11:41.660 --> 11:44.600
So there goes that a fully functional common section.

11:44.630 --> 11:47.320
So thanks for listening and will see it in the next video.
