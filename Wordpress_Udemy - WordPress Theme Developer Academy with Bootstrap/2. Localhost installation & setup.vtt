WEBVTT

00:02.640 --> 00:07.950
So now let's get to work on install in our local host on our on computer.

00:08.250 --> 00:11.000
So I'm going to head over to my web browser.

00:11.860 --> 00:15.130
An on a search for mump which is a MP.

00:18.140 --> 00:22.090
And then when the mump or in full so to select that.

00:22.310 --> 00:22.590
OK.

00:22.610 --> 00:28.730
So for this video and want of using the mump package which gives us Apache the my Escuela for all the

00:28.730 --> 00:37.010
databases and also HP and as well as server side languages that is different local hosts which you can

00:37.010 --> 00:40.610
download such as example or example.

00:40.840 --> 00:42.750
And when won't use a month for this video.

00:42.800 --> 00:48.350
It's free to use it's free to download and it's available for both Windows and Mac.

00:48.800 --> 00:52.700
So to get started just click on the download button.

00:53.990 --> 00:57.080
And then just scroll down to the version of your choice.

00:57.140 --> 00:59.430
So I won't know who's in the muck version.

00:59.690 --> 01:03.100
So click on the download button to get started.

01:05.840 --> 01:08.660
So just give that a few moments to download.

01:08.660 --> 01:14.610
So basically mump is a package which includes a web server.

01:14.840 --> 01:21.890
So replicate a web server on your own computer so you can work with server side languages such as HP

01:22.330 --> 01:26.640
would allow them to upload your website to allow a web server.

01:26.990 --> 01:33.530
And it also allows us to create my esky world databases that we can interact with so we can basically

01:33.530 --> 01:37.670
develop your website on your own computer and then once it's finished.

01:37.670 --> 01:40.460
You can upload it and start only paying for a web server.

01:40.490 --> 01:42.150
Once your website is complete.

01:42.940 --> 01:45.060
That is a pro version available with mump.

01:45.220 --> 01:49.970
But the normal version is more than good enough for all purposes.

01:50.050 --> 01:54.200
So just give that a few moments to download and return in just a minute.

01:56.920 --> 01:57.820
Okay welcome back.

01:57.820 --> 02:03.620
So hopefully the mump package has been now downloaded onto your system.

02:03.640 --> 02:08.090
If you just go through the installation process in the usual way.

02:08.380 --> 02:10.460
So I'm going to click Continue.

02:11.610 --> 02:13.690
And agree to the licence.

02:14.910 --> 02:15.350
Install.

02:15.360 --> 02:16.510
Or users.

02:17.890 --> 02:20.320
A.m. for the standard installation.

02:26.090 --> 02:27.790
And then just let it install.

02:34.670 --> 02:35.440
There we go.

02:35.480 --> 02:40.080
So now that it's fully installed on system and I should get rid of this for now.

02:41.440 --> 02:45.410
OK it's open if using a Mac or Windows.

02:45.640 --> 02:48.870
Just head over to the location which you can store all that.

02:48.970 --> 02:55.040
In my case it's in the applications and then is a month pro the standard month folder.

02:55.330 --> 03:00.260
So just click on the month folder and then you can see inside is various different files.

03:01.330 --> 03:07.070
But the one were going to be mainly concentrating on is the hate t docs which is short for the hypertext

03:07.070 --> 03:13.730
documents and this is basically the folder other location which were going to put our website in there

03:13.730 --> 03:16.420
will want to be served by the local host.

03:16.970 --> 03:19.040
So I'll just leave off just for one second.

03:21.030 --> 03:24.330
I'm going to create a new folder just on the desktop.

03:24.430 --> 03:26.830
I was going to simply call this p HP website.

03:27.960 --> 03:29.550
Just as a quick example.

03:30.760 --> 03:34.270
Now it's going to open this up inside of brackets as an example.

03:34.870 --> 03:43.930
So just plug it in and when I get a new page so I want to create a very basic index page use an HP so

03:43.930 --> 03:52.850
to say that inside the folder as in works doppie HP and then open up our HP brackets.

03:56.330 --> 03:57.890
And also the close tag.

03:58.400 --> 04:00.450
So I'm trying to create a simple echo.

04:02.790 --> 04:05.640
And then I put it between page one's eyes.

04:09.330 --> 04:15.480
And going to make a message say in the HP website is working.

04:19.250 --> 04:20.150
And then say.

04:20.560 --> 04:26.130
So if we're now to open up inside the browser you should notice that there's a problem.

04:27.380 --> 04:28.570
So let's open this up.

04:30.160 --> 04:31.490
Inside a chrome.

04:35.030 --> 04:36.940
Scroll down find your web browser.

04:39.710 --> 04:39.870
OK.

04:39.890 --> 04:45.950
It says the contents of our index page but it's not exactly of all in because when we're serving these

04:45.950 --> 04:50.450
pages as a website we don't want to display all the HP.

04:50.540 --> 04:54.670
We just want the content or the hate jamile to be returned.

04:54.680 --> 04:57.880
So in our case we just want the text in between.

04:57.890 --> 05:07.170
So now what we need to do to get this to work is we need to drag HP website folder inside the HD docs.

05:07.790 --> 05:11.380
So just drag it over and drop that insider.

05:12.260 --> 05:14.440
And then if we just open up our mom program.

05:15.800 --> 05:17.700
And then click on Start servers.

05:18.830 --> 05:23.190
And you're not in the top right and Connors the Apache server and my esky well.

05:25.440 --> 05:27.960
And scroll down and see some information.

05:28.340 --> 05:34.360
So we've got the host as a local host and the user and password has been set to root.

05:34.810 --> 05:36.770
So that's all working correctly.

05:36.970 --> 05:43.520
And inside the mump program if we click on the preferences you can find out a little bit more about

05:43.520 --> 05:45.960
the version of people who were.

05:46.580 --> 05:51.830
You can click on the ports and the Apache port is the one which you're going to be using inside the

05:51.830 --> 05:52.820
browser.

05:52.820 --> 05:55.330
So that's doable eight double eight.

05:55.610 --> 06:03.550
So if you go back over to Crome and now you can read off an index stop HP inside the local host.

06:03.980 --> 06:08.760
And then if you type in local host and now we need a call on.

06:09.980 --> 06:11.070
And then of course and pause.

06:11.090 --> 06:13.920
8 8 8 8 just typed inside there.

06:14.990 --> 06:20.990
And then to get all those we can either just go into it just as it is and we see exactly what is inside

06:20.990 --> 06:22.220
Haiti docs.

06:22.250 --> 06:28.010
So in our case it has to be Web website or you can actually type that in at the end of the you are old.

06:28.340 --> 06:35.290
So you click on cyder and then gholson now rather than have in all the HP tags that echo print into

06:35.300 --> 06:36.290
the screen.

06:36.290 --> 06:39.800
We've now got the actual hate mail returned.

06:39.980 --> 06:44.550
So now the HP website is now working as though it on a live web server.

06:46.270 --> 06:51.670
And if were any different files or folders inside the docs You just need to use exactly the same local

06:51.670 --> 06:53.870
host the debate of late.

06:54.070 --> 06:59.140
And then just change the folds flash to the directory that you put inside there and you can see which

06:59.140 --> 07:00.360
direction we were working on.

07:00.370 --> 07:05.940
If you go into the web server and you can see there's a will file path to the hastey Docs.

07:07.350 --> 07:13.010
And if want to look at a little bit further into it you can also click on the start page and it takes

07:13.010 --> 07:20.070
you back to the welcome site and you can click on the tools and you get an option to go to HP.

07:20.090 --> 07:25.370
My admin and that's the setting that we need to use if we want to create any databases.

07:26.640 --> 07:34.130
You can also see on the right side all the different versions of HP furn and Apache for example that

07:34.140 --> 07:35.260
we're currently using.

07:36.620 --> 07:38.530
Okay so I'll just leave that video there.

07:38.570 --> 07:44.450
So that's how you can create a local host on your own machine and serve will pay HP websites with without

07:44.450 --> 07:46.140
the need for a live web server.
