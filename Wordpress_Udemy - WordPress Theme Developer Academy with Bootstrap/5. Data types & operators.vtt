00:01.160 --> 00:01.760
Welcome back.

00:01.760 --> 00:08.800
So so far in the last couple of videos we've taken a look our toll variables can store data in HP.

00:09.200 --> 00:11.900
We've looked our numbers or integers.

00:13.400 --> 00:17.200
And taken a look at how we can store them into variables.

00:17.380 --> 00:24.160
So an integer can have very different types and you can see some examples such as a positive number

00:25.030 --> 00:28.820
a negative number or hexadecimal number.

00:30.310 --> 00:36.590
We've also taken a look at strings which you know is a series of characters and they can play the strings

00:36.620 --> 00:39.920
in different ways such as single or double quotes.

00:40.920 --> 00:45.840
But there's also many different types of data that you can use in P HP.

00:46.170 --> 00:52.100
For example there's a boulis on a boony on is a simple true or false.

00:53.080 --> 00:59.140
So for example we can see if some fin returns true and if it does we can perform a certain action.

01:01.140 --> 01:07.050
And as sort of a data type such as a race which will look out in this section But next when we take

01:07.080 --> 01:10.690
a look at some HP operators.

01:10.800 --> 01:18.270
So to begin where I take a look at some arithmetic operators so let's use our number example that we

01:18.270 --> 01:19.570
looked at before.

01:19.590 --> 01:29.550
So number one equal to 100 a second variable of number two equal to two hundred.

01:31.590 --> 01:33.890
And then can do an echo.

01:34.230 --> 01:37.700
So I call a number on slawson on the two.

01:40.470 --> 01:43.040
And will she get by or 300 in the browser.

01:44.690 --> 01:48.290
So this plus symbol is a arithmetic operator.

01:48.290 --> 01:51.920
It adds the value of number one to number two.

01:52.710 --> 01:56.730
Well can also take these values away with the take away symbol.

01:59.150 --> 02:01.940
So get minus or negative one hundred.

02:03.600 --> 02:08.940
Well can also multiply two MP HP we need to use the Star symbol.

02:13.220 --> 02:15.430
So we get the value of 20000.

02:16.760 --> 02:20.310
We can also divide with the faulds Flush.

02:24.900 --> 02:31.980
And we can also find out the remainder so we can do that with the per cent symbol and the percent symbol

02:32.070 --> 02:37.860
gives us the remainder after the division and to do this we need to change the values to something more

02:37.860 --> 02:39.330
suitable.

02:39.330 --> 02:41.820
So no one equals 10.

02:42.440 --> 02:44.490
And number two is equal to free.

02:46.060 --> 02:48.360
And then refreshen we should get the value of one.

02:49.570 --> 02:56.690
And the reason for that is because fragos into 10 free times and then leaves a value of worn as a remainder.

02:57.710 --> 03:01.970
So let's take a look at more examples on the w free schools website.

03:03.320 --> 03:05.200
That a be free schools.

03:07.040 --> 03:10.320
An MP HB operators.

03:13.280 --> 03:14.920
And then a scroll down.

03:14.980 --> 03:18.550
So we looked at some of the arithmetic operators which you can see here.

03:18.700 --> 03:20.790
There's also assignment operators.

03:21.130 --> 03:25.710
So the most basic assignment operator is the equal symbol.

03:26.020 --> 03:28.110
And we've looked at these in previous videos.

03:28.210 --> 03:32.530
So we signed a value of 10 to the variable name of number one.

03:32.980 --> 03:41.800
There's also other assignment operators such as addition subtraction multiplication division and the

03:41.830 --> 03:43.910
modulus which is the remainder.

03:44.780 --> 03:48.100
There's also comparison and logical operators.

03:49.310 --> 03:55.610
So you can check if two values are equal or less than are greater than but we'll take a look at these

03:55.610 --> 03:58.740
in more detail in the if El stayman section.

04:00.280 --> 04:02.950
We can also increment and decrement a value.

04:03.400 --> 04:06.860
So an increment for example of value by one.

04:07.130 --> 04:08.870
And decrements value by 1.

04:11.230 --> 04:16.530
So we'll look out increment and decrement operators more in the loop's video.

04:16.960 --> 04:25.810
But for now let's take a look at a few basic examples of how good the news and so hard a variable called

04:25.840 --> 04:26.630
no.

04:27.140 --> 04:29.860
And we simply set this to the value of one.

04:31.270 --> 04:37.660
And if we echo this the browser would just get the value of one printed book and increment its value

04:37.690 --> 04:40.340
by one every time.

04:40.380 --> 04:44.530
So any variable name of number and then using plus plus.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.180
So save that.

04:47.680 --> 04:53.220
So now the value of ONE should be incremented by one and then we should get printed to the browser.

04:53.560 --> 04:57.270
The value of two so refresh.

04:59.340 --> 05:01.630
Sorry a semicolon on the end of the.

05:01.710 --> 05:02.900
And then refresh.

05:06.030 --> 05:08.000
And then with the one off there and save.

05:09.630 --> 05:12.690
So refresh your browser and never get the value of two.

05:13.900 --> 05:15.380
I am looking keep repeating this.

05:15.430 --> 05:22.300
So if I wanted to increment by a worn once more and take the value to be and the free will can add that

05:22.300 --> 05:23.230
in again.

05:24.100 --> 05:26.200
And then we should get the value taken to free.

05:27.030 --> 05:32.800
And if I wanted to decrement it I could use the negative symbol and we use it twice.

05:32.800 --> 05:41.450
We should get the value of negative one so refresh and Ogo So the value of one gets decremented to be

05:41.450 --> 05:42.140
zero.

05:42.350 --> 05:45.220
And then decremented again to be negative 1.

05:47.240 --> 05:53.330
Such a quick look at art datatypes arm operators in P HP and all See you in the next video or take a

05:53.330 --> 05:55.310
look up chb arrays.
