00:01.870 --> 00:02.590
Welcome back.

00:02.590 --> 00:10.270
In the last video we took a look at some HP basics such as echo were in text to the browser comments

00:10.450 --> 00:13.890
and also how to mix P HP and hate email.

00:13.960 --> 00:20.230
In this video we're going to move on to take a look at strings variables and constants.

00:25.620 --> 00:31.200
So I'm going to delete the code between the PDB tags from the last section.

00:31.950 --> 00:34.920
So first of all going to take a look at strings.

00:34.920 --> 00:41.930
So a string is a sequence of characters such as a single letter a word or a sentence.

00:42.250 --> 00:46.260
A string is what we used in the last video where we don't a Echo.

00:46.370 --> 00:49.120
So I printed a string between quotations.

00:49.440 --> 00:52.080
So this is a string.

00:53.650 --> 00:55.800
And forget the semicolon at the end.

00:57.100 --> 01:04.120
So the string was be surrounded with either a single or a double quotation.

01:04.210 --> 01:10.480
Both work perfectly fine so echo an end time a single quote.

01:10.480 --> 01:12.870
So this is also a string.

01:14.770 --> 01:18.100
So let's take a look at that in a browser by refreshing.

01:18.150 --> 01:21.200
So this is a string and this is also a string.

01:22.480 --> 01:27.130
So most of the time it does my if we use single or double quotes.

01:27.130 --> 01:33.510
The only time it really matters is if you want to surround one of these words with the quotation marks.

01:33.550 --> 01:35.940
So for example if you wanted the word string.

01:37.520 --> 01:40.210
Have the quotations printed on the screen.

01:40.280 --> 01:45.470
We need to make sure that the quotations we use around the word are opposite to what is surround in

01:45.470 --> 01:48.550
this sentence sulpher say that.

01:49.010 --> 01:52.760
And then refresh the word string has the double quotes.

01:53.990 --> 01:59.090
If you were to do this and all had the same style of quotes.

02:00.250 --> 02:01.210
So say the.

02:02.340 --> 02:07.300
The text editor has picked up a issue so it's making a different colour.

02:07.320 --> 02:12.640
So if I were to refresh would see the local host page isn't working because we got a error.

02:13.980 --> 02:16.460
But if we change it to be single quotes.

02:18.840 --> 02:21.990
And then the Serrano morons bucketed a ball.

02:23.750 --> 02:28.940
Then refresh that's how can add single and double quotes within a string.

02:29.510 --> 02:34.750
Okay so there's lots of ways you can work with strings by using string functions.

02:35.160 --> 02:40.600
So for example if I wanted to reverse the string just to the example there.

02:43.840 --> 02:48.210
So if I wanted to reverse the string we could use the string verse function.

02:48.600 --> 02:56.510
So which is s t r r e e v i know i need to surround the string inside brackets.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.610
And then save that and then just check out the browser and see what happens.

03:03.660 --> 03:08.450
So that reverses all the characters inside the string so it's now back to front.

03:10.500 --> 03:18.070
You can also do other things such as make all the words uppercase or lowercase so to make them all uppercase

03:18.080 --> 03:29.240
we can use g string to up a function so S.T. are two upper and and save that and then refresh and now

03:29.270 --> 03:32.170
all the characters inside the string are uppercase.

03:33.110 --> 03:35.610
We can do the same with it's string to lower.

03:36.020 --> 03:39.060
So S.T. are to lower.

03:40.160 --> 03:41.800
Save and refresh.

03:42.620 --> 03:45.190
And now there's no capitals at all in the string.

03:46.380 --> 03:51.720
And of course has many more different string functions which you can find with a quick Google.

03:52.010 --> 03:56.370
So we search for the HP string functions.

03:58.540 --> 04:00.840
And then we're instantly taken to a list.

04:01.300 --> 04:07.720
And as I've a page B dot net or W free schools which has lots of examples.

04:08.270 --> 04:10.010
And as you can see there's quite a list.

04:10.240 --> 04:16.960
So there's lots of different things we can do with strings such as split the string into an array which

04:16.960 --> 04:23.380
can randomly shuffle all the characters in a string will can check out the length of the string which

04:23.380 --> 04:26.080
returns the number of characters.

04:26.080 --> 04:27.900
So we have a play around with these.

04:27.910 --> 04:32.720
So we may not have a need for these two functions which have to show new and I'm sure if you work with

04:32.740 --> 04:36.890
BHB Reguly you'll come across many of these different functions.

04:37.000 --> 04:37.510
So next.

04:37.510 --> 04:39.520
Going to move on to variables.

04:39.700 --> 04:42.280
And like many other programming languages.

04:42.420 --> 04:47.380
HP uses variables as containers for storing information.

04:47.530 --> 04:50.780
Our new information inside these variables can change.

04:50.980 --> 04:54.020
So I going to delete this string.

04:56.190 --> 05:04.230
And the way we declare a variable is by first using a dollar sign and then assigning a variable name.

05:04.230 --> 05:06.500
So for example number one.

05:07.830 --> 05:15.410
And then set the value to be equal to a string a number a purely on or various other things.

05:16.140 --> 05:18.850
So I said the number one to be equal to 10.

05:21.100 --> 05:25.650
You know this woman deals with numbers we don't need to put the quotations each side of it.

05:26.080 --> 05:29.420
So what we've done is create a variable with the name of number one.

05:29.700 --> 05:35.230
And we've assigned the value of 10 to this number and then can do the same.

05:35.230 --> 05:40.140
We can create a second variable so it is down when I call it number two.

05:40.510 --> 05:43.390
And this time I'll set the value to be 20.

05:44.230 --> 05:47.030
And now you can use the Echo that will looked up before.

05:47.370 --> 05:56.880
So instead of echo in a string will can echo the variable name so no one so she printed to the browser.

05:56.880 --> 05:57.970
The value of 10.

06:01.080 --> 06:02.360
So refresh.

06:02.460 --> 06:05.060
And there's our number 10.

06:05.070 --> 06:14.120
We can also add variables together so can equal the value of number 1 plus the value of number 2.

06:15.730 --> 06:17.530
So now go 30 in the browser.

06:20.110 --> 06:23.020
And we can also combine strings with variables.

06:24.800 --> 06:26.890
So if we have a variable.

06:28.870 --> 06:30.670
So the number of posts.

06:31.280 --> 06:33.280
So I said that to be 7.

06:35.460 --> 06:41.840
I never have a variable name so the variable called name assigned to a string.

06:42.240 --> 06:43.700
And when I call like Chris.

06:45.170 --> 06:51.620
So if the user called Chris harz Create 7 posts which can then print is the browser so.

06:51.650 --> 06:52.720
Echo.

06:54.050 --> 06:56.500
Because its string we need to put this in quotations.

06:57.650 --> 06:58.760
So if wanted to print.

06:58.760 --> 07:00.870
Chris has seven posts.

07:01.150 --> 07:03.040
We could start with the variable name.

07:05.210 --> 07:09.350
So place I never saw that would be Chris and then harz.

07:10.420 --> 07:12.380
And then reward the value of posts.

07:14.460 --> 07:15.740
So put that into the.

07:16.610 --> 07:21.380
So currently It says Chris has seven and N posts.

07:23.470 --> 07:29.530
And then I will mention before we can put a huge demand SAG inside there which can add a great aag into

07:29.530 --> 07:30.470
there.

07:30.580 --> 07:37.590
So let's say that and hopefully we should get the value of Chris harz seven posts which you do scutwork

07:37.630 --> 07:39.060
and fine.

07:39.190 --> 07:43.270
So he mentioned diet values of the variable can be changed.

07:44.230 --> 07:51.640
So if we go back to our number example so number one equal to 10.

07:53.490 --> 07:54.890
And then echo number one.

07:58.300 --> 08:02.090
So will she get the value of 10 printed to the browser.

08:03.310 --> 08:04.850
Bought further on down a program.

08:04.870 --> 08:12.520
If you wanted to change the value of number one book and re assign a value so no one will can change

08:12.520 --> 08:14.690
that to be 20.

08:15.880 --> 08:21.320
And there were an echo number one we should get the value of 20 printed to the browser.

08:22.890 --> 08:23.700
Which we do.

08:24.120 --> 08:27.480
And this is because the program is red line by line.

08:27.570 --> 08:35.280
So when it gets the line 11 no one is set to the value of 10 and then moves down to the next line and

08:35.280 --> 08:38.660
then realizes that number one is now set to 20.

08:38.720 --> 08:39.530
So when we echo.

08:39.530 --> 08:41.740
Number one we have the value of 20.

08:42.780 --> 08:49.320
OK so the last thing I want to look at in this video is Constance constans dislike like variables can

08:49.380 --> 08:52.920
store some information or store a value.

08:53.280 --> 08:58.540
However unlike variables the value can't change once it's been set.

08:58.710 --> 09:02.370
So this is how you set a constant impact p.

09:03.610 --> 09:11.320
So first of all we use the defined function or the defined key word to declare a constant and then we

09:11.320 --> 09:17.080
open up the curly buckets and then when it's pass in two parameters.

09:17.080 --> 09:24.990
So the first parameter in between the quotations and in cupples is the name of the constant.

09:25.150 --> 09:32.920
So for example if I wanted store value of your own name we could call it name and end separate by a

09:32.920 --> 09:33.530
comma.

09:34.460 --> 09:37.260
We add the value of the constant.

09:37.760 --> 09:42.210
So this would be my name and then a semicolon at the end.

09:43.480 --> 09:50.740
So we've defined a constant with the name of name and then we've undid the value of crista this constant

09:51.990 --> 09:56.180
Arma can print this to the browser in the same way as before.

09:56.290 --> 10:00.280
So all we need to do is echo the name.

10:01.640 --> 10:05.930
And then when you get the value of Chris inside the browser.

10:06.880 --> 10:07.660
OK so here goes.

10:07.660 --> 10:12.080
That's how we use strings variables and constants impact B.
