00:02.050 --> 00:02.630
Welcome back.

00:02.640 --> 00:06.730
In this video we're going to be quain the WordPress menu for the foot section.

00:07.060 --> 00:12.220
So currently if you scroll down to the footer which has got the on ordered list we're putting in the

00:12.220 --> 00:13.560
bootstrap template.

00:13.900 --> 00:19.410
We want to make the menu more dynamic like the menu up the navigation bar.

00:19.780 --> 00:23.070
So let's go into the dashboard and create a new menu.

00:23.500 --> 00:27.640
So head over to appearance and then menus.

00:29.830 --> 00:31.680
And then select great new menu.

00:34.250 --> 00:36.510
And one call this menu the footer menu.

00:39.550 --> 00:40.720
Then create the menu.

00:42.040 --> 00:47.920
So on the left under the pages tub we can select which links you want to add to this menu.

00:48.340 --> 00:54.550
So we've not created the about was page on the Contact Us page a book and add the blog and the latest

00:54.550 --> 00:55.510
news.

00:55.510 --> 01:01.860
So select those two and then select ads and then you add the blog just goes above the latest news.

01:03.450 --> 01:04.290
So save that.

01:04.290 --> 01:09.350
And then it will head over to the functions doppie HP we can registered the menu.

01:09.930 --> 01:16.590
So back into functions doppie HP and then look for the register not menu section that were done early

01:16.590 --> 01:21.230
on in the course and then underneath this we need to add the footer menu.

01:21.240 --> 01:26.700
So we just copy the primary menu and then paste it in just below.

01:26.700 --> 01:28.840
So the nickname is the footer.

01:29.920 --> 01:33.380
And then the menu name is the footer menu.

01:34.540 --> 01:39.390
So save that and back over to the dush board and then refresh the menus page.

01:40.740 --> 01:42.560
And now the page is refreshed.

01:42.690 --> 01:48.930
Make sure you still in the footer menu and then select the footer menu tub under the Feme locations

01:49.290 --> 01:50.290
and save that.

01:51.600 --> 01:57.270
And then with other publications walk to the foots a file in the same way as were done in the head section.

01:57.360 --> 01:58.500
So go over to the.

01:58.530 --> 02:06.220
Headed up HP and then it will look for the navigation bar which is everything from wp nub menu.

02:07.510 --> 02:09.560
All the way down to the closing brackets.

02:11.490 --> 02:13.570
Which is just so copy that section.

02:15.060 --> 02:20.100
And then go to the footed up HP and then look for the navigation.

02:22.270 --> 02:25.000
Which is just above the social media icons.

02:25.060 --> 02:32.110
So if we look at the unordered list and you can delete all of the on or the list section would the about

02:32.140 --> 02:39.100
the contact the blog and the latest news section so delete them but make sure leave the outside container.

02:39.310 --> 02:41.590
Then at the HP tags.

02:43.040 --> 02:46.920
And they would in the tug's paste in the of Walker.

02:48.410 --> 02:53.760
So this one doesn't need as much information as the head of one for the men you name.

02:53.790 --> 02:56.220
It's going to be the footer.

02:56.640 --> 02:58.770
We can delete the feed location.

03:00.460 --> 03:05.650
And also the debt for cause is only one level and bring that up.

03:06.730 --> 03:14.920
The container is the on order list that were deleted before so change from Dave to you Well I would

03:14.920 --> 03:22.810
only add the menu class the container idea or the A class for this one so we can remove them and everything

03:22.810 --> 03:25.660
else we can leave as it is and then saved up.

03:25.690 --> 03:32.210
And just to finish off the foote's a menu will other last two pages so good pages and then add new.

03:32.550 --> 03:38.790
Now I'm going to add in the above it was page so about us and then hit publish.

03:41.120 --> 03:42.380
And then I knew.

03:44.140 --> 03:48.910
And the lust page goes into the footer menu is the Contact Us page.

03:48.910 --> 03:51.050
So contact us and then publish.

03:53.130 --> 03:54.920
Um these last two pages of the footer.

03:55.190 --> 03:57.260
So appearance and menus.

03:58.990 --> 04:00.500
And select the footer menu.

04:02.130 --> 04:08.910
Send select the Contact Us page and the about was page you were just created here up to menu and then

04:08.910 --> 04:10.900
rearranges into the correct order.

04:11.010 --> 04:13.040
So the top page was about us.

04:14.090 --> 04:15.390
And it was contact us.

04:20.220 --> 04:25.790
Then the blog and latest news then hit save menu and then go over to the site.

04:26.700 --> 04:32.160
Okay so it looks as though I've managed to up these pages to the top menu to remove those in just a

04:32.160 --> 04:32.830
moment.

04:32.910 --> 04:36.390
Both will go down to the bottom which can check if it's all working correctly.

04:36.390 --> 04:37.780
So select the blog.

04:39.100 --> 04:42.760
There's our blog section and the latest news.

04:45.790 --> 04:46.910
That looks fine.

04:47.290 --> 04:49.590
So why created the ballot was page or contact.

04:49.600 --> 04:50.180
Yeah.

04:50.560 --> 04:55.570
So would remove these menu links from the top back into the dashboard.

04:56.570 --> 04:57.970
Appearance and menus.

05:00.060 --> 05:02.090
And then select the main menu from the top.

05:03.330 --> 05:09.600
Can either remove the from the menu by selecting them and then select and remove and do the same for

05:09.600 --> 05:13.450
the US page and then save that menu.

05:19.070 --> 05:20.300
Okay it's that look and how it should.

05:20.310 --> 05:24.030
Now I've got all the menus working correctly on the website.

05:24.070 --> 05:25.440
So thanks for watching.

05:25.450 --> 05:26.210
Take care.
