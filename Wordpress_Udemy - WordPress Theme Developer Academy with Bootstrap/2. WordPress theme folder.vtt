WEBVTT

00:02.710 --> 00:08.740
Okay so now we've got our local host and were press all installed when I'm going to get to work on impossibile

00:08.780 --> 00:11.740
boost of folder's into our custom theme.

00:11.810 --> 00:20.050
So if we go back to the mump folder and then under the Haiti docs go find our tranquil w.p. folder.

00:20.370 --> 00:21.760
So open this up.

00:21.950 --> 00:26.330
And these are all the files and folders that's included weird were pressed by default.

00:26.600 --> 00:34.280
Most of the work that we'll do on the custom theme will be inside w.p. content and then inside the themes

00:34.280 --> 00:34.990
folder.

00:36.150 --> 00:42.410
So inside the Feme Soledad there's the standard default beams and included weird Wordpress.

00:42.420 --> 00:48.960
2015 is the most current and that's one that we seen when we opened up our website before.

00:48.960 --> 00:50.840
So inside the themes folder.

00:51.270 --> 00:53.920
Let's get started with our custom theme.

00:54.030 --> 00:59.480
So if you go to new folder and once call it tranquil.

01:01.300 --> 01:02.210
WP.

01:07.090 --> 01:13.310
So if you open up the tranquil WP folder and also our bootstrap folder.

01:14.410 --> 01:18.250
You can start putting in some of the folders into our custom theme.

01:18.320 --> 01:24.940
So I'm going to select all the files for now and copy and then paste these in to folder.

01:26.100 --> 01:27.190
So we don't need the.

01:27.210 --> 01:30.760
About the blog or the contact page just for now.

01:31.140 --> 01:34.060
So I'm just going to get rid of those.

01:34.110 --> 01:41.560
The index page we need to change is to index dot P P So word press recognises it.

01:42.530 --> 01:44.840
So use a thp Extension.

01:45.930 --> 01:51.100
We need to keep the images that javascript the CSA the font folder.

01:51.280 --> 01:57.420
But in the successful there will need to move our custom access file and we need to move it to be at

01:57.420 --> 01:59.610
the same level as our index page.

02:00.090 --> 02:05.420
So if we select the customer success and then move that back one level.

02:06.730 --> 02:13.090
In with the index page on the folders because that's where WordPress requires the SS to be.

02:13.280 --> 02:19.660
And also it requires it's becall styled CSA rather than custom.

02:21.490 --> 02:23.780
So change to style that C assess.

02:25.940 --> 02:32.360
So as well has been our custom style sheet in our style that success were can also include some important

02:32.360 --> 02:35.010
word Chris information about I will Feme.

02:35.180 --> 02:41.090
So if we go back in to our text editor and you may need to refresh because we've changed some of the

02:41.120 --> 02:49.030
files and folders and tranquil WP if we go to content themes.

02:50.430 --> 02:52.010
And then tranquil w.p..

02:53.540 --> 02:56.020
Well can and find the style sheet that will just renamed.

02:56.970 --> 03:02.970
So right at the very top of the page if we just make some space and we need to go back into the web

03:02.970 --> 03:04.280
browser.

03:06.130 --> 03:07.980
So head over to Google.

03:09.190 --> 03:11.010
So I'm going to do a search.

03:11.170 --> 03:17.800
So if you search for kodaks so codecs is basically the word press documentation.

03:17.800 --> 03:24.200
So I'll be using that quite a lot in this section to find lots of information such as HP functions self

03:24.210 --> 03:28.940
and alferd of search for the Codex femia style sheet.

03:32.320 --> 03:33.820
So it's a top link we need.

03:33.820 --> 03:39.430
But if you just click the jump to Feme style she and this will jump to the part of the page that we

03:39.430 --> 03:40.490
need.

03:40.660 --> 03:47.050
So under the Feme style she had in her press gives us a sample of the comment that it needs to include

03:47.050 --> 03:49.360
at the top of the style of C S S.

03:49.720 --> 03:54.950
So let's copy that sample and then paste that in at the top of our style sheet.

03:56.520 --> 03:58.350
So let's get rid of this sidebar.

03:58.430 --> 04:05.280
We can start editing the information so right at the very top under the Feme name when our Feme name

04:05.280 --> 04:10.290
him which is tranquil w.p..

04:10.920 --> 04:14.710
And then the theme website so you can put in anything you want in there for now.

04:14.940 --> 04:17.310
So if you put something in jerrycan there for now.

04:17.490 --> 04:20.460
So a tranquil spa Feme.

04:21.530 --> 04:22.280
Dot com.

04:23.390 --> 04:25.090
And the offer.

04:25.660 --> 04:28.290
Don't put your name in or the naming company.

04:32.200 --> 04:34.530
And if you've got a website you can also put that in there.

04:39.120 --> 04:41.410
And then you can put in a description for the Feme.

04:41.580 --> 04:44.990
So I'm going to put in a fully responsive.

04:49.510 --> 04:51.290
Wordpress laffin.

04:54.740 --> 04:56.720
Built using bootstrap free.

05:03.040 --> 05:10.490
So the Virgin can leave up point zero and the licence we can leave when a change some of the times.

05:11.870 --> 05:17.880
Now bear in mind that the tags that were put in the stylesheet we can't put in any time that we choose.

05:17.890 --> 05:22.500
They've got to be WordPress approved tags which you can find in the codex.

05:22.550 --> 05:25.900
So for now I'm going to add the right sidebar.

05:30.360 --> 05:34.560
Now these are separate by commerce so responsive lay out.

05:43.160 --> 05:44.220
Custom header.

05:47.530 --> 05:49.430
And custom menu.

05:52.710 --> 05:54.410
Featured images.

05:56.620 --> 05:57.470
And then in the end.

05:57.470 --> 05:59.000
Translation ready.

05:59.020 --> 06:01.440
Now some of these you may not understand what the arbour.

06:01.480 --> 06:05.730
As we go through the course you'll understand more and more of what each one of these is will be adding

06:05.770 --> 06:11.620
things such as featured images and will make the theme ready for people to translate into different

06:11.620 --> 06:12.310
languages.

06:12.310 --> 06:13.320
If they want to.

06:13.870 --> 06:17.620
So the text the main We're going to make it the same as alfi name.

06:17.620 --> 06:23.230
So that's going to be tranquil w.p. and we'll use that later on in this course we'll make in the Feme

06:23.230 --> 06:27.860
ready for translation and we can delete the information at the bottom.

06:30.080 --> 06:33.540
I know that's all we need to include in the stylesheet for now.

06:33.880 --> 06:34.200
Okay.

06:34.220 --> 06:35.460
And save that.

06:35.790 --> 06:40.770
And if we go back to our theme folder which is in Haiti docs.

06:43.000 --> 06:50.770
Then open opening go again to were press contant themes and tranquil w.p. and the last thing we need

06:50.770 --> 06:58.420
to do before we activate offie in wordpress is if we go to the images folder in our custom theme and

06:58.420 --> 07:04.030
if we locate the screenshot dot PMG we need to move this over.

07:05.530 --> 07:10.060
One level into the same directory as we moved our stylesheet into before.

07:10.770 --> 07:13.240
And then if we go to a web browser.

07:15.140 --> 07:17.800
And then back to our Were press dashboard.

07:18.200 --> 07:24.760
So for go to the tranquil spa in the corner and hover over and then click on the dashboard.

07:28.200 --> 07:33.600
Basically the dashboard is really simple to use on the left hand side we've got a list of all the links

07:33.630 --> 07:39.800
wolken our various posts pages are making change things such as the themes.

07:39.840 --> 07:43.980
So if you go in to the appearance and select themes.

07:47.270 --> 07:54.300
So as you can see active is the 2015 theme but we want to use the tranquil spa theme that we just created.

07:54.590 --> 08:00.910
So if all goes well you should see your appearance on this page and then click on activate.

08:02.770 --> 08:08.170
So now if you click on the home icon in the top left and visit site.

08:09.650 --> 08:14.580
Okay so hopefully that's all one wealthy you and you feel you should now be activated as you can see

08:14.590 --> 08:15.410
it's all working.

08:15.420 --> 08:20.360
But still a lot of work that needs to be done to make it look like old bootstrap template.

08:20.670 --> 08:24.350
So let's start by adding some of the folders that we need.

08:24.360 --> 08:31.680
So back in to our theme folder in the hate docs one thing you may want to do is set up a short cuts

08:32.130 --> 08:37.800
on your desktop or if you use in much can add one of the coloured tigers so you don't need to go through

08:37.800 --> 08:40.890
the process of finding every time.

08:40.920 --> 08:42.570
So mump.

08:44.570 --> 08:56.050
And then hasted arcs tranquil wpe Content themes and then tranquil w.p. So for this tranquil folder.

08:57.020 --> 08:59.270
I'm going to create the blue tigg.

09:01.070 --> 09:07.550
So can you select the Blue and find it a lot faster if you use in a Windows machine you may want to

09:07.580 --> 09:09.460
save a shortcut on your desktop.

09:09.840 --> 09:17.900
Okay so we need to add a few more basic files in total folder so if we go over two brackets and bring

09:17.900 --> 09:23.170
out the sidebar when a press command and N to create a new page.

09:23.420 --> 09:27.860
So the first page we need to add is the header doppie HP.

09:29.780 --> 09:33.310
So just say that as header dot page B.

09:33.950 --> 09:37.060
And make sure that's included in our custom theme.

09:39.190 --> 09:41.750
Along with the index page.

09:42.100 --> 09:50.450
So save that for now and then another new page and save this as the footer doppie HP.

09:59.270 --> 10:00.530
Then just two more to create.

10:00.730 --> 10:06.110
So the next one is going to be for the sidebar and let's save the sidebar doppie HP.

10:08.070 --> 10:12.440
And was a shock at this time I'd say that even with the index page.

10:14.540 --> 10:18.390
And then lastly the last file we're going to save is for the functions.

10:18.430 --> 10:19.870
So a new page.

10:20.780 --> 10:28.540
And save up as functions doppie HP game making sure it's in the right location.

10:33.250 --> 10:35.910
Okay so that's it for now and we'll see in the next video.
