WEBVTT

00:01.760 --> 00:04.720
So our custom WordPress Theme is stanes take shape.

00:04.720 --> 00:10.200
Now one of the main problems that we can see is that the images that were included in the bootstrap

00:10.220 --> 00:15.400
template aren't appear in any Wordpress site so we need to fix that now.

00:15.440 --> 00:20.120
So to start with the majority of the images are in the index page.

00:20.210 --> 00:22.800
So head over to indexed of p p.

00:24.090 --> 00:28.220
So to get the images to appear and we need to correctly change the file path.

00:28.620 --> 00:33.520
So the first one is in the welcome section and this is the divider purple.

00:33.720 --> 00:36.570
So inside the image soss.

00:37.500 --> 00:41.750
When to start the HP tags open and close and tags.

00:43.100 --> 00:47.610
And then we use the same function that we use to include the file path for the CSA.

00:47.900 --> 00:48.970
So eco.

00:50.910 --> 00:52.480
Escape you are real.

00:53.630 --> 00:57.350
And then in brackets we'll get the template.

00:59.630 --> 01:03.660
On the score directory underscore you are right.

01:05.090 --> 01:06.650
Then a pair of brackets.

01:07.750 --> 01:10.070
The make you put the semicolon at the end again.

01:10.980 --> 01:12.720
So it just open up the sidebar.

01:12.780 --> 01:19.290
So again the template directory you are right which is our theme folder and then would include any image

01:19.300 --> 01:22.080
use folder which is in the root directory.

01:22.340 --> 01:28.370
So make sure that you've got a slush just before there because that isn't added in automatically.

01:28.860 --> 01:33.000
So let's just save that and check the work and before we go any further.

01:34.750 --> 01:36.860
So there's a purple image.

01:37.190 --> 01:39.230
So let's just copy this to save a lot.

01:39.230 --> 01:40.020
Type in.

01:42.410 --> 01:49.960
So just copy everything from the forward slash before the images folder up to the organ and page peetz.

01:50.840 --> 01:57.790
And then go onto the facilities section and then just paste this before each one of the images.

01:59.590 --> 02:08.030
So the make up the candles the lake image and the pool.

02:10.150 --> 02:14.140
And then we have the silver image in the latest Office section.

02:14.550 --> 02:15.700
So paste that in.

02:19.470 --> 02:22.260
Scroll thurbert answer was any moment to change.

02:23.490 --> 02:26.320
That's one more image in the shop online section.

02:27.100 --> 02:30.840
So let's save that and see how Let's look in and refresh the browser.

02:31.790 --> 02:34.300
So again somewhere now let's look in better.

02:34.580 --> 02:37.240
So we need to include the main buckram an image book.

02:37.250 --> 02:40.760
But in the header so will do that now.

02:41.420 --> 02:43.400
So in the heading copy HP.

02:46.020 --> 02:53.460
Scored after the feature section and paste that in front of the lakeside image and then save and then

02:53.460 --> 02:54.360
refresh that.

02:56.040 --> 02:57.210
Good so we somewhere.

02:57.230 --> 03:00.780
Now let's scroll down to the footer section.

03:02.310 --> 03:08.160
So just a couple of images we need to include the footer section which is the divider image and also

03:08.160 --> 03:16.610
the shop online buckstone Image silly footer doppie HP and scroll up for the divider.

03:18.270 --> 03:24.500
So paste that in and save then refresh says.

03:24.510 --> 03:27.920
Divide image and then as just the shop online section.

03:27.920 --> 03:32.150
Image and were added this as a background image in the CSA.

03:32.490 --> 03:38.380
So head over to the style dotsie assess and then scroll down to the shop online section.

03:44.050 --> 03:49.320
Are this to work correctly and WordPress will need to delete the slush on the 2..

03:49.700 --> 03:51.190
So save that.

03:53.540 --> 03:54.140
Then refresh.

03:54.140 --> 03:59.540
Thus the image appeared in the background would you need to make sure the shop online but urn is below

03:59.540 --> 04:00.680
the divider.

04:00.680 --> 04:02.500
So I think we're missing a break tag.

04:02.820 --> 04:04.850
Spike to the index page.

04:05.030 --> 04:10.100
We've got the head in the neat divide image and then the button straight after.

04:10.310 --> 04:17.590
So you can add break tigg into there and then refresh and hopefully that should work that's great.

04:18.260 --> 04:20.640
No ago that's working perfectly now.

04:22.030 --> 04:25.280
So I think that's all the image you've covered in the next page.

04:26.780 --> 04:29.930
Scroll up and down and see if anything is missing.

04:30.030 --> 04:32.760
Great home page now looks as it should do.

04:32.780 --> 04:38.370
We've got all the images now in place and it looked exactly like the bootstrap template that we've created.

04:40.420 --> 04:42.990
So thanks for watching and we'll see in the next video.
