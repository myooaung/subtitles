Welcome back.

00:02.070 --> 00:07.530
In this video I'm going to show you a couple of starter themes which are really useful to give you a

00:07.530 --> 00:08.530
good head start.

00:08.640 --> 00:14.670
When buildon WordPress seems sell for this class we've built everything from scratch and that's really

00:14.670 --> 00:20.450
a great way to get started and to understand what goes on when building the word pressfield.

00:20.730 --> 00:25.760
However if we build in lots of themes I would just want to get a jumpstart on development.

00:25.770 --> 00:31.860
It's a good idea to start with a word press start a theme on a couple of popular songs are underscores

00:31.920 --> 00:36.270
and bones so a starter theme is pretty much what it sounds like.

00:36.330 --> 00:42.160
It's not the finished end product which you can download off places like feen forest or the WordPress

00:42.180 --> 00:43.040
home page.

00:43.200 --> 00:50.700
It's just the theme in its most basic so char's all the necessary files and folders and a lot of the

00:50.700 --> 00:57.570
requie were press functions such as The Loop and all the templates and the really easy to get started

00:57.570 --> 01:03.900
would solve for the underscores Feme we can click on the Advanced Options an end to simply generate

01:03.900 --> 01:05.270
the theme folder.

01:05.280 --> 01:10.560
All we need to do is add the information such as our theme name and also some of the information like

01:10.560 --> 01:17.070
the log and author which we put into the common section in the E C S S template and then we just hit

01:17.070 --> 01:24.700
generate and can download that and is also a option to add SAS instead of the standard C S S.

01:25.080 --> 01:29.940
So when of a popular theme as well as underscores is the bone star theme.

01:31.010 --> 01:32.290
And just like underscores.

01:32.290 --> 01:38.370
It's free to download and it's real a popular starter theme for word pressfield developers and it is

01:38.400 --> 01:39.480
really worth taking a look at.

01:39.480 --> 01:43.660
If you are planning to build morphemes are built homes for a living.

01:44.010 --> 01:49.810
But one thing to take into consideration when using bowls is they use these just by default.

01:49.810 --> 01:55.670
So if you not too comfortable with us you may need to brush up on that or use a different staff theme.

01:55.830 --> 02:01.140
So just give me a better idea of what's included and which go on to download this theme and then will

02:01.140 --> 02:03.770
take a look at the content and see what's inside.

02:05.610 --> 02:08.270
So it should be is it file so just on if that.

02:08.670 --> 02:10.090
And then if we open it up.

02:15.780 --> 02:16.010
So.

02:16.020 --> 02:19.560
Okay so we've got the likes of the four or four page.

02:20.010 --> 02:26.880
Go to the archives page and things such as the comments the functions the prebuilt index page and the

02:26.940 --> 02:33.430
header and footer as well as many of the pages that we've been creating such as the search page.

02:33.430 --> 02:40.930
The sidebar the single to HP and the style sheets and the whole thing is designed to be customized.

02:41.010 --> 02:46.020
So I would encourage just to use this as the basic starter and then build from there.

02:46.020 --> 02:48.270
So I'll take a look at the index page.

02:49.580 --> 02:51.390
Open it up in your text editor.

02:53.450 --> 02:55.730
You know it's a lot of this is quite familiar.

02:55.820 --> 03:01.430
So I've got the get header peer to peer the top and right at the very bottom should be the get footer

03:01.910 --> 03:03.380
and the get side bar.

03:05.210 --> 03:09.090
There's also the word press loop which risks your pastor.

03:11.600 --> 03:13.490
So he says the Open a loop.

03:13.550 --> 03:17.200
So if we have posts then the loop contents.

03:18.240 --> 03:21.880
There should be plenty of familiar functions such as the Perman Inc.

03:21.990 --> 03:25.460
The title attribute and the title of the page.

03:27.010 --> 03:28.590
In any content.

03:29.040 --> 03:35.090
So whilst building a field from scratch is a great way to learn and a great way to get started.

03:35.100 --> 03:39.300
It's also worth considering using one a starter themes to save you a lot of work.

03:39.720 --> 03:40.470
So that's it.

03:40.470 --> 03:43.620
So you want to show you a couple of these themes to get started.

03:44.660 --> 03:47.490
There's plenty more out there if these two don't suit your needs.

03:47.510 --> 03:52.520
Just do a quick Google search for word pressed out of themes so hold that give me something to think

03:52.520 --> 03:53.110
about.

03:53.360 --> 03:54.080
Thanks for watching.

03:54.140 --> 03:55.060
I'll see you soon.
