WEBVTT

00:02.470 --> 00:05.700
So in our blog page we've got the short and darm posts.

00:05.860 --> 00:12.820
And in this video I want to make sure that if we click on the Read More button on the title that this

00:12.820 --> 00:19.300
links to a page which is going to show the full length post I would do that by creating a template called

00:19.300 --> 00:20.020
single lock.

00:20.090 --> 00:27.040
HP so head over to text editor and create a new page and save this.

00:27.790 --> 00:33.160
Our single top piece HP we'd all the rest of the PS HP files.

00:35.550 --> 00:39.510
So were presses two different types of page templates we can use.

00:39.510 --> 00:45.150
There's the single use template which will be used for the contact and above was page.

00:45.150 --> 00:51.450
And that's only going to be used on one particular page or it is also a global template which is a bit

00:51.450 --> 00:56.680
of a more general template and we need to put a comment at the top of the page.

00:57.060 --> 01:02.810
So the single page is going to be loosely based on our blog page so we can reuse a lot of the content.

01:03.060 --> 01:11.030
So copy the content from the index page and paste this into the single page.

01:13.040 --> 01:16.170
Because this is going to be a global template.

01:16.460 --> 01:18.300
We need to add a comment to the top.

01:19.400 --> 01:21.450
Tell WordPress the name of the template.

01:21.950 --> 01:23.720
So I read the comments.

01:27.600 --> 01:33.060
So it's got to be the name of templates that's going to be single post template.

01:39.890 --> 01:45.650
So this will have some of the same functionality as the blog page but we're just one or two little changes

01:46.160 --> 01:52.940
for example in the blog page we have the title link to the full post but we don't want that because

01:52.940 --> 02:00.830
were already on full post so let's remove the hyperlink So surrounding the title remove the hyperlink

02:00.920 --> 02:07.420
so the clothes in a tag can also remove the title attribute the Permal link.

02:07.610 --> 02:10.370
And on the way to the open in a tag.

02:12.030 --> 02:13.000
So save that.

02:13.890 --> 02:17.260
And head over to the blog and click on one of the blog posts.

02:19.850 --> 02:22.180
This is the single page that we're now working on.

02:22.340 --> 02:25.990
And we're still needs our detai all to the top of the page.

02:26.130 --> 02:29.930
So now you can see it one click on the link at the top.

02:29.930 --> 02:31.020
It's no longer a link.

02:31.040 --> 02:37.860
It's just the blog site all our money to change the shortened version of the post to be the full length.

02:37.860 --> 02:38.860
And we do that.

02:39.610 --> 02:43.660
By changing the excerpt back to the content.

02:45.350 --> 02:51.660
So save that and then refresh and then got this full length of the post.

02:51.980 --> 02:56.990
So next I want to head over to the style sheet and other little that line height in just to create some

02:56.990 --> 03:00.890
space between the tags the category and the text below.

03:01.310 --> 03:11.220
So we go over to the style that CSA us and copy a comments I want to paste it just below the blog sidebar.

03:11.310 --> 03:14.170
He baltimore's you contact us.

03:14.330 --> 03:18.050
I'll put it just before the mobile style am so peyster.

03:18.410 --> 03:22.180
I will call this the blog single post.

03:26.110 --> 03:27.180
Let's just take a look at the class.

03:27.190 --> 03:29.420
We need to target here.

03:29.560 --> 03:32.020
So if you go into the next page.

03:33.360 --> 03:35.970
So once it stands to the Tigers and the category.

03:39.160 --> 03:43.810
So the class which around those is blog post matter.

03:43.810 --> 03:48.790
And I've just noticed as a little mistake there we need to move the clothes and tag.

03:51.170 --> 03:56.950
To actually start before the tags and category and then end just afterwards.

03:58.880 --> 04:01.660
Why's that won't work so anxious.

04:01.670 --> 04:02.520
Put that in.

04:05.580 --> 04:06.520
And saved that.

04:06.540 --> 04:10.250
So back to the style sheet and then paste in the class.

04:11.380 --> 04:14.720
Dog gets put a dot in front of it because it's a class.

04:16.190 --> 04:21.770
And then it's online space in with the line high property of two Ms.

04:22.860 --> 04:25.170
And let's refresh the browser and see how that's lueken.

04:26.760 --> 04:27.840
That still hasn't changed.

04:27.850 --> 04:29.650
There's still a problem somewhere.

04:30.120 --> 04:32.420
So if we just take a look.

04:34.450 --> 04:43.160
I ask because we've changed the clause and paragraph type on the index page but not done in the single

04:43.160 --> 04:44.430
dot page piece.

04:44.840 --> 04:46.860
So had to single copy 8 p.

04:48.470 --> 04:50.850
And then just move the clause and Pete.

04:52.680 --> 04:54.750
Put this after the category.

05:01.470 --> 05:01.710
Okay.

05:01.710 --> 05:03.900
And save that Nettie let's work now.

05:05.050 --> 05:05.240
OK.

05:05.260 --> 05:07.330
I think that's work and we're just missing the Tigers off there.

05:07.330 --> 05:13.020
Just because an office that post has got any tigers which it doesn't sulpher try the August newsletter

05:13.030 --> 05:13.520
one.

05:15.300 --> 05:17.800
I've got the tags which need to add abrade Saigon to there.

05:18.160 --> 05:24.590
So just after the offer and after the close and a tag I had a break tag.

05:26.080 --> 05:26.440
And help.

05:26.430 --> 05:32.830
That should solve all no great subtle look a lot better we've now got some line height between the Tigers

05:32.830 --> 05:33.900
and the categories.

05:34.090 --> 05:35.800
So that's looking good now.

05:36.310 --> 05:39.150
Okay so then if gold down the page a little bit more.

05:39.310 --> 05:42.940
Can also remove the read more button because we don't need that.

05:43.040 --> 05:49.110
If I can move the whole of the link and pull up a little bit more and save.

05:50.740 --> 05:51.950
And then refresh that.

05:52.500 --> 05:53.520
And there we go.

05:53.520 --> 05:56.500
That's the Read More button removed.

05:56.500 --> 06:02.020
So one thing we need to be conscious of when building were pressed seems is that sometimes users can

06:02.110 --> 06:08.670
upload posts which are really long hours in only five paragraphs so it looks quite good on the page.

06:08.710 --> 06:14.850
Boy if somebody uploads a really long post may want to split it up into different pages so maybe want

06:14.850 --> 06:19.120
to add a pager with previous and next on at the end of the post.

06:19.720 --> 06:21.300
Just to split it up a little bit.

06:21.610 --> 06:25.500
And the way we can do that is we could allow users to put a brake take in.

06:25.590 --> 06:31.070
So if we choose a blog post or just choose one that we're on now which is yogas newsletter.

06:32.260 --> 06:38.620
If we just choose a point in which you want ARDS a pager we can add a comment in there which is the

06:38.620 --> 06:43.410
same as a hate Jamal comment which says next page.

06:46.980 --> 06:50.230
I'm going to copy this and paste it in one more time.

06:53.690 --> 06:55.310
And then update that post.

06:58.110 --> 06:59.290
And back to the site.

07:01.490 --> 07:03.000
OK so let's take a look at that.

07:03.260 --> 07:05.920
So now we've got our blog post appear on.

07:05.990 --> 07:11.320
It's cut off after two paragraphs where we'll put the next page break point which is great.

07:11.330 --> 07:16.670
So next we need to just add a pager onto the bottom of the posts which will allow us to skip to the

07:16.670 --> 07:18.060
next page.

07:18.110 --> 07:23.440
I can do that in the single doppie HP and adeste just below the content.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.960
So open up the page B.

07:28.770 --> 07:35.720
And then the WordPress function that will add in WP underscore link underscore pages.

07:38.420 --> 07:44.240
Brackets and semicolon and save and refresh the blog page.

07:44.240 --> 07:47.510
So now we can see at the bottom we've got the number of pages.

07:47.510 --> 07:49.650
So want to and free.

07:50.180 --> 07:52.700
And they all appeal to a working correctly.

07:58.050 --> 08:03.420
So the plussing want to do is add a pager onto the bottom of the post so you can skip to the next or

08:03.420 --> 08:05.960
the previous post if you want to.

08:06.390 --> 08:13.460
So buckin single copy HP go in onto the pager and instead of say in next posts.

08:13.610 --> 08:15.550
Just take the s off the end.

08:15.660 --> 08:18.800
Another link to the previous or the next post.

08:18.820 --> 08:21.290
We don't need the text inside the brackets.

08:23.670 --> 08:29.520
Because the name of the post is put in would were pressed dynamically to save that and then refresh.

08:31.330 --> 08:37.800
So now we've got the August newsletter and D were going to the previous or the next post just by clicking

08:37.800 --> 08:39.310
on the buttons at the bottom.

08:41.610 --> 08:47.250
So making good progress and the last thing we need to do is just up the text at the top of the page

08:47.820 --> 08:52.260
for the single post so we'll do that in the functions page again.

08:52.440 --> 08:54.770
I will add another ELSE IF statement.

08:57.420 --> 08:58.820
So elusive.

09:00.700 --> 09:06.480
In fact instead of unknown and you statements on the wheel can just add it onto the whole one.

09:06.480 --> 09:12.820
Just because we're going to use in the same text of tranquil spa official blog so just after is home

09:13.970 --> 09:16.870
were used the two pipes.

09:16.870 --> 09:17.440
Which means.

09:17.480 --> 09:18.620
Or so.

09:18.640 --> 09:23.810
If were on the home page or the page is single.

09:27.200 --> 09:32.650
Then print out the text triangles spa official blog so save and refresh.

09:34.010 --> 09:34.540
Okay good.

09:34.550 --> 09:37.680
That's the template finish for the single blog post.

09:37.970 --> 09:42.960
And if you join me in the next video will make it possible for users to add comments to the posts.
