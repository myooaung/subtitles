00:00.970 --> 00:05.080
Welcome back guys in this video I take a look at HP arrays.

00:05.380 --> 00:11.230
So in previous videos we looked at variables which great the saw in data which can be changed.

00:11.440 --> 00:14.020
However they can only hold one value.

00:14.320 --> 00:20.830
But if wanted to store more than one value we need to use an array which can store as many values inside

00:20.830 --> 00:22.310
of that array as we like.

00:23.320 --> 00:27.420
So this is how we create an array use and plan B.

00:28.030 --> 00:35.050
So there's two different methods and one to show you the first one we can set the arrays name just like

00:35.050 --> 00:40.000
a variable name so and create an array of shapes.

00:41.530 --> 00:44.060
And then set this to be an array.

00:44.170 --> 00:50.210
I know need to follow the Reiki word with the code of buckets and then a semicolon.

00:51.670 --> 00:57.330
So all we've done is create a array an empty array with the name of shapes.

00:57.940 --> 01:01.550
Okay so to add some values inside of this empty array.

01:01.990 --> 01:08.260
Let's use the arrays name and then followed by a set of square brackets.

01:08.890 --> 01:11.330
And then when it's put in the index number.

01:11.410 --> 01:16.080
So start with zero which is the first position of an array.

01:16.710 --> 01:21.060
So I want to set this to be the first shape so a square.

01:23.500 --> 01:26.510
So adds the value of square inside the array.

01:27.950 --> 01:29.420
And let's add one or two more.

01:29.950 --> 01:33.010
So shapes an end position 1.

01:35.500 --> 01:37.760
This can be a circle.

01:42.210 --> 01:45.060
And in shapes that is shown to.

01:47.300 --> 01:49.990
So a triangle.

01:51.530 --> 01:57.770
OK so we've set a empty array to either name or shapes and we've added free values to the array of square

01:58.160 --> 01:59.710
circle and triangle.

02:00.730 --> 02:11.260
So to check this is work and we can do a echo so to echo the arrays name of shapes and then the elements

02:11.260 --> 02:13.810
of the array that want to print.

02:13.810 --> 02:16.130
So let's start with it number two.

02:16.720 --> 02:19.770
So you should print out the browser the value or triangle.

02:21.070 --> 02:24.390
So save that and then refresh and never goes.

02:24.400 --> 02:31.660
That's the position number two of the array which has the value of triangle as changes to number one

02:32.530 --> 02:34.950
so should get the circle.

02:35.710 --> 02:39.160
So this is quite a long way of right in an array.

02:39.160 --> 02:41.520
That is a simple way to write an array.

02:43.170 --> 02:46.020
And this is by using the literal method.

02:46.240 --> 02:48.080
So instead of what were done above.

02:48.360 --> 02:52.840
Can set the arrays name of shapes.

02:53.020 --> 02:58.620
I never said that to an array and then put the values straight inside the array.

03:00.120 --> 03:09.180
So first of all put in the square and end separate by commas the circle.

03:12.540 --> 03:14.110
And then the triangle.

03:17.710 --> 03:21.700
And let's just delete this one for now.

03:21.750 --> 03:24.180
I ember can do the echo just as were done before.

03:25.130 --> 03:28.770
Let's echo the name which is shapes.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.690
And in the square rockets again we need to put in the index number.

03:34.690 --> 03:37.680
So let's start with zero which is the square.

03:39.320 --> 03:44.270
So say that and then refreshen will get the value of square.

03:44.540 --> 03:47.570
So even these two methods works perfectly fine.

03:48.290 --> 03:54.020
So a few videos ago we took a look at string functions where we reverse the order of the string and

03:54.020 --> 03:59.670
then we changed the text to be uppercase arrays also have similar functions.

03:59.720 --> 04:06.080
And there's a list of available functions are p p donnette but I'm going to go through one or two examples

04:06.470 --> 04:09.740
just to show you what we can do with array functions.

04:09.800 --> 04:15.940
So the first one is the count function which counts the number of items inside the array.

04:16.280 --> 04:23.520
So we use the CAN'T function and there will put the arrays name inside of brackets.

04:23.950 --> 04:25.660
So when to lead the zero.

04:27.230 --> 04:31.870
So should echo to the browser the number of items inside the shape's array.

04:32.870 --> 04:34.370
Cell refresh.

04:34.370 --> 04:36.340
So the free items inside the array.

04:37.480 --> 04:45.400
There's also various functions such as the array pop which removes returns the very last item from the

04:45.400 --> 04:46.540
end of an array.

04:47.530 --> 04:51.720
So to do this one create one more variable.

04:52.030 --> 04:58.220
And I'm going to call it the last shape so the mushaima Want to grab is a triangle.

04:59.720 --> 05:08.000
So to grab the value of this when it's set is value to be equal to array underscore pop.

05:09.860 --> 05:16.970
And then to grab the value of triangle or the last item which needs put in the name of the array which

05:16.970 --> 05:17.860
is shapes.

05:19.780 --> 05:25.840
So what we've done is we've said the last item on the array inside this variable name.

05:25.970 --> 05:28.670
So now we can just echo these variable names.

05:28.660 --> 05:32.170
The browser and we should get the value of triangle.

05:32.710 --> 05:36.200
So I echo the variable name of lush shape.

05:37.910 --> 05:40.080
And then refresh and then go as such.

05:40.160 --> 05:41.900
The value or triangle.

05:42.830 --> 05:50.420
We can also find the minimum and the maximum value of an array says Create a array with numbers this

05:50.420 --> 05:51.900
time.

05:52.850 --> 05:55.980
So numbers is equal to an array.

05:56.210 --> 05:59.790
I would only put any numbers inside these quotations.

06:02.820 --> 06:04.920
Let's just put some numbers inside there.

06:06.980 --> 06:08.300
An M. can echo.

06:08.620 --> 06:16.850
And if we wanted to find out the largest number we could use the max function and then inside the buckets.

06:16.850 --> 06:20.940
The name of the array which is numbers.

06:21.830 --> 06:26.760
So now we should get printed to the screen the maximum number which is 67.

06:29.950 --> 06:30.690
Which we do.

06:31.910 --> 06:34.140
We can also replace marks.

06:35.120 --> 06:38.640
Women and we should add the value of one.

06:43.550 --> 06:44.000
Okay great.

06:44.030 --> 06:46.520
So that's how you can create an array.

06:46.550 --> 06:51.590
Use and P HP and also some basic P HP array functions.

06:52.440 --> 06:54.530
So thank you and see in the next video.

06:54.630 --> 06:57.480
Well take a look up HP functions.
