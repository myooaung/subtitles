00:01.060 --> 00:02.070
Welcome back.

00:02.080 --> 00:08.520
Earlier on in the course we created the Contact Us page and the link is down at the bottom in the footer.

00:08.710 --> 00:10.620
If we go into the Contact Us page.

00:10.750 --> 00:14.790
We've still got the boot design at the very bottom for the.

00:14.800 --> 00:20.420
Send us a message section but it doesn't actually work at the minute because it's just hate Jamal and

00:20.550 --> 00:21.290
yes.

00:21.550 --> 00:26.710
So in this video we're going to make sure that this works by using a popular plug in called contact

00:26.710 --> 00:27.660
form 7.

00:28.480 --> 00:32.870
So you go over to the dashboard and select the plug ins.

00:33.790 --> 00:38.080
And then in this search box sorry go to add new first.

00:40.250 --> 00:44.630
In the search box search for contacts form 7.

00:47.130 --> 00:53.030
And contact form semon is one of the most popular WordPress plugins for cring contact forms.

00:53.080 --> 00:54.760
So hit install now.

00:57.960 --> 01:00.040
And she got a few moments to install.

01:01.360 --> 01:03.060
Knowing or to activate again.

01:05.850 --> 01:06.070
OK.

01:06.140 --> 01:11.710
So once you got that installed you should now see that there's a new option in the dashboard called

01:11.720 --> 01:12.800
contact.

01:12.800 --> 01:13.950
So click on that.

01:14.920 --> 01:19.230
And by default there's already one contact form there as an example.

01:19.240 --> 01:21.670
So click on EDIT take a look.

01:21.770 --> 01:22.920
Oh it's constructed.

01:23.320 --> 01:26.560
So this section here is going to be our contact form.

01:26.560 --> 01:31.450
So in just a moment I'm going to head over to the conductor's template and then when to cut out the

01:31.510 --> 01:37.700
contact section and paste it in money to replace some of the values in the form using the same format

01:37.720 --> 01:40.680
in that the contact form requires.

01:40.690 --> 01:47.500
So when working on this form each one of the sections is a particular input and we need to put the input

01:47.500 --> 01:52.750
type and also the rest of the information between the two square brackets.

01:52.750 --> 01:56.080
So to start would Let's take a look at the first example.

01:56.110 --> 02:04.300
So this will create a inputs with the type of text and then follow by the Star and The Star means that

02:04.300 --> 02:05.740
this is required.

02:06.820 --> 02:13.480
So the user must enter the name before the can submit that and then your name which is the name of the

02:13.480 --> 02:17.840
input and then pretty similar examples below.

02:17.930 --> 02:25.680
We've got the type of the input type of e-mail which is a required field and the name is your email.

02:25.760 --> 02:31.770
We can also add various other inputs such as text areas and submit buttons.

02:31.870 --> 02:39.370
So I'm just going to delete this for now and then I want to go over to our kondik page.

02:39.760 --> 02:42.580
So we need to go to the page contact or pay HP.

02:44.060 --> 02:49.160
And then were going to copy the full section for the contact form and then look for the div with the

02:49.160 --> 02:52.160
class of well which is right at the bottom.

02:52.160 --> 02:57.640
So look for that and find the close and div the claws and tag.

02:57.860 --> 02:59.340
So copy all this action.

03:01.420 --> 03:07.960
In fact and cut that out because we don't need it anymore and say that and I can paste this into the

03:08.020 --> 03:08.930
conduct form.

03:10.330 --> 03:17.680
So the first thing to do is delete the form tags because these are added buckin automatically so delete

03:17.680 --> 03:19.820
the opening on the closing time.

03:20.320 --> 03:24.820
And then we need to replace our input types.

03:24.820 --> 03:30.880
So just delete the full input section first of all for the name and then we'll put these buckin in the

03:30.880 --> 03:34.570
same format as we're looked up before in the example.

03:34.570 --> 03:41.410
So between the square brackets the first one has a type of text message for the name so we want this

03:41.410 --> 03:42.760
to be required.

03:42.790 --> 03:44.170
So put the star in there.

03:45.420 --> 03:47.720
The name of your hyphen name.

03:49.020 --> 03:50.900
Then we need to put our classes back in.

03:51.090 --> 03:53.380
So the class and then a colon.

03:53.690 --> 03:57.840
And the first one is gonna be form control.

04:01.290 --> 04:03.480
It also had an idea in there.

04:04.200 --> 04:09.350
So I deal with the call on of inputs for name.

04:10.310 --> 04:16.900
I'm can also add the place all the text so place although we don't need to call on after that so just

04:16.910 --> 04:21.600
to base them between the quotes but the name of name.

04:22.480 --> 04:24.760
That's all we need to do for the name input.

04:25.000 --> 04:32.020
So I'm going to copy this and then go down to the next impot which is the email.

04:32.290 --> 04:33.450
So delete that.

04:34.350 --> 04:38.070
And then replace up with the code in square brackets.

04:38.130 --> 04:39.800
So this time instead of text.

04:39.800 --> 04:42.790
This is not the type of email.

04:43.080 --> 04:48.950
I will also leave this out required the name mistime is going to be your email.

04:49.560 --> 04:51.990
Almost only the class of form control.

04:51.990 --> 05:01.470
But this time it is going to be imports hyphen email and the place all the text is simply e-mail.

05:03.590 --> 05:11.430
Next we'll replace the text area so delete that section and then paste in the new code that this time

05:12.030 --> 05:18.460
the input type is going to be textarea will leave this field as required.

05:18.690 --> 05:22.690
But this time change your name to your message.

05:23.880 --> 05:32.400
The class of form control will can keep that there but when it changes the input from input name to

05:32.430 --> 05:33.730
input message.

05:34.690 --> 05:40.600
Then after that we need to tell the form harmony lines for the textarea to display as default.

05:40.900 --> 05:47.690
So when I set mine to free do that would within X and then free and the place all the text.

05:47.800 --> 05:50.160
James from name to message.

05:50.980 --> 05:57.730
And then the last part of the form is the input so delete the submit button from the bottom of the form.

05:58.890 --> 06:04.700
Then open up the square brackets so one side will give the type of Submit.

06:06.030 --> 06:13.700
The class is going to be the bootstrap class of beat and then the second class of beat again.

06:14.930 --> 06:16.460
Hyphen default.

06:16.960 --> 06:22.200
So they're the same as were used in the bootstrap site and then the text in brackets of Submit.

06:24.360 --> 06:26.480
Okay so save that.

06:26.910 --> 06:33.030
Because we've taken the contact form out of the page template or the contact template we need to put

06:33.030 --> 06:34.290
this back in.

06:34.290 --> 06:42.850
So if you copy the short code so copy that part then head back over to the page contacts doppie HP and

06:42.960 --> 06:48.060
in the same section that just could the code of open up the page B.

06:49.330 --> 06:50.870
And then we echo to the browser.

06:52.780 --> 06:55.760
Do underscore short code.

06:57.240 --> 07:04.040
Then in the brackets and the quotations paste in the short code and say look.

07:04.170 --> 07:10.290
So now if we go back in to the WERE press site and hopefully if you go in on to the contact page we

07:10.290 --> 07:13.510
should see the contact form or working correctly.

07:15.760 --> 07:17.490
Which is good.

07:17.650 --> 07:23.350
So that's all displayed fine as one or two little things means change in the dashboard so go to the

07:23.410 --> 07:30.640
contact section again so to actually get this form to send to the website administrator.

07:30.670 --> 07:37.180
We need to put in the email address to send to and that can be done in the contact form under the mail

07:37.180 --> 07:37.760
tab.

07:38.990 --> 07:44.340
Could change the default values and said The email address Id like the messages to come through to.

07:44.600 --> 07:50.270
You can also go in the messages section and you can change the messages that the user gets wants to

07:50.270 --> 07:54.410
send emails and is dph all values already set in there.

07:54.500 --> 07:59.620
But these are all available to change so once you've changed it save.

08:01.250 --> 08:01.870
And that's it.

08:01.870 --> 08:05.070
And now we have a fully functional Contact Us section.

08:05.090 --> 08:07.570
So thanks for watching and we'll see in the next video.
