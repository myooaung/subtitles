00:01.990 --> 00:08.230
OK it's on the last couple of videos we've looked at advanced custom fields and we've allowed the administrator

00:08.650 --> 00:14.790
to change certain things such as the text on the website and in this video we're going to make our website

00:14.830 --> 00:22.640
even more customizable by allowing the admin or certain user to change the background featured image.

00:22.840 --> 00:25.220
We don't known how to code.

00:25.240 --> 00:29.470
Wordpress allows us to do this in what they call custom headers.

00:29.470 --> 00:35.590
So if you go over to Google and search for the code x custom headers.

00:40.400 --> 00:42.610
It should be the first result.

00:43.040 --> 00:43.250
OK.

00:43.260 --> 00:50.440
It's against the custom had this section and then FUI scrawled on page and look for the example.

00:50.510 --> 00:58.910
So copy this example and then go into the functions not P A B and this can go right at the very bottom

01:00.200 --> 01:03.130
but still would in the e 8 Peter Higgs.

01:04.540 --> 01:06.600
So we're not going to have the fix.

01:06.970 --> 01:10.260
So we can remove that or the fixed height.

01:10.420 --> 01:12.610
So I'm going to comment these two lines.

01:13.850 --> 01:18.630
No got the default image path in case the user doesn't upload an image.

01:19.100 --> 01:22.180
So the default image is going to be the lake B.

01:22.190 --> 01:22.870
G.

01:25.450 --> 01:27.660
Natalie no images folder so that's okay.

01:30.170 --> 01:32.400
So say that and Shawn.

01:32.420 --> 01:36.460
One more thing into the array which is uploads.

01:36.800 --> 01:41.590
So this allows the user to upload an image so uploads.

01:43.780 --> 01:45.430
Equal to a great line.

01:45.910 --> 01:48.400
And that's gonna be a boulis of true.

01:48.760 --> 01:55.590
And then if we go into the had a doppie HP we can change the image location so find that file.

01:56.640 --> 02:00.560
Scroll down to the feature section at the bottom.

02:02.190 --> 02:06.950
And you can delete the image source so everything between the double quotations.

02:07.000 --> 02:12.530
So rather than have in this image which had been pulled in from I will feed folder.

02:12.680 --> 02:14.190
Can use the custom had a.

02:14.650 --> 02:22.790
So between the page Pete's eyes were yousee were Press function of header underscore image.

02:25.020 --> 02:27.300
And save that and then go forwards.

02:27.330 --> 02:29.230
The word press dashboard.

02:32.240 --> 02:33.560
Down to appearance.

02:33.740 --> 02:35.060
And then customize.

02:37.430 --> 02:39.210
And then select the header image.

02:40.740 --> 02:42.630
And we can add a new image.

02:43.970 --> 02:48.060
So this is the post for mail so I will upload a new image.

02:48.860 --> 02:53.740
So in your images folder there's a second background in there which is Lake b.g. too.

02:54.110 --> 02:56.060
So select that aren't open.

02:58.560 --> 03:02.330
And then put in the old text of Lake background.

03:03.160 --> 03:04.500
Then select that.

03:06.730 --> 03:07.570
Skip crop.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.550
And then save and publish.

03:13.140 --> 03:18.080
So once I'd saved just tick the X in the corner and then go to his site.

03:19.380 --> 03:21.530
And there's one new image as the background.

03:22.540 --> 03:26.820
So that makes it really easier for the site owners to change the background image.

03:26.960 --> 03:30.960
That just need to go into the dashboard and customize like wouldest did then.

03:32.020 --> 03:34.090
And nutty and this video so thanks for watching.
