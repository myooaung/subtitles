<v Instructor>It's Coding Challenge time again.</v>
2

2

00:00:03,100  -->  00:00:04,610
So here we go.
3

3

00:00:04,610  -->  00:00:06,980
And let's remember the first coding challenge,
4

4

00:00:06,980  -->  00:00:10,770
where Mark and John compared their Body Mass Indexes.
5

5

00:00:10,770  -->  00:00:13,400
So let's now implement the same functionality,
6

6

00:00:13,400  -->  00:00:15,990
but this time with objects and methods.
7

7

00:00:15,990  -->  00:00:18,720
So for each of them, create an object with properties
8

8

00:00:18,720  -->  00:00:21,920
for their full name, mass, and height,
9

9

00:00:21,920  -->  00:00:25,720
then, add a method to each object to calculate the BMI.
10

10

00:00:25,720  -->  00:00:28,620
And what I want you to do here is to both save the BMI
11

11

00:00:28,620  -->  00:00:32,050
to the object and also return it from the method.
12

12

00:00:32,050  -->  00:00:34,590
And then in the end, I want you to log to the console
13

13

00:00:34,590  -->  00:00:37,900
who has the highest BMI, together with the full name
14

14

00:00:37,900  -->  00:00:40,100
and the respective BMI value.
15

15

00:00:40,100  -->  00:00:40,933
All right?
16

16

00:00:40,933  -->  00:00:43,280
And again, don't forget that they actually might
17

17

00:00:43,280  -->  00:00:44,960
have the same BMI.
18

18

00:00:44,960  -->  00:00:47,350
And if you don't remember the formula for calculating
19

19

00:00:47,350  -->  00:00:50,410
the Body Mass Index, then it's down here again.
20

20

00:00:50,410  -->  00:00:52,590
And you can also go back to the other challenge
21

21

00:00:52,590  -->  00:00:54,240
and find the solution there.
22

22

00:00:54,240  -->  00:00:56,670
Just keep in mind the mass has to be in kilogram
23

23

00:00:56,670  -->  00:00:58,840
and the height in meter.
24

24

00:00:58,840  -->  00:00:59,673
Okay?
25

25

00:00:59,673  -->  00:01:02,800
So this, again, is using the knowledge that we just learned
26

26

00:01:02,800  -->  00:01:04,270
in the last two lectures.
27

27

00:01:04,270  -->  00:01:05,950
So I think this is a fun way for you
28

28

00:01:05,950  -->  00:01:08,100
to retain that knowledge immediately.
29

29

00:01:08,100  -->  00:01:11,293
Okay, so good luck, and see you once you're finished.
