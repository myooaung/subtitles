1

00:00:01,240  -->  00:00:03,540
<v Narrator>And finally, here goes the second part</v>
2

2

00:00:03,540  -->  00:00:04,790
of my solution.
3

3

00:00:04,790  -->  00:00:07,630
And we left off, after creating the John object,
4

4

00:00:07,630  -->  00:00:10,990
including this huge calcTips method, okay?
5

5

00:00:10,990  -->  00:00:13,930
Now for Mark, this is all going to be very similar
6

6

00:00:13,930  -->  00:00:15,305
and so I'm just going to go at
7

7

00:00:15,305  -->  00:00:17,880
and copy this entire object...
8

8

00:00:19,190  -->  00:00:21,283
And then do some changes to it.
9

9

00:00:22,490  -->  00:00:25,770
So the name, of course, is not John,
10

10

00:00:25,770  -->  00:00:28,250
but Mark and it's Mark Miller.
11

11

00:00:28,250  -->  00:00:33,250
Then this is $77, $475, okay?
12

12

00:00:34,306  -->  00:00:38,190
And 110 and finally, 45.
13

13

00:00:38,190  -->  00:00:41,180
So he only went to four restaurants.
14

14

00:00:41,180  -->  00:00:43,000
Then down here, in the calcTips,
15

15

00:00:43,000  -->  00:00:45,110
all that we have to change is,
16

16

00:00:45,110  -->  00:00:47,500
like these tipping rules, okay?
17

17

00:00:47,500  -->  00:00:50,620
So let's see how Mark does it.
18

18

00:00:50,620  -->  00:00:54,730
So, he liked to tip 20% when the bill is less than $100,
19

19

00:00:54,730  -->  00:00:57,317
10% if it's between 100 and 300,
20

20

00:00:57,317  -->  00:00:59,923
and 25 if it's more than 300.
21

21

00:01:00,980  -->  00:01:03,070
Let's translate that into our code.
22

22

00:01:03,070  -->  00:01:07,140
So here, it's 100, so less than 100 it's 20%,
23

23

00:01:07,140  -->  00:01:08,840
or actually less than 100.
24

24

00:01:08,840  -->  00:01:09,673
Okay?
25

25

00:01:09,673  -->  00:01:13,770
Then if it's between 100 and 300,
26

26

00:01:13,770  -->  00:01:18,770
he gives 10% as a tip and, if it's even greater than 300,
27

27

00:01:19,290  -->  00:01:20,940
then he gives 25.
28

28

00:01:20,940  -->  00:01:23,370
Probably because he's at a very fancy restaurant
29

29

00:01:23,370  -->  00:01:25,531
and then he needs to give more tips.
30

30

00:01:25,531  -->  00:01:26,364
(laughs)
31

31

00:01:26,364  -->  00:01:27,197
Something like that.
32

32

00:01:27,197  -->  00:01:32,083
Okay, so that is the Mark object and it's already done.
33

33

00:01:33,020  -->  00:01:38,020
So let's do the calculation here for Mark as well
34

34

00:01:38,480  -->  00:01:41,543
and then log both John and Mark to the console.
35

35

00:01:43,440  -->  00:01:45,880
So let's check it out.
36

36

00:01:45,880  -->  00:01:50,250
Indeed, here we have our tips and our final values, alright?
37

37

00:01:50,250  -->  00:01:51,330
So this worked.
38

38

00:01:51,330  -->  00:01:54,930
Already we now have the tipping completely implemented
39

39

00:01:54,930  -->  00:01:57,540
for both Mark and John.
40

40

00:01:57,540  -->  00:02:00,800
So let's take a look at what the next step is
41

41

00:02:00,800  -->  00:02:04,230
and it is to create a function to calculate the average
42

42

00:02:04,230  -->  00:02:06,470
of a given array of tips and then, of course,
43

43

00:02:06,470  -->  00:02:09,940
calculate the average for each family using that calculator.
44

44

00:02:09,940  -->  00:02:11,610
Then finally, we can log to the console
45

45

00:02:11,610  -->  00:02:15,220
which of the families paid, on average, the highest tips.
46

46

00:02:15,220  -->  00:02:16,053
Alright?
47

47

00:02:16,053  -->  00:02:17,230
So let's create a function
48

48

00:02:17,230  -->  00:02:20,120
and I'm going to do it here after this object.
49

49

00:02:20,120  -->  00:02:22,493
So, function calcAverage.
50

50

00:02:25,920  -->  00:02:29,440
It's going to receive a tips array, okay?
51

51

00:02:29,440  -->  00:02:32,910
So now I'm going to do what I told you as a hint.
52

52

00:02:32,910  -->  00:02:36,530
So I'm going to start with a variable called sum,
53

53

00:02:36,530  -->  00:02:38,650
which will start at zero, okay?
54

54

00:02:38,650  -->  00:02:42,100
So in the beginning, of course, or sum, is zero.
55

55

00:02:42,100  -->  00:02:45,500
Now what we have to do is to loop over the tips
56

56

00:02:45,500  -->  00:02:46,880
and then, in each iteration,
57

57

00:02:46,880  -->  00:02:49,343
add the current element to the sum.
58

58

00:02:50,360  -->  00:02:51,900
Let's implement that.
59

59

00:02:51,900  -->  00:02:55,630
So before and once more we start
60

60

00:02:55,630  -->  00:02:58,700
with a variable called I at zero,
61

61

00:02:58,700  -->  00:03:03,310
with I less than the tips of length...
62

62

00:03:05,330  -->  00:03:06,820
And then we increment I.
63

63

00:03:06,820  -->  00:03:08,070
So this is pretty standard.
64

64

00:03:08,070  -->  00:03:09,010
You're seeing, at this point,
65

65

00:03:09,010  -->  00:03:11,920
that it's basically always the same here, right?
66

66

00:03:11,920  -->  00:03:15,690
Now, what we do is that we say that the sum
67

67

00:03:15,690  -->  00:03:19,210
should be equal to the current sum,
68

68

00:03:19,210  -->  00:03:22,923
plus the tips and your current position.
69

69

00:03:24,230  -->  00:03:25,063
Okay?
70

70

00:03:25,063  -->  00:03:25,896
Make sense?
71

71

00:03:25,896  -->  00:03:27,370
So let's say that we pass in on the array
72

72

00:03:27,370  -->  00:03:31,150
of two, six, and four.
73

73

00:03:31,150  -->  00:03:31,983
Alright?
74

74

00:03:31,983  -->  00:03:34,360
So in the beginning our sum will be zero
75

75

00:03:34,360  -->  00:03:36,400
and then we will enter the loop.
76

76

00:03:36,400  -->  00:03:39,080
At this point, we have that the sum is zero,
77

77

00:03:39,080  -->  00:03:40,550
plus the current element,
78

78

00:03:40,550  -->  00:03:44,050
which is two and so zero plus two will be two.
79

79

00:03:44,050  -->  00:03:46,520
So the new sum will be two.
80

80

00:03:46,520  -->  00:03:49,120
So let's just write it down here.
81

81

00:03:49,120  -->  00:03:51,380
We start off, of course, with zero.
82

82

00:03:51,380  -->  00:03:54,780
After that, we have two and so the next iteration,
83

83

00:03:54,780  -->  00:03:57,820
we have two here at the sum and then the current element
84

84

00:03:57,820  -->  00:03:59,190
of the loop is six.
85

85

00:03:59,190  -->  00:04:00,580
So this one here, right?
86

86

00:04:00,580  -->  00:04:04,290
So six plus two is then eight, okay?
87

87

00:04:04,290  -->  00:04:07,990
Eight is assigned to that sum of variables, okay?
88

88

00:04:07,990  -->  00:04:10,840
Then in the next iteration sum will be eight
89

89

00:04:10,840  -->  00:04:13,070
and eight plus the current element of the array,
90

90

00:04:13,070  -->  00:04:15,433
which is four, will then finally be 12.
91

91

00:04:16,630  -->  00:04:17,670
Okay?
92

92

00:04:17,670  -->  00:04:18,700
That's it.
93

93

00:04:18,700  -->  00:04:21,130
We went through the entire array and edited all
94

94

00:04:21,130  -->  00:04:22,870
of these elements together and, in the end,
95

95

00:04:22,870  -->  00:04:25,910
we ended up with 12, which of course is the result
96

96

00:04:25,910  -->  00:04:28,420
of adding all of these three together.
97

97

00:04:28,420  -->  00:04:29,720
Okay?
98

98

00:04:29,720  -->  00:04:31,820
That's just an example just to demonstrate
99

99

00:04:31,820  -->  00:04:33,443
how this function works.
100

100

00:04:35,850  -->  00:04:38,521
Okay, so at the end, all we have to do is to return
101

101

00:04:38,521  -->  00:04:43,330
the sum divided by the elements that are in the array.
102

102

00:04:43,330  -->  00:04:45,213
So tips.length.
103

103

00:04:46,310  -->  00:04:47,143
Okay?
104

104

00:04:47,143  -->  00:04:49,060
For example, in the array that we had before,
105

105

00:04:49,060  -->  00:04:53,120
it had three elements and so tips.length would be three.
106

106

00:04:53,120  -->  00:04:55,710
The average would then be 12 divided by three,
107

107

00:04:55,710  -->  00:04:57,330
which would be four.
108

108

00:04:57,330  -->  00:04:58,163
Okay?
109

109

00:04:58,163  -->  00:05:00,068
So that's how you calculate averages.
110

110

00:05:00,068  -->  00:05:03,855
We have now our objects, we have our calcAverage function
111

111

00:05:03,855  -->  00:05:05,955
and so now, let's do all the calculations.
112

112

00:05:08,350  -->  00:05:10,320
We already calculated the tips here,
113

113

00:05:10,320  -->  00:05:12,660
then we logged them through console just to make sure that
114

114

00:05:12,660  -->  00:05:16,744
they are correct, then we can also calculate the average.
115

115

00:05:16,744  -->  00:05:19,120
What we're going to do here is to actually calculate
116

116

00:05:19,120  -->  00:05:21,430
the average and then store them inside
117

117

00:05:21,430  -->  00:05:23,860
of each of the object, okay?
118

118

00:05:23,860  -->  00:05:28,703
I'm going to say John.average is calcAverage,
119

119

00:05:30,280  -->  00:05:33,810
using John.tips, okay?
120

120

00:05:33,810  -->  00:05:35,500
And why John.tips?
121

121

00:05:35,500  -->  00:05:38,460
Well, that's because this is the array in which all
122

122

00:05:38,460  -->  00:05:40,330
of the tips are stored, right?
123

123

00:05:40,330  -->  00:05:43,430
So that is the array that we defined here.
124

124

00:05:43,430  -->  00:05:45,855
So this dot tips, okay?
125

125

00:05:45,855  -->  00:05:48,780
So we patch that into the calcAverage function,
126

126

00:05:48,780  -->  00:05:51,080
which will then return the average and we will store that
127

127

00:05:51,080  -->  00:05:54,090
into the average property on the John object.
128

128

00:05:54,090  -->  00:05:56,480
Now you may ask, well, why didn't we add this
129

129

00:05:56,480  -->  00:06:00,110
calcAverage here as a method to each of the objects?
130

130

00:06:00,110  -->  00:06:01,970
Well, we didn't do that because that would
131

131

00:06:01,970  -->  00:06:05,800
be duplicate code, so we have to have the exact same code
132

132

00:06:05,800  -->  00:06:07,449
on both of these objects.
133

133

00:06:07,449  -->  00:06:09,405
We would basically repeat ourselves
134

134

00:06:09,405  -->  00:06:12,950
with the exact same code and that's not good, okay?
135

135

00:06:12,950  -->  00:06:15,180
So it's best to just leave it outside here,
136

136

00:06:15,180  -->  00:06:17,706
as this function, then calculate it outside
137

137

00:06:17,706  -->  00:06:22,040
and then only then, basically, add it to each object.
138

138

00:06:22,040  -->  00:06:23,480
We do it with John and then
139

139

00:06:23,480  -->  00:06:26,460
we're also going to do it with Mark.
140

140

00:06:26,460  -->  00:06:29,320
Alright, so let's actually do this console log here
141

141

00:06:29,320  -->  00:06:31,220
after that so that we also can see
142

142

00:06:31,220  -->  00:06:33,710
the newly added averages, alright?
143

143

00:06:33,710  -->  00:06:38,050
So let's try that now and, wait, where is it?
144

144

00:06:38,050  -->  00:06:38,883
Here!
145

145

00:06:38,883  -->  00:06:39,716
Here we go.
146

146

00:06:39,716  -->  00:06:40,885
Here's the average of the three
147

147

00:06:40,885  -->  00:06:43,540
or actually the four paid tips.
148

148

00:06:43,540  -->  00:06:47,283
We have these values here and the average of them is 18.
149

149

00:06:48,920  -->  00:06:52,490
In case of Mark, these are the four tips
150

150

00:06:52,490  -->  00:06:54,720
and the average of that is 38,
151

151

00:06:54,720  -->  00:06:56,510
which is significantly higher,
152

152

00:06:56,510  -->  00:07:01,120
simply because of this huge tip here with $118.
153

153

00:07:01,120  -->  00:07:01,953
Alright.
154

154

00:07:02,830  -->  00:07:05,490
These are the calculations for the averages
155

155

00:07:05,490  -->  00:07:09,823
and now all we have to do is to really do the console.log.
156

156

00:07:11,920  -->  00:07:16,920
So if John.average is larger than Mark.average
157

157

00:07:21,890  -->  00:07:26,890
then we can say, console.log of course, so John.FullName,
158

158

00:07:30,980  -->  00:07:34,280
now the escape, in order to escape the quotation here.
159

159

00:07:34,280  -->  00:07:39,280
John's family pays higher tips with an average of,
160

160

00:07:43,820  -->  00:07:46,200
and now the average tip.
161

161

00:07:46,200  -->  00:07:48,450
(clicking)
162

162

00:07:50,780  -->  00:07:51,613
Okay.
163

163

00:07:51,613  -->  00:07:54,460
If it's the other way around, let's just copy it...
164

164

00:07:58,370  -->  00:08:02,488
It's Mark here, so Mark.average is greater
165

165

00:08:02,488  -->  00:08:05,030
than John.average, well then it's,
166

166

00:08:05,030  -->  00:08:07,503
of course, the other way around.
167

167

00:08:10,652  -->  00:08:13,740
Mark and Mark here as well.
168

168

00:08:13,740  -->  00:08:14,730
Alright.
169

169

00:08:14,730  -->  00:08:17,990
That should be our final result and in it,
170

170

00:08:17,990  -->  00:08:19,970
Mark Miller's family pays higher tips
171

171

00:08:19,970  -->  00:08:22,900
with an average of $38.
172

172

00:08:22,900  -->  00:08:23,733
Okay?
173

173

00:08:23,733  -->  00:08:26,270
Just to test this, let's decrease this one here
174

174

00:08:26,270  -->  00:08:29,240
from 110 or, actually, this one here.
175

175

00:08:29,240  -->  00:08:32,823
Let's increase it from 475 to like five bucks.
176

176

00:08:33,870  -->  00:08:36,600
So the average should then decrease and so, yeah,
177

177

00:08:36,600  -->  00:08:39,020
so now John Smith family pays the higher tips,
178

178

00:08:39,020  -->  00:08:40,360
with an average of 18.
179

179

00:08:40,360  -->  00:08:41,390
Alright.
180

180

00:08:41,390  -->  00:08:44,400
That is the solution to this quite bigger
181

181

00:08:44,400  -->  00:08:47,900
and maybe a bit more difficult and confusing challenge,
182

182

00:08:47,900  -->  00:08:49,300
but I hope that you liked it and that you
183

183

00:08:49,300  -->  00:08:51,700
were able to at least do part of it.
184

184

00:08:51,700  -->  00:08:54,300
I understand if you didn't do it all, okay?
185

185

00:08:54,300  -->  00:08:56,170
So that's, again, no problem.
186

186

00:08:56,170  -->  00:08:57,540
You shouldn't feel bad about it.
187

187

00:08:57,540  -->  00:08:59,740
The most important part is that you try it here
188

188

00:08:59,740  -->  00:09:02,820
and that you put in the time to try to solve the challenge.
189

189

00:09:02,820  -->  00:09:05,270
That's really all that matters at this point.
190

190

00:09:05,270  -->  00:09:07,020
I'm serious here, okay?
191

191

00:09:07,020  -->  00:09:09,820
That's really what matters most.
192

192

00:09:09,820  -->  00:09:12,140
Anyway, you're now done with the first
193

193

00:09:12,140  -->  00:09:14,070
JavaScript introduction.
194

194

00:09:14,070  -->  00:09:16,100
Congratulations on that for making it this far
195

195

00:09:16,100  -->  00:09:16,940
in the course.
196

196

00:09:16,940  -->  00:09:19,290
That's already a huge achievement.
197

197

00:09:19,290  -->  00:09:21,730
Now, some JavaScript courses stop at this point
198

198

00:09:21,730  -->  00:09:23,740
and consider that you know enough
199

199

00:09:23,740  -->  00:09:25,350
to write JavaScript on your own.
200

200

00:09:25,350  -->  00:09:28,340
But of course, that's very far from the truth.
201

201

00:09:28,340  -->  00:09:29,240
Now don't get me wrong,
202

202

00:09:29,240  -->  00:09:31,744
you have already learned a lot by now, okay?
203

203

00:09:31,744  -->  00:09:33,880
But we are really just getting started,
204

204

00:09:33,880  -->  00:09:35,990
with a lot of great content coming up
205

205

00:09:35,990  -->  00:09:38,340
over all of the next sections.
206

206

00:09:38,340  -->  00:09:40,220
There's actually even one more video coming up
207

207

00:09:40,220  -->  00:09:43,330
in this section, which is just about JavaScript versions,
208

208

00:09:43,330  -->  00:09:45,770
so make sure to not to miss that one
209

209

00:09:45,770  -->  00:09:48,070
because it's also important to know that kind of stuff.
210

210

00:09:48,070  -->  00:09:50,630
It's not about coding, but it's still important, okay?
211

211

00:09:50,630  -->  00:09:53,343
So I hope that you take a look at that right now.
