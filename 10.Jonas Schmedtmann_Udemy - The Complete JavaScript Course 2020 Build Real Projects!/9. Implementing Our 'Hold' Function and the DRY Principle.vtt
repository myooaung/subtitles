00:00:01.249  -->  00:00:03.102
<v Jonas>In this lecture, we are going to</v>
2

2

00:00:03.102  -->  00:00:05.317
implement our hold function,
3

3

00:00:05.317  -->  00:00:07.333
and also talk a little bit about
4

4

00:00:07.333  -->  00:00:10.333
the Don't Repeat Yourself principle.
5

5

00:00:11.381  -->  00:00:13.651
So we will continue using the concepts
6

6

00:00:13.651  -->  00:00:16.147
that we have been learned so far,
7

7

00:00:16.147  -->  00:00:18.649
and we will also learn how to use functions
8

8

00:00:18.649  -->  00:00:22.292
to correctly apply the Don't Repeat Yourself principle.
9

9

00:00:22.292  -->  00:00:23.778
And of course, we will continue
10

10

00:00:23.778  -->  00:00:26.805
thinking about the game like a real programmer.
11

11

00:00:26.805  -->  00:00:28.756
So let's do that.
12

12

00:00:28.756  -->  00:00:32.069
So this is where we left after the last lecture.
13

13

00:00:32.069  -->  00:00:34.581
So far we can roll the dice,
14

14

00:00:34.581  -->  00:00:36.621
and add our scores down here,
15

15

00:00:36.621  -->  00:00:38.845
but there is no way to hold our points
16

16

00:00:38.845  -->  00:00:42.612
and update our scores here in the interface.
17

17

00:00:42.612  -->  00:00:44.789
So let's now do that.
18

18

00:00:44.789  -->  00:00:47.050
So once again, we are going to set up
19

19

00:00:47.050  -->  00:00:48.614
an event listener.
20

20

00:00:48.614  -->  00:00:51.958
And this time, it's going to be for the other button.
21

21

00:00:51.958  -->  00:00:54.454
So let's check out which one that is
22

22

00:00:54.454  -->  00:00:57.537
and it's called button hold, alright.
23

23

00:01:01.438  -->  00:01:04.480
So let's start by selecting it,
24

24

00:01:04.480  -->  00:01:07.191
and by now you already know how to do that.
25

25

00:01:07.191  -->  00:01:08.608
So querySelector,
26

26

00:01:10.886  -->  00:01:12.386
and then btn-hold,
27

27

00:01:16.632  -->  00:01:18.715
and then addEventListener
28

28

00:01:22.929  -->  00:01:26.447
okay, and we want this to happen on the click
29

29

00:01:26.447  -->  00:01:31.194
once more, and we're going to use an anonymous function,
30

30

00:01:31.194  -->  00:01:33.451
which as you remember is a function
31

31

00:01:33.451  -->  00:01:35.059
which doesn't have a name
32

32

00:01:35.059  -->  00:01:38.963
and that we cannot reuse in another point of our code.
33

33

00:01:38.963  -->  00:01:42.776
Okay so we simply write function like this,
34

34

00:01:42.776  -->  00:01:44.943
and we have no parameters.
35

35

00:01:45.891  -->  00:01:49.808
And now, in here we can write or function body.
36

36

00:01:51.089  -->  00:01:53.493
So let's first define what we want to happen
37

37

00:01:53.493  -->  00:01:56.511
as soon as the user clicks the hold button.
38

38

00:01:56.511  -->  00:01:58.822
So the most obvious thing is, of course,
39

39

00:01:58.822  -->  00:02:02.297
to add the current score to the player's global score,
40

40

00:02:02.297  -->  00:02:03.130
right?
41

41

00:02:05.297  -->  00:02:07.020
So once again I'm using these comments here
42

42

00:02:07.020  -->  00:02:09.007
to first define what we're going to do
43

43

00:02:09.007  -->  00:02:11.898
and then fill it with the code.
44

44

00:02:11.898  -->  00:02:14.981
So Add CURRENT score to GLOBAL score.
45

45

00:02:21.142  -->  00:02:24.457
Then we of course want to update the UI,
46

46

00:02:24.457  -->  00:02:26.040
the user interface.
47

47

00:02:28.711  -->  00:02:30.680
And there is another thing that we can,
48

48

00:02:30.680  -->  00:02:32.891
and should do right here in this function,
49

49

00:02:32.891  -->  00:02:35.131
so when the user clicks the hold button
50

50

00:02:35.131  -->  00:02:38.314
which is to check if the player won the game.
51

51

00:02:38.314  -->  00:02:40.860
So let's add that here too.
52

52

00:02:40.860  -->  00:02:43.277
Check if player won the game.
53

53

00:02:44.874  -->  00:02:46.578
So once again, when we hit the button
54

54

00:02:46.578  -->  00:02:49.338
then the score that we have in that round
55

55

00:02:49.338  -->  00:02:51.431
gets added to our current score
56

56

00:02:51.431  -->  00:02:54.304
then we print that number to the user interface
57

57

00:02:54.304  -->  00:02:57.528
which means that we perform some DOM manipulation,
58

58

00:02:57.528  -->  00:03:01.464
and then after that we check if the player won the game.
59

59

00:03:01.464  -->  00:03:03.297
So that starts right here.
60

60

00:03:03.297  -->  00:03:05.433
So this one should be easy right?
61

61

00:03:05.433  -->  00:03:06.967
Remember that right in the beginning,
62

62

00:03:06.967  -->  00:03:08.330
right in the first lecture,
63

63

00:03:08.330  -->  00:03:10.234
we created this variable here
64

64

00:03:10.234  -->  00:03:14.078
which stores the scores for both the players
65

65

00:03:14.078  -->  00:03:16.865
and that we also have this variable here
66

66

00:03:16.865  -->  00:03:19.372
which stores the active player.
67

67

00:03:19.372  -->  00:03:20.636
So player number one is zero,
68

68

00:03:20.636  -->  00:03:23.353
and player number two is one.
69

69

00:03:23.353  -->  00:03:25.089
And we can now use this variable
70

70

00:03:25.089  -->  00:03:28.585
to access, to read, or to write, in this case,
71

71

00:03:28.585  -->  00:03:31.706
the scores right into this array.
72

72

00:03:31.706  -->  00:03:34.306
So if the first player is the active player,
73

73

00:03:34.306  -->  00:03:35.609
then it's a zero,
74

74

00:03:35.609  -->  00:03:37.751
and so we can say scores zero
75

75

00:03:37.751  -->  00:03:40.570
and then we will have the value in here.
76

76

00:03:40.570  -->  00:03:42.546
And if the second players the active player,
77

77

00:03:42.546  -->  00:03:44.171
then this is number one
78

78

00:03:44.171  -->  00:03:47.301
and then scores one, is this element.
79

79

00:03:47.301  -->  00:03:49.051
So let's now do that.
80

80

00:03:51.019  -->  00:03:55.750
So scores, and we use the curly brackets to access
81

81

00:03:55.750  -->  00:03:57.808
the variables or to mutate it
82

82

00:03:57.808  -->  00:04:02.762
and now we simply have to write activePlayer, right?
83

83

00:04:02.762  -->  00:04:04.986
And what will the score actually be?
84

84

00:04:04.986  -->  00:04:07.149
We will simply add the score
85

85

00:04:07.149  -->  00:04:09.013
that the player got in this round
86

86

00:04:09.013  -->  00:04:11.551
to the score that the player already had.
87

87

00:04:11.551  -->  00:04:12.750
So it's as simple as this,
88

88

00:04:12.750  -->  00:04:15.000
so += roundScore,
89

89

00:04:18.391  -->  00:04:20.308
and remember that this works because
90

90

00:04:20.308  -->  00:04:22.526
this is the exact same thing
91

91

00:04:22.526  -->  00:04:24.526
as working it like this.
92

92

00:04:25.572  -->  00:04:28.239
So activePlayer equals the score
93

93

00:04:29.169  -->  00:04:31.419
that the player already had
94

94

00:04:33.431  -->  00:04:35.531
and plus the score that we got
95

95

00:04:35.531  -->  00:04:38.114
in this very round, roundScore.
96

96

00:04:39.171  -->  00:04:41.199
Alright, so this is the exact same thing,
97

97

00:04:41.199  -->  00:04:44.721
but once again I prefer to use it this way here, okay?
98

98

00:04:44.721  -->  00:04:46.056
So I'm just going to delete this.
99

99

00:04:46.056  -->  00:04:48.633
Just wanted to show you that this is the exact same.
100

100

00:04:48.633  -->  00:04:50.897
So that make sense.
101

101

00:04:50.897  -->  00:04:52.690
Now we want to update the UI,
102

102

00:04:52.690  -->  00:04:54.210
and in order to do that
103

103

00:04:54.210  -->  00:04:56.139
we first need to know
104

104

00:04:56.139  -->  00:04:58.514
where we have to write our data.
105

105

00:04:58.514  -->  00:05:02.994
So it's here in this ID score-0 for player zero,
106

106

00:05:02.994  -->  00:05:05.244
and score-1 for player one.
107

107

00:05:06.594  -->  00:05:10.677
So let's do that here with document.querySelector
108

108

00:05:15.688  -->  00:05:18.646
score, and then we're once again going to use
109

109

00:05:18.646  -->  00:05:22.481
our simple trick, where we use the active player variable
110

110

00:05:22.481  -->  00:05:26.285
to construct our string name, basically.
111

111

00:05:26.285  -->  00:05:28.431
So activePlayer, like this,
112

112

00:05:28.431  -->  00:05:30.823
so we don't have to specifically have to write
113

113

00:05:30.823  -->  00:05:32.823
score zero or score one.
114

114

00:05:33.876  -->  00:05:35.652
And here we just missed this,
115

115

00:05:35.652  -->  00:05:36.531
and now we're good to go.
116

116

00:05:36.531  -->  00:05:40.019
So we have our active player score selected
117

117

00:05:40.019  -->  00:05:43.862
and the user interface, so let's now change the content.
118

118

00:05:43.862  -->  00:05:46.834
And if you remember, from the last lectures,
119

119

00:05:46.834  -->  00:05:50.917
we use that simply using the text content method.
120

120

00:05:52.474  -->  00:05:53.307
Alright?
121

121

00:05:54.712  -->  00:05:56.894
And what are we going to print here?
122

122

00:05:56.894  -->  00:06:00.610
It's simply the value that we defined before.
123

123

00:06:00.610  -->  00:06:04.695
So we go in our scores array once again,
124

124

00:06:04.695  -->  00:06:08.133
and then select the points from the active player.
125

125

00:06:08.133  -->  00:06:09.925
So if it's the first player,
126

126

00:06:09.925  -->  00:06:12.035
it will be the first element of the array.
127

127

00:06:12.035  -->  00:06:13.771
And if it's the second player,
128

128

00:06:13.771  -->  00:06:16.579
then it's going to be the second element of the array.
129

129

00:06:16.579  -->  00:06:20.746
So let's check out if this is working as intended.
130

130

00:06:23.770  -->  00:06:26.362
So I roll the dice, and I hit hold,
131

131

00:06:26.362  -->  00:06:28.634
and alright here we go.
132

132

00:06:28.634  -->  00:06:31.368
So yes, eight points now here.
133

133

00:06:31.368  -->  00:06:33.074
Now what isn't happening here,
134

134

00:06:33.074  -->  00:06:35.769
is that it isn't changing the active player,
135

135

00:06:35.769  -->  00:06:38.665
because remember, when we hit the hold button,
136

136

00:06:38.665  -->  00:06:41.916
we store our points and then it's the next player's turn.
137

137

00:06:41.916  -->  00:06:43.900
But that's not happening right now,
138

138

00:06:43.900  -->  00:06:47.150
so we have to implement this right now.
139

139

00:06:48.686  -->  00:06:51.541
And you probably remember that we did exactly that
140

140

00:06:51.541  -->  00:06:53.693
in the last lecture, right?
141

141

00:06:53.693  -->  00:06:56.341
Because it's exactly that that happens
142

142

00:06:56.341  -->  00:06:59.732
when the user rolls a one, right?
143

143

00:06:59.732  -->  00:07:02.245
So basically, after the user rolls a one,
144

144

00:07:02.245  -->  00:07:05.235
and after the user chooses to hold his points,
145

145

00:07:05.235  -->  00:07:08.068
it's always the next player's turn.
146

146

00:07:08.068  -->  00:07:09.448
So it's the exact same code
147

147

00:07:09.448  -->  00:07:12.281
so we can just copy this down here
148

148

00:07:14.045  -->  00:07:15.878
to our other function.
149

149

00:07:18.822  -->  00:07:21.924
Now, this doesn't make much sense, does it?
150

150

00:07:21.924  -->  00:07:24.165
Why should we have the exact same code
151

151

00:07:24.165  -->  00:07:26.949
in two places of our application?
152

152

00:07:26.949  -->  00:07:29.928
Imagine that we have to change something here
153

153

00:07:29.928  -->  00:07:33.421
for example, I don't know, this class name here,
154

154

00:07:33.421  -->  00:07:35.020
or some of these class names
155

155

00:07:35.020  -->  00:07:37.737
and then we would also would have to change it up here.
156

156

00:07:37.737  -->  00:07:39.775
So this is very difficult to maintain
157

157

00:07:39.775  -->  00:07:41.482
and it's not a good practice at all.
158

158

00:07:41.482  -->  00:07:43.688
In fact, it's a really bad practice.
159

159

00:07:43.688  -->  00:07:45.709
And that's why there's something called
160

160

00:07:45.709  -->  00:07:49.087
the Don't Repeat Yourself or DRY principle.
161

161

00:07:49.087  -->  00:07:50.774
Of course, as the name says
162

162

00:07:50.774  -->  00:07:53.590
that we should not repeat ourself in our code.
163

163

00:07:53.590  -->  00:07:55.751
So what can we do in order to apply the
164

164

00:07:55.751  -->  00:07:59.024
Don't Repeat Yourself principle?
165

165

00:07:59.024  -->  00:08:00.152
You guessed it.
166

166

00:08:00.152  -->  00:08:02.630
We are going to implement a brand new function.
167

167

00:08:02.630  -->  00:08:06.518
And this one is going to be called next player.
168

168

00:08:06.518  -->  00:08:08.435
So function nextPlayer.
169

169

00:08:12.278  -->  00:08:15.888
And now we're just going to place this code here,
170

170

00:08:15.888  -->  00:08:17.216
and we have our function.
171

171

00:08:17.216  -->  00:08:20.312
So it's a function that doesn't receive any parameters
172

172

00:08:20.312  -->  00:08:22.898
and it also doesn't return any result.
173

173

00:08:22.898  -->  00:08:24.184
We simply use this function
174

174

00:08:24.184  -->  00:08:26.430
in order to not repeat our code.
175

175

00:08:26.430  -->  00:08:28.056
So we defined the function,
176

176

00:08:28.056  -->  00:08:31.103
and now we can actually use it.
177

177

00:08:31.103  -->  00:08:33.848
So we are going to delete all of this
178

178

00:08:33.848  -->  00:08:36.098
and simply call nextPlayer.
179

179

00:08:39.948  -->  00:08:43.195
And then of course, the same thing here.
180

180

00:08:43.195  -->  00:08:45.195
So deleting all of this.
181

181

00:08:46.322  -->  00:08:47.489
And nextPlayer
182

182

00:08:50.966  -->  00:08:53.735
and just like this, we use the DRY principle.
183

183

00:08:53.735  -->  00:08:55.335
So this is something really important
184

184

00:08:55.335  -->  00:08:57.102
in programming, in general.
185

185

00:08:57.102  -->  00:08:59.852
So let's check out if this works.
186

186

00:09:02.855  -->  00:09:05.066
So holding, and alright.
187

187

00:09:05.066  -->  00:09:06.963
So we're back to zero here
188

188

00:09:06.963  -->  00:09:09.099
we have updated our score here,
189

189

00:09:09.099  -->  00:09:11.835
and player two is now active.
190

190

00:09:11.835  -->  00:09:14.252
And we keep rolling the dice.
191

191

00:09:15.664  -->  00:09:17.347
So we have five and six,
192

192

00:09:17.347  -->  00:09:20.435
so we should have 11 as soon as we hit the button.
193

193

00:09:20.435  -->  00:09:23.185
And alright, it's working, great.
194

194

00:09:25.027  -->  00:09:27.610
Oh, rolling a lot of ones here.
195

195

00:09:34.541  -->  00:09:38.128
Yup, so it's working on both sides, alright.
196

196

00:09:38.128  -->  00:09:39.911
So let's go back.
197

197

00:09:39.911  -->  00:09:42.291
Now there's only this thing here to do,
198

198

00:09:42.291  -->  00:09:45.053
which is to check if the player has won the game.
199

199

00:09:45.053  -->  00:09:47.660
So let's just check out the rules of the game
200

200

00:09:47.660  -->  00:09:51.636
which says, that the first player to reach 100 points
201

201

00:09:51.636  -->  00:09:53.634
on GLOBAL score wins the game.
202

202

00:09:53.634  -->  00:09:56.717
So this should be pretty easy, right?
203

203

00:09:57.755  -->  00:10:00.077
So can you guess what we're going to do here?
204

204

00:10:00.077  -->  00:10:02.567
Take a moment and try to actually
205

205

00:10:02.567  -->  00:10:04.094
implement this for yourself.
206

206

00:10:04.094  -->  00:10:05.934
Okay, so pause the video to try
207

207

00:10:05.934  -->  00:10:08.601
to implement this functionality.
208

208

00:10:12.724  -->  00:10:14.793
Okay, so I'm sure that you got this.
209

209

00:10:14.793  -->  00:10:18.923
So of course, we are going to use an if/else statement.
210

210

00:10:18.923  -->  00:10:20.180
So what we have to do here
211

211

00:10:20.180  -->  00:10:23.082
is to check if the score of the active player
212

212

00:10:23.082  -->  00:10:26.518
is now more or equal to 100 points.
213

213

00:10:26.518  -->  00:10:29.317
So once again we use our scores array
214

214

00:10:29.317  -->  00:10:31.453
where all the scores are stored
215

215

00:10:31.453  -->  00:10:35.383
and then retrieve the score for the activePlayer
216

216

00:10:35.383  -->  00:10:39.787
and check if it's greater or equal to 100 points.
217

217

00:10:39.787  -->  00:10:42.730
So of course we cannot use just equal to 100 points
218

218

00:10:42.730  -->  00:10:45.081
because that wouldn't be fair, right?
219

219

00:10:45.081  -->  00:10:47.692
Then the user with, let's say, 105 points
220

220

00:10:47.692  -->  00:10:49.633
would not get the chance to win.
221

221

00:10:49.633  -->  00:10:54.131
So it must be equal or greater to 100 points.
222

222

00:10:54.131  -->  00:10:55.664
And just to check if this works
223

223

00:10:55.664  -->  00:10:57.649
we are going to display something
224

224

00:10:57.649  -->  00:11:00.082
on our webpage, on our game.
225

225

00:11:00.082  -->  00:11:02.978
And we simply going to replace this Player 1 name here
226

226

00:11:02.978  -->  00:11:06.943
or Player 2, whoever wins, with the word winner.
227

227

00:11:06.943  -->  00:11:11.110
So the ID for this is name and then the active player.
228

228

00:11:12.781  -->  00:11:14.864
So document.querySelector
229

229

00:11:19.667  -->  00:11:23.334
so the ID name and then our old trick again.
230

230

00:11:24.968  -->  00:11:29.223
So by now, I'm sure this makes total sense to you.
231

231

00:11:29.223  -->  00:11:30.890
So again textContent
232

232

00:11:32.987  -->  00:11:35.737
and now we will just say, Winner!
233

233

00:11:39.293  -->  00:11:41.071
And now in order to check this,
234

234

00:11:41.071  -->  00:11:43.422
I'm just going to put this down to 20,
235

235

00:11:43.422  -->  00:11:44.733
so that you don't have to watch me
236

236

00:11:44.733  -->  00:11:48.669
playing the game up until we reach 100 points.
237

237

00:11:48.669  -->  00:11:51.965
So, I'm going to put this to 20 now, just for testing.
238

238

00:11:51.965  -->  00:11:55.949
And then I'm putting it back to 100 later.
239

239

00:11:55.949  -->  00:11:58.282
So roll the dice, 15 points.
240

240

00:12:00.840  -->  00:12:04.111
And now if I hold, 15 plus 8 should already be
241

241

00:12:04.111  -->  00:12:07.019
more than 20, which is our winning score right now.
242

242

00:12:07.019  -->  00:12:09.792
So I should now be the winner.
243

243

00:12:09.792  -->  00:12:12.464
And yes, it works, great.
244

244

00:12:12.464  -->  00:12:14.704
Now what doesn't do much sense,
245

245

00:12:14.704  -->  00:12:17.439
is that now it's the next player's turn, right?
246

246

00:12:17.439  -->  00:12:20.247
So let's change that with or/else,
247

247

00:12:20.247  -->  00:12:22.089
part of the if/else statement.
248

248

00:12:22.089  -->  00:12:23.632
So if the player wins the game,
249

249

00:12:23.632  -->  00:12:25.455
we want this to happen
250

250

00:12:25.455  -->  00:12:27.394
and only if he doesn't,
251

251

00:12:27.394  -->  00:12:29.182
so if the game continues
252

252

00:12:29.182  -->  00:12:33.015
then we want the next player to play the game.
253

253

00:12:35.966  -->  00:12:38.526
So let's copy this to here.
254

254

00:12:38.526  -->  00:12:39.359
Alright.
255

255

00:12:43.056  -->  00:12:44.889
So let's see this now.
256

256

00:12:51.415  -->  00:12:52.498
12, 15, okay.
257

257

00:12:53.794  -->  00:12:55.839
Let's see if I can push this even more.
258

258

00:12:55.839  -->  00:12:57.255
Yes, so hold.
259

259

00:12:57.255  -->  00:13:00.093
And now player two won the game.
260

260

00:13:00.093  -->  00:13:01.568
So all we have to do now,
261

261

00:13:01.568  -->  00:13:04.616
is to actually hide this dice here, I would say.
262

262

00:13:04.616  -->  00:13:08.348
And also remove the active class here
263

263

00:13:08.348  -->  00:13:10.931
from the current player, right?
264

264

00:13:12.132  -->  00:13:13.107
So let's do that,
265

265

00:13:13.107  -->  00:13:16.428
and it's not the first time we did this, or course.
266

266

00:13:16.428  -->  00:13:18.845
So we're doing it right here.
267

267

00:13:20.638  -->  00:13:22.721
So document.querySelector
268

268

00:13:25.936  -->  00:13:27.621
and it's the dice class,
269

269

00:13:27.621  -->  00:13:31.788
so once again we're going to change the CSS style.
270

270

00:13:33.198  -->  00:13:37.365
Display, and we are going to set the display back to none.
271

271

00:13:38.894  -->  00:13:41.384
So now it will not be visible anymore.
272

272

00:13:41.384  -->  00:13:45.193
Now one note about this way of styling our webpage
273

273

00:13:45.193  -->  00:13:46.569
and changing the CSS,
274

274

00:13:46.569  -->  00:13:48.879
so it's not the best way to mixture
275

275

00:13:48.879  -->  00:13:51.449
or CSS with JavaScript.
276

276

00:13:51.449  -->  00:13:54.109
So if we have a lot of styles to change,
277

277

00:13:54.109  -->  00:13:55.492
we shouldn't do it this way,
278

278

00:13:55.492  -->  00:13:58.788
so we shouldn't really use the style property all the time,
279

279

00:13:58.788  -->  00:14:00.491
here in our JavaScript code.
280

280

00:14:00.491  -->  00:14:02.852
But instead, do it the way we did it, for example,
281

281

00:14:02.852  -->  00:14:05.796
down here in our nextPlayer function
282

282

00:14:05.796  -->  00:14:10.160
with the toggling or adding or removing classes.
283

283

00:14:10.160  -->  00:14:12.467
So instead of writing a bunch of lines here
284

284

00:14:12.467  -->  00:14:14.154
to manipulate the CSS,
285

285

00:14:14.154  -->  00:14:17.011
we should simply create a class, or CSS,
286

286

00:14:17.011  -->  00:14:19.866
and then simply add or remove this class
287

287

00:14:19.866  -->  00:14:21.209
here in our JavaScript.
288

288

00:14:21.209  -->  00:14:24.448
And that's exactly why I created that active class
289

289

00:14:24.448  -->  00:14:26.027
that we have used already.
290

290

00:14:26.027  -->  00:14:29.417
And it's also why I created a winner class,
291

291

00:14:29.417  -->  00:14:30.917
so let's see this.
292

292

00:14:32.412  -->  00:14:35.482
So let me see where this is.
293

293

00:14:35.482  -->  00:14:36.661
Alright, so down here.
294

294

00:14:36.661  -->  00:14:38.369
So it's not a lot of CSS,
295

295

00:14:38.369  -->  00:14:40.429
but it's just to show you
296

296

00:14:40.429  -->  00:14:42.186
that it's always a better way
297

297

00:14:42.186  -->  00:14:43.721
to create a class like this
298

298

00:14:43.721  -->  00:14:45.259
instead of doing, for example,
299

299

00:14:45.259  -->  00:14:48.800
these two manipulations directly in CSS.
300

300

00:14:48.800  -->  00:14:50.964
So let's now apply the winner class
301

301

00:14:50.964  -->  00:14:53.054
to the entire player panel.
302

302

00:14:53.054  -->  00:14:55.747
In order to make the winner look a little bit
303

303

00:14:55.747  -->  00:14:57.378
better, let's say.
304

304

00:14:57.378  -->  00:14:59.864
So, these player panels here,
305

305

00:14:59.864  -->  00:15:02.244
so which are the entire left or right side
306

306

00:15:02.244  -->  00:15:04.077
of the user interface.
307

307

00:15:05.048  -->  00:15:08.282
So let's do that right here as well.
308

308

00:15:08.282  -->  00:15:10.365
So document.querySelector
309

309

00:15:13.349  -->  00:15:16.455
and now the player that won this game is of course,
310

310

00:15:16.455  -->  00:15:18.503
the active player, right?
311

311

00:15:18.503  -->  00:15:20.384
So only the player that is playing right now
312

312

00:15:20.384  -->  00:15:22.173
can win the game.
313

313

00:15:22.173  -->  00:15:26.256
So player then we use our trick with activePlayer
314

314

00:15:29.690  -->  00:15:31.273
and then plus panel
315

315

00:15:32.779  -->  00:15:36.773
so player one panel, or player zero panel.
316

316

00:15:36.773  -->  00:15:39.083
And now we use the class list again
317

317

00:15:39.083  -->  00:15:40.465
such as we did before
318

318

00:15:40.465  -->  00:15:44.203
to access the classes that this element has.
319

319

00:15:44.203  -->  00:15:47.453
And now we simply add the winner class.
320

320

00:15:50.188  -->  00:15:53.750
Which is the one that I showed you before in the CSS.
321

321

00:15:53.750  -->  00:15:56.330
And what I should also do is to remove
322

322

00:15:56.330  -->  00:15:59.679
the active player class also from this panel.
323

323

00:15:59.679  -->  00:16:02.854
So I'm just going to duplicate this line
324

324

00:16:02.854  -->  00:16:05.105
and then here it's not add anymore,
325

325

00:16:05.105  -->  00:16:06.438
but it's remove.
326

326

00:16:07.881  -->  00:16:09.548
So the active class.
327

327

00:16:10.990  -->  00:16:14.789
So remember, we have add, remove, and also toggle,
328

328

00:16:14.789  -->  00:16:17.390
down here, so remember what toggle does
329

329

00:16:17.390  -->  00:16:20.620
is to add the class of the class that's not there
330

330

00:16:20.620  -->  00:16:23.621
and if the class is already there, it removes it.
331

331

00:16:23.621  -->  00:16:25.437
Which in this case is not necessary
332

332

00:16:25.437  -->  00:16:28.318
because we know that the winner class is not there
333

333

00:16:28.318  -->  00:16:29.844
so we add it.
334

334

00:16:29.844  -->  00:16:32.349
And we also know that the active class is there,
335

335

00:16:32.349  -->  00:16:33.917
and so we remove it.
336

336

00:16:33.917  -->  00:16:36.250
So let's now check this out.
337

337

00:16:37.820  -->  00:16:41.987
Remember, I'm still at 20 points for the final goal.
338

338

00:16:45.216  -->  00:16:46.487
And here we go.
339

339

00:16:46.487  -->  00:16:50.300
So, I won the game, and I'm no longer the active player.
340

340

00:16:50.300  -->  00:16:52.647
As you see here, as the dot disappeared.
341

341

00:16:52.647  -->  00:16:55.096
And also my winner score here
342

342

00:16:55.096  -->  00:16:57.966
is now red and big and bold.
343

343

00:16:57.966  -->  00:17:00.159
So this is already pretty cool, right?
344

344

00:17:00.159  -->  00:17:01.814
We've come a long way with this application,
345

345

00:17:01.814  -->  00:17:03.701
and it's almost ready.
346

346

00:17:03.701  -->  00:17:05.762
Just still some problems because
347

347

00:17:05.762  -->  00:17:08.767
first, now if you continue hitting this button
348

348

00:17:08.767  -->  00:17:10.503
we can still roll the dice,
349

349

00:17:10.503  -->  00:17:12.847
which doesn't make sense, right?
350

350

00:17:12.847  -->  00:17:15.102
And we also have this button here
351

351

00:17:15.102  -->  00:17:17.552
that we want to implement.
352

352

00:17:17.552  -->  00:17:19.495
So if you want to do that right now,
353

353

00:17:19.495  -->  00:17:22.007
then just hit that next lecture.
354

354

00:17:22.007  -->  00:17:23.174
See you there.
