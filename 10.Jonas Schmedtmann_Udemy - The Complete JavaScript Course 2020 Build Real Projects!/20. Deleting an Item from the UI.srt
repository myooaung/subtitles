00:00:01,151  -->  00:00:02,413
<v Instructor>This is the last lecture</v>
2

2

00:00:02,413  -->  00:00:05,913
about removing an element from our application,
3

3

00:00:05,913  -->  00:00:08,908
and all we have left to do is to actually remove
4

4

00:00:08,908  -->  00:00:12,316
the item from the user interface.
5

5

00:00:12,316  -->  00:00:14,470
And so in this lecture, we're going to learn
6

6

00:00:14,470  -->  00:00:17,879
some more DOM manipulation, and more specifically,
7

7

00:00:17,879  -->  00:00:21,046
how to remove an element from the DOM.
8

8

00:00:22,984  -->  00:00:24,797
And so in order to remove something from
9

9

00:00:24,797  -->  00:00:28,195
the user interface, we create the brand new method
10

10

00:00:28,195  -->  00:00:30,804
here in our UI controller.
11

11

00:00:30,804  -->  00:00:34,156
So here we have addListItem, and so after that,
12

12

00:00:34,156  -->  00:00:36,823
I'm going to put deleteListItem.
13

13

00:00:40,560  -->  00:00:42,727
So a function, once again.
14

14

00:00:45,553  -->  00:00:47,308
And what do we need to know in order
15

15

00:00:47,308  -->  00:00:51,709
to be able to remove an element from the DOM?
16

16

00:00:51,709  -->  00:00:55,270
That's right, we need a class name or an ID name
17

17

00:00:55,270  -->  00:00:59,326
so that we can first select it and then remove it.
18

18

00:00:59,326  -->  00:01:02,832
And in this case, of course we're going to use an ID,
19

19

00:01:02,832  -->  00:01:05,587
because we've been talking about that all the time.
20

20

00:01:05,587  -->  00:01:09,087
So let's say selectorID, right, and the ID
21

21

00:01:11,747  -->  00:01:14,538
that we're going to pass into this
22

22

00:01:14,538  -->  00:01:17,871
will be, of course, this entire ID here.
23

23

00:01:18,889  -->  00:01:23,171
So the one that we write from the DOM in the first place.
24

24

00:01:23,171  -->  00:01:26,138
So we don't want just the type or that ID,
25

25

00:01:26,138  -->  00:01:29,093
but we want the entire ID that we write.
26

26

00:01:29,093  -->  00:01:33,260
So for example, the income zero or the income one, right.
27

27

00:01:35,041  -->  00:01:39,100
So that we can then go ahead and delete this item, right.
28

28

00:01:39,100  -->  00:01:41,960
So for example, this item, or this item,
29

29

00:01:41,960  -->  00:01:44,649
this is what we want to delete.
30

30

00:01:44,649  -->  00:01:47,566
And so let's do that in our method.
31

31

00:01:49,460  -->  00:01:51,247
And removing something from the DOM
32

32

00:01:51,247  -->  00:01:54,126
is actually pretty simple, because for that,
33

33

00:01:54,126  -->  00:01:56,947
we have to remove child method.
34

34

00:01:56,947  -->  00:01:59,910
Okay, and since it's the remove child method,
35

35

00:01:59,910  -->  00:02:02,133
we first need to know the parent, right?
36

36

00:02:02,133  -->  00:02:05,284
So basically we have to move up in the DOM
37

37

00:02:05,284  -->  00:02:07,451
so that we can then remove the child.
38

38

00:02:07,451  -->  00:02:10,061
So this is a bit strange, but in JavaScript
39

39

00:02:10,061  -->  00:02:12,716
we cannot simply delete an element,
40

40

00:02:12,716  -->  00:02:14,537
we can only delete a child.
41

41

00:02:14,537  -->  00:02:16,676
So remove a child.
42

42

00:02:16,676  -->  00:02:20,055
So we start by selecting the element, as always.
43

43

00:02:20,055  -->  00:02:24,380
So document-dot, and now since we have an ID here,
44

44

00:02:24,380  -->  00:02:27,951
I will use getElementById, we haven't used that
45

45

00:02:27,951  -->  00:02:29,566
in a long time, right?
46

46

00:02:29,566  -->  00:02:33,397
So getElementById, and then selectorID.
47

47

00:02:33,397  -->  00:02:37,034
So this is our item that we want to remove.
48

48

00:02:37,034  -->  00:02:39,811
But remember, we can only remove a child,
49

49

00:02:39,811  -->  00:02:43,627
so we first need to move up, and we already did that before,
50

50

00:02:43,627  -->  00:02:47,377
and we do that using the parentNode property.
51

51

00:02:49,573  -->  00:02:53,114
So parentNode, and now we can say from here,
52

52

00:02:53,114  -->  00:02:55,281
we want to remove a child,
53

53

00:02:58,038  -->  00:03:01,211
and then, we need to again select it.
54

54

00:03:01,211  -->  00:03:03,909
So really, this is a bit strange, as I was saying,
55

55

00:03:03,909  -->  00:03:06,376
but it's just how it works.
56

56

00:03:06,376  -->  00:03:09,709
So we need to pass this into here again.
57

57

00:03:10,698  -->  00:03:12,286
So this is how it works.
58

58

00:03:12,286  -->  00:03:15,603
Now I would suggest to not do it this way,
59

59

00:03:15,603  -->  00:03:19,355
but to first actually save the selection here
60

60

00:03:19,355  -->  00:03:22,013
in a separate variable, right?
61

61

00:03:22,013  -->  00:03:24,930
So let's say element is this, okay?
62

62

00:03:27,050  -->  00:03:28,633
And so then we say,
63

63

00:03:30,629  -->  00:03:35,284
element, then we want the parentNode from that element,
64

64

00:03:35,284  -->  00:03:39,451
and then we remove the child, which is this element.
65

65

00:03:40,575  -->  00:03:44,436
So pretty weird, but yeah, that's how it works.
66

66

00:03:44,436  -->  00:03:47,184
There's actually an excellent reference that I found
67

67

00:03:47,184  -->  00:03:49,497
where lots of these things are explained,
68

68

00:03:49,497  -->  00:03:52,443
so lots of DOM manipulations like this.
69

69

00:03:52,443  -->  00:03:56,079
So let's take a look at that, I already have it here,
70

70

00:03:56,079  -->  00:04:00,046
and you can also find it on my resource page, as always.
71

71

00:04:00,046  -->  00:04:02,872
And here we have a comparison between jQuery
72

72

00:04:02,872  -->  00:04:05,318
and JavaScript DOM API.
73

73

00:04:05,318  -->  00:04:08,937
So this is for, now let's see, removing elements here,
74

74

00:04:08,937  -->  00:04:11,691
so this is what we did here, right?
75

75

00:04:11,691  -->  00:04:14,694
So we selected an element, then set parentNode,
76

76

00:04:14,694  -->  00:04:18,265
and removeChild, and the element again, right?
77

77

00:04:18,265  -->  00:04:21,052
But here is a lot of different stuff that we can do,
78

78

00:04:21,052  -->  00:04:24,314
and some of that we already did.
79

79

00:04:24,314  -->  00:04:27,314
For example, let's see, so creating,
80

80

00:04:29,571  -->  00:04:32,189
and inserting elements before and after, here's what
81

81

00:04:32,189  -->  00:04:35,106
we did here, so insertAdjacentHTML,
82

82

00:04:35,956  -->  00:04:39,310
and we already used, I don't know if it was the after end,
83

83

00:04:39,310  -->  00:04:41,587
but it was something like this, okay?
84

84

00:04:41,587  -->  00:04:45,227
And so, in here, you can find something for your needs
85

85

00:04:45,227  -->  00:04:47,590
if you want to do some DOM manipulation
86

86

00:04:47,590  -->  00:04:51,673
like inserting or removing elements from the DOM.
87

87

00:04:53,079  -->  00:04:57,310
Okay, so our deleteListItem method is actually complete
88

88

00:04:57,310  -->  00:04:59,790
with this, so this is a pretty simple one
89

89

00:04:59,790  -->  00:05:02,089
because all we really wanted to do here
90

90

00:05:02,089  -->  00:05:04,356
is to just remove this element.
91

91

00:05:04,356  -->  00:05:06,106
So let's now call it.
92

92

00:05:08,358  -->  00:05:12,525
So in here, so UI controller, dot-deleteListItem, alright,
93

93

00:05:15,267  -->  00:05:18,900
and now remember, we have to pass in the ID,
94

94

00:05:18,900  -->  00:05:22,151
and it's the itemID, as we were talking about
95

95

00:05:22,151  -->  00:05:24,223
right in the beginning.
96

96

00:05:24,223  -->  00:05:27,118
Alright, and now, all we have left to do
97

97

00:05:27,118  -->  00:05:29,510
is to update and show the new budget.
98

98

00:05:29,510  -->  00:05:31,271
But that's really simple, right,
99

99

00:05:31,271  -->  00:05:34,858
because we already have this code.
100

100

00:05:34,858  -->  00:05:39,034
So let's go here to our control AddItem function,
101

101

00:05:39,034  -->  00:05:40,307
so this one.
102

102

00:05:40,307  -->  00:05:42,958
So when we coded this part of the application,
103

103

00:05:42,958  -->  00:05:44,847
we already had this function here,
104

104

00:05:44,847  -->  00:05:47,162
which does exactly what we want.
105

105

00:05:47,162  -->  00:05:50,924
So let's just copy this, and paste it here.
106

106

00:05:50,924  -->  00:05:53,768
Alright, and that's why back then, I said
107

107

00:05:53,768  -->  00:05:57,414
that we should create a function to update the budget
108

108

00:05:57,414  -->  00:05:59,187
because we were going to use it again,
109

109

00:05:59,187  -->  00:06:01,713
and now is that time.
110

110

00:06:01,713  -->  00:06:04,806
So instead of writing the same code, here in this function
111

111

00:06:04,806  -->  00:06:08,429
and in this function, we created an updateBudget function,
112

112

00:06:08,429  -->  00:06:11,609
which contains all of the stuff that we do here.
113

113

00:06:11,609  -->  00:06:13,869
So let's remember, what is this?
114

114

00:06:13,869  -->  00:06:17,333
So we calculate the budget, then we get the budget,
115

115

00:06:17,333  -->  00:06:20,809
so we basically read it from the budget controller,
116

116

00:06:20,809  -->  00:06:23,393
and then we display it on the user interface
117

117

00:06:23,393  -->  00:06:24,603
with the UI Controller.
118

118

00:06:24,603  -->  00:06:27,735
Okay, so let's check this out.
119

119

00:06:27,735  -->  00:06:30,235
So I'm refreshing it, and then
120

120

00:06:31,570  -->  00:06:35,737
let's say salary, 1500, or something like this, okay,
121

121

00:06:36,987  -->  00:06:38,570
and sold car, 2000.
122

122

00:06:41,444  -->  00:06:44,636
And let's remove it, and it's gone.
123

123

00:06:44,636  -->  00:06:47,297
So it's working, so really cool.
124

124

00:06:47,297  -->  00:06:51,546
And did you see that also, this budget here was updated,
125

125

00:06:51,546  -->  00:06:54,729
so not only was the element actually removed,
126

126

00:06:54,729  -->  00:06:56,809
but also the budget was updated.
127

127

00:06:56,809  -->  00:06:59,081
So let's remove this one as well,
128

128

00:06:59,081  -->  00:07:01,421
and so we're back to zero.
129

129

00:07:01,421  -->  00:07:04,588
So let's add an expense, holiday, 500,
130

130

00:07:08,262  -->  00:07:12,090
and now add on our income, like logo design
131

131

00:07:12,090  -->  00:07:16,257
for 2500 dollars, so a great (mumbles), right?
132

132

00:07:17,643  -->  00:07:19,393
And our salary again.
133

133

00:07:22,921  -->  00:07:25,627
So all of this has updated, of course,
134

134

00:07:25,627  -->  00:07:28,263
and now I'm removing this one, and yeah,
135

135

00:07:28,263  -->  00:07:31,096
again it updated, it updated here,
136

136

00:07:32,187  -->  00:07:34,726
and so everything works perfectly.
137

137

00:07:34,726  -->  00:07:38,806
That's only just, look at our budget again,
138

138

00:07:38,806  -->  00:07:41,605
and take it, this is also empty,
139

139

00:07:41,605  -->  00:07:44,022
and yeah, it is, so, perfect.
140

140

00:07:45,521  -->  00:07:49,363
And with this, we concluded the part two of the project,
141

141

00:07:49,363  -->  00:07:53,013
which was just to delete an item here from our application.
142

142

00:07:53,013  -->  00:07:55,570
And we did that perfectly.
143

143

00:07:55,570  -->  00:07:57,814
So our app is growing and growing,
144

144

00:07:57,814  -->  00:07:59,968
and it's getting better and better.
145

145

00:07:59,968  -->  00:08:03,385
So let's now move on to see what's next.
