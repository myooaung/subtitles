00:00:00.980  -->  00:00:02.830
<v Narrator>Now before we can actually start,</v>
2

2

00:00:02.830  -->  00:00:05.050
we need to first set up the most important tool
3

3

00:00:05.050  -->  00:00:08.870
that we need for this course and that is a code editor.
4

4

00:00:08.870  -->  00:00:10.720
So the code editor that I'm gonna use
5

5

00:00:10.720  -->  00:00:14.270
in the first part of this course is called Brackets.
6

6

00:00:14.270  -->  00:00:17.660
So you can just go ahead to brackets on IO
7

7

00:00:17.660  -->  00:00:19.230
and download this editor.
8

8

00:00:19.230  -->  00:00:20.720
If you wanna use this same editor that
9

9

00:00:20.720  -->  00:00:22.330
I'm using throughout the videos.
10

10

00:00:22.330  -->  00:00:23.260
Now some people, of course,
11

11

00:00:23.260  -->  00:00:25.170
already have the editors installed,
12

12

00:00:25.170  -->  00:00:28.140
like VS Code, Sublime or Atom,
13

13

00:00:28.140  -->  00:00:30.750
and if you are already set up with your own editor
14

14

00:00:30.750  -->  00:00:33.290
then there is no need to install a new one of course.
15

15

00:00:33.290  -->  00:00:35.100
You can just use what you already have.
16

16

00:00:35.100  -->  00:00:36.680
But if you're new to all this,
17

17

00:00:36.680  -->  00:00:39.210
then you can just go ahead and download Brackets.
18

18

00:00:39.210  -->  00:00:40.510
Then in the second part of the course,
19

19

00:00:40.510  -->  00:00:43.270
I'm actually gonna use VS Code, simply because,
20

20

00:00:43.270  -->  00:00:45.880
it was recorded at a later time.
21

21

00:00:45.880  -->  00:00:49.310
Alright, so, this is what Brackets looks like.
22

22

00:00:49.310  -->  00:00:51.530
And that's because I have a theme installed.
23

23

00:00:51.530  -->  00:00:53.630
So let's take a look at the set up
24

24

00:00:53.630  -->  00:00:55.670
that I have for this editor.
25

25

00:00:55.670  -->  00:00:58.300
And you can take a look at that on the course,
26

26

00:00:58.300  -->  00:00:59.560
GitHub Repo.
27

27

00:00:59.560  -->  00:01:01.200
So in the last lecture, there's a link,
28

28

00:01:01.200  -->  00:01:03.460
that points to this repo and basically,
29

29

00:01:03.460  -->  00:01:06.070
this repository contains everything that you need,
30

30

00:01:06.070  -->  00:01:07.020
for the course.
31

31

00:01:07.020  -->  00:01:10.537
So all of the codes, the final and the starter code,
32

32

00:01:10.537  -->  00:01:14.930
and these slides, so the entire slides for the course,
33

33

00:01:14.930  -->  00:01:16.963
and then also the set up.
34

34

00:01:18.000  -->  00:01:21.470
And also down here, you have frequently asked questions.
35

35

00:01:21.470  -->  00:01:23.650
So before you post something to the Q and A,
36

36

00:01:23.650  -->  00:01:26.230
you can always take a look at these
37

37

00:01:26.230  -->  00:01:28.200
frequently asked questions first.
38

38

00:01:28.200  -->  00:01:31.790
Now about the set up, I have a special document here,
39

39

00:01:31.790  -->  00:01:34.040
because I get asked all the time, what themes
40

40

00:01:34.040  -->  00:01:35.880
and what extensions I use.
41

41

00:01:35.880  -->  00:01:38.870
So for Brackets, that I use in the first part of the course,
42

42

00:01:38.870  -->  00:01:42.070
I have a theme called OS X Style Flat and Dark.
43

43

00:01:42.070  -->  00:01:44.430
And then the most important extension is
44

44

00:01:44.430  -->  00:01:46.300
an Auto Save extension.
45

45

00:01:46.300  -->  00:01:48.660
So let's go ahead and set this up very quickly
46

46

00:01:48.660  -->  00:01:51.830
just so that your editor looks the exact same as mine,
47

47

00:01:51.830  -->  00:01:53.530
if you choose to use Brackets.
48

48

00:01:53.530  -->  00:01:55.910
So just hit this icon here on the right side,
49

49

00:01:55.910  -->  00:01:58.410
which says extension manager,
50

50

00:01:58.410  -->  00:02:00.740
then you can first head to themes,
51

51

00:02:00.740  -->  00:02:05.740
and then OS X Style and here it is.
52

52

00:02:07.134  -->  00:02:09.500
So all you need to do is now is click install
53

53

00:02:09.500  -->  00:02:11.940
and I already have it installed so that's why
54

54

00:02:11.940  -->  00:02:13.420
I don't have a button here
55

55

00:02:13.420  -->  00:02:16.860
then you just close it, come here to view,
56

56

00:02:16.860  -->  00:02:20.970
in the menu, then themes, then you can select
57

57

00:02:20.970  -->  00:02:23.240
the OS X Style theme from here.
58

58

00:02:23.240  -->  00:02:26.030
Click done and now your code editor should look
59

59

00:02:26.030  -->  00:02:27.370
the same as mine.
60

60

00:02:27.370  -->  00:02:31.398
Then as for the other extension, just hit the available,
61

61

00:02:31.398  -->  00:02:36.030
then auto save and the one you want to install
62

62

00:02:36.030  -->  00:02:39.310
is the one, to auto save files on window blur.
63

63

00:02:39.310  -->  00:02:41.950
And so what this is gonna do is each time that we leave
64

64

00:02:41.950  -->  00:02:44.950
the Brackets app, it will automatically save the file
65

65

00:02:44.950  -->  00:02:46.350
we are currently working on.
66

66

00:02:47.610  -->  00:02:49.850
Okay, so that is Brackets.
67

67

00:02:49.850  -->  00:02:51.560
Then again on the second part of the course
68

68

00:02:51.560  -->  00:02:53.450
we are gonna use VS Code here.
69

69

00:02:53.450  -->  00:02:56.693
So disc editor, but more about that by then.
70

70

00:02:57.726  -->  00:03:00.180
Now down here, you have also, the theme
71

71

00:03:00.180  -->  00:03:02.140
and the extensions that I use in case
72

72

00:03:02.140  -->  00:03:03.730
that you're curious.
73

73

00:03:03.730  -->  00:03:06.490
Okay, and that is the set up about code editors.
74

74

00:03:06.490  -->  00:03:08.490
Now of course you also need a browser
75

75

00:03:08.490  -->  00:03:11.690
and I am always using the latest version of Google Chrome.
76

76

00:03:11.690  -->  00:03:14.170
So I advise you to do the exact same.
77

77

00:03:14.170  -->  00:03:16.938
Then in the browser, we are gonna use a lot,
78

78

00:03:16.938  -->  00:03:18.520
especially in the beginning, is the developer consult.
79

79

00:03:18.520  -->  00:03:21.480
And let me quickly show you how you can use that.
80

80

00:03:21.480  -->  00:03:25.040
So you can come to the view menu, then developer,
81

81

00:03:25.040  -->  00:03:26.810
and java script console.
82

82

00:03:26.810  -->  00:03:28.570
And then it will open up the desk tools.
83

83

00:03:28.570  -->  00:03:31.110
And you have the console down here.
84

84

00:03:31.110  -->  00:03:33.210
And you can also do it another way,
85

85

00:03:33.210  -->  00:03:35.840
which is simply right click anywhere on the page
86

86

00:03:35.840  -->  00:03:40.840
then hit inspect and then you can click console over here.
87

87

00:03:42.056  -->  00:03:44.530
And so on this console we can very simply execute
88

88

00:03:44.530  -->  00:03:47.990
Java Script commands like math operations like this
89

89

00:03:47.990  -->  00:03:50.232
or assigning values to variables,
90

90

00:03:50.232  -->  00:03:52.780
something like this and then read them out,
91

91

00:03:52.780  -->  00:03:55.540
so this is just to execute Java Script here.
92

92

00:03:55.540  -->  00:03:58.040
But I'm already getting ahead of myself here
93

93

00:03:58.040  -->  00:04:00.700
so I'm already writing some Java Script code here
94

94

00:04:00.700  -->  00:04:03.223
but let's leave that for the next section.
95

95

00:04:04.150  -->  00:04:06.410
I think we're actually ready here so let's now
96

96

00:04:06.410  -->  00:04:08.580
finally move on right to the next video,
97

97

00:04:08.580  -->  00:04:10.760
to the next section where you're gonna start
98

98

00:04:10.760  -->  00:04:11.833
learning Java Script.
