00:00:02,229  -->  00:00:03,062
<v Jonas>So I really hope that you gave</v>
2

2

00:00:03,062  -->  00:00:05,100
the challenge a try, and, of course,
3

3

00:00:05,100  -->  00:00:06,860
that you managed to do it.
4

4

00:00:06,860  -->  00:00:08,720
So here goes my solution in case
5

5

00:00:08,720  -->  00:00:10,990
you're wondering how I did it.
6

6

00:00:10,990  -->  00:00:13,923
I'm gonna start by creating the tip calculator function.
7

7

00:00:14,770  -->  00:00:19,233
Okay so function, and I'm gonna call it tip calculator.
8

8

00:00:21,370  -->  00:00:24,533
Then in here you pass a value, which I call the bill,
9

9

00:00:26,130  -->  00:00:28,600
and then we have our function body.
10

10

00:00:28,600  -->  00:00:32,670
Okay now, we want to, depending on the bill value,
11

11

00:00:32,670  -->  00:00:34,890
to determine the percentage of the tip
12

12

00:00:34,890  -->  00:00:36,273
that John likes to pay.
13

13

00:00:37,146  -->  00:00:38,810
So here we have our rules, again,
14

14

00:00:38,810  -->  00:00:41,950
so 20% if the bill is less than $50,
15

15

00:00:41,950  -->  00:00:44,570
15% if it's between 50 and 200,
16

16

00:00:44,570  -->  00:00:48,053
and then 10% if the bill is more than 200.
17

17

00:00:50,030  -->  00:00:52,653
So I'm gonna define var percentage here,
18

18

00:00:53,980  -->  00:00:55,310
and then I'm gonna leave it.
19

19

00:00:55,310  -->  00:00:58,490
This L statement is where I'm actually gonna define
20

20

00:00:58,490  -->  00:01:01,563
the value for the percentage depending on the bill.
21

21

00:01:02,700  -->  00:01:07,700
So if the bill is less than 50,
22

22

00:01:10,000  -->  00:01:12,773
then the percentage should be 20.
23

23

00:01:13,680  -->  00:01:16,120
Or actually, it should be .2.
24

24

00:01:16,120  -->  00:01:18,090
So we could write 0.2, but we
25

25

00:01:18,090  -->  00:01:19,320
don't even need the zero here.
26

26

00:01:19,320  -->  00:01:21,850
So just .2, because that's actually the value
27

27

00:01:21,850  -->  00:01:24,670
that later we are going to multiply with the bill.
28

28

00:01:24,670  -->  00:01:27,720
Okay so remember, to complete %20 of a value,
29

29

00:01:27,720  -->  00:01:30,180
we multiply it by 0.2 in this case,
30

30

00:01:30,180  -->  00:01:32,063
because that's 20 divided by 100.
31

31

00:01:34,230  -->  00:01:37,763
Alright, so else if the bill is greater
32

32

00:01:37,763  -->  00:01:42,763
or equal to 50, end if the bill is less than 200.
33

33

00:01:45,560  -->  00:01:46,570
So that's very similar to the
34

34

00:01:46,570  -->  00:01:48,480
stuff that we already did before, right?
35

35

00:01:48,480  -->  00:01:50,983
So this should be nothing for you at this point.
36

36

00:01:53,470  -->  00:01:57,160
So in this case, our percentage is gonna be .15,
37

37

00:01:57,160  -->  00:02:01,590
and else, the percentage will be .0.
38

38

00:02:01,590  -->  00:02:03,730
Or actually, .1, sorry.
39

39

00:02:03,730  -->  00:02:06,980
So .1, which is 10%, okay.
40

40

00:02:06,980  -->  00:02:07,930
And in this case you don't even
41

41

00:02:07,930  -->  00:02:09,820
have to specify the if here,
42

42

00:02:09,820  -->  00:02:11,710
because if the bill is not less than 50
43

43

00:02:11,710  -->  00:02:14,310
and not between 50 and 200, well,
44

44

00:02:14,310  -->  00:02:16,510
then that means that it's more than 200.
45

45

00:02:16,510  -->  00:02:18,793
And so this here covers all of that.
46

46

00:02:20,790  -->  00:02:22,177
So all we have to do now is to return
47

47

00:02:22,177  -->  00:02:26,313
this percentage times the bill.
48

48

00:02:27,630  -->  00:02:30,870
So for example, if our bill was $100,
49

49

00:02:30,870  -->  00:02:33,220
then we would divide it with .15,
50

50

00:02:33,220  -->  00:02:35,190
which would then be $15.
51

51

00:02:35,190  -->  00:02:39,070
So we would return $15 from this tip calculator function.
52

52

00:02:39,070  -->  00:02:40,520
Alright, now you could, of course,
53

53

00:02:40,520  -->  00:02:41,980
have done this differently.
54

54

00:02:41,980  -->  00:02:44,290
For example, you could have done a switch
55

55

00:02:44,290  -->  00:02:48,343
like we did before for example, where is it?
56

56

00:02:49,980  -->  00:02:53,783
So something very similar to, here is it.
57

57

00:02:56,070  -->  00:02:57,620
So you could have done something similar to
58

58

00:02:57,620  -->  00:02:58,850
this one here for example as well,
59

59

00:02:58,850  -->  00:03:00,760
where in each case you would then
60

60

00:03:00,760  -->  00:03:04,315
return the bill times the current percentage.
61

61

00:03:04,315  -->  00:03:06,810
And if it works fine just like this.
62

62

00:03:06,810  -->  00:03:09,540
So just to tell that there are always different solutions
63

63

00:03:09,540  -->  00:03:12,020
for the same problems, okay?
64

64

00:03:12,020  -->  00:03:15,960
And now I just want to test this here with some value.
65

65

00:03:15,960  -->  00:03:19,450
So tip calculator, and let's set it to 100.
66

66

00:03:19,450  -->  00:03:21,000
And we need to console log it.
67

67

00:03:21,000  -->  00:03:23,060
So again this is just for testing to see
68

68

00:03:23,060  -->  00:03:26,313
if our function is actually working just fine.
69

69

00:03:28,441  -->  00:03:31,143
So this here should return 15, right?
70

70

00:03:32,380  -->  00:03:37,050
And indeed, it does, so that's 15% of 100,
71

71

00:03:37,050  -->  00:03:39,960
which is between 50 and 200.
72

72

00:03:39,960  -->  00:03:42,430
Now let's try it with 300,
73

73

00:03:42,430  -->  00:03:46,240
and we're gonna take 10% of that, which would be 30.
74

74

00:03:46,240  -->  00:03:49,870
So let's test, and indeed, it works.
75

75

00:03:49,870  -->  00:03:53,280
And now let's put, let's say, $10,
76

76

00:03:53,280  -->  00:03:55,090
which is of course, less than 50,
77

77

00:03:55,090  -->  00:03:58,053
and so two percent of that should be two dollars.
78

78

00:03:59,190  -->  00:04:01,460
And yeah, indeed it is two.
79

79

00:04:01,460  -->  00:04:03,020
And so that means that our tip
80

80

00:04:03,020  -->  00:04:04,940
calculator is actually working.
81

81

00:04:04,940  -->  00:04:06,730
So all we have to do now is to create
82

82

00:04:06,730  -->  00:04:10,136
these to erase as John wants the results.
83

83

00:04:10,136  -->  00:04:11,850
So the first thing I'm gonna do is to
84

84

00:04:11,850  -->  00:04:13,784
actually start a bills, and to an array,
85

85

00:04:13,784  -->  00:04:18,784
so we have 124, we have 48, and then 268 I believe.
86

86

00:04:23,600  -->  00:04:26,260
Let's just confirm that, and yeah.
87

87

00:04:26,260  -->  00:04:28,807
So these are the bills that we have,
88

88

00:04:28,807  -->  00:04:32,493
and then let's calculate the tips.
89

89

00:04:34,440  -->  00:04:38,240
So the first tip is calculated by using tip calculator
90

90

00:04:38,240  -->  00:04:42,710
with the bills on position number zero, right?
91

91

00:04:42,710  -->  00:04:44,180
Then a second one, and actually
92

92

00:04:44,180  -->  00:04:46,587
let's put it in a separate line here.
93

93

00:04:46,587  -->  00:04:50,020
So the second one is tip calculator
94

94

00:04:51,670  -->  00:04:56,110
bills on element one, and then finally,
95

95

00:04:56,110  -->  00:04:58,480
the last one is calculating the tip
96

96

00:04:58,480  -->  00:05:01,093
with bills at position number two.
97

97

00:05:03,050  -->  00:05:05,240
Okay, so it has created an array here
98

98

00:05:05,240  -->  00:05:07,640
which contains these three values,
99

99

00:05:07,640  -->  00:05:09,680
which all come from the result of
100

100

00:05:09,680  -->  00:05:13,250
calculating the tip using our tip calculator function.
101

101

00:05:13,250  -->  00:05:16,033
Alright, so let's log it to the console here,
102

102

00:05:22,120  -->  00:05:24,190
and so here we have our tips.
103

103

00:05:24,190  -->  00:05:26,730
Now this here is something weird that is happening
104

104

00:05:26,730  -->  00:05:29,110
with the 9.6 and 001,
105

105

00:05:29,110  -->  00:05:30,100
and this is something weird
106

106

00:05:30,100  -->  00:05:31,590
that javascript does with numbers,
107

107

00:05:31,590  -->  00:05:34,440
and no one really knows why this is happening.
108

108

00:05:34,440  -->  00:05:36,660
So it should just be 9.6,
109

109

00:05:36,660  -->  00:05:38,720
and the same is actually happening here with this
110

110

00:05:38,720  -->  00:05:43,280
59999998, and this of course, should be 18.6.
111

111

00:05:44,879  -->  00:05:46,450
But that's nothing we can change,
112

112

00:05:46,450  -->  00:05:49,410
that's not our fault so javascript just
113

113

00:05:49,410  -->  00:05:51,900
does these weird calculations here
114

114

00:05:51,900  -->  00:05:55,850
that do not really make sense, so don't worry about them.
115

115

00:05:55,850  -->  00:05:59,540
Okay so this is the first array that we want
116

116

00:05:59,540  -->  00:06:02,010
so the three tips, and then finally,
117

117

00:06:02,010  -->  00:06:05,720
we want one containing all three final paid amounts.
118

118

00:06:05,720  -->  00:06:07,893
And so that's also very easy,
119

119

00:06:09,350  -->  00:06:14,350
let's say final values, so another array.
120

120

00:06:14,650  -->  00:06:19,650
And here we have to say bills at position zero
121

121

00:06:19,800  -->  00:06:23,210
plus the tips at position zero.
122

122

00:06:23,210  -->  00:06:26,060
And that's it, so very simple.
123

123

00:06:26,060  -->  00:06:30,280
Let's just grab this here, and
124

124

00:06:30,280  -->  00:06:34,373
here it's one, and here it's two.
125

125

00:06:39,665  -->  00:06:40,508
And so this is actually all that we
126

126

00:06:40,508  -->  00:06:44,723
need to do in order to have our final results.
127

127

00:06:48,168  -->  00:06:50,250
Now you see that actually, here now we have
128

128

00:06:50,250  -->  00:06:53,720
this .6 and this .6 coming from these two.
129

129

00:06:53,720  -->  00:06:57,020
So this is really weird, again, don't worry about it.
130

130

00:06:57,020  -->  00:06:59,410
Anyway what we really wanna see here
131

131

00:06:59,410  -->  00:07:03,050
is that this 142.6 is really the sum
132

132

00:07:03,050  -->  00:07:07,990
of the original bill which is 124 plus this 18.6.
133

133

00:07:09,510  -->  00:07:11,280
And the same of course for the others.
134

134

00:07:11,280  -->  00:07:15,157
So 57.6 is 9.6 plus 48,
135

135

00:07:15,157  -->  00:07:17,533
and the same here for this last element.
136

136

00:07:18,685  -->  00:07:20,735
And with that the challenge is completed.
137

137

00:07:22,017  -->  00:07:24,140
And you could have done it very differently of course.
138

138

00:07:24,140  -->  00:07:26,070
For example, you could have declared empty arrays
139

139

00:07:26,070  -->  00:07:28,370
in the beginning and then use the push method
140

140

00:07:28,370  -->  00:07:30,870
to add all of these results to the array.
141

141

00:07:30,870  -->  00:07:33,140
But again, it's not really important that
142

142

00:07:33,140  -->  00:07:35,530
your code is the same as mine, okay?
143

143

00:07:35,530  -->  00:07:37,180
I cannot stress this enough.
144

144

00:07:37,180  -->  00:07:39,310
So what i really want here is to write code
145

145

00:07:39,310  -->  00:07:42,080
and to think about how to solve these problems.
146

146

00:07:42,080  -->  00:07:45,098
And if the results that you get are the same as mine,
147

147

00:07:45,098  -->  00:07:46,260
well then that's really fantastic.
148

148

00:07:46,260  -->  00:07:47,960
So you've come a long way in this section,
149

149

00:07:47,960  -->  00:07:51,110
but there's still a couple of more things to learn.
150

150

00:07:51,110  -->  00:07:52,373
So let's now move on.
