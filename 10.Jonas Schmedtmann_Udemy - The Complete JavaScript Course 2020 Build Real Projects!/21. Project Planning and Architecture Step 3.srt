<v Teacher>Welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:03,119  -->  00:00:06,851
Now that we have two out of three steps completed,
3

3

00:00:06,851  -->  00:00:11,230
let's look at what we have achieved so far.
4

4

00:00:11,230  -->  00:00:15,501
So, this is the updated version of our app's structure,
5

5

00:00:15,501  -->  00:00:18,760
and now, we also have the new functions and methods
6

6

00:00:18,760  -->  00:00:22,068
for deleting an item here that we just coded.
7

7

00:00:22,068  -->  00:00:25,122
So, this is an overview of everything that happens
8

8

00:00:25,122  -->  00:00:28,334
when a user clicks one of the Delete buttons.
9

9

00:00:28,334  -->  00:00:31,891
Now, this makes it visible why it was so important
10

10

00:00:31,891  -->  00:00:34,349
to create the updateBudget function,
11

11

00:00:34,349  -->  00:00:38,191
because it's used to update and display the budget changes
12

12

00:00:38,191  -->  00:00:41,583
after both adding and deleting an item.
13

13

00:00:41,583  -->  00:00:45,671
So, let's move on to planning the rest of our app.
14

14

00:00:45,671  -->  00:00:47,601
So, this is gonna be the last step
15

15

00:00:47,601  -->  00:00:49,633
in coding our application,
16

16

00:00:49,633  -->  00:00:52,322
and so what is still left to do?
17

17

00:00:52,322  -->  00:00:54,955
The first thing that comes to my mind
18

18

00:00:54,955  -->  00:00:58,943
is these percentages here that show how much each expense
19

19

00:00:58,943  -->  00:01:02,693
represents in percentage of the total income.
20

20

00:01:02,693  -->  00:01:06,396
So, that's the main thing that we're gonna take care of now.
21

21

00:01:06,396  -->  00:01:09,043
So, we calculate the percentages, and of course,
22

22

00:01:09,043  -->  00:01:11,879
update them in the User Interface.
23

23

00:01:11,879  -->  00:01:15,688
Another thing that we have left to do is to display
24

24

00:01:15,688  -->  00:01:19,955
the correct month and year at the top of our app,
25

25

00:01:19,955  -->  00:01:24,174
because currently, we only have some placeholder there.
26

26

00:01:24,174  -->  00:01:26,206
And there are actually a couple more things
27

27

00:01:26,206  -->  00:01:28,808
that we can do to improve our app,
28

28

00:01:28,808  -->  00:01:31,204
like getting this nice number formatting
29

29

00:01:31,204  -->  00:01:33,223
that we see all over the place here,
30

30

00:01:33,223  -->  00:01:36,795
and improve the user experience of the input fields,
31

31

00:01:36,795  -->  00:01:39,545
in order to make it more clear for inputting
32

32

00:01:39,545  -->  00:01:42,158
an income or an expense.
33

33

00:01:42,158  -->  00:01:46,101
Alright, so yet another to-do list for us to work on here.
34

34

00:01:46,101  -->  00:01:47,746
And after doing all of this,
35

35

00:01:47,746  -->  00:01:50,938
we're gonna be finished with our application.
36

36

00:01:50,938  -->  00:01:53,067
So, are you as excited as I am
37

37

00:01:53,067  -->  00:01:55,192
to continue with this right now?
38

38

00:01:55,192  -->  00:01:58,525
Then, join me right in the next lecture.
