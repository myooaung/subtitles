00:00:01.130  -->  00:00:01.963
<v Instructor>Let's now start to</v>
2

2

00:00:01.963  -->  00:00:03.940
implement the NBC architecture
3

3

00:00:03.940  -->  00:00:07.701
by building the model for our search functionality.
4

4

00:00:07.701  -->  00:00:09.350
In this lecture, you are going to learn
5

5

00:00:09.350  -->  00:00:11.710
how to build a simple data model
6

6

00:00:11.710  -->  00:00:14.893
using ES6 classes that we talked about before.
7

7

00:00:16.250  -->  00:00:18.537
We actually already have our model file
8

8

00:00:18.537  -->  00:00:20.500
for the search, so let's open it up
9

9

00:00:22.216  -->  00:00:24.450
so that we can build our model in here.
10

10

00:00:24.450  -->  00:00:26.820
We're going to use ES6 classes in order to
11

11

00:00:26.820  -->  00:00:30.130
describe the data model for the search.
12

12

00:00:30.130  -->  00:00:31.800
The data for the search is really just
13

13

00:00:31.800  -->  00:00:35.300
the query and then the search results.
14

14

00:00:35.300  -->  00:00:36.730
The only thing that we're gonna export
15

15

00:00:36.730  -->  00:00:40.530
from this module here will be this class.
16

16

00:00:40.530  -->  00:00:42.423
Let's say export default,
17

17

00:00:45.060  -->  00:00:47.313
and then class called search of course.
18

18

00:00:49.740  -->  00:00:52.270
Remember how we define a class?
19

19

00:00:52.270  -->  00:00:54.150
The first thing that we need to do
20

20

00:00:54.150  -->  00:00:56.600
is to always add the constructor method,
21

21

00:00:56.600  -->  00:00:58.440
which is a method that's always called
22

22

00:00:58.440  -->  00:01:01.803
as soon as we create a new object based on the class.
23

23

00:01:02.900  -->  00:01:04.890
We need the constructor, and in there
24

24

00:01:04.890  -->  00:01:06.310
we pass the properties that
25

25

00:01:06.310  -->  00:01:08.343
we want the new object to have.
26

26

00:01:09.700  -->  00:01:12.730
For example, in this case, we want to have a query
27

27

00:01:12.730  -->  00:01:17.340
and we then say this.query equals
28

28

00:01:17.340  -->  00:01:19.580
the query that we passed in.
29

29

00:01:19.580  -->  00:01:22.200
Remember this pattern, how we define a class?
30

30

00:01:22.200  -->  00:01:23.840
If not, then don't worry, it's gonna
31

31

00:01:23.840  -->  00:01:25.890
become a lot more clear once we
32

32

00:01:25.890  -->  00:01:28.313
start using this class here in a second.
33

33

00:01:29.873  -->  00:01:30.960
The second thing that's important
34

34

00:01:30.960  -->  00:01:34.310
about the search here is search results of course.
35

35

00:01:34.310  -->  00:01:36.210
We're gonna have a method here that we can
36

36

00:01:36.210  -->  00:01:39.113
use to get results for the search query.
37

37

00:01:40.570  -->  00:01:43.510
We actually already wrote that, kind of.
38

38

00:01:43.510  -->  00:01:45.450
Let's get this code from here that we wrote
39

39

00:01:45.450  -->  00:01:50.270
in the last lecture and put it here into search.
40

40

00:01:50.270  -->  00:01:51.450
This function that we have here
41

41

00:01:51.450  -->  00:01:54.603
is kind of the method that we're looking for.
42

42

00:01:56.080  -->  00:01:59.510
Let's copy it or cut it, paste it here,
43

43

00:01:59.510  -->  00:02:01.290
and then all we need to do is get rid
44

44

00:02:01.290  -->  00:02:03.530
of this function keyword because
45

45

00:02:03.530  -->  00:02:05.540
this is how we define methods.
46

46

00:02:05.540  -->  00:02:07.010
Usually you define them like this
47

47

00:02:07.010  -->  00:02:10.210
so just the method name and the parameters
48

48

00:02:10.210  -->  00:02:12.610
but in case that it's an async function
49

49

00:02:12.610  -->  00:02:14.160
and it works just the same as it
50

50

00:02:14.160  -->  00:02:16.650
works with regular functions, so we just used
51

51

00:02:16.650  -->  00:02:18.183
async keyword and so we say that
52

52

00:02:18.183  -->  00:02:21.583
this is an asynchronous method of this class.
53

53

00:02:23.420  -->  00:02:25.120
Of course we don't need this here.
54

54

00:02:27.000  -->  00:02:28.400
These definitions, they should always
55

55

00:02:28.400  -->  00:02:31.060
be at the beginning so this kind of import,
56

56

00:02:31.060  -->  00:02:33.170
we usually always include them right
57

57

00:02:33.170  -->  00:02:35.773
at the beginning of each of the modules.
58

58

00:02:37.000  -->  00:02:39.020
A couple of things that we need to change here.
59

59

00:02:39.020  -->  00:02:40.780
First off, this method here does not
60

60

00:02:40.780  -->  00:02:43.120
have any parameter because we will
61

61

00:02:43.120  -->  00:02:46.483
always read the query right from the object itself.
62

62

00:02:48.080  -->  00:02:51.520
In here, instead of query, we use this.query
63

63

00:02:51.520  -->  00:02:53.070
because the query will already be
64

64

00:02:53.070  -->  00:02:56.593
in the object once we call the get results method.
65

65

00:02:57.580  -->  00:02:59.800
Next up, we also need to change this line here
66

66

00:02:59.800  -->  00:03:02.670
because we actually want these recipes here
67

67

00:03:02.670  -->  00:03:05.872
to be saved in the object as well.
68

68

00:03:05.872  -->  00:03:08.320
Let's say that we want this.result
69

69

00:03:09.570  -->  00:03:13.863
to be the recipes that we got from the call.
70

70

00:03:13.863  -->  00:03:15.480
Again, this will become more clear
71

71

00:03:15.480  -->  00:03:19.593
in a second once we start using this method and this class.
72

72

00:03:20.711  -->  00:03:21.940
Then we can also log them to the console
73

73

00:03:21.940  -->  00:03:23.860
just to see if everything is working
74

74

00:03:23.860  -->  00:03:27.010
and that's actually it, okay?
75

75

00:03:27.010  -->  00:03:28.610
Very simple, this is all we need
76

76

00:03:28.610  -->  00:03:30.790
for our search data model.
77

77

00:03:30.790  -->  00:03:32.650
Let's now go ahead and import it here
78

78

00:03:32.650  -->  00:03:35.997
into the index, so import search,
79

79

00:03:41.791  -->  00:03:43.763
from search.
80

80

00:03:45.270  -->  00:03:46.780
Now let's create a new variable
81

81

00:03:47.785  -->  00:03:49.040
called search also but this one with
82

82

00:03:49.040  -->  00:03:52.293
the lower case and so it is a different variable.
83

83

00:03:54.229  -->  00:03:56.150
Now we use the new keyword, as always
84

84

00:03:58.800  -->  00:04:01.030
and pass pizza into it, which remember,
85

85

00:04:01.030  -->  00:04:03.990
is the query, so this query parameter
86

86

00:04:03.990  -->  00:04:05.720
is one that we need to specify
87

87

00:04:05.720  -->  00:04:07.530
whenever we create a new object
88

88

00:04:07.530  -->  00:04:10.460
based on this search class.
89

89

00:04:10.460  -->  00:04:13.280
Then this query will be attached to the object
90

90

00:04:13.280  -->  00:04:16.843
as being this.query equals the query that we inputted.
91

91

00:04:18.210  -->  00:04:20.023
Let's get a look at that actually.
92

92

00:04:26.280  -->  00:04:28.690
In the console, we can kind of review
93

93

00:04:28.690  -->  00:04:31.323
how everything works here with classes.
94

94

00:04:32.470  -->  00:04:35.540
Let's wait for it and of course,
95

95

00:04:35.540  -->  00:04:38.700
there is this error because I put the wrong
96

96

00:04:38.700  -->  00:04:41.883
path here, so I forgot to add the models here.
97

97

00:04:45.040  -->  00:04:48.460
Now it should be okay, and here you go.
98

98

00:04:48.460  -->  00:04:50.983
So this is now the search object
99

99

00:04:50.983  -->  00:04:53.440
that we created and you'll see that
100

100

00:04:53.440  -->  00:04:56.140
it has the query property set to pizza
101

101

00:04:56.140  -->  00:05:00.303
and then in its prototype it will have the get results.
102

102

00:05:01.733  -->  00:05:03.330
This is the kind of prototype inheritance
103

103

00:05:03.330  -->  00:05:05.000
that we talked about all the time
104

104

00:05:05.000  -->  00:05:06.490
throughout this course here and so
105

105

00:05:06.490  -->  00:05:08.360
I'm not going to go into that again
106

106

00:05:08.360  -->  00:05:09.460
because at this point I'm sure that
107

107

00:05:09.460  -->  00:05:12.043
you're really familiar with how it works.
108

108

00:05:13.240  -->  00:05:14.720
Now as a final test, let's actually
109

109

00:05:14.720  -->  00:05:18.483
go ahead and use the get results method.
110

110

00:05:20.575  -->  00:05:21.850
Search.getResults and that's actually it.
111

111

00:05:27.760  -->  00:05:30.823
Let's try it again and let's wait for the result.
112

112

00:05:31.950  -->  00:05:34.520
For some reason it says recipes is not defined,
113

113

00:05:34.520  -->  00:05:37.963
so let's take a look at what's happening here.
114

114

00:05:40.682  -->  00:05:41.893
Well, let's just console.log it here,
115

115

00:05:47.180  -->  00:05:52.113
just to see if, no, something's not working right.
116

116

00:05:55.510  -->  00:05:59.010
Okay, so actually we have data here
117

117

00:05:59.010  -->  00:06:01.840
so I'm not really sure why it's not working
118

118

00:06:01.840  -->  00:06:03.473
so let's try it again here,
119

119

00:06:04.780  -->  00:06:06.653
just waiting a second here.
120

120

00:06:09.850  -->  00:06:12.495
Recipes is not defined again, so let's go back
121

121

00:06:12.495  -->  00:06:15.793
and yeah, so the problem is actually here.
122

122

00:06:17.360  -->  00:06:20.523
Here we should have this.result.
123

123

00:06:21.950  -->  00:06:25.210
Now of course, it's going to work just fine.
124

124

00:06:25.210  -->  00:06:26.790
Wait for it, and here we go.
125

125

00:06:26.790  -->  00:06:28.930
Here's the data that we were looking for
126

126

00:06:28.930  -->  00:06:31.810
and so our data model works just fine.
127

127

00:06:31.810  -->  00:06:33.910
Let's get rid of this console.log
128

128

00:06:33.910  -->  00:06:35.920
and actually of this one here as well.
129

129

00:06:35.920  -->  00:06:39.210
Let's just comment it out, maybe we're gonna need it later.
130

130

00:06:39.210  -->  00:06:41.070
This is how our data model works.
131

131

00:06:41.070  -->  00:06:42.390
You see that instead of returning
132

132

00:06:42.390  -->  00:06:44.980
the result right away, it simply stores it
133

133

00:06:44.980  -->  00:06:48.180
here in this.result so that all the data
134

134

00:06:48.180  -->  00:06:51.670
about the search are encapsulated inside
135

135

00:06:51.670  -->  00:06:53.940
of the object, so we have both search
136

136

00:06:53.940  -->  00:06:56.330
and then the corresponding result
137

137

00:06:56.330  -->  00:06:59.940
both stored inside of the search object.
138

138

00:06:59.940  -->  00:07:01.720
This has some advantages that we're gonna
139

139

00:07:01.720  -->  00:07:03.570
talk about right in the next lecture.
