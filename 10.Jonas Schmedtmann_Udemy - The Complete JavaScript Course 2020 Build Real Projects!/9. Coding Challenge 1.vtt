00:00:01.230  -->  00:00:03.440
<v Instructor>Welcome to your first Coding Challenge</v>
2

2

00:00:03.440  -->  00:00:05.120
in this course.
3

3

00:00:05.120  -->  00:00:07.860
And so this is the challenge that I want you to take.
4

4

00:00:07.860  -->  00:00:10.420
So Mark and John are trying to compare their
5

5

00:00:10.420  -->  00:00:11.794
Body Mass Indexes, which is calculated by
6

6

00:00:11.794  -->  00:00:15.900
dividing the mass by the squared height.
7

7

00:00:15.900  -->  00:00:16.733
Okay?
8

8

00:00:16.733  -->  00:00:18.255
So this formula here.
9

9

00:00:18.255  -->  00:00:20.420
And to calculate the square of a number,
10

10

00:00:20.420  -->  00:00:22.880
you simply have to multiply it by itself.
11

11

00:00:22.880  -->  00:00:25.160
And so the final formula becomes
12

12

00:00:25.160  -->  00:00:27.980
mass divided by height times height.
13

13

00:00:27.980  -->  00:00:28.813
Okay?
14

14

00:00:28.813  -->  00:00:31.550
And here, note that the height must be in meters
15

15

00:00:31.550  -->  00:00:33.420
and the mass in kilograms.
16

16

00:00:33.420  -->  00:00:34.253
All right?
17

17

00:00:34.253  -->  00:00:36.420
Now the first step that you have to complete
18

18

00:00:36.420  -->  00:00:39.336
is to store Mark's and John's mass and heights
19

19

00:00:39.336  -->  00:00:41.080
in different variables.
20

20

00:00:41.080  -->  00:00:41.913
Okay?
21

21

00:00:41.913  -->  00:00:43.530
So just like we've been doing all this time
22

22

00:00:43.530  -->  00:00:44.770
up until this point.
23

23

00:00:44.770  -->  00:00:47.830
Then next up, calculate both their BMIs,
24

24

00:00:47.830  -->  00:00:50.340
then create a boolean variable containing information
25

25

00:00:50.340  -->  00:00:53.690
about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
26

26

00:00:53.690  -->  00:00:56.400
And so with that again, we did before.
27

27

00:00:56.400  -->  00:00:58.803
And then finally, you can print a string to the console
28

28

00:00:58.803  -->  00:01:02.780
saying something like, "Is Mark's BMI higher than John's?"
29

29

00:01:02.780  -->  00:01:05.170
And then the boolean that you created,
30

30

00:01:05.170  -->  00:01:07.480
or that you calculated in step three.
31

31

00:01:07.480  -->  00:01:08.313
Okay?
32

32

00:01:08.313  -->  00:01:09.300
So true or false.
33

33

00:01:09.300  -->  00:01:11.640
And so this is, again, very similar to something
34

34

00:01:11.640  -->  00:01:14.420
that we did before, and so this should be
35

35

00:01:14.420  -->  00:01:16.550
not a big problem to you, hopefully.
36

36

00:01:16.550  -->  00:01:17.970
Now if you find some problem here,
37

37

00:01:17.970  -->  00:01:19.420
if you cannot really solve it,
38

38

00:01:19.420  -->  00:01:21.720
then it's absolutely no problem here, okay?
39

39

00:01:21.720  -->  00:01:25.650
So don't beat yourself up if you're not able to 100%
40

40

00:01:25.650  -->  00:01:26.560
complete this.
41

41

00:01:26.560  -->  00:01:28.530
So everyone has different learning speeds
42

42

00:01:28.530  -->  00:01:29.660
and learning styles,
43

43

00:01:29.660  -->  00:01:32.940
and so it's really okay if you're not able to do it
44

44

00:01:32.940  -->  00:01:34.540
100% on your own here.
45

45

00:01:34.540  -->  00:01:35.373
Okay?
46

46

00:01:35.373  -->  00:01:37.762
So if you need to look up something that we did before,
47

47

00:01:37.762  -->  00:01:40.140
that's not a big deal, but you should really try
48

48

00:01:40.140  -->  00:01:42.810
to remember the stuff that we did before
49

49

00:01:42.810  -->  00:01:45.330
and use that to solve this challenge.
50

50

00:01:45.330  -->  00:01:46.163
Okay?
51

51

00:01:46.163  -->  00:01:48.810
Anyway, the solution to this is in the next video,
52

52

00:01:48.810  -->  00:01:51.460
where I'm gonna show you how I would calculate this.
53

53

00:01:51.460  -->  00:01:53.860
So good luck with this, and see you in the video
54

54

00:01:53.860  -->  00:01:55.910
after you complete this Coding Challenge.
