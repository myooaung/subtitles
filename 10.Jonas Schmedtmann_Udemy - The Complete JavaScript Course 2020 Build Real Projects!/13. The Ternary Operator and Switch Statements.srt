00:00:01,379  -->  00:00:02,580
<v Jonas>In this video, we will look</v>
2

2

00:00:02,580  -->  00:00:06,798
at some more ways of taking decisions with JavaScript.
3

3

00:00:06,798  -->  00:00:08,881
So you've learned about the if...else statement
4

4

00:00:08,881  -->  00:00:10,714
in order to take decisions, but
5

5

00:00:10,714  -->  00:00:13,021
there are more ways of doing this.
6

6

00:00:13,021  -->  00:00:14,423
And so the first thing that we're
7

7

00:00:14,423  -->  00:00:16,687
gonna look at is the ternary operator.
8

8

00:00:16,687  -->  00:00:19,105
Which is also called the conditional operator
9

9

00:00:19,105  -->  00:00:21,546
and it is an operator that basically allows us
10

10

00:00:21,546  -->  00:00:25,516
to write like an if...else statement all in one line.
11

11

00:00:25,516  -->  00:00:27,138
Let's take a look at how that works.
12

12

00:00:27,138  -->  00:00:30,531
And again, I'm bringing back my first name variable here.
13

13

00:00:30,531  -->  00:00:32,614
(typing)
14

14

00:00:34,107  -->  00:00:38,304
And then we're also gonna set the age to 16.
15

15

00:00:38,304  -->  00:00:40,262
And so now let's use the ternary operator,
16

16

00:00:40,262  -->  00:00:42,153
in order to log to the console,
17

17

00:00:42,153  -->  00:00:45,164
if John drinks a beer or if he drinks juice,
18

18

00:00:45,164  -->  00:00:47,582
depending on his age.
19

19

00:00:47,582  -->  00:00:48,415
Okay?
20

20

00:00:48,415  -->  00:00:52,482
So, let's say age greater or equal to 18,
21

21

00:00:52,482  -->  00:00:55,762
which is the legal age at which you could start drinking,
22

22

00:00:55,762  -->  00:00:58,035
at least in Europe, maybe not in the U.S.
23

23

00:00:58,035  -->  00:01:01,479
Okay? So we start here with the condition.
24

24

00:01:01,479  -->  00:01:03,334
Then, we use the question mark.
25

25

00:01:03,334  -->  00:01:05,477
And then we write, basically, what we want
26

26

00:01:05,477  -->  00:01:07,589
to happen if this condition is true.
27

27

00:01:07,589  -->  00:01:11,050
So this is like the if block, in an if...else statement.
28

28

00:01:11,050  -->  00:01:12,284
So in this case, we want to log
29

29

00:01:12,284  -->  00:01:13,909
to the console, console dot log,
30

30

00:01:13,909  -->  00:01:15,992
(typing)
31

31

00:01:21,028  -->  00:01:22,208
Drinks beer.
32

32

00:01:22,208  -->  00:01:23,975
Okay, so that is the first part.
33

33

00:01:23,975  -->  00:01:27,043
And now we also have to write the else block, okay?
34

34

00:01:27,043  -->  00:01:29,450
And so for that, we use the colon
35

35

00:01:29,450  -->  00:01:32,845
and then, let's actually go ahead and copy this part here.
36

36

00:01:32,845  -->  00:01:35,428
(mouse clicks)
37

37

00:01:37,179  -->  00:01:38,262
Drinks juice.
38

38

00:01:39,274  -->  00:01:40,850
Okay, and that's actually it.
39

39

00:01:40,850  -->  00:01:42,525
So this is the ternary operator.
40

40

00:01:42,525  -->  00:01:45,442
And it's called ternary, because it has three operands.
41

41

00:01:45,442  -->  00:01:48,815
So, basically three parts that interact with the operator.
42

42

00:01:48,815  -->  00:01:50,682
So we have the condition first,
43

43

00:01:50,682  -->  00:01:53,242
then we have the if block here, basically,
44

44

00:01:53,242  -->  00:01:55,276
and then the else block.
45

45

00:01:55,276  -->  00:01:57,409
So let's now test if that works.
46

46

00:01:57,409  -->  00:02:00,364
And indeed, it now says, John drinks juice.
47

47

00:02:00,364  -->  00:02:03,200
And that's because he is younger than 18.
48

48

00:02:03,200  -->  00:02:06,295
If we set it to 22 let's say, then it will say,
49

49

00:02:06,295  -->  00:02:08,203
John drinks beer.
50

50

00:02:08,203  -->  00:02:10,652
Okay, let's take a look at another example,
51

51

00:02:10,652  -->  00:02:12,531
because we can do even better and
52

52

00:02:12,531  -->  00:02:14,411
assign values to variable using
53

53

00:02:14,411  -->  00:02:17,327
the ternary operator in a very simple way.
54

54

00:02:17,327  -->  00:02:18,950
So let's say that we wanted to find
55

55

00:02:18,950  -->  00:02:22,260
a variable, saying what John can drink.
56

56

00:02:22,260  -->  00:02:25,312
So let's say var drink, and now we can use
57

57

00:02:25,312  -->  00:02:27,730
the conditional operator right here.
58

58

00:02:27,730  -->  00:02:30,397
So age greater or equal than 18.
59

59

00:02:31,922  -->  00:02:32,879
Then a question mark.
60

60

00:02:32,879  -->  00:02:34,528
So basically this is to ask a question.
61

61

00:02:34,528  -->  00:02:36,682
So, is John greater or equal than 18?
62

62

00:02:36,682  -->  00:02:40,099
And if he is, well then we can say, beer.
63

63

00:02:42,397  -->  00:02:46,023
And if he's not, then we can say, juice.
64

64

00:02:46,023  -->  00:02:47,090
And that's it.
65

65

00:02:47,090  -->  00:02:49,641
So basically the result of this entire code here,
66

66

00:02:49,641  -->  00:02:53,723
will be beer if the age is greater or equal than 18,
67

67

00:02:53,723  -->  00:02:56,019
and it will be juice if not.
68

68

00:02:56,019  -->  00:03:00,096
And this result will then be assigned to the drink variable.
69

69

00:03:00,096  -->  00:03:00,929
Okay?
70

70

00:03:00,929  -->  00:03:02,886
So again, this is an operator here again
71

71

00:03:02,886  -->  00:03:05,387
and so an operator always has a result just like
72

72

00:03:05,387  -->  00:03:08,548
we saw before with any of the other operators, okay?
73

73

00:03:08,548  -->  00:03:10,913
And so this operator, this ternary operator
74

74

00:03:10,913  -->  00:03:14,042
is executed of course, before the assignment operator.
75

75

00:03:14,042  -->  00:03:16,167
Remember? This one is also an operator.
76

76

00:03:16,167  -->  00:03:18,036
And so first, we execute this part
77

77

00:03:18,036  -->  00:03:21,377
which as a result will have either beer or juice
78

78

00:03:21,377  -->  00:03:23,095
and then that result will be assigned
79

79

00:03:23,095  -->  00:03:25,371
to the drink variable.
80

80

00:03:25,371  -->  00:03:26,761
And so let's log it to the console now,
81

81

00:03:26,761  -->  00:03:29,469
just to make sure that everything is working again.
82

82

00:03:29,469  -->  00:03:32,873
(mouse clicks)
83

83

00:03:32,873  -->  00:03:35,100
And indeed, it says beer.
84

84

00:03:35,100  -->  00:03:37,546
(mouse clicks)
85

85

00:03:37,546  -->  00:03:40,341
14 of course, he will drink juice.
86

86

00:03:40,341  -->  00:03:41,723
Now just to compare what we would
87

87

00:03:41,723  -->  00:03:44,060
have to do without the ternary operator,
88

88

00:03:44,060  -->  00:03:46,861
let's write out the same thing with an if...else statement.
89

89

00:03:46,861  -->  00:03:48,347
So we would have to write,
90

90

00:03:48,347  -->  00:03:50,430
(typing)
91

91

00:03:52,805  -->  00:03:57,805
so, var (typing) drink equals beer, in this case,
92

92

00:04:00,317  -->  00:04:01,628
and then the else plug
93

93

00:04:01,628  -->  00:04:03,711
(typing)
94

94

00:04:05,082  -->  00:04:06,749
and then here juice.
95

95

00:04:08,461  -->  00:04:09,300
Okay?
96

96

00:04:09,300  -->  00:04:12,620
And so that would be the alternative here of using this.
97

97

00:04:12,620  -->  00:04:14,530
And so what do you think looks better?
98

98

00:04:14,530  -->  00:04:17,386
Well it's obviously the ternary operator, right?
99

99

00:04:17,386  -->  00:04:18,666
At least I prefer it very much
100

100

00:04:18,666  -->  00:04:20,616
about having to write something like this,
101

101

00:04:20,616  -->  00:04:22,860
in case I'd be want something as simple
102

102

00:04:22,860  -->  00:04:25,002
as just assigning a value to a variable
103

103

00:04:25,002  -->  00:04:27,362
based on a simple condition like this, okay.
104

104

00:04:27,362  -->  00:04:29,595
So of course you're not going to do
105

105

00:04:29,595  -->  00:04:31,893
a ternary operator for a rather complex decision,
106

106

00:04:31,893  -->  00:04:34,525
but in case that we have something simple like this,
107

107

00:04:34,525  -->  00:04:36,618
well it's perfect to not have to
108

108

00:04:36,618  -->  00:04:38,526
use an if...else statement like this.
109

109

00:04:38,526  -->  00:04:39,695
So let me comment out this part here
110

110

00:04:39,695  -->  00:04:42,873
just so you know that this is the same.
111

111

00:04:42,873  -->  00:04:44,092
And alright.
112

112

00:04:44,092  -->  00:04:46,103
So we talked about the ternary operator,
113

113

00:04:46,103  -->  00:04:48,512
as an alternative way of writing conditionals
114

114

00:04:48,512  -->  00:04:50,248
but there is actually even more.
115

115

00:04:50,248  -->  00:04:52,208
And that is the switch statement.
116

116

00:04:52,208  -->  00:04:54,423
And this is like a huge if...else statement,
117

117

00:04:54,423  -->  00:04:57,389
where we have multiple else if clauses, basically,
118

118

00:04:57,389  -->  00:04:59,066
and so we can replace that with an easier
119

119

00:04:59,066  -->  00:05:01,199
to understand syntax, okay?
120

120

00:05:01,199  -->  00:05:02,702
Now I'm not a big fan of this myself,
121

121

00:05:02,702  -->  00:05:04,145
but you will see it around when you
122

122

00:05:04,145  -->  00:05:06,448
search for like tutorials on the web,
123

123

00:05:06,448  -->  00:05:07,941
and so it's important that you also
124

124

00:05:07,941  -->  00:05:09,721
know the switch statement.
125

125

00:05:09,721  -->  00:05:11,788
So let's add some comments here before we start.
126

126

00:05:11,788  -->  00:05:13,871
(typing)
127

127

00:05:15,121  -->  00:05:17,672
So, ternary operator, and then,
128

128

00:05:17,672  -->  00:05:19,755
(typing)
129

129

00:05:20,743  -->  00:05:22,998
the switch statement.
130

130

00:05:22,998  -->  00:05:25,802
Alright, so let's define a job here first.
131

131

00:05:25,802  -->  00:05:27,885
(typing)
132

132

00:05:28,739  -->  00:05:30,676
And let's say that John is a teacher.
133

133

00:05:30,676  -->  00:05:33,055
And so now we can use the switch statement.
134

134

00:05:33,055  -->  00:05:36,222
Give us some more space here. Alright.
135

135

00:05:37,537  -->  00:05:40,307
So we say switch, and in here between these parentheses,
136

136

00:05:40,307  -->  00:05:43,937
we put what we want to task, what we want to evaluate.
137

137

00:05:43,937  -->  00:05:45,876
Okay, and this will make a lot more sense
138

138

00:05:45,876  -->  00:05:48,366
after you see the entire switch statement.
139

139

00:05:48,366  -->  00:05:50,833
So for now just let's write the job here,
140

140

00:05:50,833  -->  00:05:53,263
and you will then understand why it works like this.
141

141

00:05:53,263  -->  00:05:55,111
So we switch the job, basically.
142

142

00:05:55,111  -->  00:05:58,493
And then, we can add a couple of case clauses.
143

143

00:05:58,493  -->  00:06:00,838
So we say case, and then we can say,
144

144

00:06:00,838  -->  00:06:03,458
(typing) for example, teacher.
145

145

00:06:03,458  -->  00:06:05,470
Then the colon, and then in the next line,
146

146

00:06:05,470  -->  00:06:07,714
we say what we want to happen.
147

147

00:06:07,714  -->  00:06:09,615
So in this case, let's say
148

148

00:06:09,615  -->  00:06:11,698
(typing)
149

149

00:06:12,552  -->  00:06:14,236
first name,
150

150

00:06:14,236  -->  00:06:16,319
(typing)
151

151

00:06:17,406  -->  00:06:19,873
teaches kids how to code.
152

152

00:06:19,873  -->  00:06:23,002
So, that's what a teacher does. Let's say.
153

153

00:06:23,002  -->  00:06:26,082
So again, if the job is equal to teacher,
154

154

00:06:26,082  -->  00:06:28,499
then this code here will be executed.
155

155

00:06:28,499  -->  00:06:29,332
Alright?
156

156

00:06:29,332  -->  00:06:30,720
Let's add a couple more.
157

157

00:06:30,720  -->  00:06:33,689
So case, driver, let's say, and now
158

158

00:06:33,689  -->  00:06:37,582
I'm just gonna grab this piece of code here.
159

159

00:06:37,582  -->  00:06:41,249
Let's say a driver drives an Uber in Lisbon.
160

160

00:06:42,230  -->  00:06:44,525
And so this is the basic functionality
161

161

00:06:44,525  -->  00:06:47,379
of the switch statement, okay?
162

162

00:06:47,379  -->  00:06:49,484
So we can add a couple of more cases even.
163

163

00:06:49,484  -->  00:06:51,445
So let's say we also want designer,
164

164

00:06:51,445  -->  00:06:53,452
(typing)
165

165

00:06:53,452  -->  00:06:55,356
and then again our console dot log.
166

166

00:06:55,356  -->  00:07:00,356
Let's say, (typing) designs beautiful websites.
167

167

00:07:01,759  -->  00:07:02,592
Alright.
168

168

00:07:02,592  -->  00:07:04,104
So what we're doing here is, again,
169

169

00:07:04,104  -->  00:07:07,822
to compare the job to each of these different cases.
170

170

00:07:07,822  -->  00:07:09,988
So if the job is teacher, then do this.
171

171

00:07:09,988  -->  00:07:12,080
If the job is driver, then do this.
172

172

00:07:12,080  -->  00:07:14,446
If the job is designer, well, then, do this.
173

173

00:07:14,446  -->  00:07:16,121
Now, what we have to do here also,
174

174

00:07:16,121  -->  00:07:18,393
is to add a break statement.
175

175

00:07:18,393  -->  00:07:20,851
So in here we have to say break, because otherwise,
176

176

00:07:20,851  -->  00:07:23,396
it will keep evaluating these next cases.
177

177

00:07:23,396  -->  00:07:25,388
Okay, so even if the job is teacher,
178

178

00:07:25,388  -->  00:07:28,730
it will then keep evaluating these other cases.
179

179

00:07:28,730  -->  00:07:30,531
It will keep basically looking at them
180

180

00:07:30,531  -->  00:07:32,014
and see if they are also true.
181

181

00:07:32,014  -->  00:07:33,423
But we don't want that to happen,
182

182

00:07:33,423  -->  00:07:35,172
and so we have to use the break key word
183

183

00:07:35,172  -->  00:07:38,701
at the end of this block that we want to execute.
184

184

00:07:38,701  -->  00:07:39,849
(typing)
185

185

00:07:39,849  -->  00:07:43,944
So, break. And here, break (typing) also.
186

186

00:07:43,944  -->  00:07:47,523
Now if none of this here applies, we can then add a default.
187

187

00:07:47,523  -->  00:07:50,625
Okay and so all we have to do is to say default.
188

188

00:07:50,625  -->  00:07:54,070
And then define what happens in that case.
189

189

00:07:54,070  -->  00:07:55,858
So in this case, well, let's just say
190

190

00:07:55,858  -->  00:07:59,632
that (typing) John does something else.
191

191

00:07:59,632  -->  00:08:01,426
And then here, of course, we don't need to break
192

192

00:08:01,426  -->  00:08:03,875
because it's already the last case here anyway.
193

193

00:08:03,875  -->  00:08:04,708
Okay?
194

194

00:08:04,708  -->  00:08:05,970
So if none of this applies, so these
195

195

00:08:05,970  -->  00:08:07,930
are basically like the else if,
196

196

00:08:07,930  -->  00:08:09,552
in the if...else statement,
197

197

00:08:09,552  -->  00:08:11,251
so in an if...else statement, this would be
198

198

00:08:11,251  -->  00:08:13,923
if job equals teacher, then do this,
199

199

00:08:13,923  -->  00:08:16,370
else if driver, then do this here,
200

200

00:08:16,370  -->  00:08:19,003
else if designer, then do this.
201

201

00:08:19,003  -->  00:08:21,503
And then else, do this. Right?
202

202

00:08:22,352  -->  00:08:24,103
And so this default here is basically
203

203

00:08:24,103  -->  00:08:26,784
our last else in an if...else statement.
204

204

00:08:26,784  -->  00:08:28,999
Alright? So let's try it out.
205

205

00:08:28,999  -->  00:08:30,758
And so, indeed, it now says that
206

206

00:08:30,758  -->  00:08:34,260
John teaches kids how to code, because he is a teacher.
207

207

00:08:34,260  -->  00:08:36,435
Now if we say that he's a driver,
208

208

00:08:36,435  -->  00:08:40,449
then of course, drives an Uber in Lisbon.
209

209

00:08:40,449  -->  00:08:43,274
Now let's say that he is cop, and so now
210

210

00:08:43,274  -->  00:08:46,524
none of these applies, and so we should end up with,
211

211

00:08:46,524  -->  00:08:48,525
John does something else.
212

212

00:08:48,525  -->  00:08:49,358
Great.
213

213

00:08:49,358  -->  00:08:51,352
Now we can also have multiple case clauses
214

214

00:08:51,352  -->  00:08:53,973
for the same piece of code that we want to execute.
215

215

00:08:53,973  -->  00:08:55,871
So for example, if you want to execute
216

216

00:08:55,871  -->  00:08:58,219
this code here, if the job is a teacher,
217

217

00:08:58,219  -->  00:09:00,393
or also, let's say instructor,
218

218

00:09:00,393  -->  00:09:03,856
then we can add simply another case here.
219

219

00:09:03,856  -->  00:09:05,168
So case,
220

220

00:09:05,168  -->  00:09:06,945
(typing)
221

221

00:09:06,945  -->  00:09:10,096
instructor, and then this piece of code here
222

222

00:09:10,096  -->  00:09:13,512
will also be executed if we say instructor.
223

223

00:09:13,512  -->  00:09:16,826
Just to finish, let's try out that.
224

224

00:09:16,826  -->  00:09:20,207
And yeah, so it still works here as it should.
225

225

00:09:20,207  -->  00:09:22,137
So this is here again, a simple way
226

226

00:09:22,137  -->  00:09:25,298
of replacing a huge if...else statement.
227

227

00:09:25,298  -->  00:09:27,167
For example, something like this,
228

228

00:09:27,167  -->  00:09:28,732
where we have this if, and then
229

229

00:09:28,732  -->  00:09:31,231
else if, else if, and then else.
230

230

00:09:31,231  -->  00:09:32,560
Or it could be even longer, and so
231

231

00:09:32,560  -->  00:09:35,405
sometimes a switch statement looks a bit cleaner
232

232

00:09:35,405  -->  00:09:37,997
than having all of these blocks like this.
233

233

00:09:37,997  -->  00:09:38,830
Okay?
234

234

00:09:38,830  -->  00:09:40,760
And actually, since we're working on it,
235

235

00:09:40,760  -->  00:09:42,674
let's actually go ahead, copy this piece of code,
236

236

00:09:42,674  -->  00:09:45,809
and try to replace this if...else statement here
237

237

00:09:45,809  -->  00:09:47,446
with a switch, because that's actually
238

238

00:09:47,446  -->  00:09:49,242
gonna work in a slightly different way,
239

239

00:09:49,242  -->  00:09:50,482
and so it's a great opportunity
240

240

00:09:50,482  -->  00:09:52,656
to show you how that could work.
241

241

00:09:52,656  -->  00:09:54,789
So this first switch that I showed you here,
242

242

00:09:54,789  -->  00:09:56,975
basically simply switches a variable
243

243

00:09:56,975  -->  00:09:59,981
and compares all of these cases to that variable.
244

244

00:09:59,981  -->  00:10:01,912
But here we have this number ranges,
245

245

00:10:01,912  -->  00:10:03,485
and so it works slightly different,
246

246

00:10:03,485  -->  00:10:06,158
and so it's a great exercise to do this one here as well.
247

247

00:10:06,158  -->  00:10:09,804
So, to translate it, basically to a switch statement.
248

248

00:10:09,804  -->  00:10:13,513
So in this case what we want to switch, is true.
249

249

00:10:13,513  -->  00:10:15,261
Okay, so we basically want to compare
250

250

00:10:15,261  -->  00:10:17,089
each of the expressions below,
251

251

00:10:17,089  -->  00:10:19,446
that we're gonna put here in a second, to true.
252

252

00:10:19,446  -->  00:10:22,270
And this is a trick to simply make the switch work
253

253

00:10:22,270  -->  00:10:24,492
as an if...else statement with ranges.
254

254

00:10:24,492  -->  00:10:28,825
So, our first case will be, case, age, less than 13.
255

255

00:10:31,521  -->  00:10:33,688
And, in that case, it will then
256

256

00:10:33,688  -->  00:10:35,944
log this piece to the console,
257

257

00:10:35,944  -->  00:10:38,250
and then don't forget to break.
258

258

00:10:38,250  -->  00:10:40,504
(typing)
259

259

00:10:40,504  -->  00:10:42,324
Okay, then the next case is this one,
260

260

00:10:42,324  -->  00:10:43,806
and let's actually go ahead and copy it,
261

261

00:10:43,806  -->  00:10:47,281
because we already know how it works at this point,
262

262

00:10:47,281  -->  00:10:50,074
and then log this here to the console.
263

263

00:10:50,074  -->  00:10:54,921
So that John is a teenager, and then let's break out of it.
264

264

00:10:54,921  -->  00:10:56,729
So let's complete the code here, and then
265

265

00:10:56,729  -->  00:11:00,562
take a closer look at it and see how it works.
266

266

00:11:01,706  -->  00:11:02,705
Okay?
267

267

00:11:02,705  -->  00:11:05,455
So, for this case, we want to log
268

268

00:11:07,110  -->  00:11:11,402
this part into your console, then break out of it.
269

269

00:11:11,402  -->  00:11:13,961
And now finally, we have the else part here.
270

270

00:11:13,961  -->  00:11:15,375
And so for the else part, we are
271

271

00:11:15,375  -->  00:11:18,792
going to use such as before, the default.
272

272

00:11:19,627  -->  00:11:23,377
So default, and then, log that John is a man.
273

273

00:11:26,871  -->  00:11:28,656
Alright? And so that's actually it.
274

274

00:11:28,656  -->  00:11:30,194
So we can get rid of this, and so
275

275

00:11:30,194  -->  00:11:34,256
we already translated it here to the switch statement.
276

276

00:11:34,256  -->  00:11:37,142
So we now have all of these conditions here, basically,
277

277

00:11:37,142  -->  00:11:41,130
not as strings, as we had before, so in this case here,
278

278

00:11:41,130  -->  00:11:43,441
and this is the more usual case
279

279

00:11:43,441  -->  00:11:45,459
of using the switch statement, okay?
280

280

00:11:45,459  -->  00:11:47,307
So where we have like a string
281

281

00:11:47,307  -->  00:11:49,948
that we want to compare with some variable.
282

282

00:11:49,948  -->  00:11:52,206
In this case here, we have basically
283

283

00:11:52,206  -->  00:11:54,105
this logical expressions here,
284

284

00:11:54,105  -->  00:11:56,743
that will turn out to be either true or false.
285

285

00:11:56,743  -->  00:11:59,031
And so for example, if this here turns out to be true,
286

286

00:11:59,031  -->  00:12:01,129
so if the age is between 13 and 20,
287

287

00:12:01,129  -->  00:12:02,760
well then this here is true and
288

288

00:12:02,760  -->  00:12:04,546
all of the others are false.
289

289

00:12:04,546  -->  00:12:06,683
And remember that we switched true.
290

290

00:12:06,683  -->  00:12:08,319
And so the case that will be true
291

291

00:12:08,319  -->  00:12:10,794
will then be the one that is executed.
292

292

00:12:10,794  -->  00:12:12,205
Okay so let's try that out.
293

293

00:12:12,205  -->  00:12:17,141
And the age I think is not, actually it is defined as 14.
294

294

00:12:17,141  -->  00:12:18,593
Let's put it again here.
295

295

00:12:18,593  -->  00:12:20,767
So we don't have to go up and down to test this.
296

296

00:12:20,767  -->  00:12:24,280
So let's say that he is 10 now, and so let's check it out.
297

297

00:12:24,280  -->  00:12:26,280
So John is a boy. Great.
298

298

00:12:27,167  -->  00:12:31,020
Change it to 17, now he's a teenager.
299

299

00:12:31,020  -->  00:12:33,187
Now 22 again, a young man.
300

300

00:12:34,060  -->  00:12:36,484
(mouse click)
301

301

00:12:36,484  -->  00:12:37,398
And, a man.
302

302

00:12:37,398  -->  00:12:39,509
So all of these now work.
303

303

00:12:39,509  -->  00:12:42,170
So these are two ways of using switch statements,
304

304

00:12:42,170  -->  00:12:43,708
and they can be useful again in case
305

305

00:12:43,708  -->  00:12:46,047
that we have a long if...else statement
306

306

00:12:46,047  -->  00:12:47,925
with lots of else if's.
307

307

00:12:47,925  -->  00:12:50,823
So this can look a bit cleaner here. Alright.
308

308

00:12:50,823  -->  00:12:52,785
And so that's three ways in which
309

309

00:12:52,785  -->  00:12:54,823
we can write conditional code.
310

310

00:12:54,823  -->  00:12:57,059
So the if...else statement, the ternary operator,
311

311

00:12:57,059  -->  00:12:59,142
and the switch statement.
