00:00:01,280  -->  00:00:03,153
<v Instructor>Alright, here goes the second part</v>
2

2

00:00:03,153  -->  00:00:05,903
for our current coding challenge.
3

3

00:00:07,465  -->  00:00:10,317
So this time our task is to add an input field
4

4

00:00:10,317  -->  00:00:13,545
to the html where players can set the winning score,
5

5

00:00:13,545  -->  00:00:16,521
and then we can use the value of that in our code.
6

6

00:00:16,521  -->  00:00:18,404
So let's start by doing that.
7

7

00:00:18,404  -->  00:00:22,306
And I'm going to put right down here.
8

8

00:00:22,306  -->  00:00:26,468
So what we need here in an input element.
9

9

00:00:26,468  -->  00:00:28,885
So input, and a type of text,
10

10

00:00:31,148  -->  00:00:32,481
so text.
11

11

00:00:32,481  -->  00:00:34,689
We also want a placeholder here,
12

12

00:00:34,689  -->  00:00:37,272
which tells us the final score.
13

13

00:00:40,163  -->  00:00:44,330
And let's just call it with a class, final score as well.
14

14

00:00:45,276  -->  00:00:46,740
Alright, so really simple.
15

15

00:00:46,740  -->  00:00:49,602
And now we also have to style it in our CSS,
16

16

00:00:49,602  -->  00:00:52,754
in order to make it visible.
17

17

00:00:52,754  -->  00:00:55,332
And I'll just put it here at the top.
18

18

00:00:55,332  -->  00:00:59,052
So the class selector, and then final score.
19

19

00:00:59,052  -->  00:01:01,802
So this will be a bit of CSS.
20

20

00:01:01,802  -->  00:01:04,684
I'm not going to really explain this,
21

21

00:01:04,684  -->  00:01:09,003
I'm just writing the CSS that is necessary to style this,
22

22

00:01:09,003  -->  00:01:11,226
also based on the rest of the code
23

23

00:01:11,226  -->  00:01:14,393
that it already has here in this file.
24

24

00:01:16,857  -->  00:01:19,080
So this is a nice little technique
25

25

00:01:19,080  -->  00:01:21,163
to center it in the page.
26

26

00:01:23,353  -->  00:01:26,020
Translate x minus 50 percent.
27

27

00:01:29,317  -->  00:01:33,150
Okay and from the top I want it at 520 pixels.
28

28

00:01:37,110  -->  00:01:40,860
The color's the same as the rest of the page.
29

29

00:01:42,300  -->  00:01:44,800
Font size should be 18 pixels.
30

30

00:01:46,601  -->  00:01:49,606
And we also need to set the font family for this one,
31

31

00:01:49,606  -->  00:01:51,476
which is Lato in this case.
32

32

00:01:51,476  -->  00:01:54,059
We want the text in the center.
33

33

00:01:54,918  -->  00:01:58,501
And also some padding, let's say 10 pixels.
34

34

00:01:59,789  -->  00:02:03,039
And we want the width to be 160 pixels.
35

35

00:02:06,907  -->  00:02:10,544
And we also want a text transform of uppercase,
36

36

00:02:10,544  -->  00:02:14,092
so you see that I care a lot about design.
37

37

00:02:14,092  -->  00:02:17,884
So this really has to look the way that I want it to be.
38

38

00:02:17,884  -->  00:02:20,886
So let's now reload and see how this looks.
39

39

00:02:20,886  -->  00:02:23,386
So here's now our input field.
40

40

00:02:24,897  -->  00:02:28,860
Let's just remove this weird blue border here
41

41

00:02:28,860  -->  00:02:31,869
that we have when we focus it.
42

42

00:02:31,869  -->  00:02:33,536
So final score focus
43

43

00:02:37,196  -->  00:02:38,363
outline, none.
44

44

00:02:40,714  -->  00:02:43,714
Okay, so now back to our JavaScript.
45

45

00:02:44,754  -->  00:02:46,677
And a question to ask here
46

46

00:02:46,677  -->  00:02:50,004
is where are we actually going to use this value?
47

47

00:02:50,004  -->  00:02:52,434
So the value that the users write in there, the number,
48

48

00:02:52,434  -->  00:02:54,769
where are we going to use it?
49

49

00:02:54,769  -->  00:02:57,916
And the answer is, it will be in the part of the code
50

50

00:02:57,916  -->  00:03:00,209
which checks if the game is finished,
51

51

00:03:00,209  -->  00:03:03,529
which checks if someone won the game.
52

52

00:03:03,529  -->  00:03:06,796
And this is exactly in the function associated
53

53

00:03:06,796  -->  00:03:09,967
with the event handler, which handles the event
54

54

00:03:09,967  -->  00:03:12,643
that someone clicks on the hold button.
55

55

00:03:12,643  -->  00:03:13,546
So it's right here.
56

56

00:03:13,546  -->  00:03:17,809
So right now we simply assume that the winning score is 100.
57

57

00:03:17,809  -->  00:03:20,618
But now we want to read this value from the input field
58

58

00:03:20,618  -->  00:03:22,035
and use that one.
59

59

00:03:23,475  -->  00:03:26,556
Let me just edit here in the code.
60

60

00:03:26,556  -->  00:03:30,139
So I'm going to call it input, very simple.
61

61

00:03:31,658  -->  00:03:35,825
So I'm going to select it, using the query selector.
62

62

00:03:36,803  -->  00:03:39,886
We know that it's called final score.
63

63

00:03:41,436  -->  00:03:43,990
And now instead of using text content
64

64

00:03:43,990  -->  00:03:46,457
or inner html or something like that,
65

65

00:03:46,457  -->  00:03:49,522
I simply used the value property.
66

66

00:03:49,522  -->  00:03:52,216
And this will give me the content that the user
67

67

00:03:52,216  -->  00:03:55,165
put into this input field.
68

68

00:03:55,165  -->  00:03:57,108
And just to see how this works,
69

69

00:03:57,108  -->  00:04:01,434
let's console log this result to our console.
70

70

00:04:01,434  -->  00:04:02,267
So input.
71

71

00:04:04,273  -->  00:04:07,407
Alright so let's now just check this out.
72

72

00:04:07,407  -->  00:04:11,010
We'll reload this, open up our console,
73

73

00:04:11,010  -->  00:04:14,115
doesn't have to be this big.
74

74

00:04:14,115  -->  00:04:16,948
Okay let's play the game and hold.
75

75

00:04:17,938  -->  00:04:19,824
And now we don't have anything here,
76

76

00:04:19,824  -->  00:04:22,157
because this is empty right.
77

77

00:04:23,476  -->  00:04:25,426
So if we continue playing,
78

78

00:04:25,426  -->  00:04:27,445
we will always have this empty here.
79

79

00:04:27,445  -->  00:04:29,640
So now it's twice the empty,
80

80

00:04:29,640  -->  00:04:32,369
because we already clicked to times here on hold.
81

81

00:04:32,369  -->  00:04:35,154
Now let's put 50 here or something,
82

82

00:04:35,154  -->  00:04:38,284
continue to roll the dice, and click hold,
83

83

00:04:38,284  -->  00:04:41,534
and now, it's 50 down here, cool right?
84

84

00:04:43,220  -->  00:04:45,710
So we can continue to roll and hold
85

85

00:04:45,710  -->  00:04:48,877
and then change this value to 100.
86

86

00:04:48,877  -->  00:04:51,515
Roll the dice, hold, and now it's 200.
87

87

00:04:51,515  -->  00:04:53,893
So the winning score by now would be 200.
88

88

00:04:53,893  -->  00:04:58,316
So the players can even change this during the game.
89

89

00:04:58,316  -->  00:05:01,070
Alright so let's now use this value.
90

90

00:05:01,070  -->  00:05:04,494
So don't need this anymore, and alright.
91

91

00:05:04,494  -->  00:05:06,613
Now what happens if the users
92

92

00:05:06,613  -->  00:05:09,933
don't put any input into that field?
93

93

00:05:09,933  -->  00:05:12,180
Then we don't want to use the value right?
94

94

00:05:12,180  -->  00:05:15,541
So we first have to actually check if there is a value.
95

95

00:05:15,541  -->  00:05:18,871
So we need to check if the input variable is not empty.
96

96

00:05:18,871  -->  00:05:21,821
And that's actually also pretty easy to do.
97

97

00:05:21,821  -->  00:05:24,823
And that's because once again type coercion.
98

98

00:05:24,823  -->  00:05:26,479
And I will actually write it down,
99

99

00:05:26,479  -->  00:05:30,646
which is that all the values of undefined, zero, null,
100

100

00:05:32,844  -->  00:05:35,844
or even the empty string, like this,
101

101

00:05:36,694  -->  00:05:38,444
are coerced to false.
102

102

00:05:42,070  -->  00:05:45,258
So if we have a condition like in an if statement,
103

103

00:05:45,258  -->  00:05:48,712
and I'm actually going to write it.
104

104

00:05:48,712  -->  00:05:51,556
So if we have something like this,
105

105

00:05:51,556  -->  00:05:53,333
so a condition here,
106

106

00:05:53,333  -->  00:05:56,541
then JavaScript will try to coerce this value here
107

107

00:05:56,541  -->  00:05:59,246
to a true or false value, so to a boolean.
108

108

00:05:59,246  -->  00:06:01,918
And in case that the variable that we have here
109

109

00:06:01,918  -->  00:06:04,676
is set to undefined, to zero, to null,
110

110

00:06:04,676  -->  00:06:06,179
or to the empty string,
111

111

00:06:06,179  -->  00:06:09,494
then these are coerced to false.
112

112

00:06:09,494  -->  00:06:10,911
And anything else
113

113

00:06:13,428  -->  00:06:15,011
is coerced to true.
114

114

00:06:17,901  -->  00:06:20,722
So if we would check this with something else,
115

115

00:06:20,722  -->  00:06:22,765
for example with the scores variable,
116

116

00:06:22,765  -->  00:06:26,068
so if scores, then this would return true.
117

117

00:06:26,068  -->  00:06:28,390
Because it's not undefined, not null,
118

118

00:06:28,390  -->  00:06:31,871
and not zero, and also not an empty string.
119

119

00:06:31,871  -->  00:06:35,188
In this case, the value of this input
120

120

00:06:35,188  -->  00:06:38,106
when the user doesn't put anything into the field
121

121

00:06:38,106  -->  00:06:41,028
is actually the empty string.
122

122

00:06:41,028  -->  00:06:44,191
So we only want to use this input
123

123

00:06:44,191  -->  00:06:46,310
if it's not an empty string.
124

124

00:06:46,310  -->  00:06:48,574
So when it's true, and down here,
125

125

00:06:48,574  -->  00:06:51,773
in this if statement, we actually already have that.
126

126

00:06:51,773  -->  00:06:55,103
So if there is an input, so if input is true,
127

127

00:06:55,103  -->  00:06:57,558
then we want to do something.
128

128

00:06:57,558  -->  00:06:59,673
And that something is to create a new variable
129

129

00:06:59,673  -->  00:07:01,423
called winning score.
130

130

00:07:02,796  -->  00:07:06,879
Winning score, in which we then store that input.
131

131

00:07:11,301  -->  00:07:13,588
And we need to do that because
132

132

00:07:13,588  -->  00:07:16,280
in the case that we don't have an input,
133

133

00:07:16,280  -->  00:07:19,213
we can store something else in that variable.
134

134

00:07:19,213  -->  00:07:22,630
So winning score is then the original 100
135

135

00:07:23,805  -->  00:07:26,365
that we defined before.
136

136

00:07:26,365  -->  00:07:28,884
And so now instead of always using 100 here,
137

137

00:07:28,884  -->  00:07:30,967
we use the winning score.
138

138

00:07:32,678  -->  00:07:34,079
And of course this variable the finishing
139

139

00:07:34,079  -->  00:07:35,978
should not happen here,
140

140

00:07:35,978  -->  00:07:38,895
but outside from this if statement.
141

141

00:07:40,575  -->  00:07:42,908
So I'm just putting it here.
142

142

00:07:44,585  -->  00:07:46,808
And alright, here we go, so once again,
143

143

00:07:46,808  -->  00:07:48,729
when there is an input,
144

144

00:07:48,729  -->  00:07:51,732
which means that when the input is coerced to true
145

145

00:07:51,732  -->  00:07:54,198
because it's not the empty string,
146

146

00:07:54,198  -->  00:07:56,997
then the winning score will be set to the value
147

147

00:07:56,997  -->  00:07:59,981
that we just read from our input field.
148

148

00:07:59,981  -->  00:08:02,181
But if there is no input,
149

149

00:08:02,181  -->  00:08:05,302
then the winning score should be 100,
150

150

00:08:05,302  -->  00:08:09,124
and we can then use that winning score down here.
151

151

00:08:09,124  -->  00:08:11,149
So let's now check this in action.
152

152

00:08:11,149  -->  00:08:14,149
Reload our page and input a 10 here.
153

153

00:08:16,102  -->  00:08:19,898
So this should be a really quick game, alright.
154

154

00:08:19,898  -->  00:08:22,516
And yes it works, so we have a winner here.
155

155

00:08:22,516  -->  00:08:26,137
Nothing else works, so the game has finished as usual,
156

156

00:08:26,137  -->  00:08:29,981
and so we can now try this out with another value.
157

157

00:08:29,981  -->  00:08:34,707
So we could even start without anything holding,
158

158

00:08:34,707  -->  00:08:38,874
holding again, and then setting it to say 20 or 25.
159

159

00:08:47,228  -->  00:08:49,916
And we still don't have a winner,
160

160

00:08:49,916  -->  00:08:51,019
but now we should have.
161

161

00:08:51,019  -->  00:08:54,348
And yes, player two won the game, alright.
162

162

00:08:54,348  -->  00:08:56,725
So challenge two completed.
163

163

00:08:56,725  -->  00:08:58,966
For solution of challenge number three,
164

164

00:08:58,966  -->  00:09:01,133
just go to the next video.
