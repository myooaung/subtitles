<v Narrator>Welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:02,288  -->  00:00:03,276
So, in this lecture, we're gonna get
3

3

00:00:03,276  -->  00:00:04,371
a quick overview of
4

4

00:00:04,371  -->  00:00:07,236
what's new in ES6 or ES2017,
5

5

00:00:07,236  -->  00:00:09,017
which is actually the official name.
6

6

00:00:09,017  -->  00:00:10,864
But everyone just calls it ES6,
7

7

00:00:10,864  -->  00:00:13,281
simply because it came right after ES5.
8

8

00:00:13,281  -->  00:00:14,263
And, so that's what I'm gonna
9

9

00:00:14,263  -->  00:00:16,810
do for the rest of the course.
10

10

00:00:16,810  -->  00:00:18,568
So, before we start, just a quick
11

11

00:00:18,568  -->  00:00:20,166
recap of what we already talked
12

12

00:00:20,166  -->  00:00:22,173
about right in the first section.
13

13

00:00:22,173  -->  00:00:24,104
So right now we have all these modern
14

14

00:00:24,104  -->  00:00:25,889
javascript versions that we can use
15

15

00:00:25,889  -->  00:00:28,025
in production, as long as we transpile
16

16

00:00:28,025  -->  00:00:31,897
and polyfill the codes back to ES5, right?
17

17

00:00:31,897  -->  00:00:34,198
And I'm going to show you how to do exactly that
18

18

00:00:34,198  -->  00:00:36,637
in one of the next sections, okay?
19

19

00:00:36,637  -->  00:00:39,290
So we're actually going to use ES7 and ES8
20

20

00:00:39,290  -->  00:00:41,822
also in the next sections, but for now I want to
21

21

00:00:41,822  -->  00:00:44,737
start by really focusing on ES6 in this
22

22

00:00:44,737  -->  00:00:46,824
section, because remember, that's the
23

23

00:00:46,824  -->  00:00:48,925
version that brought us a ton of updates
24

24

00:00:48,925  -->  00:00:52,187
and new features to a language.
25

25

00:00:52,187  -->  00:00:53,565
And so here is what we're going
26

26

00:00:53,565  -->  00:00:55,565
to cover in this section.
27

27

00:00:55,565  -->  00:00:57,348
So we'll start with the two new
28

28

00:00:57,348  -->  00:00:58,773
ways of declaring variables in
29

29

00:00:58,773  -->  00:01:00,932
javascript and that's let and const,
30

30

00:01:00,932  -->  00:01:03,086
and then move on to blocks and IIFEs,
31

31

00:01:03,086  -->  00:01:05,427
use string methods, and then arrow
32

32

00:01:05,427  -->  00:01:08,645
functions which is a ute and amazing topic.
33

33

00:01:08,645  -->  00:01:10,136
After that we're gonna talk about
34

34

00:01:10,136  -->  00:01:12,250
destructuring, new array methods,
35

35

00:01:12,250  -->  00:01:13,745
the spread operator,
36

36

00:01:13,745  -->  00:01:16,126
and rest and default parameters
37

37

00:01:16,126  -->  00:01:17,759
before we finally move on to the
38

38

00:01:17,759  -->  00:01:19,041
big and important topics of
39

39

00:01:19,041  -->  00:01:21,378
maps, classes, and subclasses.
40

40

00:01:21,378  -->  00:01:23,274
Now there are two other extremely
41

41

00:01:23,274  -->  00:01:25,399
important ES6 features that we're gonna
42

42

00:01:25,399  -->  00:01:26,599
talk about a bit later because they
43

43

00:01:26,599  -->  00:01:28,287
need some more background knowledge
44

44

00:01:28,287  -->  00:01:30,214
and that is promises for dealing
45

45

00:01:30,214  -->  00:01:32,126
with asynchronous javascript and
46

46

00:01:32,126  -->  00:01:33,895
native javascript modules to a
47

47

00:01:33,895  -->  00:01:36,790
separate or code into different files, okay?
48

48

00:01:36,790  -->  00:01:39,188
Alright, and so that's it for the intro.
49

49

00:01:39,188  -->  00:01:42,355
Let's now move on to the real coding.
