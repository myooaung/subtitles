00:00:01.655  -->  00:00:05.397
<v Instructor>Welcome to the last lecture of this project.</v>
2

2

00:00:05.397  -->  00:00:08.229
All that's left to do is to make some finishing touches
3

3

00:00:08.229  -->  00:00:10.744
on our app, and so we're going to polish
4

4

00:00:10.744  -->  00:00:14.494
our user interface even more in this lecture.
5

5

00:00:15.415  -->  00:00:17.117
And in this lecture, you're still going
6

6

00:00:17.117  -->  00:00:19.563
to learn something new, and that's how and when
7

7

00:00:19.563  -->  00:00:21.313
to use change events.
8

8

00:00:22.730  -->  00:00:24.754
So what we want to do in this lecture
9

9

00:00:24.754  -->  00:00:28.647
is to improve the user experience here of our input form.
10

10

00:00:28.647  -->  00:00:32.657
So right now when we hit this select field here,
11

11

00:00:32.657  -->  00:00:36.327
then the outline of this element here is blue, right?
12

12

00:00:36.327  -->  00:00:38.177
And this one as well, and this one,
13

13

00:00:38.177  -->  00:00:39.778
and also the button is blue.
14

14

00:00:39.778  -->  00:00:42.746
So this is the blue of our income, right?
15

15

00:00:42.746  -->  00:00:46.982
Now if we change this to minus, so to the expenses,
16

16

00:00:46.982  -->  00:00:48.890
this is still blue, right?
17

17

00:00:48.890  -->  00:00:50.693
So there's not really a difference.
18

18

00:00:50.693  -->  00:00:54.440
Now what we want to do here is to change this to red,
19

19

00:00:54.440  -->  00:00:59.319
so to the expenses color, when we are adding an expense.
20

20

00:00:59.319  -->  00:01:02.527
So this way, the user can immediately recognize
21

21

00:01:02.527  -->  00:01:04.641
if he's inputting an income,
22

22

00:01:04.641  -->  00:01:08.323
or if he's inputting an expense here.
23

23

00:01:08.323  -->  00:01:10.974
So, how are we going to do that?
24

24

00:01:10.974  -->  00:01:14.053
We're going to use an event that is triggered
25

25

00:01:14.053  -->  00:01:16.946
when we change this from plus to minus,
26

26

00:01:16.946  -->  00:01:18.378
and from minus to plus.
27

27

00:01:18.378  -->  00:01:20.022
And that's not the click event,
28

28

00:01:20.022  -->  00:01:22.480
because we could click here and then still click
29

29

00:01:22.480  -->  00:01:26.096
on the plus, and then nothing really would change, right?
30

30

00:01:26.096  -->  00:01:28.100
But there's another event that we can use,
31

31

00:01:28.100  -->  00:01:30.757
and that's the change event.
32

32

00:01:30.757  -->  00:01:34.230
And the change event occurs each time that we click here
33

33

00:01:34.230  -->  00:01:36.996
and then change it to something else.
34

34

00:01:36.996  -->  00:01:40.191
So now the change event happened.
35

35

00:01:40.191  -->  00:01:43.970
And so we can now add an event listener to this element here
36

36

00:01:43.970  -->  00:01:46.150
and then wait for the change event to happen,
37

37

00:01:46.150  -->  00:01:47.801
and then handle that event.
38

38

00:01:47.801  -->  00:01:49.551
So let's now do that.
39

39

00:01:50.843  -->  00:01:54.864
So we already know that all of our event listeners
40

40

00:01:54.864  -->  00:01:57.406
are set up here in this function.
41

41

00:01:57.406  -->  00:01:59.469
So this is no exception, and so we're going
42

42

00:01:59.469  -->  00:02:02.213
to add it also in here.
43

43

00:02:02.213  -->  00:02:04.380
So document.querySelector,
44

44

00:02:08.732  -->  00:02:12.939
and then DOM, where all the strings are contained,
45

45

00:02:12.939  -->  00:02:16.272
and this one is called inputType, right?
46

46

00:02:17.202  -->  00:02:19.952
So we add an event listener here,
47

47

00:02:20.983  -->  00:02:23.081
and now it's not the click event,
48

48

00:02:23.081  -->  00:02:27.695
but, as I was saying, it's the change event, alright?
49

49

00:02:27.695  -->  00:02:30.831
And so now we need a callback function here,
50

50

00:02:30.831  -->  00:02:33.132
and we're going to write that callback function
51

51

00:02:33.132  -->  00:02:36.555
into our UI controller because this has something to do
52

52

00:02:36.555  -->  00:02:39.222
with manipulating the UI, right?
53

53

00:02:40.820  -->  00:02:44.247
So UI controller, and I'm going to call this method
54

54

00:02:44.247  -->  00:02:46.747
the changed type, changedType.
55

55

00:02:50.017  -->  00:02:52.727
So now we need to go to our UI controller
56

56

00:02:52.727  -->  00:02:54.811
and add that method there.
57

57

00:02:54.811  -->  00:02:56.978
So let's do it right here.
58

58

00:02:58.838  -->  00:03:00.088
So changedType.
59

59

00:03:08.696  -->  00:03:10.352
Alright, so what is going to happen?
60

60

00:03:10.352  -->  00:03:12.193
So let's look at interface again.
61

61

00:03:12.193  -->  00:03:15.509
So what we want to happen is these three elements here
62

62

00:03:15.509  -->  00:03:18.221
to change this outline and then this button here
63

63

00:03:18.221  -->  00:03:19.417
to change the color.
64

64

00:03:19.417  -->  00:03:23.133
So we basically want to do some style manipulations.
65

65

00:03:23.133  -->  00:03:25.737
And do you remember the best way to do that?
66

66

00:03:25.737  -->  00:03:30.305
It is to add or to remove some CSS classes, right?
67

67

00:03:30.305  -->  00:03:33.286
And so I already wrote some CSS classes
68

68

00:03:33.286  -->  00:03:36.402
into our style sheet where they are.
69

69

00:03:36.402  -->  00:03:39.896
So this is the red, and the red-focus class.
70

70

00:03:39.896  -->  00:03:43.062
And we're gonna use the red class for the button
71

71

00:03:43.062  -->  00:03:46.673
and red-focus class on the other three elements.
72

72

00:03:46.673  -->  00:03:49.956
So I'm gonna select element and the two input elements,
73

73

00:03:49.956  -->  00:03:52.419
so two things that we have to do.
74

74

00:03:52.419  -->  00:03:54.796
We have to select all the three elements
75

75

00:03:54.796  -->  00:03:58.363
which are gonna receive this red-focus class, right?
76

76

00:03:58.363  -->  00:04:02.341
And remember, it's these three, this and this,
77

77

00:04:02.341  -->  00:04:04.662
and then we need to select the button here
78

78

00:04:04.662  -->  00:04:08.089
and give it the red class, okay?
79

79

00:04:08.089  -->  00:04:10.047
So let's do that.
80

80

00:04:10.047  -->  00:04:14.530
So for the first three, let's use the querySelectorAll.
81

81

00:04:14.530  -->  00:04:18.280
So var fields, and document.querySelectorAll,
82

82

00:04:23.911  -->  00:04:26.432
and now we need to input the three class names,
83

83

00:04:26.432  -->  00:04:29.032
separated by commas, okay?
84

84

00:04:29.032  -->  00:04:31.336
So let's actually do this in separate lines here,
85

85

00:04:31.336  -->  00:04:33.836
because we have three of them.
86

86

00:04:34.941  -->  00:04:37.358
So it's DOMstrings.inputType,
87

87

00:04:42.697  -->  00:04:44.364
then plus the comma,
88

88

00:04:47.672  -->  00:04:50.755
and then DOMstrings.inputDescription,
89

89

00:04:53.073  -->  00:04:56.522
and here we don't need any comma, of course,
90

90

00:04:56.522  -->  00:05:00.062
because the comma is here between the quotes,
91

91

00:05:00.062  -->  00:05:04.088
because we're constructing a string here, right?
92

92

00:05:04.088  -->  00:05:06.255
And DOMstrings.inputValue.
93

93

00:05:07.194  -->  00:05:09.799
So these three are the ones that are going
94

94

00:05:09.799  -->  00:05:12.382
to receive the red-focus class.
95

95

00:05:13.563  -->  00:05:17.480
Alright, so remember, this returns a node list.
96

96

00:05:18.347  -->  00:05:20.857
So in order to loop over it, we cannot use
97

97

00:05:20.857  -->  00:05:22.993
the forEach method, but remember,
98

98

00:05:22.993  -->  00:05:25.365
in one of the previous lectures, we wrote
99

99

00:05:25.365  -->  00:05:28.402
a very useful function for that,
100

100

00:05:28.402  -->  00:05:32.569
and it was called, here, nodeListForEach function.
101

101

00:05:33.720  -->  00:05:36.869
So we can now make use of that again, right?
102

102

00:05:36.869  -->  00:05:39.458
All we need to do is to remove this function here
103

103

00:05:39.458  -->  00:05:43.002
from this scope, right, because if it would be like this,
104

104

00:05:43.002  -->  00:05:46.405
we cannot use it in our other methods or functions.
105

105

00:05:46.405  -->  00:05:49.525
So I have to remove it from here, because the other methods
106

106

00:05:49.525  -->  00:05:51.970
don't have access to it, and so I'm going
107

107

00:05:51.970  -->  00:05:55.137
to put it out here, out of the object,
108

108

00:05:56.123  -->  00:06:00.360
so right here after the formatNumber function.
109

109

00:06:00.360  -->  00:06:03.758
So it's still a private function, so only the methods
110

110

00:06:03.758  -->  00:06:06.242
that are in here, in this control module,
111

111

00:06:06.242  -->  00:06:08.575
can use this function, okay?
112

112

00:06:09.951  -->  00:06:12.797
So let's go back to where we were,
113

113

00:06:12.797  -->  00:06:16.994
and now use this function to loop over our selection.
114

114

00:06:16.994  -->  00:06:20.494
So nodeListForEach, then input our fields,
115

115

00:06:21.362  -->  00:06:23.529
and our callback function.
116

116

00:06:25.891  -->  00:06:28.194
So we want the current element,
117

117

00:06:28.194  -->  00:06:31.140
and the index number we don't really need,
118

118

00:06:31.140  -->  00:06:33.086
because all we want to do is to add
119

119

00:06:33.086  -->  00:06:36.737
the red-focus class on the current element.
120

120

00:06:36.737  -->  00:06:39.737
So cur, classList, remember, and now
121

121

00:06:41.499  -->  00:06:45.666
I can put add, and then the class name, so red-focus.
122

122

00:06:48.167  -->  00:06:50.224
Now the problem with this is that once
123

123

00:06:50.224  -->  00:06:53.018
this change event occurs, and this function here
124

124

00:06:53.018  -->  00:06:56.759
gets called, this red-focus class will get added
125

125

00:06:56.759  -->  00:06:58.679
and will never again be removed,
126

126

00:06:58.679  -->  00:07:01.505
because we don't have the remove method anywhere.
127

127

00:07:01.505  -->  00:07:04.547
And actually, using remove would not be ideal
128

128

00:07:04.547  -->  00:07:07.547
because we have something better, which is toggle.
129

129

00:07:07.547  -->  00:07:10.602
And remember, what toggle does, basically it adds
130

130

00:07:10.602  -->  00:07:13.572
the red-focus class when it's not there,
131

131

00:07:13.572  -->  00:07:17.061
and when it's there on some element, then it removes it.
132

132

00:07:17.061  -->  00:07:19.317
And that's exactly what we want.
133

133

00:07:19.317  -->  00:07:22.569
So each time that the type changes, you want this class
134

134

00:07:22.569  -->  00:07:25.413
to change, and change in this case means
135

135

00:07:25.413  -->  00:07:28.166
that it's there or that it's not there.
136

136

00:07:28.166  -->  00:07:31.053
Okay, so this would already work.
137

137

00:07:31.053  -->  00:07:32.720
So let's check that.
138

138

00:07:33.612  -->  00:07:36.247
So now it's blue, and it's still blue.
139

139

00:07:36.247  -->  00:07:39.218
So let me click here as well so nothing really happens.
140

140

00:07:39.218  -->  00:07:41.635
So let's open up the console.
141

141

00:07:42.894  -->  00:07:45.856
Let's see, so we have some syntax error,
142

142

00:07:45.856  -->  00:07:47.856
so let's go to line 323.
143

143

00:07:49.622  -->  00:07:52.232
323, so it's this one here.
144

144

00:07:52.232  -->  00:07:55.115
Okay, so I have two parentheses here,
145

145

00:07:55.115  -->  00:07:57.657
so we don't need this, of course,
146

146

00:07:57.657  -->  00:07:59.824
so let's now try it again.
147

147

00:08:02.134  -->  00:08:04.903
So now we don't have a buck,
148

148

00:08:04.903  -->  00:08:07.376
and yeah, it's red now.
149

149

00:08:07.376  -->  00:08:10.272
And so now, when we click here, all of this is red,
150

150

00:08:10.272  -->  00:08:12.848
and so we instantly know that we're working
151

151

00:08:12.848  -->  00:08:14.536
with an expense here.
152

152

00:08:14.536  -->  00:08:17.733
And now if we change it back, then the change event
153

153

00:08:17.733  -->  00:08:21.724
is triggered again, and so we toggle our class.
154

154

00:08:21.724  -->  00:08:25.241
So the class is now removed, so it's now gone again.
155

155

00:08:25.241  -->  00:08:28.065
And the same thing here and here, and if I click again,
156

156

00:08:28.065  -->  00:08:29.649
then the class is toggled again,
157

157

00:08:29.649  -->  00:08:32.869
and now it's back on this element.
158

158

00:08:32.869  -->  00:08:34.933
The only small thing left to do
159

159

00:08:34.933  -->  00:08:38.748
is to now add the red class here on our button.
160

160

00:08:38.748  -->  00:08:43.023
And that's the easiest thing in the world, right?
161

161

00:08:43.023  -->  00:08:46.051
So we just need to add another line here,
162

162

00:08:46.051  -->  00:08:48.551
saying document.querySelector,
163

163

00:08:50.403  -->  00:08:53.442
and we do this because it's only one element,
164

164

00:08:53.442  -->  00:08:57.442
so DOMstrings, and this one is the input button.
165

165

00:08:59.413  -->  00:09:02.624
And again, we want to toggle it, because of the same reasons
166

166

00:09:02.624  -->  00:09:06.979
that I explained before, and this one is called red.
167

167

00:09:06.979  -->  00:09:09.164
Okay, and that's it.
168

168

00:09:09.164  -->  00:09:10.997
So let's try it again.
169

169

00:09:12.023  -->  00:09:14.253
So everything is blue, the button is blue,
170

170

00:09:14.253  -->  00:09:17.349
now change to red, and now look at the button,
171

171

00:09:17.349  -->  00:09:19.378
and it turned red.
172

172

00:09:19.378  -->  00:09:21.264
So, amazing, right?
173

173

00:09:21.264  -->  00:09:24.240
So let's add an expense here
174

174

00:09:24.240  -->  00:09:27.589
to see if nothing else is broken in the app now.
175

175

00:09:27.589  -->  00:09:29.839
So 500, and yeah, it works.
176

176

00:09:32.342  -->  00:09:34.342
Or dining out for 58.25,
177

177

00:09:40.571  -->  00:09:42.635
and let's add a salary, and now everything
178

178

00:09:42.635  -->  00:09:44.878
should turn blue again.
179

179

00:09:44.878  -->  00:09:48.401
And yes, so it's blue, or green, whatever,
180

180

00:09:48.401  -->  00:09:50.651
and now the salary is 2500,
181

181

00:09:53.791  -->  00:09:57.041
and yeah, everything works as expected.
182

182

00:09:58.716  -->  00:10:00.866
And that's actually it, everyone.
183

183

00:10:00.866  -->  00:10:03.556
We have now finally and officially finished
184

184

00:10:03.556  -->  00:10:05.674
this beautiful application.
185

185

00:10:05.674  -->  00:10:09.451
And it has now all the features that we planned to include,
186

186

00:10:09.451  -->  00:10:12.323
and it has a really polished user interface, right?
187

187

00:10:12.323  -->  00:10:15.883
So it really looks great, and it also works great.
188

188

00:10:15.883  -->  00:10:19.561
So really, congratulations for making it this far
189

189

00:10:19.561  -->  00:10:22.166
and for really learning and understanding all
190

190

00:10:22.166  -->  00:10:25.750
of these exciting new things about JavaScript.
191

191

00:10:25.750  -->  00:10:28.188
And now this jumps right into the next lecture,
192

192

00:10:28.188  -->  00:10:30.415
which is also the last one of this project,
193

193

00:10:30.415  -->  00:10:34.582
just to take a look at the final structure of our app.
