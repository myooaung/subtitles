00:00:01.269  -->  00:00:03.660
<v Instructor>Let's now create the methods</v>
2

2

00:00:03.660  -->  00:00:06.061
that will do the actual calculations
3

3

00:00:06.061  -->  00:00:08.311
of the expense percentages.
4

4

00:00:09.301  -->  00:00:11.538
And so, in this lecture, you'll learn
5

5

00:00:11.538  -->  00:00:14.057
how to make the budget controller interact
6

6

00:00:14.057  -->  00:00:16.307
with our Expense prototype.
7

7

00:00:18.097  -->  00:00:20.408
So let's start by adding a new method
8

8

00:00:20.408  -->  00:00:23.698
to our budget controller, and it's gonna be
9

9

00:00:23.698  -->  00:00:25.531
another public method.
10

10

00:00:26.899  -->  00:00:29.354
So calculateBudget, getBudget,
11

11

00:00:29.354  -->  00:00:32.018
and so I'm gonna put the calculate methods,
12

12

00:00:32.018  -->  00:00:34.025
basically, here together, okay?
13

13

00:00:34.025  -->  00:00:37.706
So we have calculateBudget and now,
14

14

00:00:37.706  -->  00:00:39.456
calculatePercentages.
15

15

00:00:47.315  -->  00:00:49.950
Okay, so let's think about this.
16

16

00:00:49.950  -->  00:00:53.681
So basically, we need to calculate the expense percentage
17

17

00:00:53.681  -->  00:00:55.792
for each of the expense objects
18

18

00:00:55.792  -->  00:00:59.965
that are stored in the expenses array, right?
19

19

00:00:59.965  -->  00:01:03.420
So imagine that we had three expenses,
20

20

00:01:03.420  -->  00:01:07.087
and I'm gonna write them here as an example.
21

21

00:01:08.380  -->  00:01:10.047
So imagine we had a,
22

22

00:01:11.306  -->  00:01:13.389
20, then expense b of 10,
23

23

00:01:15.502  -->  00:01:19.386
and then another expense, let's call it c, of 40, okay?
24

24

00:01:19.386  -->  00:01:23.553
So just an example, and our total income would be 100.
25

25

00:01:26.796  -->  00:01:30.455
So what would the percentages for each of these be?
26

26

00:01:30.455  -->  00:01:31.288
So for a,
27

27

00:01:32.925  -->  00:01:36.175
we would have 20 divided by 100, right?
28

28

00:01:38.191  -->  00:01:40.108
So this makes 20%.
29

29

00:01:41.225  -->  00:01:44.977
So with expense a, this means that we spend 20%
30

30

00:01:44.977  -->  00:01:47.453
of our total income.
31

31

00:01:47.453  -->  00:01:50.288
And then of course, in the same way,
32

32

00:01:50.288  -->  00:01:52.705
b would be 10 divided by 100.
33

33

00:01:55.139  -->  00:01:57.079
That would be 10%,
34

34

00:01:57.079  -->  00:01:59.662
and c would be 40%, right?
35

35

00:02:03.223  -->  00:02:05.151
So this is just so that we know
36

36

00:02:05.151  -->  00:02:08.072
how to calculate each of these percentages.
37

37

00:02:08.072  -->  00:02:10.535
So this means that we're always gonna need
38

38

00:02:10.535  -->  00:02:12.802
this total income here.
39

39

00:02:12.802  -->  00:02:14.664
Now, we said that we need to do this
40

40

00:02:14.664  -->  00:02:16.792
for each object individually,
41

41

00:02:16.792  -->  00:02:20.111
and so this sounds like there should be a method
42

42

00:02:20.111  -->  00:02:22.255
on each of these expense objects
43

43

00:02:22.255  -->  00:02:25.601
that calculates this percentage, right?
44

44

00:02:25.601  -->  00:02:28.254
And so, let's actually do that.
45

45

00:02:28.254  -->  00:02:32.020
So let's go to our expense function constructor here.
46

46

00:02:32.020  -->  00:02:35.256
So in here, and we want to add a method.
47

47

00:02:35.256  -->  00:02:36.939
So how do we do that?
48

48

00:02:36.939  -->  00:02:39.824
And I'm absolutely sure that you remember this.
49

49

00:02:39.824  -->  00:02:41.994
So we're not just going to add the method
50

50

00:02:41.994  -->  00:02:44.656
right here into the function constructor, right?
51

51

00:02:44.656  -->  00:02:48.455
But instead, we're going to add it to its prototype
52

52

00:02:48.455  -->  00:02:50.588
because like this, all of the objects
53

53

00:02:50.588  -->  00:02:53.334
that are created through this expense prototype
54

54

00:02:53.334  -->  00:02:55.867
will then inherit this method,
55

55

00:02:55.867  -->  00:02:58.063
because of the prototype chain, right?
56

56

00:02:58.063  -->  00:03:00.051
Because it's in their prototype,
57

57

00:03:00.051  -->  00:03:03.518
so the prototype property of expense.
58

58

00:03:03.518  -->  00:03:04.841
So let me do that.
59

59

00:03:04.841  -->  00:03:07.272
We did this before a lot of times,
60

60

00:03:07.272  -->  00:03:09.012
so we already know how to do this.
61

61

00:03:09.012  -->  00:03:10.762
So Expense.prototype,
62

62

00:03:12.820  -->  00:03:17.032
and let's call this method the calculate percentage,
63

63

00:03:17.032  -->  00:03:18.949
or just calcPercentage.
64

64

00:03:24.064  -->  00:03:27.499
Okay, and so, and we already know
65

65

00:03:27.499  -->  00:03:29.617
that we always need something in order
66

66

00:03:29.617  -->  00:03:31.909
to be able to calculate the percentage
67

67

00:03:31.909  -->  00:03:33.874
of one of the expenses, right?
68

68

00:03:33.874  -->  00:03:35.715
And we just talked about that,
69

69

00:03:35.715  -->  00:03:38.300
and that is the total income.
70

70

00:03:38.300  -->  00:03:39.550
So totalIncome.
71

71

00:03:45.327  -->  00:03:49.701
Okay, so now we can calculate our actual percentage,
72

72

00:03:49.701  -->  00:03:53.127
but first, where are we gonna store this percentage?
73

73

00:03:53.127  -->  00:03:55.283
We should actually create a new property
74

74

00:03:55.283  -->  00:03:57.594
here in the expense object, right?
75

75

00:03:57.594  -->  00:03:59.455
So let's do that.
76

76

00:03:59.455  -->  00:04:02.872
So this.percentage, and in the beginning,
77

77

00:04:03.718  -->  00:04:07.292
before it's defined, I'm gonna set it to -1,
78

78

00:04:07.292  -->  00:04:10.539
such as we did somewhere else in our code before, right?
79

79

00:04:10.539  -->  00:04:14.133
So when something is not defined, we use -1,
80

80

00:04:14.133  -->  00:04:16.355
and so now, here in this method,
81

81

00:04:16.355  -->  00:04:21.030
we can then define this property to something meaningful,
82

82

00:04:21.030  -->  00:04:25.197
so this.percentage will be the value of this expense, right?
83

83

00:04:29.172  -->  00:04:32.505
So the value divided by the totalIncome,
84

84

00:04:33.393  -->  00:04:37.852
which is the argument that we receive as an input here.
85

85

00:04:37.852  -->  00:04:41.769
Now such as we did before, in another function,
86

86

00:04:42.807  -->  00:04:46.974
we will multiply this by 100, and then also round it,
87

87

00:04:49.342  -->  00:04:51.988
so again, we're using the Math object,
88

88

00:04:51.988  -->  00:04:53.238
and then round,
89

89

00:04:57.182  -->  00:05:00.653
and with this, we have an integer percentage value.
90

90

00:05:00.653  -->  00:05:02.923
So we did this before in this way.
91

91

00:05:02.923  -->  00:05:04.910
Let's remember it.
92

92

00:05:04.910  -->  00:05:07.099
So yeah, it was here.
93

93

00:05:07.099  -->  00:05:08.916
So when we calculated the budget,
94

94

00:05:08.916  -->  00:05:13.475
we also calculated the, let's say, global percentage,
95

95

00:05:13.475  -->  00:05:17.665
and so, we also divided the expense by the income,
96

96

00:05:17.665  -->  00:05:21.874
multiplied it with 100, and then rounded it.
97

97

00:05:21.874  -->  00:05:23.483
And something else that we did here
98

98

00:05:23.483  -->  00:05:25.965
was to only calculate this when the income
99

99

00:05:25.965  -->  00:05:29.366
was actually greater than zero here, right?
100

100

00:05:29.366  -->  00:05:32.909
And that's because we cannot divide anything by zero.
101

101

00:05:32.909  -->  00:05:35.455
So we should do the same in our method
102

102

00:05:35.455  -->  00:05:38.945
that we're writing right now, so in here,
103

103

00:05:38.945  -->  00:05:42.521
I'm gonna do the same thing, so...
104

104

00:05:42.521  -->  00:05:45.854
If the totalIncome is greater than zero,
105

105

00:05:49.881  -->  00:05:54.048
and only then, we calculate this percentage like this,
106

106

00:05:56.023  -->  00:06:00.190
and if it's zero, then the percentage will just be -1 again.
107

107

00:06:04.176  -->  00:06:05.442
All right, and that's it.
108

108

00:06:05.442  -->  00:06:08.931
So this method calculates the percentage,
109

109

00:06:08.931  -->  00:06:12.068
and since we always have a get method,
110

110

00:06:12.068  -->  00:06:15.948
so for example, a getBudget and a getPercentage,
111

111

00:06:15.948  -->  00:06:18.185
which we're gonna write in a second,
112

112

00:06:18.185  -->  00:06:20.421
I will also create a getPercentage method
113

113

00:06:20.421  -->  00:06:24.504
for this Expense object, or function constructor,
114

114

00:06:25.585  -->  00:06:28.502
so Expense.prototype.getPercentage,
115

115

00:06:33.358  -->  00:06:34.976
and this, of course,
116

116

00:06:34.976  -->  00:06:38.673
will be the simplest function ever, right?
117

117

00:06:38.673  -->  00:06:41.704
Because it's just going to retrieve the percentage
118

118

00:06:41.704  -->  00:06:44.621
from the object and then return it,
119

119

00:06:45.611  -->  00:06:48.803
but this again is so that we have different functions
120

120

00:06:48.803  -->  00:06:52.555
which each one only has one specific task.
121

121

00:06:52.555  -->  00:06:54.558
So this one calculates it,
122

122

00:06:54.558  -->  00:06:57.089
and then this one returns it.
123

123

00:06:57.089  -->  00:07:00.756
Okay, so let's now use this method actually.
124

124

00:07:02.498  -->  00:07:04.740
So this is the one that we were working on here,
125

125

00:07:04.740  -->  00:07:07.271
so the calculatePercentages method,
126

126

00:07:07.271  -->  00:07:10.413
and now, we can call the method that we just wrote
127

127

00:07:10.413  -->  00:07:13.136
for each of the elements in the array
128

128

00:07:13.136  -->  00:07:14.631
in our data structure, right?
129

129

00:07:14.631  -->  00:07:16.973
So for all of the expense objects
130

130

00:07:16.973  -->  00:07:21.140
that are stored here in this data structure, okay?
131

131

00:07:22.214  -->  00:07:23.877
And do you remember the new method
132

132

00:07:23.877  -->  00:07:27.166
that we learned to loop over arrays?
133

133

00:07:27.166  -->  00:07:30.168
Yes, it was the forEach method.
134

134

00:07:30.168  -->  00:07:32.441
So let's use it now again.
135

135

00:07:32.441  -->  00:07:35.031
So we first need an array, so we're gonna retrieve it
136

136

00:07:35.031  -->  00:07:36.780
from our data structure.
137

137

00:07:36.780  -->  00:07:39.915
So data.allItems, and in this case,
138

138

00:07:39.915  -->  00:07:42.701
we only want the expense array, right?
139

139

00:07:42.701  -->  00:07:46.297
And now in here, we can call the forEach method
140

140

00:07:46.297  -->  00:07:48.455
because this is an array.
141

141

00:07:48.455  -->  00:07:50.574
And now, our callback function.
142

142

00:07:50.574  -->  00:07:54.824
So this specifies exactly what we want to happen
143

143

00:07:54.824  -->  00:07:56.408
for each of the elements.
144

144

00:07:56.408  -->  00:07:59.694
So we have access to the current variable here, right?
145

145

00:07:59.694  -->  00:08:03.027
I'm just gonna call it cur in this case.
146

146

00:08:04.339  -->  00:08:07.016
And what I want to happen to each of the elements
147

147

00:08:07.016  -->  00:08:10.451
is to simply call the calcPercentage method.
148

148

00:08:10.451  -->  00:08:14.034
So I write current and then calcPercentage,
149

149

00:08:15.341  -->  00:08:18.163
which is the method that we coded before.
150

150

00:08:18.163  -->  00:08:19.330
And that's it.
151

151

00:08:20.577  -->  00:08:22.534
So this is gonna calculate the percentage
152

152

00:08:22.534  -->  00:08:26.555
for each and every expense that we have in our object.
153

153

00:08:26.555  -->  00:08:29.641
And now, we just need the getPercentages.
154

154

00:08:29.641  -->  00:08:31.224
So, getPercentages,
155

155

00:08:41.751  -->  00:08:45.159
and some space here as well, and all right.
156

156

00:08:45.159  -->  00:08:47.651
And this one will actually be a bit similar
157

157

00:08:47.651  -->  00:08:52.013
because we once again need to loop over all of our expenses,
158

158

00:08:52.013  -->  00:08:55.066
and that's because we want to call the getPercentage method
159

159

00:08:55.066  -->  00:08:57.272
on each of our objects.
160

160

00:08:57.272  -->  00:08:59.834
The difference to the loop that we wrote here
161

161

00:08:59.834  -->  00:09:02.512
in our other method is that this time,
162

162

00:09:02.512  -->  00:09:05.823
we don't wanna just loop over the array and do something.
163

163

00:09:05.823  -->  00:09:08.096
No, we also want to return something.
164

164

00:09:08.096  -->  00:09:10.342
So we want to store it somewhere.
165

165

00:09:10.342  -->  00:09:13.883
And remember, that's what the map method is for.
166

166

00:09:13.883  -->  00:09:17.117
So instead of forEach, we're gonna use map.
167

167

00:09:17.117  -->  00:09:19.867
So var allPercentages, let's say,
168

168

00:09:21.540  -->  00:09:23.290
is data.allItems.exp,
169

169

00:09:29.408  -->  00:09:31.759
so the expenses, and then, I use map
170

170

00:09:31.759  -->  00:09:34.292
'cause remember, map returns something
171

171

00:09:34.292  -->  00:09:38.459
and stores it in a variable while forEAch does not.
172

172

00:09:39.558  -->  00:09:42.641
And now, our callback function again.
173

173

00:09:45.253  -->  00:09:47.308
And now, in here, in the callback function
174

174

00:09:47.308  -->  00:09:51.842
of the map method, we usually just return something,
175

175

00:09:51.842  -->  00:09:55.742
and what we return here is what is then stored here
176

176

00:09:55.742  -->  00:09:57.545
in this variable.
177

177

00:09:57.545  -->  00:09:59.878
So we just return the result
178

178

00:10:00.954  -->  00:10:03.954
of calling the getPercentage method.
179

179

00:10:06.321  -->  00:10:10.488
And in the end, all we need to do is then to return
180

180

00:10:12.015  -->  00:10:15.148
the allPerc variable, which is, of course,
181

181

00:10:15.148  -->  00:10:17.996
an array with all of the percentages.
182

182

00:10:17.996  -->  00:10:20.717
So again, imagine we had five objects
183

183

00:10:20.717  -->  00:10:24.653
in our array here, in our expenses array,
184

184

00:10:24.653  -->  00:10:29.192
so then this here would get called five times, right?
185

185

00:10:29.192  -->  00:10:31.283
So for each of the five elements.
186

186

00:10:31.283  -->  00:10:34.781
So for each of them, we would call the getPercentage method,
187

187

00:10:34.781  -->  00:10:36.475
return it, and then store it
188

188

00:10:36.475  -->  00:10:38.375
here in the allPercentages array,
189

189

00:10:38.375  -->  00:10:40.674
and then in the end, we just return it.
190

190

00:10:40.674  -->  00:10:43.219
All right, and so with these three methods,
191

191

00:10:43.219  -->  00:10:46.582
we calculate the percentage on each individual object
192

192

00:10:46.582  -->  00:10:48.086
and we then return an array
193

193

00:10:48.086  -->  00:10:51.051
with all of these percentages in it.
194

194

00:10:51.051  -->  00:10:54.692
So let's now use these methods that we just coded
195

195

00:10:54.692  -->  00:10:56.962
here in our controller.
196

196

00:10:56.962  -->  00:11:00.208
And remember, we created this updatePercentages function
197

197

00:11:00.208  -->  00:11:02.944
in the last lecture, and in here,
198

198

00:11:02.944  -->  00:11:06.944
we will now say budgetCtrl.calculatePercentages,
199

199

00:11:11.193  -->  00:11:15.360
and then we just say that we want to get the percentages.
200

200

00:11:19.409  -->  00:11:22.466
And of course, we need to store this somewhere, right?
201

201

00:11:22.466  -->  00:11:24.799
So var percentages, and now,
202

202

00:11:28.151  -->  00:11:31.433
since we can't see anything on the user interface just yet,
203

203

00:11:31.433  -->  00:11:33.543
I'm gonna log it to the console.
204

204

00:11:33.543  -->  00:11:37.293
So console.log(percentages).
205

205

00:11:38.823  -->  00:11:40.195
All right.
206

206

00:11:40.195  -->  00:11:42.539
So it's time to test this.
207

207

00:11:42.539  -->  00:11:45.707
And I'm going to use the example that we had before.
208

208

00:11:45.707  -->  00:11:48.207
So project, 100 is our income,
209

209

00:11:50.368  -->  00:11:54.285
and the three expenses are going to be a of 20,
210

210

00:11:56.371  -->  00:11:58.508
and now, we have some kind of bug here.
211

211

00:11:58.508  -->  00:12:01.008
Okay, so let's go to line 135.
212

212

00:12:02.074  -->  00:12:02.907
Okay.
213

213

00:12:04.206  -->  00:12:05.039
135.
214

214

00:12:06.076  -->  00:12:08.233
And okay, so of course, that's a problem
215

215

00:12:08.233  -->  00:12:10.403
because we used current here,
216

216

00:12:10.403  -->  00:12:14.196
but the parameter name is cur, right?
217

217

00:12:14.196  -->  00:12:15.696
So just like this.
218

218

00:12:17.895  -->  00:12:20.765
So it's completely normal that we sometimes have some bugs,
219

219

00:12:20.765  -->  00:12:22.586
that we do this kind of mistakes,
220

220

00:12:22.586  -->  00:12:27.014
and everyone does this so it's really no big deal.
221

221

00:12:27.014  -->  00:12:29.014
So let's try this again.
222

222

00:12:30.516  -->  00:12:33.675
So I'm just calling it inc here.
223

223

00:12:33.675  -->  00:12:35.583
And then our three expenses.
224

224

00:12:35.583  -->  00:12:36.500
So a is 20.
225

225

00:12:38.650  -->  00:12:41.894
And now we see -1 here in the console,
226

226

00:12:41.894  -->  00:12:43.773
which is weird, right?
227

227

00:12:43.773  -->  00:12:47.063
So let's see why that happened.
228

228

00:12:47.063  -->  00:12:49.893
So the percentage can only be -1
229

229

00:12:49.893  -->  00:12:52.310
if the income is zero, right?
230

230

00:12:54.183  -->  00:12:56.156
But the income is not actually zero
231

231

00:12:56.156  -->  00:12:58.739
so let's see what we did wrong.
232

232

00:13:01.835  -->  00:13:04.249
So the calculatePercentage method here,
233

233

00:13:04.249  -->  00:13:06.378
and so, here's the problem.
234

234

00:13:06.378  -->  00:13:08.918
So we called the calcPercentage method
235

235

00:13:08.918  -->  00:13:11.940
and didn't pass the totals into it,
236

236

00:13:11.940  -->  00:13:14.633
which we should have, so let's do that now.
237

237

00:13:14.633  -->  00:13:17.679
And we already know where that is stored,
238

238

00:13:17.679  -->  00:13:19.512
so data.totals, right?
239

239

00:13:23.445  -->  00:13:25.060
And then inc.
240

240

00:13:25.060  -->  00:13:28.469
So let me show it to you just to remember.
241

241

00:13:28.469  -->  00:13:30.220
So it's this value here.
242

242

00:13:30.220  -->  00:13:32.716
So the total income is stored right here,
243

243

00:13:32.716  -->  00:13:36.005
and hopefully, now it's the third time
244

244

00:13:36.005  -->  00:13:37.908
and now it's going to work.
245

245

00:13:37.908  -->  00:13:39.158
So income, 100,
246

246

00:13:42.132  -->  00:13:44.715
and let's add an expense of 10.
247

247

00:13:46.790  -->  00:13:48.040
Sorry, a is 10,
248

248

00:13:49.280  -->  00:13:51.530
and yes, so 10 is 10%.
249

249

00:13:52.868  -->  00:13:56.618
Actually, let's try it with an income of 200,
250

250

00:13:59.439  -->  00:14:01.522
and then have a equal 10,
251

251

00:14:02.813  -->  00:14:05.026
and now it's gonna be 5%, right?
252

252

00:14:05.026  -->  00:14:07.155
And yes, here it is.
253

253

00:14:07.155  -->  00:14:12.072
Now b, let's say, 50, and this should be 25%, right?
254

254

00:14:12.072  -->  00:14:14.935
And yes, so now we have five and 25.
255

255

00:14:14.935  -->  00:14:16.481
So these are the percentages
256

256

00:14:16.481  -->  00:14:18.550
that we're later gonna display here.
257

257

00:14:18.550  -->  00:14:21.708
So it will be five here, and then 25,
258

258

00:14:21.708  -->  00:14:24.694
and if we now add another one like c,
259

259

00:14:24.694  -->  00:14:29.356
which is gonna be 40, and this one is, of course, 20%,
260

260

00:14:29.356  -->  00:14:31.023
so five, 25, and 20,
261

261

00:14:32.348  -->  00:14:35.492
and these are percentages that we're going to put here,
262

262

00:14:35.492  -->  00:14:37.659
right, in a next lecture.
