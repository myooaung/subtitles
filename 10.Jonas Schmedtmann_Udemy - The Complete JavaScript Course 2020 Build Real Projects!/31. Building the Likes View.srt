1

00:00:01,500  -->  00:00:02,610
<v Instructor>And in this video,</v>
2

2

00:00:02,610  -->  00:00:06,463
we're gonna handle the user interface for the likes.
3

3

00:00:07,976  -->  00:00:10,183
So let's create a likes view.
4

4

00:00:14,170  -->  00:00:16,893
Okay, then get this part here.
5

5

00:00:19,868  -->  00:00:22,770
So our elements, close it up.
6

6

00:00:22,770  -->  00:00:24,130
Now the first thing that we're gonna do
7

7

00:00:24,130  -->  00:00:28,180
is to create a function to toggle the like button.
8

8

00:00:28,180  -->  00:00:30,463
So we say export const,
9

9

00:00:33,843  -->  00:00:35,223
toggle the like button.
10

10

00:00:36,090  -->  00:00:39,980
Okay, and in here we will pass the is liked variable.
11

11

00:00:39,980  -->  00:00:42,410
So a Boolean saying true or false,
12

12

00:00:42,410  -->  00:00:45,470
whether the current recipe is liked or not.
13

13

00:00:45,470  -->  00:00:47,870
And we will then adjust the button accordingly.
14

14

00:00:47,870  -->  00:00:49,030
Basically, what we wanna do here
15

15

00:00:49,030  -->  00:00:52,360
is, in the recipe view,
16

16

00:00:52,360  -->  00:00:54,323
where do we have the icon?
17

17

00:00:55,728  -->  00:00:57,960
It's actually right here.
18

18

00:00:57,960  -->  00:01:01,610
So we wanna change basically this icon here.
19

19

00:01:01,610  -->  00:01:06,133
So we can have the icon heart outlined or just icon heart.
20

20

00:01:06,133  -->  00:01:08,500
Outlined is when it's not liked
21

21

00:01:08,500  -->  00:01:10,650
and without the outline, just icon heart,
22

22

00:01:10,650  -->  00:01:13,570
is when it is liked actually.
23

23

00:01:13,570  -->  00:01:15,070
Let's just copy this part here
24

24

00:01:16,500  -->  00:01:18,080
so that we know how this is written.
25

25

00:01:18,080  -->  00:01:23,080
And let's create a variable for this name here,
26

26

00:01:23,107  -->  00:01:25,383
according to the is liked variable.
27

27

00:01:26,300  -->  00:01:28,523
Const, icon string.
28

28

00:01:31,859  -->  00:01:34,280
And we're using the ternary operator here.
29

29

00:01:34,280  -->  00:01:36,030
And say, if it's liked,
30

30

00:01:36,030  -->  00:01:38,023
then it should be icon heart.
31

31

00:01:40,360  -->  00:01:45,360
And, if not, then it's icon heart outline.
32

32

00:01:50,322  -->  00:01:54,510
Okay, and now we can actually select that button.
33

33

00:01:54,510  -->  00:01:56,620
So let's take a look at the class name.
34

34

00:01:56,620  -->  00:01:58,423
And it's recipe love.
35

35

00:02:00,800  -->  00:02:03,970
And what need to change is on the use elements.
36

36

00:02:03,970  -->  00:02:05,240
So recipe class,
37

37

00:02:05,240  -->  00:02:07,840
and then the use element is a child of that.
38

38

00:02:07,840  -->  00:02:09,330
We're selecting this one
39

39

00:02:09,330  -->  00:02:12,980
and now all we need to do is change the href attribute here.
40

40

00:02:12,980  -->  00:02:13,963
So this one.
41

41

00:02:15,480  -->  00:02:16,960
How do we do that in JavaScript?
42

42

00:02:16,960  -->  00:02:19,130
I'm not sure if we have done this before
43

43

00:02:19,130  -->  00:02:21,940
and so all we have to do is say .setattribute
44

44

00:02:23,867  -->  00:02:26,230
and then we say the attribute that we wanna change,
45

45

00:02:26,230  -->  00:02:28,120
which is the href one,
46

46

00:02:28,120  -->  00:02:30,860
and then what we wanna set it to.
47

47

00:02:30,860  -->  00:02:35,860
And we wanna set it to, let's take a look, to this.
48

48

00:02:36,100  -->  00:02:37,340
No, actually to this here
49

49

00:02:37,340  -->  00:02:39,990
and then we will add the string that we just created.
50

50

00:02:41,060  -->  00:02:46,060
So img/icons.svg and then or icon string.
51

51

00:02:49,970  -->  00:02:51,930
Okay, makes sense?
52

52

00:02:51,930  -->  00:02:54,810
We're selecting the element where the icon is located.
53

53

00:02:54,810  -->  00:02:57,480
So it's this use element, parent of recipe love.
54

54

00:02:57,480  -->  00:03:00,530
And then we set a href attribute, using this method here,
55

55

00:03:00,530  -->  00:03:02,169
to our icons.svg
56

56

00:03:02,169  -->  00:03:05,600
and then the icon name, according to is liked.
57

57

00:03:05,600  -->  00:03:06,720
Alright?
58

58

00:03:06,720  -->  00:03:07,970
Let's test that actually.
59

59

00:03:08,840  -->  00:03:10,523
In index.js.
60

60

00:03:12,370  -->  00:03:15,720
And here it is, okay?
61

61

00:03:15,720  -->  00:03:18,520
And before we can do that, we actually need to of course
62

62

00:03:19,902  -->  00:03:22,850
import this list view
63

63

00:03:22,850  -->  00:03:25,083
and it is not list, it is likes.
64

64

00:03:26,260  -->  00:03:27,533
So likes view.
65

65

00:03:32,550  -->  00:03:34,987
So likesview.togglelightbtn.
66

66

00:03:36,810  -->  00:03:38,773
And now, in here, we pass true.
67

67

00:03:39,900  -->  00:03:41,750
Okay, so this is the case
68

68

00:03:41,750  -->  00:03:44,640
where the user has not yet liked a current recipe
69

69

00:03:44,640  -->  00:03:46,040
and so, after he likes it,
70

70

00:03:46,040  -->  00:03:48,180
then, of course, it should be liked
71

71

00:03:48,180  -->  00:03:49,280
and so it's true here.
72

72

00:03:52,393  -->  00:03:56,050
And then, the next one is the opposite,
73

73

00:03:56,050  -->  00:03:57,403
and it will be false.
74

74

00:03:58,624  -->  00:04:01,063
So that part should now be working.
75

75

00:04:04,680  -->  00:04:06,907
And actually we can test it here.
76

76

00:04:06,907  -->  00:04:08,100
And it is working.
77

77

00:04:08,100  -->  00:04:09,770
Well, kind of at least.
78

78

00:04:09,770  -->  00:04:13,990
It seems like one of the strings is not correct.
79

79

00:04:13,990  -->  00:04:16,543
So where do we have that?
80

80

00:04:17,570  -->  00:04:20,520
So it's icon heart and icon heart outline
81

81

00:04:20,520  -->  00:04:23,123
and should be outlined like this.
82

82

00:04:24,490  -->  00:04:28,420
Alright, now it's working.
83

83

00:04:28,420  -->  00:04:29,360
So, cool.
84

84

00:04:29,360  -->  00:04:30,410
Now what's not working
85

85

00:04:30,410  -->  00:04:34,160
is that when we come to this page here it'll not be toggled.
86

86

00:04:34,160  -->  00:04:36,033
So let's say we like this pizza now.
87

87

00:04:37,617  -->  00:04:40,460
Then we choose another one.
88

88

00:04:40,460  -->  00:04:42,579
And when we then come back,
89

89

00:04:42,579  -->  00:04:45,960
then it'll no longer be with the liked icon here.
90

90

00:04:45,960  -->  00:04:48,519
So if now click that it is unliked, now it's liked again.
91

91

00:04:48,519  -->  00:04:51,270
But it should be liked right from the beginning.
92

92

00:04:51,270  -->  00:04:53,310
And so we need to implement that
93

93

00:04:53,310  -->  00:04:55,880
and that'll be in the recipe view.
94

94

00:04:55,880  -->  00:04:57,700
Okay, so when the recipe is loaded,
95

95

00:04:57,700  -->  00:05:00,170
then we already need to know if this recipe is liked
96

96

00:05:00,170  -->  00:05:02,470
and then display this button here accordingly.
97

97

00:05:04,700  -->  00:05:07,250
Let's open up our recipe view.
98

98

00:05:07,250  -->  00:05:10,640
And then, in here, we need to not only pass the recipe,
99

99

00:05:10,640  -->  00:05:12,933
but also if it's liked.
100

100

00:05:14,560  -->  00:05:16,380
So, is liked.
101

101

00:05:16,380  -->  00:05:18,750
And then we come down here to the icon
102

102

00:05:18,750  -->  00:05:21,063
and then we can just change this here,
103

103

00:05:21,063  -->  00:05:24,910
put in a variable and use the ternary operator.
104

104

00:05:24,910  -->  00:05:26,003
So, is liked,
105

105

00:05:27,100  -->  00:05:30,720
and if it is liked, don't add anything here,
106

106

00:05:30,720  -->  00:05:34,623
and if it's not liked, then add the outlined.
107

107

00:05:36,050  -->  00:05:38,570
This is a bit similar to what we did in the other function.
108

108

00:05:38,570  -->  00:05:39,403
So if it is liked,
109

109

00:05:39,403  -->  00:05:41,480
then it'll just be icon heart.
110

110

00:05:41,480  -->  00:05:42,410
And if it is not liked,
111

111

00:05:42,410  -->  00:05:45,093
then it'll be dash outlined will be added.
112

112

00:05:46,450  -->  00:05:48,750
Alright and then finally, of course,
113

113

00:05:48,750  -->  00:05:52,070
we also need to pass in the is liked
114

114

00:05:52,070  -->  00:05:53,270
when we render a recipe.
115

115

00:05:54,520  -->  00:05:57,130
Index and is liked.
116

116

00:05:57,130  -->  00:05:59,400
And where, ah here it is.
117

117

00:05:59,400  -->  00:06:00,890
So we have state recipe
118

118

00:06:01,900  -->  00:06:04,803
and that's now separated into a different line.
119

119

00:06:05,640  -->  00:06:10,457
And we also need to pass in state.likes.isliked
120

120

00:06:11,900  -->  00:06:13,210
and then the current ID.
121

121

00:06:13,210  -->  00:06:16,120
And we have that available to us in this function.
122

122

00:06:16,120  -->  00:06:18,670
So here is the ID actually.
123

123

00:06:18,670  -->  00:06:20,150
So the current recipe ID.
124

124

00:06:20,150  -->  00:06:22,773
So here we test if it is liked.
125

125

00:06:23,720  -->  00:06:25,610
Here this will then return true or false,
126

126

00:06:25,610  -->  00:06:30,180
which is what we pass in to our render function.
127

127

00:06:30,180  -->  00:06:31,490
So not this one.
128

128

00:06:31,490  -->  00:06:33,579
Whoa, what's happening here?
129

129

00:06:33,579  -->  00:06:35,236
Well, anyway.
130

130

00:06:35,236  -->  00:06:37,840
So we pass it into this render recipe,
131

131

00:06:37,840  -->  00:06:39,770
saying if it's liked or not.
132

132

00:06:39,770  -->  00:06:42,673
Alright, so let's test it out now.
133

133

00:06:44,090  -->  00:06:48,670
And it says error processing recipe for some reason.
134

134

00:06:48,670  -->  00:06:52,280
Okay, so it means that it happens somewhere here.
135

135

00:06:52,280  -->  00:06:56,563
So that's actually locked an error to the console.
136

136

00:06:58,234  -->  00:07:00,500
Okay, so I'm not sure what's happening here
137

137

00:07:00,500  -->  00:07:04,560
because apparently something is wrong with this here.
138

138

00:07:04,560  -->  00:07:06,733
But I'm not really sure what it could be.
139

139

00:07:07,920  -->  00:07:10,350
So let's try to load this again.
140

140

00:07:10,350  -->  00:07:12,330
And so now we can see the actual error,
141

141

00:07:12,330  -->  00:07:14,623
cannot read property isliked of undefined.
142

142

00:07:15,910  -->  00:07:17,690
Let's take a look at that.
143

143

00:07:17,690  -->  00:07:20,070
It is at control recipe.
144

144

00:07:20,070  -->  00:07:24,400
And so the problem is right here.
145

145

00:07:24,400  -->  00:07:27,980
So it cannot read this state.likes.isliked
146

146

00:07:27,980  -->  00:07:29,750
because whenever we reload the page,
147

147

00:07:29,750  -->  00:07:32,860
we don't yet have a state.liked.
148

148

00:07:32,860  -->  00:07:34,520
Okay, and so therefore,
149

149

00:07:34,520  -->  00:07:37,073
we can't really read then this method.
150

150

00:07:37,990  -->  00:07:38,840
Okay?
151

151

00:07:38,840  -->  00:07:39,900
Now in the next video,
152

152

00:07:39,900  -->  00:07:42,280
we will make this liked data persistent.
153

153

00:07:42,280  -->  00:07:44,600
Basically, we will save it in the browser
154

154

00:07:44,600  -->  00:07:47,440
and when we reload the page, it'll still be there.
155

155

00:07:47,440  -->  00:07:48,970
And then it'll no longer be a problem.
156

156

00:07:48,970  -->  00:07:49,824
But, for now,
157

157

00:07:49,824  -->  00:07:51,982
a good way of fixing this
158

158

00:07:51,982  -->  00:07:54,510
is to simply out of everything
159

159

00:07:54,510  -->  00:07:55,920
so you're in the global scope.
160

160

00:07:55,920  -->  00:07:58,460
We can simply add a new like to the state
161

161

00:07:58,460  -->  00:08:00,220
whenever we load the page.
162

162

00:08:00,220  -->  00:08:03,290
Okay, so just for testing here
163

163

00:08:04,320  -->  00:08:06,790
so that we remove it later on.
164

164

00:08:06,790  -->  00:08:09,180
Alright, so let's test it out again now.
165

165

00:08:09,180  -->  00:08:11,360
And yeah, so now it's working.
166

166

00:08:11,360  -->  00:08:12,743
Let's search for pizza.
167

167

00:08:17,410  -->  00:08:20,310
And we liked it and we can dislike it and that still works.
168

168

00:08:20,310  -->  00:08:21,483
Let's like it again.
169

169

00:08:23,060  -->  00:08:25,490
And now let's try coming to the next one,
170

170

00:08:25,490  -->  00:08:26,693
like it as well.
171

171

00:08:28,251  -->  00:08:30,610
Go to another one and then come back to this one.
172

172

00:08:30,610  -->  00:08:33,050
And, you can see, it is still liked.
173

173

00:08:33,050  -->  00:08:34,120
Great.
174

174

00:08:34,120  -->  00:08:36,127
And this one here should also still be liked.
175

175

00:08:36,127  -->  00:08:37,680
We can unlike it,
176

176

00:08:37,680  -->  00:08:38,640
come back to this one,
177

177

00:08:38,640  -->  00:08:39,980
unlike it as well.
178

178

00:08:39,980  -->  00:08:42,730
Come back to this and it's still unliked,
179

179

00:08:42,730  -->  00:08:43,910
just like we put it before.
180

180

00:08:43,910  -->  00:08:47,170
So the functionality is now actually working.
181

181

00:08:47,170  -->  00:08:48,948
Next up, let's add a small function
182

182

00:08:48,948  -->  00:08:51,310
that will insure that this heart here,
183

183

00:08:51,310  -->  00:08:52,800
so this entire menu here,
184

184

00:08:52,800  -->  00:08:55,510
is only displayed when there is actually a like.
185

185

00:08:55,510  -->  00:08:56,690
And if there's no like,
186

186

00:08:56,690  -->  00:08:58,380
then this entire button here,
187

187

00:08:58,380  -->  00:09:01,420
liked heart button here, should disappear.
188

188

00:09:01,420  -->  00:09:05,173
Alright, back into the likes view.
189

189

00:09:07,160  -->  00:09:11,123
Let's say export const toggle like menu.
190

190

00:09:14,300  -->  00:09:16,500
And we can pass in the number of likes here.
191

191

00:09:17,608  -->  00:09:19,650
And based on that,
192

192

00:09:19,650  -->  00:09:20,520
we're gonna figure out
193

193

00:09:20,520  -->  00:09:23,970
if we should show or not the like menu.
194

194

00:09:23,970  -->  00:09:28,833
First off, we can actually add that element to our base js.
195

195

00:09:29,750  -->  00:09:32,870
So, let's take a look at the html.
196

196

00:09:32,870  -->  00:09:34,220
And it is right at the top.
197

197

00:09:35,350  -->  00:09:38,263
So what we're looking for is this.
198

198

00:09:39,310  -->  00:09:40,910
So this likes list here.
199

199

00:09:40,910  -->  00:09:43,140
Or actually this field here.
200

200

00:09:43,140  -->  00:09:45,397
Okay, so this here is the icon.
201

201

00:09:45,397  -->  00:09:48,693
And that's the one that we wanna to show or hide, depending.
202

202

00:09:49,638  -->  00:09:50,471
Base.js.
203

203

00:09:51,600  -->  00:09:52,930
Let's add a new one here.
204

204

00:09:52,930  -->  00:09:55,033
And I'm gonna call it the likes menu.
205

205

00:10:02,140  -->  00:10:04,637
Remember, likes menu.
206

206

00:10:04,637  -->  00:10:07,750
And all we have to do is say elements.likemenu
207

207

00:10:07,750  -->  00:10:11,410
and now we can manipulate this dial property.
208

208

00:10:11,410  -->  00:10:16,380
Okay, so in order to manipulate a single style in css.
209

209

00:10:16,380  -->  00:10:18,630
And what we're looking for is the visibility.
210

210

00:10:20,640  -->  00:10:21,960
Now as you already know,
211

211

00:10:21,960  -->  00:10:24,277
if we had many styles that we wanted to apply,
212

212

00:10:24,277  -->  00:10:26,510
then we would just define a class in css
213

213

00:10:26,510  -->  00:10:30,100
and then toggle that class here using JavaScript.
214

214

00:10:30,100  -->  00:10:33,270
But, in this case, it's just a simple visibility property.
215

215

00:10:33,270  -->  00:10:36,655
And so let's just do it like this with the style property.
216

216

00:10:36,655  -->  00:10:39,940
We can now do a ternary operator and say
217

217

00:10:39,940  -->  00:10:44,323
if number of likes is greater than zero,
218

218

00:10:45,426  -->  00:10:46,893
then it should be visible.
219

219

00:10:48,640  -->  00:10:50,820
And, if not, basically if it is zero,
220

220

00:10:50,820  -->  00:10:53,223
then we want it to be hidden.
221

221

00:10:55,830  -->  00:10:57,220
And that's it.
222

222

00:10:57,220  -->  00:11:00,500
That's all that it really takes here, in this case.
223

223

00:11:00,500  -->  00:11:01,333
Alright?
224

224

00:11:01,333  -->  00:11:03,393
So it's the toggle like menu.
225

225

00:11:04,790  -->  00:11:07,240
So index.js, coming back...
226

226

00:11:07,240  -->  00:11:09,640
And actually, it's right here.
227

227

00:11:09,640  -->  00:11:12,240
And so this should also happen in a control like.
228

228

00:11:12,240  -->  00:11:13,900
And it doesn't really matter
229

229

00:11:13,900  -->  00:11:16,320
if these are already liked or not.
230

230

00:11:16,320  -->  00:11:18,913
We can just add it here after all of this.
231

231

00:11:20,543  -->  00:11:23,263
Listview.togglelike.
232

232

00:11:25,198  -->  00:11:26,798
And it's not buttons, it's menu.
233

233

00:11:27,680  -->  00:11:31,350
Alright, and then in here we pass the number of likes,
234

234

00:11:31,350  -->  00:11:34,830
which remember we did a method for that actually.
235

235

00:11:34,830  -->  00:11:36,283
So get number of likes.
236

236

00:11:38,840  -->  00:11:41,725
State.likes.
237

237

00:11:41,725  -->  00:11:43,253
Get number of likes.
238

238

00:11:45,971  -->  00:11:49,640
Let's test this one out again.
239

239

00:11:49,640  -->  00:11:51,060
And we have a warning here.
240

240

00:11:51,060  -->  00:11:52,550
So thank you, webpack,
241

241

00:11:52,550  -->  00:11:53,731
for actually telling us
242

242

00:11:53,731  -->  00:11:56,853
that toggle like menu is not in the list view.
243

243

00:11:58,080  -->  00:11:59,216
And yeah, of course not.
244

244

00:11:59,216  -->  00:12:03,363
It's the likes view, obviously.
245

245

00:12:04,978  -->  00:12:07,043
Let's again search for pizza.
246

246

00:12:09,230  -->  00:12:11,240
Open this one here up.
247

247

00:12:11,240  -->  00:12:13,130
And actually it's already opened.
248

248

00:12:13,130  -->  00:12:15,710
Next one and now we have one like.
249

249

00:12:15,710  -->  00:12:17,150
And so it's here, of course.
250

250

00:12:17,150  -->  00:12:21,370
And now we should have zero likes and now it's gone.
251

251

00:12:21,370  -->  00:12:22,680
Now when we loaded the page,
252

252

00:12:22,680  -->  00:12:25,050
it was actually also there.
253

253

00:12:25,050  -->  00:12:27,200
So let's add the same outside here.
254

254

00:12:27,200  -->  00:12:28,650
And again this is just for testing
255

255

00:12:28,650  -->  00:12:31,183
because we are going to change this in the next lecture
256

256

00:12:31,183  -->  00:12:34,754
when we're gonna persist this likes data.
257

257

00:12:34,754  -->  00:12:36,000
But anyway, for now,
258

258

00:12:36,000  -->  00:12:37,550
let's just put it outside here
259

259

00:12:37,550  -->  00:12:38,843
so that when we reload it,
260

260

00:12:38,843  -->  00:12:41,510
then it's really gone.
261

261

00:12:41,510  -->  00:12:44,180
Okay, and last step,
262

262

00:12:44,180  -->  00:12:48,770
we will now finally render our likes into that menu.
263

263

00:12:48,770  -->  00:12:49,933
So just like this.
264

264

00:12:57,556  -->  00:13:01,890
This is again very similar to the way we did it before.
265

265

00:13:01,890  -->  00:13:06,890
Render the like and we're gonna pass in the like.
266

266

00:13:08,690  -->  00:13:13,690
And then create our markup variable just like usually.
267

267

00:13:19,750  -->  00:13:23,293
Now we need to get that markup from the html.
268

268

00:13:24,650  -->  00:13:28,083
So for each like, we will have this list item.
269

269

00:13:29,050  -->  00:13:30,193
And it is here.
270

270

00:13:34,760  -->  00:13:36,373
And what do we need to put here?
271

271

00:13:37,653  -->  00:13:41,030
Well, here is, of course, the ID.
272

272

00:13:41,030  -->  00:13:42,525
So like.id.
273

273

00:13:42,525  -->  00:13:45,872
And let's grab this and copy it.
274

274

00:13:45,872  -->  00:13:47,913
Here we have the image.
275

275

00:13:51,830  -->  00:13:55,240
Here we have the title as the alternative text
276

276

00:13:55,240  -->  00:13:56,603
Here also the title.
277

277

00:13:59,550  -->  00:14:01,103
And here the author.
278

278

00:14:04,100  -->  00:14:07,283
Okay, and then finally we need to insert the html.
279

279

00:14:08,380  -->  00:14:11,450
So first off, let's add this here to our elements.
280

280

00:14:11,450  -->  00:14:12,763
So the likes list.
281

281

00:14:18,050  -->  00:14:21,643
Likes list document query selector.
282

282

00:14:26,840  -->  00:14:31,840
Likes list and so elements.likeslist.insert adjacent html.
283

283

00:14:36,480  -->  00:14:39,573
And again, beforeend, and our markup.
284

284

00:14:44,410  -->  00:14:47,158
And since were at it here, we don't need to test it yet,
285

285

00:14:47,158  -->  00:14:51,430
let's first add the delete like function as well.
286

286

00:14:51,430  -->  00:14:55,343
Export delete like.
287

287

00:14:57,230  -->  00:15:00,120
And for that we need the ID as usual.
288

288

00:15:00,120  -->  00:15:01,470
So that's like the element.
289

289

00:15:06,750  -->  00:15:08,567
So document.queryselector
290

290

00:15:09,520  -->  00:15:14,057
and then we will do our special css selector,
291

291

00:15:15,570  -->  00:15:19,790
where we can select based on the href attribute.
292

292

00:15:19,790  -->  00:15:20,994
And we did this one here before
293

293

00:15:20,994  -->  00:15:25,173
in the search view, I believe.
294

294

00:15:30,413  -->  00:15:31,515
Yeah, it's down here.
295

295

00:15:31,515  -->  00:15:34,950
We select it based on the ID.
296

296

00:15:34,950  -->  00:15:36,450
And let's go ahead and actually copy it
297

297

00:15:36,450  -->  00:15:38,150
because it's the exact same thing.
298

298

00:15:40,180  -->  00:15:43,480
Okay, so we want to select all of the anchors.
299

299

00:15:43,480  -->  00:15:48,360
So all of the links which have the href with this ID.
300

300

00:15:48,360  -->  00:15:50,660
Alright, and actually this is not quite correct
301

301

00:15:50,660  -->  00:15:53,570
because we don't want to select all of the links.
302

302

00:15:53,570  -->  00:15:56,960
We just want to select the links that are a like.
303

303

00:15:56,960  -->  00:15:59,690
So we want to select not the links
304

304

00:15:59,690  -->  00:16:02,053
but the ones with the likes link class.
305

305

00:16:03,150  -->  00:16:07,340
So likes link and then the ones that have this ID.
306

306

00:16:07,340  -->  00:16:10,750
Okay, and the same actually applies to the search view here.
307

307

00:16:10,750  -->  00:16:13,020
So we don't want to select all of the links
308

308

00:16:13,020  -->  00:16:15,970
because then that might select the link in the likes list
309

309

00:16:15,970  -->  00:16:17,230
and not the one in the search results.
310

310

00:16:17,230  -->  00:16:19,480
And so that is here a small bug.
311

311

00:16:19,480  -->  00:16:23,223
And so instead, let's simply select the results link.
312

312

00:16:27,861  -->  00:16:32,861
It's this, the results link.
313

313

00:16:32,930  -->  00:16:36,450
That's the one that we need to actually select.
314

314

00:16:36,450  -->  00:16:38,970
Alright, so this selects the link.
315

315

00:16:38,970  -->  00:16:41,050
But we don't wanna just remove the link.
316

316

00:16:41,050  -->  00:16:44,170
We want to remove the entire li element, right?
317

317

00:16:44,170  -->  00:16:46,980
So we're selecting this link element.
318

318

00:16:46,980  -->  00:16:51,143
But what we wanna delete really is this entire list element.
319

319

00:16:52,260  -->  00:16:53,460
And that's very simple.
320

320

00:16:53,460  -->  00:16:55,373
We just select the parent.
321

321

00:16:57,490  -->  00:16:59,370
So parent element.
322

322

00:16:59,370  -->  00:17:00,690
Very simple.
323

323

00:17:00,690  -->  00:17:02,024
And if there is an element,
324

324

00:17:02,024  -->  00:17:03,925
so it's always best to test here
325

325

00:17:03,925  -->  00:17:06,820
if the selection was actually successful,
326

326

00:17:06,820  -->  00:17:10,110
so if there is an element we can then remove it.
327

327

00:17:10,110  -->  00:17:11,080
And just like before,
328

328

00:17:11,080  -->  00:17:13,823
we move up to the parent element and remove the child.
329

329

00:17:17,850  -->  00:17:21,503
Okay, now it is time to actually test this.
330

330

00:17:22,560  -->  00:17:24,357
And this is our version.
331

331

00:17:24,357  -->  00:17:29,357
Pizza and let's try it with the pizza quesadillas.
332

332

00:17:31,330  -->  00:17:32,200
No error.
333

333

00:17:32,200  -->  00:17:36,370
And it's here but it's not really in the list.
334

334

00:17:36,370  -->  00:17:38,071
So something went wrong here.
335

335

00:17:38,071  -->  00:17:40,510
While this functionality still works,
336

336

00:17:40,510  -->  00:17:41,820
and the button is still gone,
337

337

00:17:41,820  -->  00:17:43,480
but something in the code is not correct
338

338

00:17:43,480  -->  00:17:45,400
and it didn't even give us an error,
339

339

00:17:45,400  -->  00:17:48,083
so maybe it's just something with the render like.
340

340

00:17:48,083  -->  00:17:50,053
Yeah, I guess the problem is
341

341

00:17:50,053  -->  00:17:53,800
that we didn't really already call this function.
342

342

00:17:53,800  -->  00:17:56,140
Yeah, so we just logged it to the console.
343

343

00:17:56,140  -->  00:17:58,790
And so, of course, we need to do likesview.renderlike
344

344

00:18:01,610  -->  00:18:03,773
and pass in the new like.
345

345

00:18:05,280  -->  00:18:07,430
Okay, and so that's why we saved it here
346

346

00:18:07,430  -->  00:18:09,298
also to this variable.
347

347

00:18:09,298  -->  00:18:11,490
So we did the add like,
348

348

00:18:11,490  -->  00:18:14,760
which then, remember, returns the newly added like,
349

349

00:18:14,760  -->  00:18:16,420
so we can save it here into this variable
350

350

00:18:16,420  -->  00:18:19,640
and then pass it to the likes view module.
351

351

00:18:19,640  -->  00:18:24,260
Alright, so we have render like here and then also...
352

352

00:18:24,260  -->  00:18:26,940
Well, actually let's get rid of this console.log here.
353

353

00:18:26,940  -->  00:18:28,130
And here as well.
354

354

00:18:28,130  -->  00:18:30,280
We already know that it works.
355

355

00:18:30,280  -->  00:18:32,990
And so, all we have to do now is likesview.deletelike
356

356

00:18:35,920  -->  00:18:39,200
and what we need to pass in now is the ID.
357

357

00:18:39,200  -->  00:18:42,333
So current ID that we have up here.
358

358

00:18:43,730  -->  00:18:47,563
And so now, we should be good to go.
359

359

00:18:52,140  -->  00:18:53,850
So let's like this one.
360

360

00:18:53,850  -->  00:18:56,647
The heart appeared and here we go.
361

361

00:18:56,647  -->  00:18:58,900
And so we have pizza quesadillas.
362

362

00:18:58,900  -->  00:19:03,150
Now we have to also shorten the title here, right?
363

363

00:19:03,150  -->  00:19:05,300
So like it appears here.
364

364

00:19:05,300  -->  00:19:08,172
And we already have a function for that.
365

365

00:19:08,172  -->  00:19:10,468
So it's right here in the search view.
366

366

00:19:10,468  -->  00:19:13,310
It is the...
367

367

00:19:13,310  -->  00:19:14,143
Where is it?
368

368

00:19:14,143  -->  00:19:17,004
So it's the limit recipe title.
369

369

00:19:17,004  -->  00:19:19,000
Now we want to actually use it
370

370

00:19:19,000  -->  00:19:20,960
here in our likes view as well.
371

371

00:19:20,960  -->  00:19:22,272
So first we have to export it.
372

372

00:19:22,272  -->  00:19:26,490
And so, let's now actually import this entire module
373

373

00:19:26,490  -->  00:19:28,393
into our likes view module.
374

374

00:19:29,500  -->  00:19:31,313
Or actually not all of it.
375

375

00:19:32,550  -->  00:19:35,030
All we really want if the...
376

376

00:19:35,030  -->  00:19:37,350
And I have to go back to copy it.
377

377

00:19:37,350  -->  00:19:41,110
So all we want is just this function from search view.
378

378

00:19:46,962  -->  00:19:50,240
So here we have title and...
379

379

00:19:50,240  -->  00:19:51,427
It's actually not this one here.
380

380

00:19:51,427  -->  00:19:52,620
The one in h4.
381

381

00:19:52,620  -->  00:19:57,110
And let's now say limit the recipe title.
382

382

00:19:57,110  -->  00:19:58,510
And let's see if that works.
383

383

00:20:04,820  -->  00:20:08,020
Pizza, and we liked this one already.
384

384

00:20:08,020  -->  00:20:10,303
And, yeah, so now it's better.
385

385

00:20:12,030  -->  00:20:13,653
Let's now like this one as well.
386

386

00:20:14,970  -->  00:20:16,450
And indeed, here we go.
387

387

00:20:16,450  -->  00:20:20,330
And I can now click this and it takes me to that recipe.
388

388

00:20:20,330  -->  00:20:23,090
And at the same time, it also highlights it here.
389

389

00:20:23,090  -->  00:20:24,410
Everything's working perfect.
390

390

00:20:24,410  -->  00:20:26,569
Our icon is also still liked.
391

391

00:20:26,569  -->  00:20:28,710
If we take a look at this one,
392

392

00:20:28,710  -->  00:20:29,940
then this is not liked.
393

393

00:20:29,940  -->  00:20:31,870
But we can add it and, you can see,
394

394

00:20:31,870  -->  00:20:34,880
that is now added of course to this one.
395

395

00:20:34,880  -->  00:20:36,531
Now let's open one of these
396

396

00:20:36,531  -->  00:20:41,080
and let's unlike it and see what happens.
397

397

00:20:41,080  -->  00:20:41,913
And it's gone.
398

398

00:20:42,810  -->  00:20:43,710
So it's working.
399

399

00:20:43,710  -->  00:20:45,916
Our functionality is now fully implemented
400

400

00:20:45,916  -->  00:20:47,830
and it works just fine.
401

401

00:20:47,830  -->  00:20:49,720
Let's delete all of them
402

402

00:20:49,720  -->  00:20:52,963
and take a look if the button actually disappears.
403

403

00:20:54,000  -->  00:20:55,830
And indeed it does.
404

404

00:20:55,830  -->  00:20:59,500
Okay, let's add it back and here we go.
405

405

00:20:59,500  -->  00:21:02,190
And if you now reload this, then it's gone.
406

406

00:21:02,190  -->  00:21:03,770
So it's no longer liked.
407

407

00:21:03,770  -->  00:21:05,580
And so what we're gonna do in the next video
408

408

00:21:05,580  -->  00:21:07,710
is to actually persist this data.
409

409

00:21:07,710  -->  00:21:09,403
So basically save it in a browser
410

410

00:21:09,403  -->  00:21:11,600
and then when we reload the page,
411

411

00:21:11,600  -->  00:21:13,410
all our likes will still be there.
412

412

00:21:13,410  -->  00:21:16,457
So that's a bit more useful for the user
413

413

00:21:16,457  -->  00:21:19,633
if we were to use it on our local computer.
414

414

00:21:20,562  -->  00:21:24,730
Great work, great job making it all the way to this point.
415

415

00:21:24,730  -->  00:21:26,090
There's just a tiny bit missing,
416

416

00:21:26,090  -->  00:21:28,640
which is this functionality that I just talked about
417

417

00:21:28,640  -->  00:21:30,890
that we're gonna implement in the next video.
