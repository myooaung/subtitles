00:00:01,157  -->  00:00:02,744
<v Instructor>So with the last lecture</v>
2

2

00:00:02,744  -->  00:00:05,798
we completed the first step of our app.
3

3

00:00:05,798  -->  00:00:07,971
Congratulations for that.
4

4

00:00:07,971  -->  00:00:10,896
You have come a really long way.
5

5

00:00:10,896  -->  00:00:14,486
So let's now take a look at the structure of the app
6

6

00:00:14,486  -->  00:00:16,120
that we have built so far
7

7

00:00:16,120  -->  00:00:20,074
so that we can then outline what to do next.
8

8

00:00:20,074  -->  00:00:22,328
All right so this is how I like to represent
9

9

00:00:22,328  -->  00:00:25,313
the structure and architecture of an app
10

10

00:00:25,313  -->  00:00:28,354
like the one that we're building right now.
11

11

00:00:28,354  -->  00:00:30,265
So we have our three modules.
12

12

00:00:30,265  -->  00:00:31,713
So the budget controller,
13

13

00:00:31,713  -->  00:00:32,876
the app controller,
14

14

00:00:32,876  -->  00:00:34,628
and the UI controller,
15

15

00:00:34,628  -->  00:00:36,418
and in each one of them
16

16

00:00:36,418  -->  00:00:38,695
we can see the functions or methods
17

17

00:00:38,695  -->  00:00:40,736
that we have written so far
18

18

00:00:40,736  -->  00:00:42,613
and then with these green arrows
19

19

00:00:42,613  -->  00:00:45,030
we see the connections between them
20

20

00:00:45,030  -->  00:00:48,344
so that we can see functions calling other functions.
21

21

00:00:48,344  -->  00:00:49,971
So this really helps us
22

22

00:00:49,971  -->  00:00:53,929
to get a nice overview of what we're doing here, right.
23

23

00:00:53,929  -->  00:00:55,624
So it really makes it easier
24

24

00:00:55,624  -->  00:00:58,769
to plan and organize our app and code.
25

25

00:00:58,769  -->  00:01:00,700
For example we can see
26

26

00:01:00,700  -->  00:01:04,650
that effect that a simple click on our input button has,
27

27

00:01:04,650  -->  00:01:06,403
which is this green dot here
28

28

00:01:06,403  -->  00:01:08,400
that represents an event,
29

29

00:01:08,400  -->  00:01:11,246
and there will be more of them in the future.
30

30

00:01:11,246  -->  00:01:12,983
So as we know from our code
31

31

00:01:12,983  -->  00:01:17,722
clicking this button will call the control at item function
32

32

00:01:17,722  -->  00:01:21,257
which will then call all of the other functions and methods
33

33

00:01:21,257  -->  00:01:24,665
that we see here connected with the green arrows.
34

34

00:01:24,665  -->  00:01:26,981
So again this gives us a
35

35

00:01:26,981  -->  00:01:30,423
very nice high level overview of our app
36

36

00:01:30,423  -->  00:01:31,923
and I really advise you
37

37

00:01:31,923  -->  00:01:34,278
that you always draw up something like this
38

38

00:01:34,278  -->  00:01:35,702
for your own apps
39

39

00:01:35,702  -->  00:01:39,230
or whatever you're going to do with JavaScript.
40

40

00:01:39,230  -->  00:01:41,550
Let's now continue with the planning
41

41

00:01:41,550  -->  00:01:45,398
and see what we can do in step two of building our app.
42

42

00:01:45,398  -->  00:01:48,650
So far we can input data into our app,
43

43

00:01:48,650  -->  00:01:51,161
which is then stored in a data structure
44

44

00:01:51,161  -->  00:01:53,737
and displayed on a user interface.
45

45

00:01:53,737  -->  00:01:54,971
What's missing here
46

46

00:01:54,971  -->  00:01:58,314
is the functionality of deleting an item from this list.
47

47

00:01:58,314  -->  00:02:00,674
So let's take care of that now.
48

48

00:02:00,674  -->  00:02:04,394
So we already have our delete buttons in the UI,
49

49

00:02:04,394  -->  00:02:07,131
but they are not doing any work yet, right.
50

50

00:02:07,131  -->  00:02:08,516
So once more
51

51

00:02:08,516  -->  00:02:11,634
we start by adding an event handler to them.
52

52

00:02:11,634  -->  00:02:14,642
We then go ahead and delete this entire row
53

53

00:02:14,642  -->  00:02:17,314
as soon as the user clicks the button,
54

54

00:02:17,314  -->  00:02:21,785
both from our data structure and from the UI,
55

55

00:02:21,785  -->  00:02:23,394
and after that of course
56

56

00:02:23,394  -->  00:02:25,967
we also need to recalculate the budget
57

57

00:02:25,967  -->  00:02:29,625
and update it here on the user interface.
58

58

00:02:29,625  -->  00:02:33,090
All right so we have a nice little to do list here again
59

59

00:02:33,090  -->  00:02:36,090
so let's get back to work right now.
