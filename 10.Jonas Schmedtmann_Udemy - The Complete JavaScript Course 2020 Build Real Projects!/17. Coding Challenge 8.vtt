00:00:01.547  -->  00:00:04.192
<v Jonas>Hey there, it's now time for the final</v>
2

2

00:00:04.192  -->  00:00:06.108
coding challenge in this course,
3

3

00:00:06.108  -->  00:00:08.950
so that you can apply some of the new ES6 features
4

4

00:00:08.950  -->  00:00:12.508
that you just learned in this section.
5

5

00:00:12.508  -->  00:00:15.177
So in this challenge, what I want you to do
6

6

00:00:15.177  -->  00:00:17.025
is to imagine that you're working
7

7

00:00:17.025  -->  00:00:20.475
in a small town administration and that you're in charge
8

8

00:00:20.475  -->  00:00:24.306
of two town elements, parks and streets.
9

9

00:00:24.306  -->  00:00:26.286
And this is a very small town,
10

10

00:00:26.286  -->  00:00:30.128
so we currently only have three parks and four streets,
11

11

00:00:30.128  -->  00:00:34.493
but more parks or streets may be added in the future.
12

12

00:00:34.493  -->  00:00:36.859
Also, all of the parks and streets
13

13

00:00:36.859  -->  00:00:40.136
have to have a name and a build year.
14

14

00:00:40.136  -->  00:00:42.300
Now, at an end-of-the-year meeting,
15

15

00:00:42.300  -->  00:00:46.699
your boss wants a final report with the following data.
16

16

00:00:46.699  -->  00:00:49.127
First, he wants to know the tree density
17

17

00:00:49.127  -->  00:00:52.177
of each park in the town, and that's calculated
18

18

00:00:52.177  -->  00:00:56.344
by dividing the total number of trees by the park area.
19

19

00:00:57.410  -->  00:01:01.012
Second, the average age of each town's park
20

20

00:01:01.012  -->  00:01:03.587
and that one is calumniated by adding up
21

21

00:01:03.587  -->  00:01:08.302
all of the ages and dividing it by the number of parks.
22

22

00:01:08.302  -->  00:01:10.299
The third data that your boss wants to know
23

23

00:01:10.299  -->  00:01:14.282
is the name of the park that has more than 1,000 trees.
24

24

00:01:14.282  -->  00:01:16.838
So your boss knows that there is one park like this
25

25

00:01:16.838  -->  00:01:20.168
but he wants to know the name of that park.
26

26

00:01:20.168  -->  00:01:23.400
Okay, and as of the streets, we want to know
27

27

00:01:23.400  -->  00:01:26.374
the total and average length of the town's streets
28

28

00:01:26.374  -->  00:01:30.417
and also a size classification of each of the streets,
29

29

00:01:30.417  -->  00:01:32.940
and these should be classified into tiny,
30

30

00:01:32.940  -->  00:01:35.357
small, normal, big, and huge.
31

31

00:01:36.204  -->  00:01:37.816
And if the size is unknown,
32

32

00:01:37.816  -->  00:01:40.639
that the default is simply normal.
33

33

00:01:40.639  -->  00:01:44.396
And all this report data should be printed to the console
34

34

00:01:44.396  -->  00:01:45.675
so that it looks a little bit
35

35

00:01:45.675  -->  00:01:48.397
like this output that I have here.
36

36

00:01:48.397  -->  00:01:51.426
So we have the average age of our parks,
37

37

00:01:51.426  -->  00:01:54.534
and then in here, we also have the tree density
38

38

00:01:54.534  -->  00:01:56.520
of our three parks, and finally
39

39

00:01:56.520  -->  00:01:59.808
the park that has more than 1,000 trees.
40

40

00:01:59.808  -->  00:02:01.887
And for the streets, we have the total
41

41

00:02:01.887  -->  00:02:04.858
and average length and then the size classification
42

42

00:02:04.858  -->  00:02:08.520
for all of the four streets, and that's it.
43

43

00:02:08.520  -->  00:02:10.686
Now, in this challenge, I'm not gonna give you
44

44

00:02:10.686  -->  00:02:14.499
detailed steps on how to solve it like I did before,
45

45

00:02:14.499  -->  00:02:16.806
because I think that you're really ready
46

46

00:02:16.806  -->  00:02:19.399
to do it on your own at this point.
47

47

00:02:19.399  -->  00:02:22.058
And that being said, the goal of this challenge
48

48

00:02:22.058  -->  00:02:25.477
is of course that you use some of the ES6 concepts
49

49

00:02:25.477  -->  00:02:28.124
that we talked about just in this section.
50

50

00:02:28.124  -->  00:02:31.240
Things like classes, subclasses, template strings,
51

51

00:02:31.240  -->  00:02:34.015
default parameters, maps, arrow functions,
52

52

00:02:34.015  -->  00:02:36.848
and destructuring, for example,
53

53

00:02:36.848  -->  00:02:39.235
and of course, you don't need to build anything
54

54

00:02:39.235  -->  00:02:41.655
super fancy here because all I want
55

55

00:02:41.655  -->  00:02:43.596
with this challenge is for you to practice
56

56

00:02:43.596  -->  00:02:47.311
some of the new ES6 features here in this challenge.
57

57

00:02:47.311  -->  00:02:50.241
So, good luck with this one, and if you struggle
58

58

00:02:50.241  -->  00:02:53.193
with anything, then you can just watch the next video
59

59

00:02:53.193  -->  00:02:56.283
to see my personal solution to this challenge.
60

60

00:02:56.283  -->  00:02:59.866
But first, please try to do it on your own.
