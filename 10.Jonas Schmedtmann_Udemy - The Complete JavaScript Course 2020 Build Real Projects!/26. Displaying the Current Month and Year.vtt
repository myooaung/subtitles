00:00:01.857  -->  00:00:03.815
<v Instructor>In this lecture, we're gonna display</v>
2

2

00:00:03.815  -->  00:00:07.519
the current month and year in our user interface
3

3

00:00:07.519  -->  00:00:10.519
as soon as we start the application.
4

4

00:00:11.356  -->  00:00:13.401
And so in this lecture, you're gonna learn
5

5

00:00:13.401  -->  00:00:15.660
how to get the current date by using the
6

6

00:00:15.660  -->  00:00:17.660
date object constructor.
7

7

00:00:19.758  -->  00:00:23.439
So let's create a new method here in our UI controller
8

8

00:00:23.439  -->  00:00:25.106
called displayMonth.
9

9

00:00:35.523  -->  00:00:39.329
Okay, so we're gonna use the date object constructor
10

10

00:00:39.329  -->  00:00:43.376
in order to save the current date into a new variable.
11

11

00:00:43.376  -->  00:00:47.543
So let's call it now, so variable now is a new date,
12

12

00:00:49.226  -->  00:00:51.201
so remember, with object constructors,
13

13

00:00:51.201  -->  00:00:53.495
we have to use the new keyword such as we do
14

14

00:00:53.495  -->  00:00:57.969
with our own object constructors, and then if we simply
15

15

00:00:57.969  -->  00:01:01.406
don't paste anything into the date constructor,
16

16

00:01:01.406  -->  00:01:04.573
then it will return the date of today.
17

17

00:01:05.411  -->  00:01:09.022
We could also do it in a different way, so we could say
18

18

00:01:09.022  -->  00:01:13.105
var, for example, Christmas, and then a new date,
19

19

00:01:16.142  -->  00:01:18.721
and then we could paste into the year,
20

20

00:01:18.721  -->  00:01:21.875
so this year, for example, 2016, then the month,
21

21

00:01:21.875  -->  00:01:25.160
so for December, it's 11 because it's zero-based,
22

22

00:01:25.160  -->  00:01:26.634
and then the date.
23

23

00:01:26.634  -->  00:01:28.645
So this would return a date object
24

24

00:01:28.645  -->  00:01:31.596
with the Christmas date of this year.
25

25

00:01:31.596  -->  00:01:33.690
But that's not something so common to do.
26

26

00:01:33.690  -->  00:01:36.603
So usually, we simply use it like this
27

27

00:01:36.603  -->  00:01:39.594
to store the date of today.
28

28

00:01:39.594  -->  00:01:43.083
And then, we can use methods to retrieve the current year,
29

29

00:01:43.083  -->  00:01:46.029
or the current month, or the current day, or even
30

30

00:01:46.029  -->  00:01:50.902
the minute or second in which this date object was created.
31

31

00:01:50.902  -->  00:01:52.593
So let's start with the year
32

32

00:01:52.593  -->  00:01:55.426
and create a variable called year,
33

33

00:01:56.535  -->  00:02:00.702
and let me declare them up here, so var now, and year.
34

34

00:02:03.579  -->  00:02:07.880
And later, also month, so remove this here.
35

35

00:02:07.880  -->  00:02:12.047
So year is now, and this object now inherits a bunch
36

36

00:02:14.563  -->  00:02:17.639
of methods from the date prototype.
37

37

00:02:17.639  -->  00:02:22.608
And the one that we're gonna use here is getFullYear,
38

38

00:02:22.608  -->  00:02:26.141
and this is gonna return, in case that it's 2016,
39

39

00:02:26.141  -->  00:02:29.259
it's gonna return the year 2016.
40

40

00:02:29.259  -->  00:02:30.363
So really easy.
41

41

00:02:30.363  -->  00:02:34.417
Now, all we need to do is to display this on our web page.
42

42

00:02:34.417  -->  00:02:38.000
So let's look at that to find out the class
43

43

00:02:39.775  -->  00:02:44.363
and it's up here, so it's called budget title month.
44

44

00:02:44.363  -->  00:02:46.984
So I initially only wanted to put the month here,
45

45

00:02:46.984  -->  00:02:50.708
but now I'm gonna put the month and the year.
46

46

00:02:50.708  -->  00:02:55.459
So this will be a new element to the DOMstring object,
47

47

00:02:55.459  -->  00:02:58.876
so up here, and I'm calling it dateLabel.
48

48

00:03:04.681  -->  00:03:07.098
So, then I'm going back here.
49

49

00:03:07.935  -->  00:03:11.268
So now we can use document.querySelector
50

50

00:03:14.172  -->  00:03:16.589
and DOMstrings and dateLabel,
51

51

00:03:18.526  -->  00:03:22.663
and if we now set the textContent property of this
52

52

00:03:22.663  -->  00:03:24.996
to our year, it should work.
53

53

00:03:26.354  -->  00:03:28.396
So all we need to do now is to actually
54

54

00:03:28.396  -->  00:03:30.851
call this method here.
55

55

00:03:30.851  -->  00:03:33.397
And where's the best place to do that?
56

56

00:03:33.397  -->  00:03:36.020
It's of course in the init function, right?
57

57

00:03:36.020  -->  00:03:37.989
Because that's something that we want to happen
58

58

00:03:37.989  -->  00:03:41.843
right in the beginning, after we start our app.
59

59

00:03:41.843  -->  00:03:45.926
So I'm gonna say, UI controller dot displayMonth.
60

60

00:03:48.639  -->  00:03:51.489
Maybe I should have called it displayDate,
61

61

00:03:51.489  -->  00:03:53.008
but it doesn't really matter.
62

62

00:03:53.008  -->  00:03:57.229
So let's see if this works, and actually no,
63

63

00:03:57.229  -->  00:04:00.562
nothing happened here, so let's go back,
64

64

00:04:01.776  -->  00:04:03.578
and yeah, here, I see the problem,
65

65

00:04:03.578  -->  00:04:07.387
so I didn't actually call this function, this method, right?
66

66

00:04:07.387  -->  00:04:09.387
So that was the problem.
67

67

00:04:10.586  -->  00:04:13.002
Okay, now we have this weird,
68

68

00:04:13.002  -->  00:04:16.892
I don't know what this is, so let me create some space here.
69

69

00:04:16.892  -->  00:04:21.059
Function, getFullYear, so I guess I see what happened there,
70

70

00:04:23.452  -->  00:04:26.891
so the problem is that in here, I also didn't
71

71

00:04:26.891  -->  00:04:29.522
call this method, so of course this is a method,
72

72

00:04:29.522  -->  00:04:31.368
so I have to call it.
73

73

00:04:31.368  -->  00:04:34.067
So now, I'm sure it's gonna work.
74

74

00:04:34.067  -->  00:04:37.798
Let's see, and yeah, so 2016, the current year.
75

75

00:04:37.798  -->  00:04:39.522
If you're taking this course later,
76

76

00:04:39.522  -->  00:04:43.540
then maybe you'll see 2017, but 2016 is right now,
77

77

00:04:43.540  -->  00:04:46.043
as I'm recording this.
78

78

00:04:46.043  -->  00:04:50.043
And now, let's get the month here, so I'm saying
79

79

00:04:50.897  -->  00:04:52.730
month is now.getMonth.
80

80

00:04:56.707  -->  00:04:58.790
So it's also really easy.
81

81

00:05:02.243  -->  00:05:05.480
So month up here, and now, I simply say
82

82

00:05:05.480  -->  00:05:08.647
month plus a space, and plus the year.
83

83

00:05:12.616  -->  00:05:14.949
So let's see how that looks.
84

84

00:05:17.661  -->  00:05:19.992
And yeah, so it gives me a number.
85

85

00:05:19.992  -->  00:05:21.999
So month number eight.
86

86

00:05:21.999  -->  00:05:24.543
And we already know that this is zero-based.
87

87

00:05:24.543  -->  00:05:27.412
So now, we can do something very simple,
88

88

00:05:27.412  -->  00:05:32.245
which is simply an array containing all of the month names.
89

89

00:05:32.245  -->  00:05:35.860
So this is gonna be called month, okay?
90

90

00:05:35.860  -->  00:05:39.110
So let me first declare it here, month,
91

91

00:05:42.705  -->  00:05:45.788
and now let's write all of them here.
92

92

00:05:59.796  -->  00:06:04.049
So we're already halfway through, now only six more left,
93

93

00:06:04.049  -->  00:06:07.049
so July, August, September, October,
94

94

00:06:14.449  -->  00:06:16.949
and now November and December.
95

95

00:06:21.563  -->  00:06:25.063
So, something missing here, I'm all right,
96

96

00:06:26.320  -->  00:06:28.116
and now what we want here, down here,
97

97

00:06:28.116  -->  00:06:29.836
is no longer the month,
98

98

00:06:29.836  -->  00:06:32.919
but the index number of month, right?
99

99

00:06:34.706  -->  00:06:37.614
And remember, this is zero-based, so number zero
100

100

00:06:37.614  -->  00:06:41.890
will be January, and the eight that we saw is not August,
101

101

00:06:41.890  -->  00:06:46.063
but September, because September is the month number nine,
102

102

00:06:46.063  -->  00:06:49.094
and so in a zero-based array, it's number eight.
103

103

00:06:49.094  -->  00:06:51.921
So let's check this out.
104

104

00:06:51.921  -->  00:06:56.439
So all right, available budget in September 2016.
105

105

00:06:56.439  -->  00:07:00.744
So now you also know how to use dates in JavaScript.
106

106

00:07:00.744  -->  00:07:04.911
So let's now move on together, right to the next lecture.
