<v ->Congratulations on finishing the course.</v>

2

00:00:03.890  -->  00:00:05.990
So after going through all the videos
3

3

00:00:05.990  -->  00:00:08.410
and coding the project and the challenges,
4

4

00:00:08.410  -->  00:00:10.730
I hope that right now you are super confident
5

5

00:00:10.730  -->  00:00:13.170
to write code completely on your own
6

6

00:00:13.170  -->  00:00:15.550
and that you're ready to also continue
7

7

00:00:15.550  -->  00:00:16.950
your learning journey.
8

8

00:00:16.950  -->  00:00:19.488
Because a course like the one that you just finished,
9

9

00:00:19.488  -->  00:00:21.830
well, can only take you so far.
10

10

00:00:21.830  -->  00:00:24.420
It can give you an amazing foundation
11

11

00:00:24.420  -->  00:00:25.950
and a lot of knowledge,
12

12

00:00:25.950  -->  00:00:29.480
but in the end, you really need to practice on your own.
13

13

00:00:29.480  -->  00:00:30.640
Build your own apps,
14

14

00:00:30.640  -->  00:00:32.150
improve your website,
15

15

00:00:32.150  -->  00:00:33.914
come up with new projects to code
16

16

00:00:33.914  -->  00:00:37.030
and improve yourself every single day.
17

17

00:00:37.030  -->  00:00:39.100
Never stop learning.
18

18

00:00:39.100  -->  00:00:41.720
And that is especially true in Javascript
19

19

00:00:41.720  -->  00:00:43.300
and front-end web development,
20

20

00:00:43.300  -->  00:00:45.800
because things change very fast.
21

21

00:00:45.800  -->  00:00:47.740
And so this is a field where you have to be
22

22

00:00:47.740  -->  00:00:50.168
always learning and always be on top
23

23

00:00:50.168  -->  00:00:52.700
of everything that's happening in the industry.
24

24

00:00:52.700  -->  00:00:55.970
And I really know how hard that can be.
25

25

00:00:55.970  -->  00:00:58.750
And so in order to help you keep updated,
26

26

00:00:58.750  -->  00:01:01.720
I actually started a monthly newsletter last year.
27

27

00:01:01.720  -->  00:01:04.380
And my subscribers really appreciated that,
28

28

00:01:04.380  -->  00:01:07.750
because it's been super helpful for them ever since.
29

29

00:01:07.750  -->  00:01:09.130
So if you want to check it out,
30

30

00:01:09.130  -->  00:01:11.039
you can just subscribe to the newsletter
31

31

00:01:11.039  -->  00:01:12.920
over at jonas.io.
32

32

00:01:12.920  -->  00:01:14.770
Now once you feel confident enough with
33

33

00:01:14.770  -->  00:01:15.890
your new skills,
34

34

00:01:15.890  -->  00:01:18.420
you can also start learning popular libraries
35

35

00:01:18.420  -->  00:01:19.310
or frameworks,
36

36

00:01:19.310  -->  00:01:23.310
like jQuery, React, Angular, or Node.js
37

37

00:01:23.310  -->  00:01:25.300
and all of these technologies will enable
38

38

00:01:25.300  -->  00:01:27.510
you to build even cooler apps.
39

39

00:01:27.510  -->  00:01:30.310
And at the same time make you even more qualified
40

40

00:01:30.310  -->  00:01:32.860
to apply to real jobs in the industry.
41

41

00:01:32.860  -->  00:01:35.310
So if you really spend some more time learning
42

42

00:01:35.310  -->  00:01:37.710
and getting better and better at Javascript,
43

43

00:01:37.710  -->  00:01:39.450
and maybe some other technologies,
44

44

00:01:39.450  -->  00:01:42.070
then I'm 100% confident that
45

45

00:01:42.070  -->  00:01:44.900
you can start working in a field if that's your goal.
46

46

00:01:44.900  -->  00:01:47.890
I've seen students from this course and my other courses
47

47

00:01:47.890  -->  00:01:50.930
getting real jobs and starting real careers,
48

48

00:01:50.930  -->  00:01:53.660
and so I'm absolutely sure that you can achieve
49

49

00:01:53.660  -->  00:01:55.420
the exact same thing.
50

50

00:01:55.420  -->  00:01:58.050
So to finish, it was really nice
51

51

00:01:58.050  -->  00:01:59.550
having you in this course and
52

52

00:01:59.550  -->  00:02:01.940
taking this really amazing journey with you.
53

53

00:02:01.940  -->  00:02:04.578
And now I wish you good luck with your new skills,
54

54

00:02:04.578  -->  00:02:07.492
take care and see you next time.
