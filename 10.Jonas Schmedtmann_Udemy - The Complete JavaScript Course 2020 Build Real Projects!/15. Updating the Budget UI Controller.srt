00:00:01,595  -->  00:00:03,324
<v Instructor>Now comes the fun part</v>
2

2

00:00:03,324  -->  00:00:06,076
where we'll finally see the budget updating
3

3

00:00:06,076  -->  00:00:08,527
on the user interface.
4

4

00:00:08,527  -->  00:00:11,051
And since this will be a shorter lecture,
5

5

00:00:11,051  -->  00:00:13,823
we will just practice some more DOM manipulation
6

6

00:00:13,823  -->  00:00:16,577
by updating the budget and total values
7

7

00:00:16,577  -->  00:00:18,410
in the user interface.
8

8

00:00:20,221  -->  00:00:23,062
So of course we need to add a new method
9

9

00:00:23,062  -->  00:00:26,314
here to our user interface controller, right?
10

10

00:00:26,314  -->  00:00:28,981
And let's call it displayBudget.
11

11

00:00:30,296  -->  00:00:32,321
And let's put it here.
12

12

00:00:32,321  -->  00:00:36,071
So displayBudget.
13

13

00:00:39,238  -->  00:00:41,930
And what do we need here in order to be able
14

14

00:00:41,930  -->  00:00:44,258
to actually print the budget?
15

15

00:00:44,258  -->  00:00:46,354
Of course we need to update
16

16

00:00:46,354  -->  00:00:48,776
where all of this data is stored.
17

17

00:00:48,776  -->  00:00:52,943
So I'm going to call it (obj) just like we did before
18

18

00:00:54,499  -->  00:00:57,506
and this will then contain the four pieces of data
19

19

00:00:57,506  -->  00:00:59,569
that we want to print here, right?
20

20

00:00:59,569  -->  00:01:03,058
So the budget, the total income, the total expense
21

21

00:01:03,058  -->  00:01:05,347
and also the percentage.
22

22

00:01:05,347  -->  00:01:07,800
So we're going to do some more DOM manipulation
23

23

00:01:07,800  -->  00:01:10,215
and in order to do that we need to know
24

24

00:01:10,215  -->  00:01:12,120
the class names of the elements
25

25

00:01:12,120  -->  00:01:14,599
on our user interface that we want, right?
26

26

00:01:14,599  -->  00:01:18,147
And so once again we're going to add some more strings here
27

27

00:01:18,147  -->  00:01:21,001
to our DOM strings object so that we can use them
28

28

00:01:21,001  -->  00:01:23,319
then in our methods.
29

29

00:01:23,319  -->  00:01:25,894
So let's go to our html file
30

30

00:01:25,894  -->  00:01:29,500
where our user interface is stored, right?
31

31

00:01:29,500  -->  00:01:31,624
And so this is here in the top part
32

32

00:01:31,624  -->  00:01:33,804
as I showed you right in the beginning.
33

33

00:01:33,804  -->  00:01:37,838
So the actual budget value which will be stored here.
34

34

00:01:37,838  -->  00:01:40,421
So right here this is this
35

35

00:01:41,400  -->  00:01:43,610
will be called "budget_value".
36

36

00:01:43,610  -->  00:01:48,021
So let me copy this and then paste it here.
37

37

00:01:48,021  -->  00:01:52,728
And I'm going to call it budgetLabel
38

38

00:01:52,728  -->  00:01:55,085
because these basically act as labels
39

39

00:01:55,085  -->  00:01:57,483
in the user interface, okay?
40

40

00:01:57,483  -->  00:02:02,061
So the class selector and then the class name.
41

41

00:02:02,061  -->  00:02:04,621
Alright, so next one.
42

42

00:02:04,621  -->  00:02:08,422
So now we need our total income, which is here right,
43

43

00:02:08,422  -->  00:02:10,950
and the total expenses is down here.
44

44

00:02:10,950  -->  00:02:12,493
In this dif element.
45

45

00:02:12,493  -->  00:02:13,793
So let's just check.
46

46

00:02:13,793  -->  00:02:17,457
So it's this here and this.
47

47

00:02:17,457  -->  00:02:20,982
So these are called "budget_income_value"
48

48

00:02:20,982  -->  00:02:24,182
and "budget_expenses_value" down here.
49

49

00:02:24,182  -->  00:02:26,765
So let's add these two as well.
50

50

00:02:27,783  -->  00:02:30,450
So let me call this incomeLabel.
51

51

00:02:33,196  -->  00:02:36,410
And actually I didn't copy it.
52

52

00:02:36,410  -->  00:02:37,743
Okay.
53

53

00:02:40,890  -->  00:02:42,170
So now it's here.
54

54

00:02:42,170  -->  00:02:46,337
And now the expenseLabel.
55

55

00:02:50,814  -->  00:02:53,397
So income and expenses.
56

56

00:02:56,951  -->  00:02:59,469
And finally the percentage as well.
57

57

00:02:59,469  -->  00:03:02,882
So let me check that as well and it's here.
58

58

00:03:02,882  -->  00:03:07,151
So this is called "budget_expenses_percentage".
59

59

00:03:07,151  -->  00:03:08,687
And copy this as well
60

60

00:03:08,687  -->  00:03:12,020
and now percentageLabel.
61

61

00:03:15,913  -->  00:03:17,739
And now we're ready to use this.
62

62

00:03:17,739  -->  00:03:21,120
So remember we store all of these class names
63

63

00:03:21,120  -->  00:03:24,707
here in this central object that we have here
64

64

00:03:24,707  -->  00:03:26,082
so that we don't have all of these
65

65

00:03:26,082  -->  00:03:27,963
class names here floating around
66

66

00:03:27,963  -->  00:03:30,729
in all of these methods, okay?
67

67

00:03:30,729  -->  00:03:33,203
And so if something changes in the user interface
68

68

00:03:33,203  -->  00:03:36,821
you can simply come here and update all of these class names
69

69

00:03:36,821  -->  00:03:37,738
if we want.
70

70

00:03:38,742  -->  00:03:41,877
So this makes our lives as programmers much easier
71

71

00:03:41,877  -->  00:03:44,544
having these kind of structures.
72

72

00:03:45,549  -->  00:03:48,818
Okay now we already know how to display all of these values
73

73

00:03:48,818  -->  00:03:50,651
on our webpage, right?
74

74

00:03:51,779  -->  00:03:54,275
So we have done this a lot of time.
75

75

00:03:54,275  -->  00:03:57,608
So we use document.queryselector
76

76

00:03:58,482  -->  00:04:02,476
and then (DOMstrings.budgetLabel)
77

77

00:04:02,476  -->  00:04:04,056
which is the first one.
78

78

00:04:04,056  -->  00:04:07,019
And then in this case we don't want to change the html
79

79

00:04:07,019  -->  00:04:09,053
but only the text content.
80

80

00:04:09,053  -->  00:04:12,136
So we say textContent, okay?
81

81

00:04:13,264  -->  00:04:16,738
And now this should be equal to the budget
82

82

00:04:16,738  -->  00:04:20,034
and this budget comes here from the object
83

83

00:04:20,034  -->  00:04:22,067
that we pass into this method.
84

84

00:04:22,067  -->  00:04:27,018
So obj.budget
85

85

00:04:27,018  -->  00:04:28,499
and that's it.
86

86

00:04:28,499  -->  00:04:31,042
And now I'm just going to duplicate this line
87

87

00:04:31,042  -->  00:04:34,046
because we already know how to do this, right?
88

88

00:04:34,046  -->  00:04:36,528
So now I just need to replace a couple of things here
89

89

00:04:36,528  -->  00:04:38,462
to make it work.
90

90

00:04:38,462  -->  00:04:41,781
So the incomeLabel, right,
91

91

00:04:41,781  -->  00:04:44,934
and now we need to know the name of the property
92

92

00:04:44,934  -->  00:04:47,707
where the total income is actually stored.
93

93

00:04:47,707  -->  00:04:51,193
So let's go back to where we generate this object.
94

94

00:04:51,193  -->  00:04:53,964
So remember it's here in the getbudget method.
95

95

00:04:53,964  -->  00:04:56,740
So this is where we create the object
96

96

00:04:56,740  -->  00:04:59,763
that's going to be returned to the app controller
97

97

00:04:59,763  -->  00:05:03,874
which then passes it into the displayBudget method
98

98

00:05:03,874  -->  00:05:06,201
that we're working on right now.
99

99

00:05:06,201  -->  00:05:10,368
Let me just copy this so that I have the names here, okay?
100

100

00:05:13,474  -->  00:05:16,891
So, this one is call totalInc,
101

101

00:05:19,482  -->  00:05:22,232
totalInc,
102

102

00:05:23,125  -->  00:05:25,894
and here is the expensesLabel, right?
103

103

00:05:25,894  -->  00:05:29,962
And this one is called, as we see, totalExp
104

104

00:05:29,962  -->  00:05:31,663
just going to copy it.
105

105

00:05:31,663  -->  00:05:35,707
And then here this one is called percentageLabel
106

106

00:05:35,707  -->  00:05:38,927
and this should be percentageLabel.
107

107

00:05:38,927  -->  00:05:41,811
Let me change it in both places.
108

108

00:05:41,811  -->  00:05:42,644
Okay.
109

109

00:05:43,876  -->  00:05:46,050
And now this one is simply called percentage.
110

110

00:05:46,050  -->  00:05:48,633
So I'll copy and paste.
111

111

00:05:51,585  -->  00:05:53,165
And now before we can see this in action
112

112

00:05:53,165  -->  00:05:56,926
we need to of course call this method here, right?
113

113

00:05:56,926  -->  00:05:58,704
And also add this comma.
114

114

00:05:58,704  -->  00:06:00,925
Okay, so displayBudget is the method
115

115

00:06:00,925  -->  00:06:02,811
that we're going to call.
116

116

00:06:02,811  -->  00:06:04,021
Oh yeah it's here.
117

117

00:06:04,021  -->  00:06:06,385
So before we have this console.log here
118

118

00:06:06,385  -->  00:06:08,886
which we don't need anymore.
119

119

00:06:08,886  -->  00:06:11,305
And so now we use the UICtrl
120

120

00:06:11,305  -->  00:06:14,282
to call the displayBudget method.
121

121

00:06:14,282  -->  00:06:17,222
And now what we have to pass in here is the object
122

122

00:06:17,222  -->  00:06:19,841
that we called budget, right?
123

123

00:06:19,841  -->  00:06:21,701
So this object here.
124

124

00:06:21,701  -->  00:06:24,306
Which is, as I showed you a couple of moments ago,
125

125

00:06:24,306  -->  00:06:27,937
the object that is returned from the getBudget method.
126

126

00:06:27,937  -->  00:06:31,520
Okay and now we're ready to check this out.
127

127

00:06:35,104  -->  00:06:39,187
So project 1500 and alright.
128

128

00:06:40,112  -->  00:06:41,720
It works.
129

129

00:06:41,720  -->  00:06:45,062
So the budget is 1500, our income is 1500,
130

130

00:06:45,062  -->  00:06:47,326
and our expenses are zero.
131

131

00:06:47,326  -->  00:06:49,262
Let's now add another one,
132

132

00:06:49,262  -->  00:06:52,623
salary let's say, 2550
133

133

00:06:52,623  -->  00:06:54,728
and now it should be 4,000, right?
134

134

00:06:54,728  -->  00:06:55,926
So let's see.
135

135

00:06:55,926  -->  00:06:57,132
And yes it is.
136

136

00:06:57,132  -->  00:06:59,715
So it updated very nicely here.
137

137

00:07:00,788  -->  00:07:03,925
And now I'm going to add an expense as well
138

138

00:07:03,925  -->  00:07:08,107
and I'm going to call it holiday again for 1200.
139

139

00:07:08,107  -->  00:07:11,250
And it works, so we see 1200 here
140

140

00:07:11,250  -->  00:07:14,390
and our budget which is now 2800
141

141

00:07:14,390  -->  00:07:17,710
and then the percentage here is also correct.
142

142

00:07:17,710  -->  00:07:20,729
So with this holiday here we now know that we spent
143

143

00:07:20,729  -->  00:07:24,416
30% of the money that we made in this month.
144

144

00:07:24,416  -->  00:07:28,188
Now we don't only want this to be 30 here right?
145

145

00:07:28,188  -->  00:07:30,851
So let's add the percentage sign here.
146

146

00:07:30,851  -->  00:07:33,649
And actually there's another thing that we have to do.
147

147

00:07:33,649  -->  00:07:37,816
So let's reload this and let's simply add an income.
148

148

00:07:41,685  -->  00:07:43,916
So now we have minus 1%
149

149

00:07:43,916  -->  00:07:47,109
and we don't want the user to see minus 1% right
150

150

00:07:47,109  -->  00:07:49,789
because that doesn't make any sense at all.
151

151

00:07:49,789  -->  00:07:52,526
So we need to be prepared for this case
152

152

00:07:52,526  -->  00:07:54,533
and display something else there.
153

153

00:07:54,533  -->  00:07:56,513
So let's do this.
154

154

00:07:56,513  -->  00:07:59,930
So back to the displayBudget method here.
155

155

00:08:01,870  -->  00:08:04,609
We basically need an if else statement here right?
156

156

00:08:04,609  -->  00:08:06,329
So we say if there is a percentage,
157

157

00:08:06,329  -->  00:08:08,149
so if it's not minus one,
158

158

00:08:08,149  -->  00:08:10,432
then we want to add the percentage sign.
159

159

00:08:10,432  -->  00:08:13,968
So if it's 30 we want to display 30%,
160

160

00:08:13,968  -->  00:08:16,072
but if it's minus one we simply want to
161

161

00:08:16,072  -->  00:08:18,633
display something else.
162

162

00:08:18,633  -->  00:08:22,877
So let's say if obj.percentage
163

163

00:08:22,877  -->  00:08:25,149
is greater than zero
164

164

00:08:25,149  -->  00:08:28,186
then we want this to happen here.
165

165

00:08:28,186  -->  00:08:30,852
Let me cut this from here and paste it here.
166

166

00:08:30,852  -->  00:08:33,321
So we want this object percentage
167

167

00:08:33,321  -->  00:08:36,904
plus the percentage sign, right?
168

168

00:08:39,634  -->  00:08:44,133
But if it's not we want something else.
169

169

00:08:44,133  -->  00:08:47,382
So we don't want to see the percentage value here,
170

170

00:08:47,382  -->  00:08:49,771
but we want to see something that shows us
171

171

00:08:49,771  -->  00:08:52,281
that there is nothing to show actually.
172

172

00:08:52,281  -->  00:08:55,534
So let's put simply some of these dashes.
173

173

00:08:55,534  -->  00:08:58,046
And so this shows that it's empty.
174

174

00:08:58,046  -->  00:09:00,263
And notice that this is not only going to happen
175

175

00:09:00,263  -->  00:09:02,215
when the percentage is minus one,
176

176

00:09:02,215  -->  00:09:04,051
but also when it's zero, right?
177

177

00:09:04,051  -->  00:09:06,451
Because in here we said greater than zero.
178

178

00:09:06,451  -->  00:09:08,179
So this only happens,
179

179

00:09:08,179  -->  00:09:10,048
so this percentage is only shown
180

180

00:09:10,048  -->  00:09:12,594
if the percentage is greater than zero
181

181

00:09:12,594  -->  00:09:14,131
and not if it's greater or equal.
182

182

00:09:14,131  -->  00:09:16,204
But that's totally okay.
183

183

00:09:16,204  -->  00:09:18,537
So let's see that in action.
184

184

00:09:22,511  -->  00:09:25,011
So I'm going to add a holiday.
185

185

00:09:25,864  -->  00:09:29,917
So 1200 and yeah, now we have these three dashes
186

186

00:09:29,917  -->  00:09:32,751
that we had before, cool right?
187

187

00:09:32,751  -->  00:09:35,168
Let's now add a salary for us
188

188

00:09:36,776  -->  00:09:39,898
of 2400 and now we see
189

189

00:09:39,898  -->  00:09:42,552
that we spent 50%.
190

190

00:09:42,552  -->  00:09:45,195
So now it's working really good.
191

191

00:09:45,195  -->  00:09:48,468
Only one small thing that we can improve now is
192

192

00:09:48,468  -->  00:09:50,147
you see when we reload this
193

193

00:09:50,147  -->  00:09:52,822
then we have these weird numbers here
194

194

00:09:52,822  -->  00:09:55,381
that we obviously don't want, right?
195

195

00:09:55,381  -->  00:09:58,685
So remember there's something that runs each time
196

196

00:09:58,685  -->  00:10:00,677
that our application starts
197

197

00:10:00,677  -->  00:10:03,006
and do you remember what that is?
198

198

00:10:03,006  -->  00:10:05,667
Yes, it is the init function.
199

199

00:10:05,667  -->  00:10:08,433
So, we cannot only call
200

200

00:10:08,433  -->  00:10:10,511
this method that we just created
201

201

00:10:10,511  -->  00:10:12,730
each time that we input a new item,
202

202

00:10:12,730  -->  00:10:15,115
but we can call it right in the beginning
203

203

00:10:15,115  -->  00:10:17,812
when we start to run our application.
204

204

00:10:17,812  -->  00:10:19,979
So let's copy this
205

205

00:10:21,298  -->  00:10:22,715
and then
206

206

00:10:24,282  -->  00:10:28,605
say that we want to run this right in the beginning.
207

207

00:10:28,605  -->  00:10:30,617
Now the thing is that we don't want to pass
208

208

00:10:30,617  -->  00:10:32,703
the budget in here, right?
209

209

00:10:32,703  -->  00:10:36,056
Because what we want is basically do a reset everything.
210

210

00:10:36,056  -->  00:10:39,220
So we want everything to be set to zero.
211

211

00:10:39,220  -->  00:10:40,529
So what we need to pass here is
212

212

00:10:40,529  -->  00:10:43,105
actually an object similar to the budget object,
213

213

00:10:43,105  -->  00:10:46,301
but with everything set to zero.
214

214

00:10:46,301  -->  00:10:50,468
So let's just grab the object from up here, okay,
215

215

00:10:53,215  -->  00:10:54,792
and put everything to zero.
216

216

00:10:54,792  -->  00:10:56,499
So very simple.
217

217

00:10:56,499  -->  00:10:59,749
So back to our init function okay here.
218

218

00:11:00,778  -->  00:11:05,337
Let's pass this object, but we set everything to zero.
219

219

00:11:05,337  -->  00:11:08,013
So the budget is zero, the total income is zero,
220

220

00:11:08,013  -->  00:11:11,682
the total expense is zero, and the percentage is
221

221

00:11:11,682  -->  00:11:13,599
not zero but minus one.
222

222

00:11:15,014  -->  00:11:17,022
So there's no percentage at all.
223

223

00:11:17,022  -->  00:11:19,003
So let's check this now.
224

224

00:11:19,003  -->  00:11:22,331
So when we reload everything should be set to zero, right,
225

225

00:11:22,331  -->  00:11:23,554
and yes here it is.
226

226

00:11:23,554  -->  00:11:26,166
So no budget, no income, no expenses,
227

227

00:11:26,166  -->  00:11:28,851
and no percentage to show.
228

228

00:11:28,851  -->  00:11:31,517
Okay, and with this we have actually finished
229

229

00:11:31,517  -->  00:11:33,161
everything that we had planned
230

230

00:11:33,161  -->  00:11:36,573
for the first step of building this application
231

231

00:11:36,573  -->  00:11:39,253
and it already looks pretty cool right?
232

232

00:11:39,253  -->  00:11:41,563
So great work so far.
233

233

00:11:41,563  -->  00:11:44,453
So we can now already do a lot of stuff with this,
234

234

00:11:44,453  -->  00:11:46,018
but there are actually still
235

235

00:11:46,018  -->  00:11:48,773
a lot of more cool features coming up
236

236

00:11:48,773  -->  00:11:50,773
over the next lectures.
