00:00:01,490  -->  00:00:03,042
<v Jonas>Hello there.</v>
2

2

00:00:03,042  -->  00:00:05,524
It's time for another Coding Challenge
3

3

00:00:05,524  -->  00:00:07,849
so that you can apply some of the concepts
4

4

00:00:07,849  -->  00:00:09,400
that you just learned on a fun
5

5

00:00:09,400  -->  00:00:11,900
and practical coding exercise.
6

6

00:00:14,046  -->  00:00:15,714
So in this challenge, we're going
7

7

00:00:15,714  -->  00:00:19,218
to build a fun quiz game right here in the console.
8

8

00:00:19,218  -->  00:00:21,909
So you see here in the console, we have a question
9

9

00:00:21,909  -->  00:00:24,637
and then in here, we have this pop-up window
10

10

00:00:24,637  -->  00:00:27,081
where we can insert the correct answer.
11

11

00:00:27,081  -->  00:00:29,564
So there's no fancier interface.
12

12

00:00:29,564  -->  00:00:31,681
We do everything just here in the console
13

13

00:00:31,681  -->  00:00:34,208
and using this prompt window.
14

14

00:00:34,208  -->  00:00:37,052
So in here we can select a correct answer,
15

15

00:00:37,052  -->  00:00:38,069
and the question is
16

16

00:00:38,069  -->  00:00:40,228
"Is JavaScript the coolest programming language
17

17

00:00:40,228  -->  00:00:41,451
in the world?"
18

18

00:00:41,451  -->  00:00:43,852
And yes, of course, it is, right?
19

19

00:00:43,852  -->  00:00:45,477
So let's insert "zero" here.
20

20

00:00:45,477  -->  00:00:47,977
Okay, and then correct answer.
21

21

00:00:49,267  -->  00:00:50,814
So if you want to play again,
22

22

00:00:50,814  -->  00:00:53,057
we just reload the page, we get another question,
23

23

00:00:53,057  -->  00:00:56,400
and right now I only have three questions,
24

24

00:00:56,400  -->  00:00:58,190
and these are selected randomly,
25

25

00:00:58,190  -->  00:01:01,978
so it's very likely that we have the same questions again.
26

26

00:01:01,978  -->  00:01:03,311
So "zero" again.
27

27

00:01:04,747  -->  00:01:06,969
Let's reload this
28

28

00:01:06,969  -->  00:01:07,802
again,
29

29

00:01:09,253  -->  00:01:10,597
and now we have a new question
30

30

00:01:10,597  -->  00:01:13,328
"So what's the name of this course's teacher?"
31

31

00:01:13,328  -->  00:01:17,495
And as you already know, it's number two, Jonas, right?
32

32

00:01:19,116  -->  00:01:22,503
All right, so you see how this works, right?
33

33

00:01:22,503  -->  00:01:27,306
So let's take out some instructions for this challenge.
34

34

00:01:27,306  -->  00:01:31,219
So again, let's build a fun quiz game in the console.
35

35

00:01:31,219  -->  00:01:34,280
The first step is to build a function constructor
36

36

00:01:34,280  -->  00:01:37,332
called "Question" to describe a question.
37

37

00:01:37,332  -->  00:01:39,712
And a question should include, of course,
38

38

00:01:39,712  -->  00:01:41,788
the question itself, right?
39

39

00:01:41,788  -->  00:01:43,046
And the answers
40

40

00:01:43,046  -->  00:01:46,268
from which the player can choose the correct answer,
41

41

00:01:46,268  -->  00:01:49,693
and in here, you should choose an adequate data structure
42

42

00:01:49,693  -->  00:01:53,479
like an array, an object, or whatever you think is best.
43

43

00:01:53,479  -->  00:01:56,666
And then, also we need to store the correct answer
44

44

00:01:56,666  -->  00:02:00,169
so that we can check if the input answer is correct.
45

45

00:02:00,169  -->  00:02:02,981
And for this one, I would use a number.
46

46

00:02:02,981  -->  00:02:04,944
Okay, and then when you have the func and constructor
47

47

00:02:04,944  -->  00:02:07,307
properly set up, you can then use it
48

48

00:02:07,307  -->  00:02:09,548
to create a couple of questions.
49

49

00:02:09,548  -->  00:02:12,112
And then number three, store all of these questions
50

50

00:02:12,112  -->  00:02:14,938
inside an array because it makes it a lot easier
51

51

00:02:14,938  -->  00:02:16,771
to code step number four,
52

52

00:02:16,771  -->  00:02:18,728
which is to select one random question
53

53

00:02:18,728  -->  00:02:21,011
and log it to the console together
54

54

00:02:21,011  -->  00:02:23,336
with the possible answers, of course.
55

55

00:02:23,336  -->  00:02:25,372
And then each question should have a number
56

56

00:02:25,372  -->  00:02:28,715
such as we saw in the demonstration.
57

57

00:02:28,715  -->  00:02:30,916
And the hint that I can give you for this is
58

58

00:02:30,916  -->  00:02:35,156
to write a method for the question objects for this task.
59

59

00:02:35,156  -->  00:02:38,089
Then, after that, you use the prompt function
60

60

00:02:38,089  -->  00:02:40,410
to ask the user for the correct answer.
61

61

00:02:40,410  -->  00:02:42,361
And the user should then input the number
62

62

00:02:42,361  -->  00:02:45,181
of the correct answer, and these numbers are
63

63

00:02:45,181  -->  00:02:49,158
of course, the numbers that you displayed in task four.
64

64

00:02:49,158  -->  00:02:52,054
And then finally, you check if the answer is correct,
65

65

00:02:52,054  -->  00:02:53,358
and print to the console
66

66

00:02:53,358  -->  00:02:55,601
whether the answer is correct or not.
67

67

00:02:55,601  -->  00:02:59,428
And I would write another method for doing this.
68

68

00:02:59,428  -->  00:03:02,898
Now in the end, suppose that this code would be a plug in
69

69

00:03:02,898  -->  00:03:05,786
for other programmers to use in their code.
70

70

00:03:05,786  -->  00:03:10,064
So we have to make sure that all of your code is private
71

71

00:03:10,064  -->  00:03:13,367
and doesn't interfere with the other programmer's code,
72

72

00:03:13,367  -->  00:03:14,874
and we learned a special technique
73

73

00:03:14,874  -->  00:03:17,318
in this section to do exactly that,
74

74

00:03:17,318  -->  00:03:21,071
so use that one to complete this step.
75

75

00:03:21,071  -->  00:03:23,716
So this is the most basic version of the quiz,
76

76

00:03:23,716  -->  00:03:27,016
but this time I also have an expert level.
77

77

00:03:27,016  -->  00:03:29,418
And so let's take a look at that first,
78

78

00:03:29,418  -->  00:03:32,962
and then let's see the instructions here.
79

79

00:03:32,962  -->  00:03:35,525
So this time after we answer to one question,
80

80

00:03:35,525  -->  00:03:37,984
we will always get a new question.
81

81

00:03:37,984  -->  00:03:40,675
And we also keep a score and display it
82

82

00:03:40,675  -->  00:03:44,667
so that we know how many answers were correct.
83

83

00:03:44,667  -->  00:03:47,516
So again, "What is the name of this course's teacher?"
84

84

00:03:47,516  -->  00:03:49,554
And number two, Jonas.
85

85

00:03:49,554  -->  00:03:53,133
You see we get a new question right away here, right?
86

86

00:03:53,133  -->  00:03:56,472
We see the correct answer, then your score is one
87

87

00:03:56,472  -->  00:03:59,319
because we have one correct answer at this point,
88

88

00:03:59,319  -->  00:04:01,316
and then we get the new question here.
89

89

00:04:01,316  -->  00:04:02,906
So "Is JavaScript the coolest programming
90

90

00:04:02,906  -->  00:04:04,859
language in the world?"
91

91

00:04:04,859  -->  00:04:05,692
And yes.
92

92

00:04:07,192  -->  00:04:10,654
Okay, so now we have two points.
93

93

00:04:10,654  -->  00:04:12,931
So "What's the name of the course's teacher" again?
94

94

00:04:12,931  -->  00:04:15,132
So let's now put a wrong answer here.
95

95

00:04:15,132  -->  00:04:19,132
Let's say one, and then wrong answer, try again,
96

96

00:04:20,465  -->  00:04:24,632
and our current score keeps at two, such as it was before.
97

97

00:04:25,721  -->  00:04:30,243
So this question again, so number two, "zero"
98

98

00:04:30,243  -->  00:04:32,894
and here is the third question that I wanted to show you.
99

99

00:04:32,894  -->  00:04:34,968
So "What does best describe coding?"
100

100

00:04:34,968  -->  00:04:38,024
It's boring, hard, fun, or tedious?
101

101

00:04:38,024  -->  00:04:42,410
So the answer is, of course, number two, right?
102

102

00:04:42,410  -->  00:04:45,267
And now our current score is five.
103

103

00:04:45,267  -->  00:04:48,362
So this version of the quiz is a lot more fun, right?
104

104

00:04:48,362  -->  00:04:51,578
So let's see the instructions for this one.
105

105

00:04:51,578  -->  00:04:53,858
So after you display the result,
106

106

00:04:53,858  -->  00:04:56,182
you should display the next random question
107

107

00:04:56,182  -->  00:04:58,791
so that the game never ends.
108

108

00:04:58,791  -->  00:05:01,561
And if I were you, I would write a function for this,
109

109

00:05:01,561  -->  00:05:04,859
and then call it right after displaying the result.
110

110

00:05:04,859  -->  00:05:06,854
But be careful because if you do that,
111

111

00:05:06,854  -->  00:05:10,518
then the game will actually literally never end.
112

112

00:05:10,518  -->  00:05:13,613
So you have to include an option to quit the game
113

113

00:05:13,613  -->  00:05:16,749
if the user writes "exit" instead of the answer,
114

114

00:05:16,749  -->  00:05:19,272
and then in this case, you don't call the function here
115

115

00:05:19,272  -->  00:05:20,814
in task eight.
116

116

00:05:20,814  -->  00:05:23,341
Let me actually show that to you.
117

117

00:05:23,341  -->  00:05:24,809
Okay.
118

118

00:05:24,809  -->  00:05:27,054
Because if I hit cancel,
119

119

00:05:27,054  -->  00:05:31,132
then I will always get a new window, you see?
120

120

00:05:31,132  -->  00:05:34,053
I cannot close this, and so the only way
121

121

00:05:34,053  -->  00:05:36,589
to exit this game is to write "exit" here,
122

122

00:05:36,589  -->  00:05:38,873
and that's because I coded it this way.
123

123

00:05:38,873  -->  00:05:41,623
So "exit" and then the game ends.
124

124

00:05:42,585  -->  00:05:45,313
Okay, so you have to code this too.
125

125

00:05:45,313  -->  00:05:48,739
Now after that works, you can track the user's score
126

126

00:05:48,739  -->  00:05:50,899
to make the game even more fun.
127

127

00:05:50,899  -->  00:05:53,388
So each time that the answer is correct,
128

128

00:05:53,388  -->  00:05:57,348
you just add one point to the score, and for this task,
129

129

00:05:57,348  -->  00:06:00,567
I am actually going to use the power of closures,
130

130

00:06:00,567  -->  00:06:02,853
but of course, you don't have to, you can do it
131

131

00:06:02,853  -->  00:06:05,542
in another way because for me,
132

132

00:06:05,542  -->  00:06:07,746
the most important thing at this point,
133

133

00:06:07,746  -->  00:06:10,401
is that you actually write the code on your own,
134

134

00:06:10,401  -->  00:06:12,926
so that you really try to solve these problems
135

135

00:06:12,926  -->  00:06:14,719
on your own, okay?
136

136

00:06:14,719  -->  00:06:16,551
It's absolutely no problem
137

137

00:06:16,551  -->  00:06:19,002
if your code is different from mine.
138

138

00:06:19,002  -->  00:06:21,206
The most important thing again is
139

139

00:06:21,206  -->  00:06:23,085
that you should really do it on your own
140

140

00:06:23,085  -->  00:06:24,875
at this point because right now
141

141

00:06:24,875  -->  00:06:26,590
in the beginning of your journey,
142

142

00:06:26,590  -->  00:06:29,641
the most important thing is that you really practice,
143

143

00:06:29,641  -->  00:06:31,230
and that your code works.
144

144

00:06:31,230  -->  00:06:34,120
Then, optimizing your code to make it perfect,
145

145

00:06:34,120  -->  00:06:35,747
that comes after that.
146

146

00:06:35,747  -->  00:06:38,397
But for now, just get your hands dirty with some coding,
147

147

00:06:38,397  -->  00:06:41,574
and not trying to make it perfect, okay?
148

148

00:06:41,574  -->  00:06:44,183
Then finally, in the end, just display the score
149

149

00:06:44,183  -->  00:06:47,686
in a console such as you saw in the demo before.
150

150

00:06:47,686  -->  00:06:49,843
And for that, you can use another method.
151

151

00:06:49,843  -->  00:06:52,659
So again, just try to code this on your own,
152

152

00:06:52,659  -->  00:06:55,345
and then after that, once everything works the way
153

153

00:06:55,345  -->  00:06:57,754
I showed you, you can check out the solution
154

154

00:06:57,754  -->  00:07:02,030
to see the way I implemented this game, okay?
155

155

00:07:02,030  -->  00:07:06,197
So good luck, and take all the time that you need.
