00:00:01.130  -->  00:00:02.710
<v Jonas>So here goes my solution</v>
2

2

00:00:02.710  -->  00:00:05.340
to coding challenge number two.
3

3

00:00:05.340  -->  00:00:08.163
So let's start by calculating the average scores.
4

4

00:00:09.090  -->  00:00:13.867
So var scoreJohn is equal to, and we have the points,
5

5

00:00:18.370  -->  00:00:23.370
so 89 plus 120 plus 103 divided by three.
6

6

00:00:27.860  -->  00:00:32.860
Then var scoreMike is equal to 116 plus 94
7

7

00:00:37.070  -->  00:00:41.113
plus 123 divided by three again.
8

8

00:00:42.160  -->  00:00:44.260
Now let's simply log these to the console.
9

9

00:00:46.681  -->  00:00:48.703
scoreJohn and scoreMike and here we go.
10

10

00:00:52.030  -->  00:00:54.630
So the average score for John 104, and for Mike 111.
11

11

00:00:56.155  -->  00:00:58.040
So Mike is clearly the winner here,
12

12

00:00:58.040  -->  00:01:00.830
and so let's now log that to the console.
13

13

00:01:00.830  -->  00:01:02.340
Okay, and so what we're gonna do here
14

14

00:01:02.340  -->  00:01:04.643
is of course an if else statement.
15

15

00:01:05.520  -->  00:01:10.520
So give it some space here, and now if scoreJohn
16

16

00:01:12.220  -->  00:01:17.220
is greater than scoreMike, well then log to the console
17

17

00:01:21.090  -->  00:01:26.090
that John's, now we need to escape this quote here,
18

18

00:01:26.970  -->  00:01:31.920
so John's team wins with, and now let's also
19

19

00:01:31.920  -->  00:01:33.740
include the score here as I mentioned
20

20

00:01:33.740  -->  00:01:38.110
in the instructions, so scoreJohn points.
21

21

00:01:41.960  -->  00:01:46.090
Alright, and else if, if it's the
22

22

00:01:46.090  -->  00:01:48.650
other way around basically, so scoreMike
23

23

00:01:49.750  -->  00:01:53.287
is greater than scoreJohn, well then
24

24

00:01:57.670  -->  00:02:01.440
let's of course log that Mike's team wins.
25

25

00:02:01.440  -->  00:02:06.190
Then here we also need to use the score of Mike, okay?
26

26

00:02:06.190  -->  00:02:08.930
And then else, and that's the situation
27

27

00:02:08.930  -->  00:02:12.230
where there is a draw, so if John's score
28

28

00:02:12.230  -->  00:02:14.630
is not greater than Mike's and Mike's score
29

29

00:02:14.630  -->  00:02:17.300
is also not greater than John, well then it means
30

30

00:02:17.300  -->  00:02:19.240
that they have the same score, okay?
31

31

00:02:19.240  -->  00:02:21.580
And so that is here in this else block,
32

32

00:02:21.580  -->  00:02:24.280
and so in here we can simply log that there is a draw.
33

33

00:02:30.390  -->  00:02:33.440
So let's test it out, and so yeah,
34

34

00:02:33.440  -->  00:02:36.110
Mike's team wins with 111 points.
35

35

00:02:36.110  -->  00:02:41.030
Let's now increase this here, let's say to 129,
36

36

00:02:41.030  -->  00:02:44.200
and so now probably John wins.
37

37

00:02:44.200  -->  00:02:47.290
And yeah, here we go, so now John's team wins.
38

38

00:02:47.290  -->  00:02:51.980
Now let's try to have a tie here.
39

39

00:02:51.980  -->  00:02:56.980
So we had 89 before, let's put it to 95, and we need
40

40

00:02:58.010  -->  00:03:02.123
some more points here so lets increase this to 115.
41

41

00:03:04.030  -->  00:03:06.873
That was a bit too much, 112 maybe.
42

42

00:03:08.940  -->  00:03:10.823
And now we're almost there I guess.
43

43

00:03:12.010  -->  00:03:15.750
Yeah, so now they have the same scores, so both have 111,
44

44

00:03:15.750  -->  00:03:18.480
and so now we see that there is a draw,
45

45

00:03:18.480  -->  00:03:21.860
and so of course none of these situations here apply,
46

46

00:03:21.860  -->  00:03:24.300
because John's score is not greater than Mike's score,
47

47

00:03:24.300  -->  00:03:26.980
and Mike's score is not greater than John's score,
48

48

00:03:26.980  -->  00:03:28.570
and so of course we have a draw.
49

49

00:03:28.570  -->  00:03:29.980
So that is the easier part.
50

50

00:03:29.980  -->  00:03:33.330
Now let's also add Mary to the game.
51

51

00:03:33.330  -->  00:03:38.330
So var scoreMary equals, and let's get her points.
52

52

00:03:42.770  -->  00:03:47.203
So 97, 134, and 105.
53

53

00:03:48.950  -->  00:03:52.550
This should be a comma, obviously, and now,
54

54

00:03:52.550  -->  00:03:56.790
this should be plus signs of course, sorry for that.
55

55

00:03:56.790  -->  00:04:00.803
So we add all of them together and then divide it by three.
56

56

00:04:05.330  -->  00:04:08.060
Also log it to the console just to make sure.
57

57

00:04:08.060  -->  00:04:11.750
So she has 112, let's put back what we had initially,
58

58

00:04:11.750  -->  00:04:16.750
so it was 89, and so now we have these
59

59

00:04:17.330  -->  00:04:20.090
three different scores, alright?
60

60

00:04:20.090  -->  00:04:23.210
So let's get rid of this part, and I'm not gonna delete it,
61

61

00:04:23.210  -->  00:04:27.300
I'll just comment it out, and okay.
62

62

00:04:27.300  -->  00:04:29.720
So how can John win the game?
63

63

00:04:29.720  -->  00:04:32.410
Basically he has to have more points than Mike
64

64

00:04:32.410  -->  00:04:35.550
and also more points than Mary, right?
65

65

00:04:35.550  -->  00:04:38.440
And so that's what we have to translate into code now.
66

66

00:04:38.440  -->  00:04:42.607
So an if else statement, and we have to say that scoreJohn
67

67

00:04:42.607  -->  00:04:47.607
should be greater than scoreMike and scoreJohn
68

68

00:04:49.649  -->  00:04:52.820
should be greater than scoreMary.
69

69

00:04:52.820  -->  00:04:54.310
Okay and that's it.
70

70

00:04:54.310  -->  00:04:55.870
So does that make sense?
71

71

00:04:55.870  -->  00:04:59.370
That is a great use case of the and operator here.
72

72

00:04:59.370  -->  00:05:02.360
And it works like this because we need this here to be
73

73

00:05:02.360  -->  00:05:06.320
true and at the same time we need this to be true.
74

74

00:05:06.320  -->  00:05:07.890
So John's score needs to be greater
75

75

00:05:07.890  -->  00:05:11.720
than both Mary's and Mike's, alright?
76

76

00:05:11.720  -->  00:05:14.750
And so only in that case we will want
77

77

00:05:14.750  -->  00:05:17.820
to print that John's team wins the game.
78

78

00:05:17.820  -->  00:05:21.010
And then from here, it's actually pretty straightforward.
79

79

00:05:21.010  -->  00:05:23.490
So once we understand how the logic works,
80

80

00:05:23.490  -->  00:05:27.210
all we have to do is to do the same for the other players.
81

81

00:05:27.210  -->  00:05:29.900
So how does Mike win the game?
82

82

00:05:29.900  -->  00:05:32.900
Well of course he has to have a larger score
83

83

00:05:32.900  -->  00:05:36.010
than the other two, so scoreMike needs to be greater
84

84

00:05:36.010  -->  00:05:40.293
than scoreJohn and at the same time,
85

85

00:05:41.934  -->  00:05:44.808
scoreMike, and what happened here,
86

86

00:05:44.808  -->  00:05:47.558
scoreMike greater than scoreMary.
87

87

00:05:52.012  -->  00:05:56.679
So John, and here we have Mike, and of course scoreMike.
88

88

00:05:57.520  -->  00:06:00.823
And then finally the same for Mary.
89

89

00:06:03.450  -->  00:06:07.917
So scoreMary needs to be larger than scoreJohn,
90

90

00:06:08.770  -->  00:06:13.263
and scoreMary greater than scoreMike.
91

91

00:06:17.217  -->  00:06:20.993
And now we say that Mary's team wins and here the scoreMary.
92

92

00:06:26.840  -->  00:06:30.430
Alright, now what about the other situations?
93

93

00:06:30.430  -->  00:06:33.700
Well let's just use an else here
94

94

00:06:33.700  -->  00:06:38.563
and say that there is a draw, okay?
95

95

00:06:43.830  -->  00:06:45.520
So this doesn't really cover all of the different
96

96

00:06:45.520  -->  00:06:48.030
situations here, but that's not a big deal.
97

97

00:06:48.030  -->  00:06:50.060
So for this small example, it's okay.
98

98

00:06:50.060  -->  00:06:53.230
Imagine that Mary and John had both the same score,
99

99

00:06:53.230  -->  00:06:56.960
but a larger score than Mike, so they two would have a tie,
100

100

00:06:56.960  -->  00:06:59.170
but would still have more points than Mike,
101

101

00:06:59.170  -->  00:07:02.260
and so that's one of the situations in which we will enter
102

102

00:07:02.260  -->  00:07:05.530
this else block and display that there is a draw, okay?
103

103

00:07:05.530  -->  00:07:09.500
So these three situations here only work for a clear winner,
104

104

00:07:09.500  -->  00:07:11.500
alright, but again that's not a big deal.
105

105

00:07:11.500  -->  00:07:14.030
We don't need to cover every single situation here.
106

106

00:07:14.030  -->  00:07:16.650
So these are the more important of course,
107

107

00:07:16.650  -->  00:07:19.820
where we can define which one is the clear winner.
108

108

00:07:19.820  -->  00:07:22.190
So let's try it out now, and indeed
109

109

00:07:22.190  -->  00:07:25.600
Mary's team wins with 112 points.
110

110

00:07:25.600  -->  00:07:28.010
Let's add some points here to Mike,
111

111

00:07:28.010  -->  00:07:30.650
and if we add three points, then he will have
112

112

00:07:30.650  -->  00:07:34.690
the same score as Mary, so let's put it to 19 here,
113

113

00:07:34.690  -->  00:07:37.690
and they now have both 112, and so we see
114

114

00:07:37.690  -->  00:07:40.840
that there is a draw, so perfect.
115

115

00:07:40.840  -->  00:07:43.570
And if we now increase this even further,
116

116

00:07:43.570  -->  00:07:48.260
let's say 29, well then of course Mike's team
117

117

00:07:48.260  -->  00:07:50.820
has the most points, and now finally let's add
118

118

00:07:50.820  -->  00:07:53.120
some more points here to John, just to test
119

119

00:07:53.120  -->  00:07:55.180
that all three cases work, and indeed,
120

120

00:07:55.180  -->  00:07:58.130
now he has the most points and he is declared the winner.
121

121

00:07:58.130  -->  00:07:59.620
Great, so that's it.
122

122

00:07:59.620  -->  00:08:02.460
I hope you figured it out and so now you are
123

123

00:08:02.460  -->  00:08:05.850
really ready to finally move on to the next part
124

124

00:08:05.850  -->  00:08:09.080
of this intro section, which is the hugely important topic
125

125

00:08:09.080  -->  00:08:12.123
of functions, so join me right there in the next video.
