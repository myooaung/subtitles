00:00:01,739  -->  00:00:02,737
<v Instructor>In this lecture,</v>
2

2

00:00:02,737  -->  00:00:04,346
it's finally time
3

3

00:00:04,346  -->  00:00:06,631
to add our newly created object
4

4

00:00:06,631  -->  00:00:08,914
to the user interface
5

5

00:00:08,914  -->  00:00:11,480
and this means that we're going to do some DOM manipulation
6

6

00:00:11,480  -->  00:00:14,784
for the first time in this project
7

7

00:00:14,784  -->  00:00:17,661
and this means that you're going to learn
8

8

00:00:17,661  -->  00:00:22,518
a technique for adding big chunks of HTML into the DOM,
9

9

00:00:22,518  -->  00:00:24,791
how to replace parts of strings,
10

10

00:00:24,791  -->  00:00:27,576
and also how to do DOM manipulation
11

11

00:00:27,576  -->  00:00:30,743
using the insert Adjacent HTML method.
12

12

00:00:32,108  -->  00:00:36,762
So it's time to go back to our user interface controller
13

13

00:00:36,762  -->  00:00:40,749
and add a new public method here right
14

14

00:00:40,749  -->  00:00:44,180
and I'm going to put it right here
15

15

00:00:44,180  -->  00:00:47,498
and this one is going to be called add a list item.
16

16

00:00:47,498  -->  00:00:48,915
So add list item.
17

17

00:00:52,409  -->  00:00:54,492
So our function as always
18

18

00:00:56,835  -->  00:00:58,418
enter function body
19

19

00:00:59,907  -->  00:01:02,014
and what kind of information do we need
20

20

00:01:02,014  -->  00:01:04,474
to add this new item to the list?
21

21

00:01:04,474  -->  00:01:07,961
First we need the object itself.
22

22

00:01:07,961  -->  00:01:10,156
So let's call it object
23

23

00:01:10,156  -->  00:01:12,526
and then the type so if it's an incoming
24

24

00:01:12,526  -->  00:01:14,940
or an expanse so we already know that.
25

25

00:01:14,940  -->  00:01:17,293
So in this object is the exact same object
26

26

00:01:17,293  -->  00:01:20,854
that we created using a function constructor
27

27

00:01:20,854  -->  00:01:23,740
and then passed to our app controller
28

28

00:01:23,740  -->  00:01:25,532
in the last lecture.
29

29

00:01:25,532  -->  00:01:27,949
So let's quickly review that.
30

30

00:01:29,449  -->  00:01:33,744
So down here in the control and item function
31

31

00:01:33,744  -->  00:01:35,520
which remember is the function that is called
32

32

00:01:35,520  -->  00:01:38,025
when someone hits the input button
33

33

00:01:38,025  -->  00:01:39,858
or hits the enter key.
34

34

00:01:40,970  -->  00:01:43,338
Then we first read the input out of the fields,
35

35

00:01:43,338  -->  00:01:45,386
store it into the input variable,
36

36

00:01:45,386  -->  00:01:47,012
then using this input variable,
37

37

00:01:47,012  -->  00:01:50,888
and then item method we create a new item
38

38

00:01:50,888  -->  00:01:55,317
and we return it and store it in this variable.
39

39

00:01:55,317  -->  00:01:57,306
So in here in the new item variable
40

40

00:01:57,306  -->  00:01:59,229
we now have the new object
41

41

00:01:59,229  -->  00:02:01,101
and that's the object that we're going to pass
42

42

00:02:01,101  -->  00:02:03,351
to or add list item method.
43

43

00:02:05,056  -->  00:02:06,934
Does that make sense to you?
44

44

00:02:06,934  -->  00:02:10,416
So again the logic here is that this method here
45

45

00:02:10,416  -->  00:02:14,533
or this function is like the control center
46

46

00:02:14,533  -->  00:02:15,609
of the application.
47

47

00:02:15,609  -->  00:02:17,657
So it tells the item modules what it should do
48

48

00:02:17,657  -->  00:02:20,122
and it then gets data back
49

49

00:02:20,122  -->  00:02:22,875
that it can then use in other things
50

50

00:02:22,875  -->  00:02:25,547
such as this input variable for example
51

51

00:02:25,547  -->  00:02:27,474
and this new item variable
52

52

00:02:27,474  -->  00:02:30,989
that we will use to display the object on the interface.
53

53

00:02:30,989  -->  00:02:34,739
So let's go back to the add list item method.
54

54

00:02:35,833  -->  00:02:37,400
So what are we going to do here?
55

55

00:02:37,400  -->  00:02:39,886
So this will be in three steps.
56

56

00:02:39,886  -->  00:02:43,264
So the first thing is to create an HTML string
57

57

00:02:43,264  -->  00:02:45,110
with some placeholder text
58

58

00:02:45,110  -->  00:02:48,693
so create HTML string with placeholder text
59

59

00:02:53,853  -->  00:02:58,020
and then we're going to replace the placeholder text
60

60

00:03:02,081  -->  00:03:03,831
with some actual data
61

61

00:03:05,003  -->  00:03:08,011
which is the data that receive from the object
62

62

00:03:08,011  -->  00:03:10,178
and then finally we insert
63

63

00:03:12,416  -->  00:03:14,249
the HTML into the DOM.
64

64

00:03:16,616  -->  00:03:17,533
Make sense?
65

65

00:03:18,998  -->  00:03:20,915
So let's talk about the first part
66

66

00:03:20,915  -->  00:03:22,800
which is creating the HTML string
67

67

00:03:22,800  -->  00:03:26,884
and for that we need to look at our HTML file.
68

68

00:03:26,884  -->  00:03:30,469
Okay so in here this is how an income item
69

69

00:03:30,469  -->  00:03:31,815
looks like.
70

70

00:03:31,815  -->  00:03:35,571
So we have the description here right so salary in this case
71

71

00:03:35,571  -->  00:03:38,821
then the value which would be 2100 here
72

72

00:03:39,848  -->  00:03:42,265
then we also a delete button.
73

73

00:03:43,136  -->  00:03:46,303
Okay so this is the HTML for an income
74

74

00:03:47,210  -->  00:03:51,073
and then down here we have the expense
75

75

00:03:51,073  -->  00:03:53,835
which actually looks pretty similar.
76

76

00:03:53,835  -->  00:03:56,948
The only difference is that we have the item percentage
77

77

00:03:56,948  -->  00:04:01,136
class here which we're going to talk about later.
78

78

00:04:01,136  -->  00:04:02,732
So this is one of the differences
79

79

00:04:02,732  -->  00:04:06,432
and the other difference is that ID for the expenses
80

80

00:04:06,432  -->  00:04:10,006
which is expense zero, expense one, and so on
81

81

00:04:10,006  -->  00:04:11,273
and so forth
82

82

00:04:11,273  -->  00:04:14,887
and then it's income zero, income one, income two,
83

83

00:04:14,887  -->  00:04:16,696
and so on and so forth.
84

84

00:04:16,696  -->  00:04:19,924
So we actually need to create different HTML strings
85

85

00:04:19,924  -->  00:04:21,937
for incomes and for expenses.
86

86

00:04:21,937  -->  00:04:23,485
So let's start with the incomes
87

87

00:04:23,485  -->  00:04:26,152
and I will just copy all of this
88

88

00:04:27,352  -->  00:04:30,935
and paste it here into our JavaScript okay.
89

89

00:04:33,257  -->  00:04:34,294
All right.
90

90

00:04:34,294  -->  00:04:36,152
So this looks a bit weird now
91

91

00:04:36,152  -->  00:04:37,873
because the JavaScript file
92

92

00:04:37,873  -->  00:04:40,548
is of course not to write HTML.
93

93

00:04:40,548  -->  00:04:43,202
So what we're going to do now
94

94

00:04:43,202  -->  00:04:46,514
is to put this our single quotes
95

95

00:04:46,514  -->  00:04:48,175
like this
96

96

00:04:48,175  -->  00:04:50,641
and now all we need to do is to remove all of
97

97

00:04:50,641  -->  00:04:52,141
these spaces here.
98

98

00:04:55,374  -->  00:04:56,207
Okay.
99

99

00:05:03,313  -->  00:05:05,759
So this is bit boring work
100

100

00:05:05,759  -->  00:05:08,097
but we'll have to do it.
101

101

00:05:08,097  -->  00:05:08,930
Okay.
102

102

00:05:14,314  -->  00:05:16,404
All right so now this is a string
103

103

00:05:16,404  -->  00:05:19,217
which contains a lot of HTML
104

104

00:05:19,217  -->  00:05:21,456
and actually this is a good place to show you the difference
105

105

00:05:21,456  -->  00:05:24,719
between the single quotes, these ones here
106

106

00:05:24,719  -->  00:05:26,658
and the double quotes.
107

107

00:05:26,658  -->  00:05:29,428
So inside of the single quotes we have lots of
108

108

00:05:29,428  -->  00:05:31,875
double quotes in here so all of these
109

109

00:05:31,875  -->  00:05:35,999
so see here, all of these are double quotes
110

110

00:05:35,999  -->  00:05:38,516
and so JavaScript doesn't interpret this
111

111

00:05:38,516  -->  00:05:41,619
as an end of the string because we began the string
112

112

00:05:41,619  -->  00:05:44,414
with the single quote and so the end of the string
113

113

00:05:44,414  -->  00:05:46,682
is a single quote as well.
114

114

00:05:46,682  -->  00:05:50,849
Now if we have put the double quotes here like this,
115

115

00:05:56,274  -->  00:05:59,431
then JavaScript would only interpret this as the string
116

116

00:05:59,431  -->  00:06:01,626
here because then it would be the beginning of the string
117

117

00:06:01,626  -->  00:06:03,058
and here the end
118

118

00:06:03,058  -->  00:06:05,091
and then here a new beginning and here a new end
119

119

00:06:05,091  -->  00:06:08,070
but that's of course not what we want.
120

120

00:06:08,070  -->  00:06:10,653
So we want a single quote here.
121

121

00:06:12,259  -->  00:06:14,899
Now if all of these would be single quotes in here
122

122

00:06:14,899  -->  00:06:15,905
and not double quotes
123

123

00:06:15,905  -->  00:06:18,338
then in the outside we would put double quotes
124

124

00:06:18,338  -->  00:06:21,540
and then it would work as well.
125

125

00:06:21,540  -->  00:06:24,533
All right so let's call this one HTML
126

126

00:06:24,533  -->  00:06:27,533
and I'm going to declare it up here.
127

127

00:06:31,397  -->  00:06:34,035
Okay so this is the one for income
128

128

00:06:34,035  -->  00:06:37,778
and one for outcome will actually be pretty similar
129

129

00:06:37,778  -->  00:06:40,278
so let's get this one as well.
130

130

00:06:41,535  -->  00:06:43,922
So this is like a template
131

131

00:06:43,922  -->  00:06:47,758
that we copy here into the JavaScript file
132

132

00:06:47,758  -->  00:06:50,008
so that we can then use it.
133

133

00:06:52,917  -->  00:06:57,084
So once again we remove all of these white spaces here.
134

134

00:07:10,334  -->  00:07:11,584
And here we go.
135

135

00:07:12,875  -->  00:07:15,625
So now put the quotes around this
136

136

00:07:16,649  -->  00:07:17,899
and here we go.
137

137

00:07:20,498  -->  00:07:22,077
And now what I need to do
138

138

00:07:22,077  -->  00:07:25,577
is actually to create an if else statement
139

139

00:07:27,191  -->  00:07:28,247
because of the type.
140

140

00:07:28,247  -->  00:07:30,247
So if the type is income
141

141

00:07:31,648  -->  00:07:32,481
so inc
142

142

00:07:34,993  -->  00:07:38,743
then we want this to be the HTML string okay.
143

143

00:07:41,253  -->  00:07:43,503
And else if the type is exp
144

144

00:07:45,241  -->  00:07:46,408
so for expense
145

145

00:07:50,877  -->  00:07:54,450
then it should be this HTML string.
146

146

00:07:54,450  -->  00:07:56,031
All right and now what we want to do
147

147

00:07:56,031  -->  00:07:58,834
is to replace the actual data that is in here
148

148

00:07:58,834  -->  00:08:00,592
with some placeholder
149

149

00:08:00,592  -->  00:08:03,469
and that's because what we then receive our object here
150

150

00:08:03,469  -->  00:08:07,199
right we can then go ahead and replace these placeholders
151

151

00:08:07,199  -->  00:08:09,334
with the actual data.
152

152

00:08:09,334  -->  00:08:10,667
So let's do that.
153

153

00:08:10,667  -->  00:08:14,584
So let's replace this with something like this.
154

154

00:08:15,591  -->  00:08:18,303
So percentage ID percentage
155

155

00:08:18,303  -->  00:08:20,748
and I use these percentage symbols here
156

156

00:08:20,748  -->  00:08:24,046
so that the placeholder text is easier to find here
157

157

00:08:24,046  -->  00:08:26,015
and that we don't override something
158

158

00:08:26,015  -->  00:08:27,054
that we don't want okay.
159

159

00:08:27,054  -->  00:08:30,471
So in here it's going to be a value right
160

160

00:08:32,613  -->  00:08:33,446
so value
161

161

00:08:36,950  -->  00:08:38,690
and I'm missing the description.
162

162

00:08:38,690  -->  00:08:40,023
Here it is okay.
163

163

00:08:42,343  -->  00:08:44,244
So description
164

164

00:08:44,244  -->  00:08:47,327
and of course the same thing in here.
165

165

00:08:48,204  -->  00:08:50,871
So this is where the ID will go.
166

166

00:08:53,216  -->  00:08:55,133
This is the description
167

167

00:09:00,274  -->  00:09:02,274
and then here the value.
168

168

00:09:05,392  -->  00:09:06,642
All right cool.
169

169

00:09:09,075  -->  00:09:10,784
So let's now go to the next step
170

170

00:09:10,784  -->  00:09:12,770
which is to replace the placeholder
171

171

00:09:12,770  -->  00:09:14,716
with the actual data
172

172

00:09:14,716  -->  00:09:15,976
and in order to do that,
173

173

00:09:15,976  -->  00:09:18,164
we will use a brand new method
174

174

00:09:18,164  -->  00:09:19,777
that we have never used before
175

175

00:09:19,777  -->  00:09:22,109
which is the replace method.
176

176

00:09:22,109  -->  00:09:25,215
So let's say I will create a new variable first.
177

177

00:09:25,215  -->  00:09:26,382
New HTML okay.
178

178

00:09:29,652  -->  00:09:31,402
So let's say new HTML
179

179

00:09:33,860  -->  00:09:35,878
is HTML which is our string
180

180

00:09:35,878  -->  00:09:39,075
and then strings have a bunch of their own methods
181

181

00:09:39,075  -->  00:09:40,669
just like array
182

182

00:09:40,669  -->  00:09:43,209
and since HTML is a string we can use all
183

183

00:09:43,209  -->  00:09:45,660
the strings methods here.
184

184

00:09:45,660  -->  00:09:48,705
So we use the replace method
185

185

00:09:48,705  -->  00:09:51,766
and what replace does is exactly what we want.
186

186

00:09:51,766  -->  00:09:53,266
It searches for a string
187

187

00:09:53,266  -->  00:09:55,641
and then replaces that string with the data
188

188

00:09:55,641  -->  00:09:58,255
that we put into the method.
189

189

00:09:58,255  -->  00:10:01,170
So let's start with the ID here.
190

190

00:10:01,170  -->  00:10:03,758
So our placeholder text goes like this.
191

191

00:10:03,758  -->  00:10:07,380
ID and what we want to replace it with
192

192

00:10:07,380  -->  00:10:08,797
is our object.ID.
193

193

00:10:12,057  -->  00:10:16,057
Okay because remember the ID property is the one
194

194

00:10:16,900  -->  00:10:19,079
that holds of course the ID
195

195

00:10:19,079  -->  00:10:21,838
and we can see that here okay.
196

196

00:10:21,838  -->  00:10:23,731
So these are our function constructors
197

197

00:10:23,731  -->  00:10:27,261
and they are called ID, description and value.
198

198

00:10:27,261  -->  00:10:30,132
So these are the three that we will have here
199

199

00:10:30,132  -->  00:10:32,067
in our add list method
200

200

00:10:32,067  -->  00:10:36,234
and that we can use to replace our placeholder strings.
201

201

00:10:37,218  -->  00:10:38,913
So this was the first replacement
202

202

00:10:38,913  -->  00:10:43,080
and now we can override this new variable that we created
203

203

00:10:44,073  -->  00:10:47,580
and now we will not replace the placeholder
204

204

00:10:47,580  -->  00:10:51,945
in HTML again because it's the new HTML variable now
205

205

00:10:51,945  -->  00:10:55,032
where we have made this replacement here.
206

206

00:10:55,032  -->  00:10:57,959
So if we would now do HTML replace again,
207

207

00:10:57,959  -->  00:11:01,650
then this ID placeholder here would still be there.
208

208

00:11:01,650  -->  00:11:03,468
Okay so we actually need to do it
209

209

00:11:03,468  -->  00:11:04,801
on the new HTML.
210

210

00:11:07,668  -->  00:11:11,418
Replace and let's go with the description now
211

211

00:11:17,841  -->  00:11:20,008
and say object.description
212

212

00:11:22,460  -->  00:11:25,297
and now I'm just going to duplicate this
213

213

00:11:25,297  -->  00:11:28,880
so here is value and here is value as well.
214

214

00:11:29,894  -->  00:11:31,519
All right and now all we need to do
215

215

00:11:31,519  -->  00:11:34,281
is to insert this into the DOM
216

216

00:11:34,281  -->  00:11:36,410
and that's something new that we didn't do before
217

217

00:11:36,410  -->  00:11:39,016
so let's see how we can do that.
218

218

00:11:39,016  -->  00:11:41,193
So we first need to select some element
219

219

00:11:41,193  -->  00:11:44,029
on our webpage so from the DOM
220

220

00:11:44,029  -->  00:11:47,696
and then we can insert our HTML next to that
221

221

00:11:48,705  -->  00:11:51,458
and we're going to use the insert adjacent HTML method
222

222

00:11:51,458  -->  00:11:52,807
for that
223

223

00:11:52,807  -->  00:11:55,626
so let's take a look at the reference page
224

224

00:11:55,626  -->  00:11:56,758
of that element
225

225

00:11:56,758  -->  00:11:57,968
and it's right here.
226

226

00:11:57,968  -->  00:12:00,175
So this insert adjacent HTML method
227

227

00:12:00,175  -->  00:12:02,342
first accepts the position
228

228

00:12:04,045  -->  00:12:06,057
and then the text so the string,
229

229

00:12:06,057  -->  00:12:08,408
the HTML that we want to insert
230

230

00:12:08,408  -->  00:12:10,348
and there are four different positions
231

231

00:12:10,348  -->  00:12:13,173
in which we can insert the HTML.
232

232

00:12:13,173  -->  00:12:16,511
So imagine that this p element was the one
233

233

00:12:16,511  -->  00:12:17,746
that we selected.
234

234

00:12:17,746  -->  00:12:20,415
We can then insert before that element
235

235

00:12:20,415  -->  00:12:21,440
even begins
236

236

00:12:21,440  -->  00:12:23,626
so we use before begin.
237

237

00:12:23,626  -->  00:12:26,434
We can insert it as a sibling after that
238

238

00:12:26,434  -->  00:12:30,590
so after end or we can insert it as a child of p
239

239

00:12:30,590  -->  00:12:32,231
and then we have two options
240

240

00:12:32,231  -->  00:12:33,626
which is after begin,
241

241

00:12:33,626  -->  00:12:36,499
which is basically before any content inside
242

242

00:12:36,499  -->  00:12:38,051
of the p element
243

243

00:12:38,051  -->  00:12:39,341
so after the p element begin
244

244

00:12:39,341  -->  00:12:41,236
and then before the end.
245

245

00:12:41,236  -->  00:12:43,697
So at the end of the p element
246

246

00:12:43,697  -->  00:12:47,728
but after all of the content that is inside of it
247

247

00:12:47,728  -->  00:12:49,750
and that one is actually the one
248

248

00:12:49,750  -->  00:12:51,487
that we're going to use.
249

249

00:12:51,487  -->  00:12:53,828
So we're going to use before end
250

250

00:12:53,828  -->  00:12:55,923
and I will show you why that is.
251

251

00:12:55,923  -->  00:12:58,755
So let's go back to our HTML file
252

252

00:12:58,755  -->  00:13:03,474
and what we're going to do is to add the expenses
253

253

00:13:03,474  -->  00:13:06,141
into this expense list container
254

254

00:13:07,441  -->  00:13:10,033
and in there will be a lot of child elements
255

255

00:13:10,033  -->  00:13:12,405
so all of these expenses will be childs
256

256

00:13:12,405  -->  00:13:15,352
of the expense list container.
257

257

00:13:15,352  -->  00:13:17,606
So that's for expenses
258

258

00:13:17,606  -->  00:13:21,205
and for incomes it's called the income list.
259

259

00:13:21,205  -->  00:13:24,696
So in this case the div element here has a class
260

260

00:13:24,696  -->  00:13:27,053
of income list so we actually need these two
261

261

00:13:27,053  -->  00:13:29,588
and then decide which one we want to
262

262

00:13:29,588  -->  00:13:31,338
append this new HTML.
263

263

00:13:33,927  -->  00:13:36,170
So let's start with the income list
264

264

00:13:36,170  -->  00:13:41,055
and maybe you can guess what we're going to do now.
265

265

00:13:41,055  -->  00:13:43,702
We will put a new field in your property
266

266

00:13:43,702  -->  00:13:46,781
here in our DOM strings okay.
267

267

00:13:46,781  -->  00:13:50,211
I'm going to call it the income container.
268

268

00:13:50,211  -->  00:13:51,544
Income container
269

269

00:13:54,125  -->  00:13:56,625
and then I will paste it here.
270

270

00:13:57,669  -->  00:13:59,586
Sorry I didn't copy it.
271

271

00:14:01,162  -->  00:14:02,412
So income list.
272

272

00:14:05,276  -->  00:14:09,313
Okay and then I'm going to duplicate this line
273

273

00:14:09,313  -->  00:14:11,689
and do the same for the expenses.
274

274

00:14:11,689  -->  00:14:15,606
So expenses container will be the expense list.
275

275

00:14:17,997  -->  00:14:20,880
So again this is the element that we want to select
276

276

00:14:20,880  -->  00:14:22,646
if we have an income
277

277

00:14:22,646  -->  00:14:25,075
and this is the element that we want to select
278

278

00:14:25,075  -->  00:14:27,151
if we have an expense.
279

279

00:14:27,151  -->  00:14:31,335
So let's do that here in our add list item method.
280

280

00:14:31,335  -->  00:14:35,913
So we can use this if else statement for that right?
281

281

00:14:35,913  -->  00:14:39,179
So if it's an income we can say that the element
282

282

00:14:39,179  -->  00:14:42,429
should be DOM strings.income container.
283

283

00:14:49,898  -->  00:14:53,378
All right and I still have to declare it here.
284

284

00:14:53,378  -->  00:14:57,295
So element and now in case that it's an expense
285

285

00:14:59,445  -->  00:15:03,612
then the element will be DOM strings.expenses container.
286

286

00:15:06,690  -->  00:15:10,046
All right and now we're ready to select this.
287

287

00:15:10,046  -->  00:15:12,213
So document.query selector
288

288

00:15:14,752  -->  00:15:17,599
and now we simply select the element.
289

289

00:15:17,599  -->  00:15:19,822
Okay so very easy.
290

290

00:15:19,822  -->  00:15:21,856
This element will be
291

291

00:15:21,856  -->  00:15:24,972
the income list if it's an income
292

292

00:15:24,972  -->  00:15:28,559
and the expense list if it's an expense.
293

293

00:15:28,559  -->  00:15:33,148
All right and now it's time to use your insert adjacent
294

294

00:15:33,148  -->  00:15:34,911
HTML method.
295

295

00:15:34,911  -->  00:15:37,065
All right and as we said we're going to use
296

296

00:15:37,065  -->  00:15:37,982
before end.
297

297

00:15:39,155  -->  00:15:43,322
So before end and then what we want to insert there
298

298

00:15:44,657  -->  00:15:46,490
is of course our HTML.
299

299

00:15:47,967  -->  00:15:49,708
So the string that we produced
300

300

00:15:49,708  -->  00:15:51,918
and actually it's not HTML.
301

301

00:15:51,918  -->  00:15:53,272
It is new HTML
302

302

00:15:53,272  -->  00:15:57,439
because that's the one that already has all our value,
303

303

00:15:59,570  -->  00:16:01,889
description and ID.
304

304

00:16:01,889  -->  00:16:04,275
So again this before end keyword here
305

305

00:16:04,275  -->  00:16:07,724
makes it so that all of our HTML will be inserted
306

306

00:16:07,724  -->  00:16:10,224
as a child of these containers
307

307

00:16:11,070  -->  00:16:13,017
so this income list and the expense list
308

308

00:16:13,017  -->  00:16:15,241
but as the last child
309

309

00:16:15,241  -->  00:16:18,255
so as the last element in the list.
310

310

00:16:18,255  -->  00:16:21,541
So if you already had like two or three items here,
311

311

00:16:21,541  -->  00:16:24,361
then the next one would be here after that
312

312

00:16:24,361  -->  00:16:25,694
so the last one.
313

313

00:16:26,732  -->  00:16:29,032
Let's just look again at the reference.
314

314

00:16:29,032  -->  00:16:32,502
So imagine if we would use before begin.
315

315

00:16:32,502  -->  00:16:35,529
Then the new element would be inserted right here
316

316

00:16:35,529  -->  00:16:37,508
so before this income list
317

317

00:16:37,508  -->  00:16:40,208
so not a child, but as a sibling
318

318

00:16:40,208  -->  00:16:42,125
and before this element
319

319

00:16:43,075  -->  00:16:44,469
and then after the end
320

320

00:16:44,469  -->  00:16:46,609
would be down here
321

321

00:16:46,609  -->  00:16:50,771
so also as a sibling but after this element.
322

322

00:16:50,771  -->  00:16:54,938
Okay but enough code let's now see if this actually works.
323

323

00:16:56,686  -->  00:16:59,769
So again we need to reload this okay.
324

324

00:17:02,034  -->  00:17:03,734
Application has started
325

325

00:17:03,734  -->  00:17:07,295
so everything seems to work up until this point.
326

326

00:17:07,295  -->  00:17:10,354
So I'm now going to add it an income.
327

327

00:17:10,354  -->  00:17:13,021
Let's say project for 1500 Euros
328

328

00:17:18,533  -->  00:17:21,301
and nothing happened and that makes a lot of sense
329

329

00:17:21,301  -->  00:17:24,209
of course because nowhere in our code
330

330

00:17:24,209  -->  00:17:26,894
we called this add list item method right.
331

331

00:17:26,894  -->  00:17:31,280
So before making it possible to anything appear here,
332

332

00:17:31,280  -->  00:17:34,309
of course we need to first call this.
333

333

00:17:34,309  -->  00:17:38,476
So we do this of course in our control add item function
334

334

00:17:41,293  -->  00:17:42,548
so it's as simple as this.
335

335

00:17:42,548  -->  00:17:44,798
UI controller add list item
336

336

00:17:46,732  -->  00:17:49,438
and now as I said in the beginning,
337

337

00:17:49,438  -->  00:17:51,285
what we're going to pass in here
338

338

00:17:51,285  -->  00:17:54,592
is the new item that was created here before.
339

339

00:17:54,592  -->  00:17:55,425
Okay.
340

340

00:17:56,497  -->  00:17:59,121
So the object created through one of our
341

341

00:17:59,121  -->  00:18:01,212
function constructors.
342

342

00:18:01,212  -->  00:18:04,160
So the new item and then the type.
343

343

00:18:04,160  -->  00:18:07,934
So we're going to use input not type right
344

344

00:18:07,934  -->  00:18:10,199
because that's where our type is stored.
345

345

00:18:10,199  -->  00:18:12,848
So whether it's an income or an expense
346

346

00:18:12,848  -->  00:18:15,765
and now it should be ready to work.
347

347

00:18:17,353  -->  00:18:19,186
So again project 1500.
348

348

00:18:24,570  -->  00:18:25,824
Oh yeah here it is.
349

349

00:18:25,824  -->  00:18:26,827
So it worked.
350

350

00:18:26,827  -->  00:18:29,389
It is here in our user interface.
351

351

00:18:29,389  -->  00:18:30,834
How cool is that right?
352

352

00:18:30,834  -->  00:18:31,840
So it really worked.
353

353

00:18:31,840  -->  00:18:33,236
This is really cool.
354

354

00:18:33,236  -->  00:18:35,530
So let's try it with another one.
355

355

00:18:35,530  -->  00:18:38,363
Let's say we sold our car for 2500
356

356

00:18:41,419  -->  00:18:43,838
and yeah here it is also.
357

357

00:18:43,838  -->  00:18:45,998
So for me this is a really magical moment
358

358

00:18:45,998  -->  00:18:48,455
when we hit the enter button here
359

359

00:18:48,455  -->  00:18:50,928
and then something like magic appears
360

360

00:18:50,928  -->  00:18:52,073
here on our webpage.
361

361

00:18:52,073  -->  00:18:54,273
So this is really cool.
362

362

00:18:54,273  -->  00:18:57,016
Let's try out an expense now.
363

363

00:18:57,016  -->  00:19:00,266
Let's say our rent is like I don't know
364

364

00:19:01,564  -->  00:19:05,731
950 dollars and now it should appear in expenses right
365

365

00:19:06,613  -->  00:19:07,902
and yes here it goes.
366

366

00:19:07,902  -->  00:19:11,235
So everything works exactly as expected.
367

367

00:19:12,488  -->  00:19:14,795
Now forget about this 21 percent here
368

368

00:19:14,795  -->  00:19:17,489
because this is just the text that we copied
369

369

00:19:17,489  -->  00:19:19,458
from our HTML page
370

370

00:19:19,458  -->  00:19:21,436
and we're going to take care of this later
371

371

00:19:21,436  -->  00:19:23,528
but for now what matters here is that
372

372

00:19:23,528  -->  00:19:26,582
at this point we're able to really add the elements
373

373

00:19:26,582  -->  00:19:28,332
to our user interface.
374

374

00:19:28,332  -->  00:19:31,050
So this is already a great achievement.
375

375

00:19:31,050  -->  00:19:32,542
So now that we have this,
376

376

00:19:32,542  -->  00:19:36,018
over the next lectures we're going to take care here
377

377

00:19:36,018  -->  00:19:37,226
of the budget part
378

378

00:19:37,226  -->  00:19:39,253
so we're going to calculate the budget
379

379

00:19:39,253  -->  00:19:42,628
and update it here on the user interface as well.
380

380

00:19:42,628  -->  00:19:44,238
So don't wait
381

381

00:19:44,238  -->  00:19:47,405
and join me right in the next lecture.
