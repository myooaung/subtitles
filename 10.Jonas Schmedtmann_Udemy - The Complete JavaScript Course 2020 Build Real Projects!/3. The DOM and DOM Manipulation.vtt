<v Jonas>So in this section,</v>
2

2

00:00:03.547  -->  00:00:05.611
we are going to make JavaScript interact
3

3

00:00:05.611  -->  00:00:08.790
with a webpage for the first time,
4

4

00:00:08.790  -->  00:00:13.640
and the technical term for that is doing DOM manipulation.
5

5

00:00:13.640  -->  00:00:16.183
So in order to do that, we need to first know
6

6

00:00:16.183  -->  00:00:20.016
what the DOM and DOM manipulation actually is.
7

7

00:00:22.703  -->  00:00:26.120
So, DOM stands for Document Object Model.
8

8

00:00:27.176  -->  00:00:30.314
Now, the DOM is a structured representation
9

9

00:00:30.314  -->  00:00:33.672
of an HTML document that can be used
10

10

00:00:33.672  -->  00:00:36.142
to connect webpages to scripts
11

11

00:00:36.142  -->  00:00:39.378
or programming languages such as JavaScript.
12

12

00:00:39.378  -->  00:00:42.661
Imagine a very simple webpage like the one
13

13

00:00:42.661  -->  00:00:44.710
we see here on the right side.
14

14

00:00:44.710  -->  00:00:47.645
We can say that each HTML element
15

15

00:00:47.645  -->  00:00:51.395
can be represented by a box like this, right?
16

16

00:00:52.732  -->  00:00:57.289
Now, the DOM is a fully object-oriented representation.
17

17

00:00:57.289  -->  00:01:01.580
So, for each of these boxes, there is an object in the DOM
18

18

00:01:01.580  -->  00:01:04.088
that we can access and interact with
19

19

00:01:04.088  -->  00:01:06.671
right from our JavaScript code.
20

20

00:01:08.446  -->  00:01:11.150
But before moving on, I just want to make
21

21

00:01:11.150  -->  00:01:14.195
crystal clear that JavaScript and the DOM
22

22

00:01:14.195  -->  00:01:15.725
are two different things.
23

23

00:01:15.725  -->  00:01:18.367
So, what we have been doing so far
24

24

00:01:18.367  -->  00:01:21.151
was to just use the JavaScript language
25

25

00:01:21.151  -->  00:01:24.901
without any interaction with any webpage.
26

26

00:01:24.901  -->  00:01:28.595
All we did was just to print some stuff to the console
27

27

00:01:28.595  -->  00:01:31.988
but now, we're going to use special JavaScript methods
28

28

00:01:31.988  -->  00:01:34.877
that allows us to interact and manipulate,
29

29

00:01:34.877  -->  00:01:39.849
which means change, the DOM and therefore the webpage.
30

30

00:01:39.849  -->  00:01:42.566
And since I said methods, that means
31

31

00:01:42.566  -->  00:01:46.069
that they are functions attached to some object, right?
32

32

00:01:46.069  -->  00:01:49.575
And that object is the document object.
33

33

00:01:49.575  -->  00:01:53.889
So this is the object that gives us access to the DOM.
34

34

00:01:53.889  -->  00:01:56.846
Okay, once again, the HTML webpage content
35

35

00:01:56.846  -->  00:02:00.348
is stored in the DOM, which can then be accessed
36

36

00:02:00.348  -->  00:02:03.205
and manipulated by a JavaScript,
37

37

00:02:03.205  -->  00:02:05.742
and that is exactly what we're gonna do
38

38

00:02:05.742  -->  00:02:08.325
in the project in this section.
