1

00:00:01,150  -->  00:00:03,460
<v Instructor>Let's quickly continue and build now</v>
2

2

00:00:03,460  -->  00:00:06,463
the controller for the Likes feature of our app.
3

3

00:00:07,560  -->  00:00:10,140
So this is where we left off with our model.
4

4

00:00:10,140  -->  00:00:11,633
Let's put it this way here,
5

5

00:00:12,490  -->  00:00:15,670
and start working on the controller again.
6

6

00:00:15,670  -->  00:00:18,720
Okay, so let's...
7

7

00:00:18,720  -->  00:00:20,010
Get this code here
8

8

00:00:23,360  -->  00:00:26,543
inside the like controller.
9

9

00:00:27,860  -->  00:00:30,630
Now whether we actually trigger a new like
10

10

00:00:30,630  -->  00:00:33,350
while it happens, of course, on that like button,
11

11

00:00:33,350  -->  00:00:36,080
right, and that like button is again in the recipe,
12

12

00:00:36,080  -->  00:00:38,240
and so we will control that click again
13

13

00:00:38,240  -->  00:00:39,708
in this EventListener here, okay.
14

14

00:00:39,708  -->  00:00:43,120
So all events that happen on the recipe,
15

15

00:00:43,120  -->  00:00:46,130
we will all of them handle here in this event header.
16

16

00:00:46,130  -->  00:00:47,880
So we are already handling the decrease button,
17

17

00:00:47,880  -->  00:00:51,910
the increase button, and also the add to list button.
18

18

00:00:51,910  -->  00:00:54,163
So we didn't write it down here, let's actually do that.
19

19

00:01:00,810  -->  00:01:02,420
All right.
20

20

00:01:02,420  -->  00:01:05,420
So let's grab the name for the selector.
21

21

00:01:05,420  -->  00:01:09,870
So it is in recipeView, and like is this button.
22

22

00:01:09,870  -->  00:01:11,770
So it's the recipe_love class
23

23

00:01:11,770  -->  00:01:14,010
that is associated with the button, okay,
24

24

00:01:14,010  -->  00:01:16,700
and so that's the one that we want to test for now.
25

25

00:01:16,700  -->  00:01:18,000
So else if
26

26

00:01:19,890  -->  00:01:20,750
the target
27

27

00:01:22,780  -->  00:01:23,640
matches
28

28

00:01:26,210  -->  00:01:29,923
this selector or any child element just like before.
29

29

00:01:31,620  -->  00:01:33,510
Okay, because I think there are some childs,
30

30

00:01:33,510  -->  00:01:35,326
and yeah, of course, so this SVG here
31

31

00:01:35,326  -->  00:01:38,060
might also be where the click happens,
32

32

00:01:38,060  -->  00:01:39,853
and in that case, we want to still match
33

33

00:01:39,853  -->  00:01:41,193
the button itself.
34

34

00:01:42,780  -->  00:01:45,387
Okay, and what is going to happen in this case,
35

35

00:01:45,387  -->  00:01:46,470
well...
36

36

00:01:48,760  -->  00:01:50,540
We want to call the like controller
37

37

00:01:50,540  -->  00:01:52,820
which we don't have yet, but we will do it in a second,
38

38

00:01:52,820  -->  00:01:55,033
so it is simply the controller,
39

39

00:01:57,027  -->  00:01:58,027
controlLike.
40

40

00:01:59,410  -->  00:02:00,243
Okay.
41

41

00:02:08,850  -->  00:02:12,200
So again, just like before, let's start by creating
42

42

00:02:12,200  -->  00:02:15,160
a new likes object, okay?
43

43

00:02:15,160  -->  00:02:18,223
And again, we will only create it if it's not yet there.
44

44

00:02:19,690  -->  00:02:21,350
So if we have state.likes,
45

45

00:02:21,350  -->  00:02:23,460
or actually if we don't have state.likes,
46

46

00:02:23,460  -->  00:02:28,460
then we say that state.likes is a new likes object.
47

47

00:02:29,290  -->  00:02:32,260
And now we need to think about two different states
48

48

00:02:32,260  -->  00:02:33,230
that can happen.
49

49

00:02:33,230  -->  00:02:37,010
So let's say that we have a recipe that is already liked.
50

50

00:02:37,010  -->  00:02:39,040
So in this case, if we hit the button,
51

51

00:02:39,040  -->  00:02:41,210
then we want to remove this recipe from the list
52

52

00:02:41,210  -->  00:02:43,940
of liked recipes, and so we want to change
53

53

00:02:43,940  -->  00:02:45,600
the underlying data model.
54

54

00:02:45,600  -->  00:02:48,060
We want to change this button here like this,
55

55

00:02:48,060  -->  00:02:50,200
and we also want to get removed from here.
56

56

00:02:50,200  -->  00:02:51,330
But if it's the other way around,
57

57

00:02:51,330  -->  00:02:53,160
so if we didn't yet like it,
58

58

00:02:53,160  -->  00:02:55,000
well, then we want it to be added,
59

59

00:02:55,000  -->  00:02:57,280
and we want it to be added here also
60

60

00:02:57,280  -->  00:02:58,700
in the user interface.
61

61

00:02:58,700  -->  00:03:01,490
Okay, so we have two different situations.
62

62

00:03:01,490  -->  00:03:04,440
And so now we are going to need that method
63

63

00:03:04,440  -->  00:03:06,263
that we coded out before, which is to test
64

64

00:03:06,263  -->  00:03:09,910
if a certain recipe is already liked or not.
65

65

00:03:09,910  -->  00:03:12,830
So let's start with what happens when it's not liked.
66

66

00:03:12,830  -->  00:03:14,600
So state
67

67

00:03:15,507  -->  00:03:16,701
.likes
68

68

00:03:16,701  -->  00:03:17,534
.isLiked,
69

69

00:03:19,810  -->  00:03:22,240
and now we need to pass in the current ID,
70

70

00:03:22,240  -->  00:03:25,113
which is, and let's actually put it out here,
71

71

00:03:27,740  -->  00:03:30,310
so currentID is state
72

72

00:03:31,325  -->  00:03:34,333
.recipe.id, right?
73

73

00:03:37,570  -->  00:03:39,303
So let's say current ID.
74

74

00:03:41,279  -->  00:03:43,340
And then we're also going to have an else statement,
75

75

00:03:43,340  -->  00:03:46,440
so in the case that the current recipe was already liked.
76

76

00:03:46,440  -->  00:03:48,840
But usually when we encounter a new recipe,
77

77

00:03:48,840  -->  00:03:50,890
it will usually not have been liked yet,
78

78

00:03:50,890  -->  00:03:52,830
and so we're starting with that one here.
79

79

00:03:52,830  -->  00:03:56,120
Okay, so let's actually say that here,
80

80

00:03:56,120  -->  00:04:01,120
user has not yet liked current recipe.
81

81

00:04:04,420  -->  00:04:07,570
Just wanted it like this, okay.
82

82

00:04:07,570  -->  00:04:09,000
And then down here...
83

83

00:04:09,840  -->  00:04:11,203
Let's copy this.
84

84

00:04:12,160  -->  00:04:14,920
So I always like to keep my code commented.
85

85

00:04:14,920  -->  00:04:18,743
User has liked the current recipe.
86

86

00:04:20,370  -->  00:04:21,270
All right.
87

87

00:04:21,270  -->  00:04:24,053
So we then want to add the like to the data.
88

88

00:04:27,620  -->  00:04:29,143
So to the state, let's say.
89

89

00:04:30,260  -->  00:04:33,333
We want to basically toggle the like button.
90

90

00:04:35,120  -->  00:04:37,220
So in this case where it has not been liked,
91

91

00:04:37,220  -->  00:04:39,470
it will then become the full heart,
92

92

00:04:39,470  -->  00:04:41,400
and in the other case down here,
93

93

00:04:41,400  -->  00:04:44,850
it will then become the empty heart, basically.
94

94

00:04:44,850  -->  00:04:45,910
Okay.
95

95

00:04:45,910  -->  00:04:47,283
So toggle the button,
96

96

00:04:48,200  -->  00:04:52,453
and then add like to the UI list.
97

97

00:04:53,820  -->  00:04:55,440
And if it's the other way around,
98

98

00:04:55,440  -->  00:04:58,310
well, then we're going to do the other thing.
99

99

00:04:58,310  -->  00:05:00,310
So remove like
100

100

00:05:01,900  -->  00:05:03,870
from the state.
101

101

00:05:03,870  -->  00:05:06,060
Toggle the like button still,
102

102

00:05:06,060  -->  00:05:07,793
and also remove it from the UI.
103

103

00:05:08,890  -->  00:05:11,460
Remove like from UI list.
104

104

00:05:11,460  -->  00:05:14,563
So let's start by creating a new like here,
105

105

00:05:18,220  -->  00:05:21,653
and that is done by saying state.likes.
106

106

00:05:22,940  -->  00:05:25,220
So what we created just up here.
107

107

00:05:25,220  -->  00:05:26,370
So state.likes.addLike.
108

108

00:05:30,760  -->  00:05:32,780
And so what do we need to pass in here?
109

109

00:05:32,780  -->  00:05:35,180
And let me actually do it in separate lines.
110

110

00:05:35,180  -->  00:05:37,690
So with the Likes, we need to pass in the ID,
111

111

00:05:37,690  -->  00:05:40,123
the title, the author, and the image.
112

112

00:05:42,220  -->  00:05:44,403
Okay, so the ID is the current ID.
113

113

00:05:46,000  -->  00:05:49,133
Then we have state.recipe.title,
114

114

00:05:52,160  -->  00:05:55,673
and we have author, and of course the image.
115

115

00:05:59,570  -->  00:06:02,700
Okay, so we created our new like here,
116

116

00:06:02,700  -->  00:06:04,120
then we toggle the like button,
117

117

00:06:04,120  -->  00:06:06,140
and we cannot do that yet because we don't have
118

118

00:06:06,140  -->  00:06:07,730
the view functions just yet,
119

119

00:06:07,730  -->  00:06:10,666
and then add it to the UI, which we also still don't have,
120

120

00:06:10,666  -->  00:06:13,660
but that's simply console.log.
121

121

00:06:13,660  -->  00:06:16,403
So state.likes.
122

122

00:06:17,410  -->  00:06:18,243
Okay.
123

123

00:06:18,243  -->  00:06:21,170
And the same thing here, in the other case.
124

124

00:06:21,170  -->  00:06:23,610
So instead of removing it from the UI for now,
125

125

00:06:23,610  -->  00:06:26,440
let's just log it to console.
126

126

00:06:26,440  -->  00:06:30,150
And so here we add it into the likes,
127

127

00:06:30,150  -->  00:06:31,710
and here we want to remove it from the likes,
128

128

00:06:31,710  -->  00:06:35,740
so all we have to do is to say state.likes
129

129

00:06:36,580  -->  00:06:38,313
and delete the like.
130

130

00:06:39,220  -->  00:06:40,733
And we pass in the current ID,
131

131

00:06:43,310  -->  00:06:44,900
and that should be it.
132

132

00:06:44,900  -->  00:06:47,080
Okay, so that what we defined right here
133

133

00:06:47,080  -->  00:06:48,820
in our Likes model.
134

134

00:06:48,820  -->  00:06:51,630
So we hooked it up down here also,
135

135

00:06:51,630  -->  00:06:53,590
yeah, because we have controlLike,
136

136

00:06:53,590  -->  00:06:56,363
and so we can now actually now test it out already.
137

137

00:07:00,380  -->  00:07:02,360
So let's search for pizza here
138

138

00:07:07,500  -->  00:07:09,640
and hit the Like button,
139

139

00:07:09,640  -->  00:07:11,220
and we have an error.
140

140

00:07:11,220  -->  00:07:13,263
Okay, so likes is not defined.
141

141

00:07:14,470  -->  00:07:17,138
And yeah, of course, so this Likes here is not defined
142

142

00:07:17,138  -->  00:07:19,320
and that's because we didn't include
143

143

00:07:19,320  -->  00:07:20,813
the model just yet.
144

144

00:07:26,760  -->  00:07:29,463
All right, so now we should be ready to roll.
145

145

00:07:35,600  -->  00:07:37,820
Oh, we have our Likes array already here,
146

146

00:07:37,820  -->  00:07:41,890
and indeed, it is the best pizza dough ever.
147

147

00:07:41,890  -->  00:07:43,600
So it's working, you see,
148

148

00:07:43,600  -->  00:07:45,860
and it has this current ID also here,
149

149

00:07:45,860  -->  00:07:47,470
and so great, it's working.
150

150

00:07:47,470  -->  00:07:49,173
Well it's not really here yet,
151

151

00:07:50,040  -->  00:07:53,343
and so let's now try it out with another one.
152

152

00:07:54,460  -->  00:07:56,773
And yeah, now we have both,
153

153

00:07:58,100  -->  00:07:59,800
and it's also working.
154

154

00:07:59,800  -->  00:08:01,750
And if we now go back to this one here,
155

155

00:08:02,670  -->  00:08:05,230
well, now I will hit this button here again
156

156

00:08:05,230  -->  00:08:08,060
and see if it's then deleted.
157

157

00:08:08,060  -->  00:08:09,160
And indeed, it's gone.
158

158

00:08:10,060  -->  00:08:11,040
So it's working.
159

159

00:08:11,040  -->  00:08:13,470
So now we only have the deep dish fruit pizza,
160

160

00:08:13,470  -->  00:08:15,010
so the next one.
161

161

00:08:15,010  -->  00:08:18,160
And if I now also dislike this one here,
162

162

00:08:18,160  -->  00:08:19,530
well, then it's gone.
163

163

00:08:19,530  -->  00:08:22,460
So all our likes are now gone,
164

164

00:08:22,460  -->  00:08:25,560
which means that our controller is currently working.
165

165

00:08:25,560  -->  00:08:26,490
Okay.
166

166

00:08:26,490  -->  00:08:29,810
So next up, all we have to do now is to create the view.
167

167

00:08:29,810  -->  00:08:31,690
So toggle this button here,
168

168

00:08:31,690  -->  00:08:34,893
and then also display the list of likes up here.
