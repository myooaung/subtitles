00:00:01.295  -->  00:00:04.849
<v Instructor>So let's continue our coding journey</v>
2

2

00:00:04.849  -->  00:00:06.746
and we're getting really close
3

3

00:00:06.746  -->  00:00:10.746
to having our first real javascript application.
4

4

00:00:11.940  -->  00:00:13.368
So by now you have already learned
5

5

00:00:13.368  -->  00:00:16.042
a lot of stuff about DOM manipulation
6

6

00:00:16.042  -->  00:00:17.892
and even other things.
7

7

00:00:17.892  -->  00:00:20.289
So in this lecture we will just continue
8

8

00:00:20.289  -->  00:00:22.228
practicing some of these things
9

9

00:00:22.228  -->  00:00:25.728
and implement another feature in our game.
10

10

00:00:26.586  -->  00:00:29.353
Alright this is where we left our game
11

11

00:00:29.353  -->  00:00:32.645
so let's now implement this functionality here
12

12

00:00:32.645  -->  00:00:34.004
so when we hit this button
13

13

00:00:34.004  -->  00:00:36.362
that the game starts from the beginning.
14

14

00:00:36.362  -->  00:00:39.449
So if we have a button and an event
15

15

00:00:39.449  -->  00:00:42.142
then of course we need to listen to that event.
16

16

00:00:42.142  -->  00:00:45.831
So once again we will use an event listener.
17

17

00:00:45.831  -->  00:00:48.646
So let's take out the name of the button
18

18

00:00:48.646  -->  00:00:50.896
and it's simply button new.
19

19

00:00:51.904  -->  00:00:55.737
So document.querySelector
20

20

00:00:57.097  -->  00:01:00.430
and btn-new.
21

21

00:01:01.363  -->  00:01:03.017
And by now you already
22

22

00:01:03.017  -->  00:01:04.843
really know how to do this.
23

23

00:01:04.843  -->  00:01:07.870
So add event listener and once again
24

24

00:01:07.870  -->  00:01:10.287
we are listening for a click.
25

25

00:01:11.660  -->  00:01:14.367
And we will once again use an anonymous function here,
26

26

00:01:14.367  -->  00:01:16.596
which by now you know in your sleep,
27

27

00:01:16.596  -->  00:01:18.920
right, what is this.
28

28

00:01:18.920  -->  00:01:19.812
Okay cool.
29

29

00:01:19.812  -->  00:01:23.249
So what do we have to do when we want to start a new game?
30

30

00:01:23.249  -->  00:01:25.006
The first thing that I can think of
31

31

00:01:25.006  -->  00:01:28.337
is that we have to reset our player's scores.
32

32

00:01:28.337  -->  00:01:31.302
So we set our scores back to
33

33

00:01:31.302  -->  00:01:33.688
zero and zero
34

34

00:01:33.688  -->  00:01:38.476
and we also have to say that the activePlayer is
35

35

00:01:38.476  -->  00:01:42.376
back to being zero because that's always the player
36

36

00:01:42.376  -->  00:01:44.823
that starts, so the first player.
37

37

00:01:44.823  -->  00:01:47.767
And also if there is some roundScore left
38

38

00:01:47.767  -->  00:01:49.451
from the last game.
39

39

00:01:49.451  -->  00:01:52.041
So from the game that we were playing
40

40

00:01:52.041  -->  00:01:54.783
and we also need that back to zero.
41

41

00:01:54.783  -->  00:01:59.128
So roundScore should be zero, okay.
42

42

00:01:59.128  -->  00:02:02.519
So if this is starting to look familiar to you
43

43

00:02:02.519  -->  00:02:04.055
then you're not the only one
44

44

00:02:04.055  -->  00:02:07.355
because actually we already wrote
45

45

00:02:07.355  -->  00:02:11.534
that exact same code up here, right?
46

46

00:02:11.534  -->  00:02:13.865
So this is not ideal, not at all.
47

47

00:02:13.865  -->  00:02:18.155
So once again we should stick to our dry principle here,
48

48

00:02:18.155  -->  00:02:20.180
so not repeating our code.
49

49

00:02:20.180  -->  00:02:21.682
So what can we do here?
50

50

00:02:21.682  -->  00:02:23.516
And you guessed it once again
51

51

00:02:23.516  -->  00:02:25.295
we are going to use a function
52

52

00:02:25.295  -->  00:02:27.897
and I'm calling this one init function
53

53

00:02:27.897  -->  00:02:31.006
because this is to initialize the game.
54

54

00:02:31.006  -->  00:02:33.622
And the logic behind this is that once again
55

55

00:02:33.622  -->  00:02:35.489
we will write a function
56

56

00:02:35.489  -->  00:02:38.125
and then even before doing anything else
57

57

00:02:38.125  -->  00:02:39.722
we will run that function
58

58

00:02:39.722  -->  00:02:44.088
and this will then initialize, or start, our game.
59

59

00:02:44.088  -->  00:02:47.070
So not only when we hit a new game button,
60

60

00:02:47.070  -->  00:02:49.027
but also right in the beginning
61

61

00:02:49.027  -->  00:02:51.604
when we first load our application.
62

62

00:02:51.604  -->  00:02:55.271
So I'm going to delete this from here, okay?
63

63

00:02:58.105  -->  00:03:01.738
And I'm writing my init function now.
64

64

00:03:01.738  -->  00:03:06.284
So function simply init and again it doesn't
65

65

00:03:06.284  -->  00:03:08.250
receive any parameters.
66

66

00:03:08.250  -->  00:03:11.872
We just want to use this code.
67

67

00:03:11.872  -->  00:03:16.455
So I'm removing it from there and putting it right here
68

68

00:03:16.455  -->  00:03:20.505
and then all we have to do is to simply call init function
69

69

00:03:20.505  -->  00:03:22.431
right in the beginning.
70

70

00:03:22.431  -->  00:03:24.710
So the first thing that we do
71

71

00:03:24.710  -->  00:03:27.472
is to call the init function.
72

72

00:03:27.472  -->  00:03:30.359
And so that piece of code that we had here
73

73

00:03:30.359  -->  00:03:32.505
will be then run.
74

74

00:03:32.505  -->  00:03:34.447
Now the things that you see here
75

75

00:03:34.447  -->  00:03:36.707
are also things that are done
76

76

00:03:36.707  -->  00:03:38.874
right in the beginning of the game, right?
77

77

00:03:38.874  -->  00:03:41.054
So of course it also makes sense
78

78

00:03:41.054  -->  00:03:45.521
to include this right into our init function.
79

79

00:03:45.521  -->  00:03:48.096
So all the things that happened
80

80

00:03:48.096  -->  00:03:50.627
before we can start to play
81

81

00:03:50.627  -->  00:03:53.752
will now be placed right into this init function.
82

82

00:03:53.752  -->  00:03:56.793
So we call this function as soon as we load
83

83

00:03:56.793  -->  00:03:58.272
our application,
84

84

00:03:58.272  -->  00:04:01.062
but remember we also want to call this function
85

85

00:04:01.062  -->  00:04:04.373
when we hit on our new game button, right?
86

86

00:04:04.373  -->  00:04:07.351
Okay, so we could do it like this.
87

87

00:04:07.351  -->  00:04:10.883
So we can simply call the function in here now
88

88

00:04:10.883  -->  00:04:12.553
and that's it.
89

89

00:04:12.553  -->  00:04:14.345
But there's another way of doing this
90

90

00:04:14.345  -->  00:04:16.271
because why should we create
91

91

00:04:16.271  -->  00:04:18.714
an anonymous function here, right?
92

92

00:04:18.714  -->  00:04:21.756
So this anonymous function only to then
93

93

00:04:21.756  -->  00:04:23.550
call another function.
94

94

00:04:23.550  -->  00:04:25.608
So it doesn't make much sense.
95

95

00:04:25.608  -->  00:04:28.921
Actually as we set up our very first event listener
96

96

00:04:28.921  -->  00:04:31.541
I told you that we can write any function in here,
97

97

00:04:31.541  -->  00:04:32.702
in this argument.
98

98

00:04:32.702  -->  00:04:35.005
So I'm just going to delete this
99

99

00:04:35.005  -->  00:04:38.626
and what I can do now is to not call the anonymous function
100

100

00:04:38.626  -->  00:04:41.181
but instead our init function.
101

101

00:04:41.181  -->  00:04:42.765
And actually I'm not calling it
102

102

00:04:42.765  -->  00:04:46.833
I'm just passing it here into this even listener function,
103

103

00:04:46.833  -->  00:04:48.229
this method.
104

104

00:04:48.229  -->  00:04:50.119
And that's why I don't need to use the
105

105

00:04:50.119  -->  00:04:53.024
function call operator here which is this one
106

106

00:04:53.024  -->  00:04:55.576
because if I would then this function would be
107

107

00:04:55.576  -->  00:04:58.859
immediately called, but I don't want that to happen.
108

108

00:04:58.859  -->  00:05:03.358
I just want to tell this event listener
109

109

00:05:03.358  -->  00:05:05.386
that hey when someone clicks this button
110

110

00:05:05.386  -->  00:05:07.904
then please call the init function for me.
111

111

00:05:07.904  -->  00:05:11.065
So that's all that I'm doing here.
112

112

00:05:11.065  -->  00:05:15.119
So back to our game init function, which starts the game.
113

113

00:05:15.119  -->  00:05:17.452
Another thing that we have to do here
114

114

00:05:17.452  -->  00:05:20.702
is to actually change back the player names.
115

115

00:05:20.702  -->  00:05:24.415
So when someone wins the game we print winner here,
116

116

00:05:24.415  -->  00:05:26.522
but when we start a new game of course
117

117

00:05:26.522  -->  00:05:30.189
we want to say player one and player two right there.
118

118

00:05:30.189  -->  00:05:31.482
So let's do that as well
119

119

00:05:31.482  -->  00:05:34.068
and we know from up here.
120

120

00:05:34.068  -->  00:05:35.173
Yeah it's right here.
121

121

00:05:35.173  -->  00:05:37.866
So we know that these are called name
122

122

00:05:37.866  -->  00:05:40.007
and then the number of the player.
123

123

00:05:40.007  -->  00:05:43.195
And actually let me just copy this from here
124

124

00:05:43.195  -->  00:05:46.146
because by now we already know in our sleep
125

125

00:05:46.146  -->  00:05:48.450
how to do this, right?
126

126

00:05:48.450  -->  00:05:52.617
So we have to do this for name-1 and two.
127

127

00:05:54.338  -->  00:05:58.317
So we don't need this active player variable here.
128

128

00:05:58.317  -->  00:06:02.533
So 'Player 1' and now I'm simply duplicating it here,
129

129

00:06:02.533  -->  00:06:03.783
for 'Player 2'.
130

130

00:06:04.950  -->  00:06:06.884
So 'Player 2' here.
131

131

00:06:06.884  -->  00:06:09.696
And since we are using getElementById
132

132

00:06:09.696  -->  00:06:11.123
for all of these IDs here,
133

133

00:06:11.123  -->  00:06:13.873
let me just do this here as well.
134

134

00:06:14.831  -->  00:06:19.107
So, getElementById and now remember we have to remove
135

135

00:06:19.107  -->  00:06:21.178
this hash symbol because this is only
136

136

00:06:21.178  -->  00:06:23.567
for the query selector.
137

137

00:06:23.567  -->  00:06:26.406
So this looks pretty cool.
138

138

00:06:26.406  -->  00:06:28.939
So let's now check this out.
139

139

00:06:28.939  -->  00:06:30.873
Alright so let's roll the dice.
140

140

00:06:30.873  -->  00:06:31.749
Well nothing's happening
141

141

00:06:31.749  -->  00:06:34.314
so we probably have some bug somewhere
142

142

00:06:34.314  -->  00:06:36.731
so let's open up the console.
143

143

00:06:37.899  -->  00:06:41.742
Alright, so we cannot set textContent of null
144

144

00:06:41.742  -->  00:06:43.231
in line 93.
145

145

00:06:43.231  -->  00:06:45.474
So let's check out where that is.
146

146

00:06:45.474  -->  00:06:49.153
And of course, I did make mistake right here, right?
147

147

00:06:49.153  -->  00:06:51.736
And you probably already saw it coming
148

148

00:06:51.736  -->  00:06:54.086
because the players are not one and two,
149

149

00:06:54.086  -->  00:06:56.646
but they are zero and one.
150

150

00:06:56.646  -->  00:06:59.251
So of course I cannot set the content
151

151

00:06:59.251  -->  00:07:02.011
of an element called name two
152

152

00:07:02.011  -->  00:07:05.491
if there isn't one on the page, right?
153

153

00:07:05.491  -->  00:07:10.189
So let's now load this and yeah, so it actually works.
154

154

00:07:10.189  -->  00:07:11.948
So we already know that it works because
155

155

00:07:11.948  -->  00:07:13.877
before we had some different values here
156

156

00:07:13.877  -->  00:07:15.627
not zero, zero, zero.
157

157

00:07:16.575  -->  00:07:18.084
But we see that our init function
158

158

00:07:18.084  -->  00:07:20.941
is already doing its work by setting everything to zero
159

159

00:07:20.941  -->  00:07:23.019
just because we call it right in the beginning.
160

160

00:07:23.019  -->  00:07:25.623
So, right here before doing anything else
161

161

00:07:25.623  -->  00:07:27.714
we call this function.
162

162

00:07:27.714  -->  00:07:30.064
So let's now play.
163

163

00:07:30.064  -->  00:07:32.064
Roll and now player two.
164

164

00:07:33.098  -->  00:07:33.931
And hold.
165

165

00:07:34.989  -->  00:07:36.486
And with this we can already win
166

166

00:07:36.486  -->  00:07:39.012
because remember it's still set to 20.
167

167

00:07:39.012  -->  00:07:41.991
So I'm saying hold and now I win.
168

168

00:07:41.991  -->  00:07:42.824
Cool.
169

169

00:07:42.824  -->  00:07:45.884
So now if I hit the new game, let's see what happens.
170

170

00:07:45.884  -->  00:07:50.345
Alright, so we are back to zero points here and here,
171

171

00:07:50.345  -->  00:07:53.054
but what we still have is this winner class here
172

172

00:07:53.054  -->  00:07:57.158
which formats this tag are red and also the active class.
173

173

00:07:57.158  -->  00:07:59.256
So we need to do a couple more things
174

174

00:07:59.256  -->  00:08:01.006
in our init function.
175

175

00:08:02.304  -->  00:08:06.550
So first thing is to remove the winner class.
176

176

00:08:06.550  -->  00:08:10.731
Let me actually check where we put this winner class.
177

177

00:08:10.731  -->  00:08:13.615
Alright so we put it here.
178

178

00:08:13.615  -->  00:08:17.698
So let me copy this to make our life a bit easier
179

179

00:08:19.099  -->  00:08:20.926
and just paste it here.
180

180

00:08:20.926  -->  00:08:24.439
Alright so player zero
181

181

00:08:24.439  -->  00:08:27.595
and this time I'm not making the same mistake
182

182

00:08:27.595  -->  00:08:30.262
and now not adding but removing.
183

183

00:08:32.540  -->  00:08:34.700
And since we don't know who won the game
184

184

00:08:34.700  -->  00:08:37.352
we will simply remove this class from both.
185

185

00:08:37.352  -->  00:08:40.881
So it doesn't matter even if the class is not there
186

186

00:08:40.881  -->  00:08:44.036
we can call the remove method without any problem.
187

187

00:08:44.036  -->  00:08:46.949
And actually we will do the exact same thing
188

188

00:08:46.949  -->  00:08:48.699
for the active class.
189

189

00:08:49.792  -->  00:08:51.635
So the class that defines, or that shows,
190

190

00:08:51.635  -->  00:08:54.892
which one is the active player.
191

191

00:08:54.892  -->  00:08:59.271
So again of course only one of these is the active player
192

192

00:08:59.271  -->  00:09:01.305
but we have to remove it from both
193

193

00:09:01.305  -->  00:09:04.579
because we don't want any of them to be the active player.
194

194

00:09:04.579  -->  00:09:06.334
And now only one thing to left
195

195

00:09:06.334  -->  00:09:09.886
which is to set the first player to the active player.
196

196

00:09:09.886  -->  00:09:14.563
So I will just duplicate this line and set it to add.
197

197

00:09:14.563  -->  00:09:16.720
Now this sounds a little bit strange, right?
198

198

00:09:16.720  -->  00:09:19.769
First removing it then adding it,
199

199

00:09:19.769  -->  00:09:22.940
but I'm doing this because imagine that player zero
200

200

00:09:22.940  -->  00:09:24.700
was the active player
201

201

00:09:24.700  -->  00:09:28.225
then in this case the active class would be there.
202

202

00:09:28.225  -->  00:09:31.676
And if I then call this method here, so this line,
203

203

00:09:31.676  -->  00:09:34.894
then another active class would get added.
204

204

00:09:34.894  -->  00:09:37.071
And then we would have two active class
205

205

00:09:37.071  -->  00:09:39.072
and of course we don't want that.
206

206

00:09:39.072  -->  00:09:41.813
Because if we later went to remove that class
207

207

00:09:41.813  -->  00:09:43.689
then there still would be one left
208

208

00:09:43.689  -->  00:09:46.183
and then the styles associated with the active class
209

209

00:09:46.183  -->  00:09:48.447
would still apply, and we don't want that.
210

210

00:09:48.447  -->  00:09:50.780
So we need to always remove them.
211

211

00:09:50.780  -->  00:09:53.496
And actually let me put this down here
212

212

00:09:53.496  -->  00:09:57.320
so that the ones that belong together are together.
213

213

00:09:57.320  -->  00:10:00.457
So we first remove these two
214

214

00:10:00.457  -->  00:10:03.526
so hat we are sure that no active classes anywhere
215

215

00:10:03.526  -->  00:10:06.714
and then we add the active class back to the first one.
216

216

00:10:06.714  -->  00:10:09.881
And with this we should be good to go.
217

217

00:10:17.845  -->  00:10:20.265
So player two is in the lead this time,
218

218

00:10:20.265  -->  00:10:23.265
but I'm still rolling a lot of ones.
219

219

00:10:24.379  -->  00:10:26.597
Alright so I'm going to let player two win.
220

220

00:10:26.597  -->  00:10:30.441
So I click hold and alright player two won.
221

221

00:10:30.441  -->  00:10:32.019
Everything looks nice.
222

222

00:10:32.019  -->  00:10:33.912
So now look at these numbers
223

223

00:10:33.912  -->  00:10:37.266
and at here when I hit the new game.
224

224

00:10:37.266  -->  00:10:39.792
Alright, so this works just fine.
225

225

00:10:39.792  -->  00:10:41.615
Everything is back to zero.
226

226

00:10:41.615  -->  00:10:43.828
Player one is the active player.
227

227

00:10:43.828  -->  00:10:46.211
The winner class is also removed
228

228

00:10:46.211  -->  00:10:48.779
and everything is fine.
229

229

00:10:48.779  -->  00:10:50.696
So if I play again now.
230

230

00:10:53.748  -->  00:10:55.415
Let me hold it here.
231

231

00:10:57.945  -->  00:10:59.568
Okay so I won.
232

232

00:10:59.568  -->  00:11:02.986
Now it makes sense that the game stops with this, right?
233

233

00:11:02.986  -->  00:11:05.873
But instead if I continue hitting this
234

234

00:11:05.873  -->  00:11:09.152
the game continues and now we have two active players
235

235

00:11:09.152  -->  00:11:11.360
and all of this is really weird
236

236

00:11:11.360  -->  00:11:13.803
and not working the way that it should be.
237

237

00:11:13.803  -->  00:11:15.980
So there's one more thing to do
238

238

00:11:15.980  -->  00:11:18.428
and that will be in the next lecture.
239

239

00:11:18.428  -->  00:11:21.463
So if you're curious on how to solve this problem
240

240

00:11:21.463  -->  00:11:24.713
then don't wait and come right with me.
