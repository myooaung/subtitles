00:00:01,120  -->  00:00:03,688
<v Instructor>Finally here goes the last part of the</v>
2

2

00:00:03,688  -->  00:00:06,560
solution of our coding challenge.
3

3

00:00:06,560  -->  00:00:10,176
And this coding challenge is a really fun one,
4

4

00:00:10,176  -->  00:00:13,736
because this time we have to add another dice to the game
5

5

00:00:13,736  -->  00:00:17,176
and then we will have two dice instead of just one.
6

6

00:00:17,176  -->  00:00:20,008
So let's now do that so the dice is down here
7

7

00:00:20,008  -->  00:00:21,824
and I will just duplicate this line
8

8

00:00:21,824  -->  00:00:23,992
and now we have two dice.
9

9

00:00:23,992  -->  00:00:26,456
And since they are different, we need a way to identify
10

10

00:00:26,456  -->  00:00:28,456
them both separately
11

11

00:00:28,456  -->  00:00:32,623
and therefore I'm going to create an ID called dice one.
12

12

00:00:34,472  -->  00:00:37,312
And down here we will have an ID
13

13

00:00:37,312  -->  00:00:39,376
and you can imagine that this will be
14

14

00:00:39,376  -->  00:00:41,293
dice number two, right?
15

15

00:00:42,304  -->  00:00:44,471
And I will just for a CSS,
16

16

00:00:45,584  -->  00:00:48,288
it's also quite simple because all I have to do is
17

17

00:00:48,288  -->  00:00:49,664
to position them
18

18

00:00:49,664  -->  00:00:52,664
so I just need to specify their top.
19

19

00:00:56,130  -->  00:00:59,297
So top of this one will be 120 pixels.
20

20

00:01:00,864  -->  00:01:02,720
And then duplicating it.
21

21

00:01:02,720  -->  00:01:05,637
And 250 pixels for the second dice.
22

22

00:01:06,992  -->  00:01:10,312
And since they both share the dice class,
23

23

00:01:10,312  -->  00:01:12,952
all of these rules here appear to both.
24

24

00:01:12,952  -->  00:01:15,912
All right so let's, before we start coding,
25

25

00:01:15,912  -->  00:01:17,495
see how this looks.
26

26

00:01:20,872  -->  00:01:23,624
Actually we cannot really see how this looks because
27

27

00:01:23,624  -->  00:01:25,640
one of the dice gets hidden.
28

28

00:01:25,640  -->  00:01:29,256
And that's because of the code that we wrote exactly to hide
29

29

00:01:29,256  -->  00:01:30,089
the dice.
30

30

00:01:30,089  -->  00:01:33,672
So maybe let's start by changing that code.
31

31

00:01:36,448  -->  00:01:38,768
So it's right here, so as I mentioned right in the
32

32

00:01:38,768  -->  00:01:41,408
beginning, probably in one of the first lectures of the
33

33

00:01:41,408  -->  00:01:44,296
section, the query selector only selects the first
34

34

00:01:44,296  -->  00:01:48,464
occurrence of the elements with this string here.
35

35

00:01:48,464  -->  00:01:51,408
So we could use the query selector all method here
36

36

00:01:51,408  -->  00:01:54,728
and then we would have to use a four loop or a while
37

37

00:01:54,728  -->  00:01:57,184
to loop through the results.
38

38

00:01:57,184  -->  00:01:59,544
And we will do that later in the next project
39

39

00:01:59,544  -->  00:02:03,071
but for now let's keep things a bit simpler
40

40

00:02:03,071  -->  00:02:05,847
and I will therefore just use the select element by ID
41

41

00:02:05,847  -->  00:02:07,031
method here.
42

42

00:02:07,031  -->  00:02:10,391
So I don't want this anymore, I'm just going to say
43

43

00:02:10,391  -->  00:02:12,558
document.get element by ID
44

44

00:02:13,959  -->  00:02:17,367
and the first one is called dice one
45

45

00:02:17,367  -->  00:02:20,284
and I'm just going to set its style
46

46

00:02:22,399  -->  00:02:25,816
or better it's display property to block.
47

47

00:02:27,631  -->  00:02:30,375
So that we can see it here.
48

48

00:02:30,375  -->  00:02:33,542
And the same thing for the second one.
49

49

00:02:34,825  -->  00:02:37,479
So we don't need this one anymore.
50

50

00:02:37,479  -->  00:02:40,527
And now since this variable here is gone
51

51

00:02:40,527  -->  00:02:44,610
I will also simply go ahead and replace this code
52

52

00:02:47,551  -->  00:02:48,863
with this part here.
53

53

00:02:48,863  -->  00:02:52,280
Ok so dice one will be the value of dice.
54

54

00:02:53,271  -->  00:02:57,135
Now we still only have one dice value right?
55

55

00:02:57,135  -->  00:02:59,015
So we need to fix that as well.
56

56

00:02:59,015  -->  00:03:02,839
So I'm going to create dice one instead of dice.
57

57

00:03:02,839  -->  00:03:06,103
Duplicate this line and create dice one with the exact
58

58

00:03:06,103  -->  00:03:07,975
same formula.
59

59

00:03:07,975  -->  00:03:11,519
Swift this runs twice, we already know that the math random
60

60

00:03:11,519  -->  00:03:13,479
always generates a different number,
61

61

00:03:13,479  -->  00:03:15,690
so these will be two different numbers.
62

62

00:03:15,690  -->  00:03:17,311
Not always but generally
63

63

00:03:17,311  -->  00:03:19,591
there will be two different numbers.
64

64

00:03:19,591  -->  00:03:23,623
So now here's dice one and then duplicating this line
65

65

00:03:23,623  -->  00:03:25,873
we will have dice two here.
66

66

00:03:27,287  -->  00:03:30,655
And then the value of the random dice roll.
67

67

00:03:30,655  -->  00:03:33,103
All right now down there
68

68

00:03:33,103  -->  00:03:36,647
in the places where we actually hide the dice,
69

69

00:03:36,647  -->  00:03:40,594
now I will need to change that as well.
70

70

00:03:40,594  -->  00:03:42,559
So for example in here,
71

71

00:03:42,559  -->  00:03:43,976
we have two dice.
72

72

00:03:44,967  -->  00:03:47,384
Now we need to put it to none
73

73

00:03:49,199  -->  00:03:50,032
For both.
74

74

00:03:51,799  -->  00:03:54,466
And the same thing here as well.
75

75

00:03:56,935  -->  00:03:57,768
None.
76

76

00:03:59,255  -->  00:04:00,831
And none.
77

77

00:04:00,831  -->  00:04:01,664
Now maybe you're thinking,
78

78

00:04:01,664  -->  00:04:04,111
oh I'm repeating a lot of code here,
79

79

00:04:04,111  -->  00:04:07,311
I could just create a function instead.
80

80

00:04:07,311  -->  00:04:10,031
And yes that's true, you could actually create
81

81

00:04:10,031  -->  00:04:14,207
a function called hide dice, for example,
82

82

00:04:14,207  -->  00:04:17,071
and replace this code by that.
83

83

00:04:17,071  -->  00:04:18,767
And would actually make some sense,
84

84

00:04:18,767  -->  00:04:21,663
but in this solution of this coding challenge,
85

85

00:04:21,663  -->  00:04:25,871
I'm not going to do that, but of course you can try it out
86

86

00:04:25,871  -->  00:04:30,247
and then see for yourself that it's going to work too.
87

87

00:04:30,247  -->  00:04:32,287
Ok, so here we are back.
88

88

00:04:32,287  -->  00:04:35,831
And actually let's comment out this part here
89

89

00:04:35,831  -->  00:04:37,567
from the last challenge.
90

90

00:04:37,567  -->  00:04:39,734
Actually this one as well.
91

91

00:04:41,359  -->  00:04:45,391
So we don't need this last dice thing, ok?
92

92

00:04:45,391  -->  00:04:49,687
Because what we want is only this what we had before.
93

93

00:04:49,687  -->  00:04:52,519
Oh let me just copy it from the original, ok?
94

94

00:04:52,519  -->  00:04:54,279
So it's less confusing like this.
95

95

00:04:54,279  -->  00:04:57,362
So we want the original part to this.
96

96

00:04:58,631  -->  00:05:01,464
OK, so this is what we had before.
97

97

00:05:02,943  -->  00:05:05,335
If the dice is different to one, then everything
98

98

00:05:05,335  -->  00:05:07,319
happens normally.
99

99

00:05:07,319  -->  00:05:09,303
But now it's different because now, it's enough
100

100

00:05:09,303  -->  00:05:13,711
for one of them to be one and then we lose our score
101

101

00:05:13,711  -->  00:05:16,247
and it's the next player's turn.
102

102

00:05:16,247  -->  00:05:20,751
So what has to happen that we can continue playing
103

103

00:05:20,751  -->  00:05:22,807
and that our score gets added?
104

104

00:05:22,807  -->  00:05:26,695
So the first dice of course needs to be different from one,
105

105

00:05:26,695  -->  00:05:30,862
and at the same time, dice two also needs to not be one.
106

106

00:05:36,375  -->  00:05:40,263
So this solves coding challenge number three.
107

107

00:05:40,263  -->  00:05:43,359
And now let's test that this actually works.
108

108

00:05:43,359  -->  00:05:45,935
In the beginning there's no dice, as we know.
109

109

00:05:45,935  -->  00:05:50,102
If I roll the dice, oh ok, so here we have now two dice.
110

110

00:05:51,303  -->  00:05:54,335
But there's a still a problem because here we don't
111

111

00:05:54,335  -->  00:05:55,855
have a number right now.
112

112

00:05:55,855  -->  00:05:58,783
So actually the problem right now is not yet solved.
113

113

00:05:58,783  -->  00:06:01,015
So let me look at the console here.
114

114

00:06:01,015  -->  00:06:03,271
And there we have an error.
115

115

00:06:03,271  -->  00:06:06,127
And an error happened in line 32
116

116

00:06:06,127  -->  00:06:10,823
Where we see that we still were using the old dice value.
117

117

00:06:10,823  -->  00:06:13,175
And actually yes we did.
118

118

00:06:13,175  -->  00:06:16,039
So of course we don't want the dice here anymore
119

119

00:06:16,039  -->  00:06:19,967
but now what gets added to our score is not only dice one
120

120

00:06:19,967  -->  00:06:23,280
but of course the sum of these two.
121

121

00:06:23,280  -->  00:06:25,783
So dice one plus dice two.
122

122

00:06:25,783  -->  00:06:28,815
So that's what we're missing here.
123

123

00:06:28,815  -->  00:06:30,148
So closing this,
124

124

00:06:32,927  -->  00:06:35,427
and once again, roll the dice.
125

125

00:06:36,943  -->  00:06:39,776
And yes, now four plus two is six.
126

126

00:06:40,687  -->  00:06:44,119
Hold it, and the next player, oh and he once again
127

127

00:06:44,119  -->  00:06:46,103
rolled one of them was a one
128

128

00:06:46,103  -->  00:06:48,853
so it's right back to player two.
129

129

00:06:53,311  -->  00:06:57,055
So yeah, this was challenge number three with two dices.
130

130

00:06:57,055  -->  00:07:00,287
So we did three nice changes here which hopefully
131

131

00:07:00,287  -->  00:07:04,335
helped you get a bit more practice with your javascript.
132

132

00:07:04,335  -->  00:07:06,585
All right so see you soon.
