00:00:01.400  -->  00:00:04.220
<v Jonas>So you already coded a line or two of JavaScript,</v>
2

2

00:00:04.220  -->  00:00:07.100
but what exactly is JavaScript, actually?
3

3

00:00:07.100  -->  00:00:09.670
Well, that's what we're going to look at in this video,
4

4

00:00:09.670  -->  00:00:11.850
and so in this lecture we will set the stage
5

5

00:00:11.850  -->  00:00:14.530
for the rest of the course, and so it's really important
6

6

00:00:14.530  -->  00:00:17.810
that you follow this one until the end, all right?
7

7

00:00:17.810  -->  00:00:20.480
So, per definition, JavaScript is a lightweight,
8

8

00:00:20.480  -->  00:00:22.450
cross-platform, object-oriented
9

9

00:00:22.450  -->  00:00:24.580
computer programming language.
10

10

00:00:24.580  -->  00:00:26.940
Now that sounds a bit too much, right?
11

11

00:00:26.940  -->  00:00:29.950
But don't worry, it's simpler than what it sounds like.
12

12

00:00:29.950  -->  00:00:32.030
So "lightweight" just means that the language
13

13

00:00:32.030  -->  00:00:34.530
doesn't eat up much memory of the computer,
14

14

00:00:34.530  -->  00:00:38.077
and that it has a relatively simple syntax and features.
15

15

00:00:38.077  -->  00:00:40.080
"Cross-platform" means that the language
16

16

00:00:40.080  -->  00:00:42.570
can be used on multiple platforms and systems,
17

17

00:00:42.570  -->  00:00:44.280
not just for web development.
18

18

00:00:44.280  -->  00:00:46.570
And finally, "object-oriented" means
19

19

00:00:46.570  -->  00:00:49.030
that it's a language that's based on objects.
20

20

00:00:49.030  -->  00:00:50.650
And we're going to explore all of that
21

21

00:00:50.650  -->  00:00:52.430
throughout the course.
22

22

00:00:52.430  -->  00:00:55.890
Now, as you already know, together with HTML and CSS,
23

23

00:00:55.890  -->  00:00:57.290
JavaScript is one of the three
24

24

00:00:57.290  -->  00:00:59.680
core technologies of web development.
25

25

00:00:59.680  -->  00:01:02.040
And more on that in a second.
26

26

00:01:02.040  -->  00:01:04.880
So, for web development, JavaScript has traditionally
27

27

00:01:04.880  -->  00:01:07.120
only been used in the browser environment,
28

28

00:01:07.120  -->  00:01:10.290
which means that it was only a client-side language.
29

29

00:01:10.290  -->  00:01:12.010
However, more lately, thanks to
30

30

00:01:12.010  -->  00:01:14.140
a new technology called node.js,
31

31

00:01:14.140  -->  00:01:17.350
developers are now able to actually use JavaScript
32

32

00:01:17.350  -->  00:01:19.030
on the server side as well.
33

33

00:01:19.030  -->  00:01:21.570
But that is a whole big topic for itself,
34

34

00:01:21.570  -->  00:01:23.960
and we will not cover that in this course.
35

35

00:01:23.960  -->  00:01:25.460
So as I mentioned at the beginning,
36

36

00:01:25.460  -->  00:01:28.140
this course covers the JavaScript language itself,
37

37

00:01:28.140  -->  00:01:29.660
and how to use it in the browser,
38

38

00:01:29.660  -->  00:01:31.840
which is the more traditional way, okay?
39

39

00:01:31.840  -->  00:01:34.280
So in summary, JavaScript is what
40

40

00:01:34.280  -->  00:01:36.540
made modern web development possible.
41

41

00:01:36.540  -->  00:01:39.050
It allows us to not only add dynamic effects
42

42

00:01:39.050  -->  00:01:41.500
and interactivity to more simple websites,
43

43

00:01:41.500  -->  00:01:43.810
but it also allows us to develop complex
44

44

00:01:43.810  -->  00:01:46.940
modern web applications that we can interact with
45

45

00:01:46.940  -->  00:01:49.230
and that almost feel like the apps that we can use
46

46

00:01:49.230  -->  00:01:51.920
on our computers and phones every single day.
47

47

00:01:51.920  -->  00:01:53.710
Now something else that I think is important
48

48

00:01:53.710  -->  00:01:56.100
to mention here is that today there are
49

49

00:01:56.100  -->  00:01:59.410
lots of JavaScript libraries and frameworks out there
50

50

00:01:59.410  -->  00:02:01.330
that implement different architectures
51

51

00:02:01.330  -->  00:02:03.410
and help developers build complex apps
52

52

00:02:03.410  -->  00:02:06.030
more easily and faster than ever.
53

53

00:02:06.030  -->  00:02:07.870
So I'm talking about stuff like React,
54

54

00:02:07.870  -->  00:02:12.190
or Angular, or even jQuery, which are all extremely popular,
55

55

00:02:12.190  -->  00:02:14.860
and I'm sure that you have heard of them already, right?
56

56

00:02:14.860  -->  00:02:18.950
Now the thing is, they are all 100% based on JavaScript,
57

57

00:02:18.950  -->  00:02:20.970
and so before using them, developers
58

58

00:02:20.970  -->  00:02:23.590
actually need to be really good at JavaScript.
59

59

00:02:23.590  -->  00:02:25.890
They need to be really able to understand
60

60

00:02:25.890  -->  00:02:28.200
the language itself, and that's exactly
61

61

00:02:28.200  -->  00:02:30.000
where this course wants to help you.
62

62

00:02:31.050  -->  00:02:33.950
So I mentioned that together with HTML and CSS,
63

63

00:02:33.950  -->  00:02:36.940
JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the web,
64

64

00:02:36.940  -->  00:02:38.940
and so let's go a bit deeper into that
65

65

00:02:38.940  -->  00:02:42.700
and talk about the role of JavaScript in web development.
66

66

00:02:42.700  -->  00:02:45.720
So HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all work together
67

67

00:02:45.720  -->  00:02:48.440
to create beautiful, interactive, and dynamic
68

68

00:02:48.440  -->  00:02:50.860
websites or web applications.
69

69

00:02:50.860  -->  00:02:54.320
Now, HTML is responsible for the content of the page,
70

70

00:02:54.320  -->  00:02:56.400
so the text, the images, the buttons,
71

71

00:02:56.400  -->  00:02:58.560
and all the content that you see on a webpage
72

72

00:02:58.560  -->  00:03:00.620
is always written in HTML.
73

73

00:03:00.620  -->  00:03:03.080
Then the CSS of course is responsible for
74

74

00:03:03.080  -->  00:03:06.540
the presentation of that content, so basically for styling
75

75

00:03:06.540  -->  00:03:09.180
and for laying out the elements on the webpage.
76

76

00:03:09.180  -->  00:03:10.930
And then finally JavaScript is
77

77

00:03:10.930  -->  00:03:13.670
the real programming language that allows developers
78

78

00:03:13.670  -->  00:03:17.040
to add dynamics into the picture, like interactive effects,
79

79

00:03:17.040  -->  00:03:20.130
manipulation of the content or of the CSS,
80

80

00:03:20.130  -->  00:03:21.990
and much, much more.
81

81

00:03:21.990  -->  00:03:25.170
So again, HTML is responsible for the content,
82

82

00:03:25.170  -->  00:03:28.190
CSS for the presentation, and JavaScript for adding
83

83

00:03:28.190  -->  00:03:30.993
real programming capabilities to websites.
84

84

00:03:31.990  -->  00:03:33.840
Now, another way to easily visualize
85

85

00:03:33.840  -->  00:03:35.380
the role of each technology
86

86

00:03:35.380  -->  00:03:39.140
is to put them in terms of nouns, adjectives, and verbs.
87

87

00:03:39.140  -->  00:03:41.430
So in this, like, thought experiment,
88

88

00:03:41.430  -->  00:03:44.110
HTML does the nouns, like saying that
89

89

00:03:44.110  -->  00:03:46.340
the &lt;p&gt; element is a paragraph.
90

90

00:03:46.340  -->  00:03:48.700
So paragraph here is the noun.
91

91

00:03:48.700  -->  00:03:50.920
The CSS then is the adjective,
92

92

00:03:50.920  -->  00:03:52.600
because it describes the noun,
93

93

00:03:52.600  -->  00:03:55.590
like saying the paragraph text is red,
94

94

00:03:55.590  -->  00:03:57.400
and so there is the adjective.
95

95

00:03:57.400  -->  00:04:00.100
And then finally, JavaScript is the verb,
96

96

00:04:00.100  -->  00:04:02.140
like saying hide the paragraph.
97

97

00:04:02.140  -->  00:04:05.550
And so we are doing something here and so we have a verb.
98

98

00:04:05.550  -->  00:04:07.220
Okay, does that make sense?
99

99

00:04:07.220  -->  00:04:10.323
And so that is the role of JavaScript in web development.
100

100

00:04:11.210  -->  00:04:12.870
And now just before we finish,
101

101

00:04:12.870  -->  00:04:15.360
I want to quickly mention that there are different versions
102

102

00:04:15.360  -->  00:04:16.760
of the JavaScript language.
103

103

00:04:16.760  -->  00:04:18.900
But I'm not going to go into that right now, and instead
104

104

00:04:18.900  -->  00:04:22.100
I'll leave that for the end of this section, okay?
105

105

00:04:22.100  -->  00:04:24.950
For now I just want you to start coding as fast as possible,
106

106

00:04:24.950  -->  00:04:27.220
and so we're going to use a version called ES5
107

107

00:04:27.220  -->  00:04:28.840
over the next couple of lectures.
108

108

00:04:28.840  -->  00:04:30.670
But again, at the end of this section,
109

109

00:04:30.670  -->  00:04:33.143
there's a whole very important video about this.
