[Autogenerated] Hi, This is Greg Golightly,

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:08,440
and welcome to designing for Advanced Security within a W s

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:13,940
securing and managing your AWS account.

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,760
This course builds on concepts introduced in the

5
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,580
designing for complexity on AWS course.

6
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:23,260
So if you haven't watched that course yet and don't understand something,

7
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,620
you may want to pause.

8
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,140
Watch that course, then come back.

9
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,890
We're going to cover what makes the root user unique and how to

10
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:35,960
secure the root user in your AWS account will also discuss different

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,140
ways to secure access to your accounts,

12
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,440
including policies and other tools for limiting.

13
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,220
I am user access.

14
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:48,090
Additional ways to secure roles and how to use the permissions boundary

15
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:53,550
feature finally will discuss how to manage sandbox accounts in your AWS

16
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,440
organization and some benefits to using them.

17
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,550
When you create an AWS account, you start out with a single root user.

18
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:06,810
The root user has complete access to all AWS services,

19
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,990
and resource is in the account because it is so powerful you

20
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:13,070
need to take steps to lock down your route.

21
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:14,040
User.

22
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,610
Let's go through those recommended steps,

23
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:20,820
then talk about some things that only the root user can do do and how you

24
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:26,360
can actually limit the root user with service control policies instead of

25
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,090
using the root user for administrative tasks.

26
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:33,800
Create an I am username has administrative privileges.

27
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,210
It's recommended that you use I am groups To assign permissions.

28
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:42,720
Simply create an administrator's group with the appropriate permissions.

29
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,950
Then assign the I Am username group.

30
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,940
Next, delete your root access keys.

31
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:52,700
This goes back to using an I am user to administer your account.

32
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,380
Except for those things that only a root user can do do,

33
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:00,570
activate multi factor authentication on your route account.

34
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:05,240
This is a simple but important step to add a layer of security to your account.

35
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,550
You can use a virtual or physical MF a device Finally,

36
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:14,020
ensure that the root user has a strong, randomly generated password.

37
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,020
At least 20 characters in length.

38
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,920
You should also be using a secrets manager to generate and secure the

39
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,540
password and limit who has access to the root account.

40
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:29,480
There are a few account actions that can only be performed by the root username.

41
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,500
Any of these are one time actions or things you may not ever do,

42
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,430
but I wanted to give you an idea of when you would have to

43
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:39,230
use the root user to perform an action.

44
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:42,760
If in action isn't working as an I am administrator,

45
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,410
double check the documentation to see if what you

46
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:48,540
want to do requires the root user.

47
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:53,160
If you've enabled A W s organizations and service control policies,

48
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:58,010
it's possible that for a given member account in the organization,

49
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:01,390
the root user could have limited permissions.

50
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:05,980
Recall that actions that error not listed in an SCP are implicitly

51
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:11,370
denied and that S E P s can also explicitly deny actions which will

52
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:14,630
prevent them from happening under any circumstance.

53
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:19,730
If you're leveraging AWS organizations to manage several AWS accounts,

54
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:23,430
the root user of each account should still be locked down

55
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,540
following the recommended steps we discussed earlier.

56
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,980
But setting up guard rails with service control policies for each

57
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:34,530
account according to how you are going to use the account can further

58
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,660
limit the possible actions for any user,

59
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,840
including the root user.

60
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,540
So even if the root user was compromised,

61
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:47,640
any possible actions would be limited by the service control policy.

62
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,570
The other thing to be aware of when using A W s organizations

63
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:55,730
is that any I am users in the master account that have

64
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:58,230
permissions to change settings in AWS,

65
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:05,210
organizations need to be locked down as those users could attach and detach

66
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:10,370
S C P s from member accounts and organizational units or move member

67
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:13,940
accounts from one organizational unit to another,

68
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:17,240
thus affecting the permissions for that account.

69
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:21,820
Only a few trusted I am administrative users should have access

70
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,040
to the master account of the organization.

71
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,090
The rest of the I am users can be created and managed from a

72
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:36,000
member account in the organization to reduce the risk of compromise in the master account.
