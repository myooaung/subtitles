1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,780
[Autogenerated] AWS certificate manager or A C M allows you to centrally

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:10,420
manage provisions and deploy SSL TLS certificates.

3
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:14,970
ACM is integrated with A W s services like cloudfront

4
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:17,740
elastic load balancer and API Gateway.

5
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:20,030
To make adding a certificate to endpoints,

6
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:23,840
you create on these services very quick and easy.

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,860
Best of all,

8
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:30,430
ACM public certificates are free when you use them with integrated AWS services.

9
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:34,640
You just pay for the underlying services that error using the certificate

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,890
ACM manages certificate renewal for you so you won't have to worry about

11
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,170
getting an embarrassing certificate expired.

12
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:44,200
Message on your web-page Finally,

13
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:50,020
ACM private certificate Authority is a highly available managed private

14
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:54,050
certificate authority service that allows you to easily and securely

15
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:58,250
manage the lifecycle of your private certificates without the time and

16
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:02,440
expense of operating your own private C A.

17
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,210
For public certificates, you'll enter the name of the site,

18
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,520
then validate ownership of the domain via a see name record in your DNS

19
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,340
configuration or an email to the registered domain owner.

20
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,940
Once the site is validated,

21
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,540
your certificate will be generated and available to

22
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,840
use with supported A W s services.

23
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,290
To deploy the certificate,

24
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:26,760
simply select it from a drop down list in the AWS management

25
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:31,200
console and ACM will deploy the certificate to the resource you

26
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,900
selected for private certificates.

27
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,050
You must first create and activate a private See A.

28
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:42,440
You can then request private certificates and enter the name of your site.

29
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,690
ACM generates the key pair and issues the certificate from your

30
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:51,470
private CIA ACM can deploy the private certificate to the resource

31
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:57,240
you select or you can export the certificate.

32
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,080
Let's go to AWS certificate manager and create a public certificate

33
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:06,510
will then deploy it to a supported A W s service to see just how easy

34
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:10,110
that process could be from the AWS console,

35
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,040
go to AWS certificate manager.

36
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,240
We're going to provision a public certificate.

37
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,750
Note that if you have an existing certificate,

38
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:25,000
you can import that into a CME for easier deployment and

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,040
management will request our public certificate.

40
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,740
Enter the domain name for which you'd like to issue a certificate.

41
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,030
You can add another name to the certificate.

42
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:40,740
Depending on how customers arrive at your site,

43
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:44,300
you can choose DNAs or email validation.

44
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,940
I'm going to choose email for this example.

45
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:52,590
You can add any tags that you'd like then review your selections.

46
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:58,440
Once you're ready, select, Confirm and request From this dashboard,

47
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,200
you can see the status of your certificates.

48
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:01,460
Note.

49
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:07,040
The one that I just requested is pending validation.

50
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,980
If for some reason you're not getting the validation email,

51
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,540
you have an option to resend it.

52
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:18,930
Once I followed the instructions in the email I can refresh and see that

53
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:22,540
it has been validated and their certificate issued.

54
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:22,900
Now,

55
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,990
if you go to one of the integrated services like API

56
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:30,730
Gateway under custom domain names,

57
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:35,310
enter the domain name that you generated a certificate for and

58
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:40,990
select create notice under ACM certificate.

59
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:45,140
The certificate that was created is in the drop down list.

60
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,910
I could select this and use it to configure this

61
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,480
custom domain name for my API gateway.

62
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:56,840
ACM will then automatically deploy that certificate to this resource.

63
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,880
You're doing great.

64
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,490
We've covered how to use Kms to securely manage your data

65
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:05,470
encryption keys for use in many different AWS services.

66
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:09,550
You know about cloudhsm and when you might choose to use it,

67
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,270
particularly if you need a single tenant.

68
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:16,890
HSM have a high volume of keys or calls and for certain

69
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:20,940
applications that need direct access to an HSM.

70
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,690
Finally,

71
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:26,950
you can easily provisioned and managed both public and private SSL TLS

72
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:31,540
certificates with Amazon certificate manager with free public

73
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:34,690
certificates for use in services like Cloudfront,

74
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:39,240
Elastic Load Balancing, API Gateway and Elastic Beanstalk.

75
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,620
Join me in the next module to discuss protecting your account

76
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:50,000
and applications with AWS web application, firewall, shield and guard duty.
