00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.650
[Autogenerated] Amazon Guard Duty is a threat detection

2
00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.140
service that continually monitors events across multiple AWS

3
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:15.440
data sources such as A W S CloudTrail, Amazon BPC flow logs and DNA is logs.

4
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.970
Guard duty uses machine learning to establish a baseline for your

5
00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.100
normal account activity and assigns threats,

6
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.270
a category and severity.

7
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.870
You can even integrate findings into services like Lambda to

8
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.040
automatically take actions for remediation or prevention.

9
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.460
You can try it for free for 30 days.

10
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.440
Then you're charged based on the amount of data your account is producing.

11
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.540
That guard duty needs to analyze.

12
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.880
Threats are classified into three main categories.

13
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.350
Reconnaissance, such as unusual API activity,

14
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.470
port scanning,

15
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.440
failed log in requests or port probing from a known bad i p instantiate

16
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.850
compromise such as Cryptocurrency mining ________ activity,

17
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.100
unusually high volume of network traffic or data

18
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.900
exfiltration using drones and account compromise such as

19
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.210
attempts to disable AWS CloudTrail logging,

20
00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.140
unusual infrastructure deployment or region usage,

21
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.740
or API calls from known bad i PS.

22
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.100
Amazon guard duty is easy to set up just a couple of clicks to configure

23
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.840
since it leverages these existing AWS infrastructure.

24
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.910
Once it's set up,

25
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:30.270
it will continually monitor your account and alert you with unusual

26
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:39.000
account activities from potential or real threats so you can take action on findings and protect your resource is.
