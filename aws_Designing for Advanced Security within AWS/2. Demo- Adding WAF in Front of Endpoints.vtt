00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:04.950
[Autogenerated] Let's go to the AWS web console and

2
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.230
create some rules in web application.

3
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.810
Firewall will create a web A C L, and assign it to a resource in our AWS account.

4
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.270
Then we'll see the different components available to configure waft,

5
00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.840
including Red X Pattern sets, I P sets and rule groups.

6
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.540
Finally, we'll take a look at some managed rules in the AWS marketplace.

7
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:31.140
I've got a sample application deployed on Amazon API Gateway.

8
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.110
Here is a machine located in the US where I can hit the rest.

9
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.440
API.

10
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:45.240
Here is a machine in the London region that I can also use to hit the API.

11
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.890
Let's configure web application firewall to sit in front of that API

12
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.940
gateway and create some rules to see it in action.

13
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.140
First, we'll create a web A C L.

14
00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.040
I'll call it API Gateway Demo.

15
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.140
You can provide an optional description or a CloudWatch metric name.

16
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.400
Then we'll specify the resource that we want to associate with this web.

17
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.330
A C l.

18
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.130
If it's a regional resource, A, l, B and API Gateway,

19
00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.140
it's important to select the correct region.

20
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:26.100
Select Add A W s resource is indicate if it's an API gateway or a L.

21
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.740
B.

22
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:34.240
Then you'll see the available resource is listed for you to associate.

23
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.040
Confirm your selection.

24
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.800
Next, you can add rules and rule groups to your web.

25
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.140
CL.

26
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.210
We'll come back to that in a minute, so we'll just default.

27
00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.040
Allow all actions.

28
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.040
We can view the summary, Then create the web A.

29
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.440
C L.

30
00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.910
Once it has been created, you'll see it in your list of web seals.

31
00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.340
If we go back to our samples,

32
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.980
we can still hit it from the London region and we can still hit it from the U.

33
00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:09.940
S.

34
00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.800
I'd like to filter based on an I P address.

35
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.040
In order to do this will need to create an I p set with the I P address.

36
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.040
I'll give it a name.

37
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.570
Select the region for the I P set.

38
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:24.780
I'll leave it in Oregon,

39
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.340
since that's where the web A C L is that I'd like to use it with.

40
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.440
Then enter your I P V four or iPod V six address insider format.

41
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.910
Note that you can have multiple I P addresses,

42
00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.760
so this is meant to facilitate adding test machines or office IOPS or whatever

43
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.040
you need to configure your web application firewall rules.

44
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.540
Now we can create a rule with this I P address.

45
00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.480
Go back to web A C L's.

46
00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.800
Then in the rules tab, we can add a rule.

47
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.580
This rule is going to use an I.

48
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.820
P.

49
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:09.040
Set.

50
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.430
Notice that for the action we can allow block or count.

51
00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.480
I'm going to block as we add more rules.

52
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.240
We can set the rule of priority here.

53
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:27.640
Now let's try to hit the API with the machine whose I p address I just blocked.

54
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.140
Notice how now I get a forbidden response.

55
00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.540
But if I hit it from a different machine, it goes through just fine.

56
00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.540
Let's add another rule.

57
00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.640
This time we're going to create a rate based rule.

58
00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.340
I'll give it a name for a rate based rule will set a rate limit,

59
00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:55.000
then add any criteria to determine which requests count against the rate limit.

60
00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.840
I'll set it for the minimum of 100 and I'm going to create some criteria.

61
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.570
As we discussed in the slides.

62
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.370
Notice all of the different options to choose from.

63
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.340
I'm going to select originating from a country.

64
00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.040
I'll use my machine that's in the London region.

65
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.930
Next, cheese, whether to block or count.

66
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.440
I'm going to block.

67
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.090
Now we have two different rules.

68
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.740
I'm actually going to modify the block London machine to simply count,

69
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.240
but I'll keep the order of the same count.

70
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.950
Could be a good option when you're testing out rules,

71
00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.040
or you just want to verify that your logic is correct.

72
00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.800
Note also that if you always want your count rules to log,

73
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.140
you'll need to have them before any blocks.

74
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.230
Okay, now we're ready on each machine.

75
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:55.540
I've created a simple loop to hit the API 101 times

76
00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:56.930
we'll start the machine in the U.

77
00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.140
S.

78
00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.940
And we'll start the machine in London.

79
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.640
If I look at the end of the log, notice how I'm getting forbidden messages.

80
00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.010
Once I exceeded 100 requests in five minutes,

81
00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:17.640
it blocked everything else here on the machine that is not in the London region.

82
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:22.440
Notice that we had no blocked calls back on the dashboard.

83
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.560
We can see the requests that were counted after the threshold of 100 was hit,

84
00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:33.110
the requests that were blocked and the requests that were allowed to access the

85
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:39.440
managed rule sets maintained by AWS simply select Add rules,

86
00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.440
then add managed rule groups.

87
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.940
Here you can see the rule groups managed by AWS.

88
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.840
These rules contain things like iPod reputation lists,

89
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:59.840
known bad inputs, SQL database and other common waft configurations.

90
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.910
If you see one that you'd like to use, simply select, add to web A C.

91
00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:05.940
L.

92
00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:11.840
You can also select whether you want to initially at it as a count action.

93
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.540
That's usually a good idea until you verify that the

94
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.740
logic is doing what you want it to.

95
00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.710
These other managed rule groups are maintained by third parties and

96
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:26.240
are available to subscribe in AWS Marketplace.

97
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.680
For example, if I wanted the WASP Top 10 complete rule set,

98
00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.440
I could subscribe to this in AWS marketplace.

99
00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:35.700
Here.

100
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:42.040
I can see the details about the third-party as well as the pricing information.

101
00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:46.740
If I subscribe, this rule set will then be available to use in my web.

102
00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:46.840
A.

103
00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.840
C l note that this one is about a dollar a day,

104
00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.940
and it would be pro rated by the hour.

105
00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.570
If you wanted to just try it out for a few hours, then unsubscribe.

106
00:06:55.570 --> 00:07:01.000
Note. Also, the per million requests charge of a dollar 80 per million
