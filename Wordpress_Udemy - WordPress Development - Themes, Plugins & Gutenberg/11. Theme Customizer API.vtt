00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.210
We are now going to take a look at the theme customized API.

2
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.380
The theme customized is WordPress is UI for customizing the theme.

3
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.080
This is enabled by default for you already.

4
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:23.900
You can view the customized by going into the admin dashboard and navigating to Appearance Customize

5
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.510
on the sidebar.

6
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.790
You'll find a few options for changing the theme and you'll see our theme being displayed on the right.

7
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.210
Let's see how this works.

8
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:40.030
Click on site identity and try changing the site title right after making these modifications.

9
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:46.590
WordPress will actually update the preview what WordPress is doing is loading the site inside an iframe

10
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.680
every time a change happens.

11
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.580
WordPress will refresh the ie frame with the modified data.

12
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.570
Keep in mind that this doesn't take an official effect until you click save.

13
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.150
What makes this customizable even more powerful is that developers are provided an API to add in their

14
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.500
own options and settings.

15
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:06.800
So here's what we're going to do.

16
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.470
We're going to create some settings to add social links in the header and footer.

17
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:18.000
We're going to make everything here dynamic open the functions file and add an action hook.

18
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.610
The action we want to hook into is called customize register.

19
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:24.680
This is the hook.

20
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.460
WordPress calls when it starts to set up the theme customized the function to call we'll be called J

21
00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:39.460
You customize register create a file called the theme dash customize your dot peach we inside the includes

22
00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:49.800
folder and define the function here.

23
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.680
Lastly include this file from the function's file

24
00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.990
this function will be passed in one variable names WP customize.

25
00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.640
This is an object with methods and properties for modifying within customized her.

26
00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.960
This object is an instance of the WP customize manager class.

27
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.610
I'll provide a link to this class in the resource section.

28
00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.280
This class controls how the Customize are works and most of its functionality will be going over how

29
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.010
this works shortly before we begin working on the customize our.

30
00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.990
There are three important concepts you need to know.

31
00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.030
If you don't understand right away after I explain it then that's fine.

32
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.760
I'll be showing you how it works.

33
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.790
There are three steps you'll usually take when working with the Customize your directly.

34
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.160
The first step is adding a setting the setting is just a value that you save in the database and can

35
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.930
be modified through the customize.

36
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.900
You can then use this value in your theme.

37
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.920
The second step is creating a section a section is a way to group a bunch of fields together.

38
00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:02.270
If you look at the Customize or you'll notice that things are grouped together instead of just displaying

39
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.720
every option together.

40
00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:10.700
This makes it easier to control and navigate around the third step is creating a controller a controller

41
00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:17.180
is just an input field checkbox color picker or uploader that allows you to change the setting you made

42
00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.730
in Step 1 directly.

43
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.770
Let's get started with the Customize or the object passing has a couple of methods.

44
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:33.850
The method for adding a new setting is called add setting and it's called like so this method has two

45
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:34.780
parameters.

46
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:41.050
The first is the I.D. like anything else the I.D. is something that should be unique so we can refer

47
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:42.160
to it later.

48
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:50.090
I'm going to set this to J you Facebook handle the next parameter is an array of settings.

49
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:56.040
I'm going to provide a link in the resource section of lecture for more information about this method.

50
00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.600
If you scroll down a bit you'll see a few settings you can set most of them are optional except one

51
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.770
setting which is the default key.

52
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.710
I'm going to set this as an empty string

53
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:12.810
that's all you need to do.

54
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.000
One thing I should mention is this setting called transport.

55
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:20.710
This controls how the value is reflected on the main theme during preview mode.

56
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:23.230
By default it's set to refresh.

57
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:29.260
This means that when this value is changed then the page will refresh and show that value.

58
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:35.770
If you want to control how this value is reflected on the theme you will need to set this to post message.

59
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:41.770
However refresh will work in 90 percent of the time so will leave this value as is.

60
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:47.710
This value will now be saved in the database and it can now be manipulated through controllers and be

61
00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.660
displayed on our theme.

62
00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.350
We now have to create a section to create a section.

63
00:04:53.350 --> 00:05:01.060
We have to call the ad section method the first parameter is the I.D. for this section.

64
00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:06.340
I'm going to set this to J use social section.

65
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.110
The second parameter is an array of settings.

66
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.930
The title will be translatable and I'll set it to you to me social settings

67
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.450
next is the priority.

68
00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.460
The lower the number the higher placement it will receive and vice versa.

69
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.320
I'm going to set this to 30.

70
00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:35.250
There's one last method I want to call which is the ad control method.

71
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:40.600
This will create an input field and add it to a particular section of our choosing.

72
00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.720
This method is a bit tricky because there are two ways you can set this up.

73
00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.010
The first way is to pass in the settings and have more control over it.

74
00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:52.970
However this tends to be confusing if you don't know what you're doing.

75
00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:58.980
The second route is to pass in an object that will help you create the field you'd like to create.

76
00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:04.400
We'll be going with the second route because it's really easy to get started in the resource section.

77
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.250
I provide a link to the ad control method.

78
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.910
Scroll down to the classes section.

79
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:14.600
This section provides a couple of classes that can be passed and that will assist us with filling in

80
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.910
the blanks.

81
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:23.570
The WP customize control class will help you create fields such as text fields radio buttons checkboxes

82
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:29.900
and drop downs the color control will create a color picture for you the upload control will create

83
00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:36.110
a field for uploading files the image control also does something similar to the upload control except

84
00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.060
you can only upload images.

85
00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:44.870
These other two are unimportant to us as WordPress uses these internally for its own purpose so we won't

86
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:46.250
be messing with them at all.

87
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:52.280
Throughout this lecture for our purposes the first class is perfect for us since we want to create a

88
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.580
text field for the users handle.

89
00:06:54.680 --> 00:07:00.110
I'm going to click this and you'll see that WordPress provides an example on how this works.

90
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:07.220
I'm going to copy and paste this and go over what's going on.

91
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:10.700
The first parameter is the customizable object itself.

92
00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:14.930
The controller needs to know more about what's happening in the customizable so that it can fill in

93
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:16.390
the blanks for you.

94
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.910
The second parameter is the I.D. for this controller.

95
00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:29.260
I'm going to set this as J use social Facebook input the last parameter is an array of additional settings.

96
00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:32.630
We will only concern ourselves with these four keys.

97
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:36.150
The label is just text to describe the field.

98
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:38.720
This should be a translatable string.

99
00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:46.030
I'm going to set this as Facebook handle the section is where it will appear.

100
00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:54.770
We created our own section called J use social section will assign this control under that section the

101
00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:58.940
next key is settings which is what setting will this field modify.

102
00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:08.160
We created this in Step 1 the value for this will be J you Facebook handle the last key is type which

103
00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.210
is what kind of field this will be.

104
00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:12.450
By default it'll be text.

105
00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:20.250
There's also radio text area etc. You can find all the types of fields in the documentation for now

106
00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:21.650
the default is fine.

107
00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:24.360
I'm actually just going to remove this key.

108
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:29.400
We are now finished with the customizable let's refresh the customization and you will now see this

109
00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.490
new section called Udemy social settings.

110
00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:35.260
After clicking it you'll now see the controller.

111
00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:38.230
I'm going to input you to me and save the setting.

112
00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:43.620
However nothing in the preview will change because we haven't told WordPress where we'd like to use

113
00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:44.700
this setting.

114
00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:48.210
Let's review what we did in our customized function first.

115
00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:53.290
The first step was to create the setting which is the value but stored in the database.

116
00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:57.510
The second step is to create a section that will group various controllers.

117
00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:03.530
The third step was to create a controller that is assigned under a section and controls one setting.

118
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:09.090
A lot of people get confused with the difference between the ad setting and ad control methods.

119
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.820
The setting will create the database value.

120
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.630
The method will not create an input field.

121
00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:20.400
It will just tell WordPress about the setting and tell it to create a setting in the database.

122
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.960
The control method will not create a database value.

123
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.830
Instead it will create an input field.

124
00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:32.340
The control will take care of modifying and updating the database value whenever the input field is

125
00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:33.320
updated.

126
00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:39.750
All right now that we've cleared that up let's start making our theme recognize the changes inside the

127
00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:40.740
header template.

128
00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:46.350
Let's locate a list of social icons in the header inside a conditional statement.

129
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:48.900
I'm going to call the function get theme mod

130
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:59.520
this function will grab a setting you pass in if there is no value or the value does not exist then

131
00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.290
this will return false.

132
00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:09.340
I'm going to pass in j u Facebook handle this is the setting we created earlier.

133
00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:14.570
If there is a value then we'll output this one list item which is the facebook link.

134
00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:18.050
I'm going to move this static link inside the conditional statement

135
00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:26.020
then I'm going to replace the your role for this with the Facebook.

136
00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:30.020
Your URL followed by the value returned by the theme mod function.

137
00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:39.330
We will have to echo out the value since the function will only return it.

138
00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.360
That's it.

139
00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:44.070
Let's go back to the customized and you will now see our link appearing.

140
00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:50.050
If I were to empty out this text field you'll notice the eye frame refresh and the link disappear.

141
00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:52.270
This is exactly what we want.

142
00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:55.490
The only thing left to tackle is the rest of these icons.

143
00:10:55.510 --> 00:11:01.660
I want you to try this on your own actually before I let you off there's one thing we should do together

144
00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:11.140
create a folder inside the includes folder named customize our then create a file named Social dot P

145
00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:16.720
HP inside this file create a function named J use social customize or section

146
00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:24.400
this function will accept the WP customize object.

147
00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:31.690
I'm going to cut and paste the contents from the main customize a function into this function then I'm

148
00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:36.510
going to call this function from the main customize R and pass in the Customize object.

149
00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:44.880
The last step is to just include this social customize or file

150
00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:56.570
by doing this we make things a lot cleaner and easier to manage these social icons aren't the only things

151
00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:58.640
we'll be using the customized for.

152
00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:02.690
This here is just preference and not required by WordPress itself.

153
00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:05.630
I just like to stay organized and clean.

154
00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:11.880
I want you to create the new settings now all you'll be doing is creating new settings and controllers.

155
00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:14.990
You only need one section which we already defined.

156
00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:21.170
Once you have those ready then you can modify the theme itself to include the links.

157
00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:22.240
Welcome back.

158
00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:26.210
If you weren't able to do it then no worries I have you covered.

159
00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:29.330
As you can see here I already have everything setup.

160
00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:35.210
I'm going to provide these social customize their function in the resource section so that you can download

161
00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:37.670
it and compare it to your own function.

162
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:42.920
I also made modifications to the header and footer to include these settings onto the theme.
