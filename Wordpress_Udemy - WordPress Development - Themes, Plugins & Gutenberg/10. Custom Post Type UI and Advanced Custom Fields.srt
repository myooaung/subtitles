00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,750
Throughout this course we've talked about quite a few important concepts for WordPress development a

2
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:18,480
lot of the problems we've been facing can be solved by using two plugins called custom post type UI

3
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,120
and advanced custom fields.

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:26,240
These two plugins will create post types taxonomy and custom fields for us.

5
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:32,580
Let's check these plugins out inside the admin dashboard navigate to plugins add new search for the

6
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:39,690
plugin called a custom post type you want this plugin was created by web dev studios install and activate

7
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:40,320
this plugin

8
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:51,430
after activating this plugin you should find a menu called CPC UI appear let's create a new post type.

9
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:57,260
There are a lot of fields here but each field corresponds to a setting we can set in the register post

10
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,430
type function.

11
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:04,890
Not only that but there are also these Little Helper texts that describe what each setting does.

12
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:10,530
As you can see this plugin is extremely powerful and easy to use even for people who can't code.

13
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,880
Let's create a new post type.

14
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,100
The first three fields are required.

15
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:21,920
I'm going to set the post type of slug to music the plural and singular labels will be music.

16
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:29,400
Right after this you can set additional labels but I'm going to leave this as is.

17
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:34,350
I'm going to toggle this for a second so that we don't have to scroll all the way down.

18
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,710
Then we have some settings we can set.

19
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,900
Most of these are fine by default.

20
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:43,830
If you scroll down you'll find a list of taxonomy so we can assign to this post type.

21
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:47,820
We even see the origin taxonomy we created earlier.

22
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,470
I want to create a custom taxonomy for this post type.

23
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,850
We'll do that next.

24
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:55,190
Before we do let's add this post type

25
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:04,180
once added You can view the Post site by clicking on The View Post types tab the plugin provides plenty

26
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:09,670
of information about this post type and its settings and even provides information about how you would

27
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:12,580
use this post type in the template hierarchy.

28
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,860
This is incredibly useful.

29
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:19,650
Let's create the taxonomy genre that will be associated with this post type.

30
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:24,400
This plugin allows you to create taxonomy without having to write code.

31
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:32,280
You can create it by going to see P.T. UI add edit taxonomy is let's create a taxonomy for genres.

32
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,210
The slug will be genre.

33
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:41,080
The plural will be genres and the singular will be genre nothing too crazy.

34
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,340
We even have the opportunity to assign this taxonomy to a post type.

35
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:50,850
I only want this taxonomy to apply to the music post type so check that box only.

36
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,150
Just like last time.

37
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:55,390
You can also set some additional labels and settings.

38
00:02:55,390 --> 00:03:01,540
I'm fine with most of these settings except for one the show in rest settings should be set to true.

39
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,900
Just like last time.

40
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,560
Custom taxonomy is can only work in Gutenberg.

41
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,020
If this value is true.

42
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:08,010
Submit the form.

43
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,400
You should see a success message.

44
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:17,230
If you look at the menu you'll find our music post type and under them and you'll find the genre taxonomy.

45
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:22,420
If you were to create a new music post you'll find a new panel for the genre.

46
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:26,510
We didn't have to write a single line of code to accomplish any of this.

47
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,230
Let's keep going with this route.

48
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,480
I want to create some custom fields.

49
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:35,090
Unfortunately it's not possible with a custom post type UI plugin.

50
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:41,800
Go to plugins add new and search for the plugin advanced custom fields by Elliot content install and

51
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,790
activate this plugin

52
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,270
on the menu.

53
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:53,110
You'll find a new item called custom fields.

54
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:58,260
Click on it and you'll see an overview of all the custom fields created with this plugin.

55
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,100
It's empty so let's add in two new fields.

56
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:06,640
Click on the ADD Field buttons and you'll be taken to this page where you can create some fields.

57
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:09,290
I'm going to call this group music options.

58
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:19,760
Then I'm going to add one field the first field will be called Release Date immediately after typing

59
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,030
this ECF will automatically generate the next field.

60
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,250
That's fine with me as that would be the name I would have used originally for the field type.

61
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,320
I'm going to set this to date picker.

62
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,170
The rest of the settings are fine as is.

63
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,200
That's about it.

64
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:40,850
I'm going to publish these changes you should receive a success message.

65
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,080
Let's try creating a new music post

66
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,720
all the way at the bottom.

67
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:52,300
You should see the field appearing.

68
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,770
The release date even has this fancy date picker.

69
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,720
I'm going to fill in some stuff here.

70
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,420
Make sure to publish your post.

71
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,360
After doing so

72
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,630
if you look at the post it'll look all right.

73
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:13,710
But we get this error and it's loading information and we're not interested in to fix this.

74
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:20,160
We're going to create a template specific to this post type create a file named single dash music dot

75
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:29,110
P. HP copy everything from the single template into this template I'm going to remove the comments and

76
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,460
related posts section

77
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:41,420
then I'm going to add some code right above the content of function

78
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:50,290
in order to get fields from the advanced custom fields you're provided a function called the field you

79
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:58,280
pass in the name of the field you'd like to grab I'm going to grab the release date refresh the page

80
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:02,390
after you've made these changes and you should see the template working accordingly.

81
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:08,270
This is the power of these two plugins they're really popular with over a million installations combined

82
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,240
so why don't I show you how to do all of this manually.

83
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:18,110
Well it's important to understand how WordPress works and how these plugins work behind the scenes.

84
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,530
These plugins are doing the exact same thing we did in the previous lectures.

85
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:27,930
They're calling the register a taxonomy function and using metadata just like we would.

86
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:33,110
The only difference is that these plugins take it a step further by semi automating the process for

87
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:33,610
you.

88
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,530
In my opinion these plugins are really great.

89
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:39,300
They make developing sites a whole lot faster.

90
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,650
I recommend you give them a try and learn more about them.

91
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:48,680
Of course they can't handle all situations for you but they should be able to solve most if not half

92
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,200
of your problems for you.

93
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:53,320
You're not limited to just using one or the other.

94
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:59,090
You can use these plugins to create post types taxonomy ease and custom fields for you then you can

95
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,760
add in your own code if you need more functionality.

96
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:06,790
You use the exact same functions as you would before without any worry or hassle.

97
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,050
This is the beauty of WordPress development even though every plugin does different things.

98
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:17,510
They all use the same API and functions as you would before I am this lecture.

99
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:21,890
There is one more resource I want to show you that will help me with some of the problems you'll face

100
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:26,140
in the field of WordPress development in the resource section of this lecture.

101
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:29,920
I provide a link to the Generate WP site.

102
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:35,390
This site will help generate code you need to create things like taxonomy as post types and so much

103
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,070
more.

104
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:38,160
Let's explore one of these tools.

105
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:41,640
I'm going to click on the post type generator page.

106
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:46,350
This generator will generate the exact code you need to create a post type.

107
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:50,000
You can even modify these settings with a user friendly interface.

108
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,720
I'm going to change the post type field to music then I'm going to click update Code.

109
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:00,620
The code will then refresh and you will now see our changes reflected on the code.

110
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:04,130
This tool is invaluable and is extremely flexible.

111
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:08,780
If you're not comfortable with using a plug in to generate your post types and would rather write your

112
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:13,010
own code than this tool and site will make that process easier.

113
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:15,130
I highly recommend you bookmark it.

114
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:19,400
It has several tools you can use related to WordPress development.

115
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:24,680
That's basically it in the next few lectures we'll be getting into some advanced topics so get ready

116
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,910
to do some more coding.
