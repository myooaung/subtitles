1
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:09,270
We're almost done right now.

2
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:10,720
I'm in the header file.

3
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:14,190
We still have some static sections inside the template.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,170
First let's tackle the title.

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:20,120
WordPress provides two solutions for adding titles to your head.

6
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:25,450
The first solution is a bit outdated and that is by using the WP title function.

7
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:30,320
This function is to be deprecated but it is still available for backwards compatibility.

8
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:35,500
I do not suggest using it the recommended solution is to add theme support for it.

9
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:41,050
I'm going to delete the title tags from the head tag and then open the setup file.

10
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:48,420
I'm going to call the function at theme support and pass entitled hash tag just like that.

11
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,140
WordPress will always generate the title tag for you.

12
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,700
Any SEO plugins will also be able to make modifications if they wish.

13
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,960
Next up is the logo itself.

14
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,150
The logo can either be text or an image.

15
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,230
Currently we only have text.

16
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,580
We are also willing to accept images.

17
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:14,740
I'm going to call the function app theme support again and pass in custom dash logo WordPress comes

18
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,950
with a feature for users to upload their own logos.

19
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,680
We don't have to make a form or handle the upload.

20
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:23,820
You'll see how this works in just a moment.

21
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:29,230
Go back to the header template and look for the div tag with the idea of Logo.

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:36,530
Inside this tag add a conditional statement to check if the user has uploaded a logo.

23
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:44,970
You have to use the function has custom logo this function will return true if the user uploaded a logo.

24
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,970
Otherwise it'll return False if there is a logo.

25
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:52,150
Then we can call a function called the custom logo.

26
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:56,040
This function will output the image along with the link to the home page.

27
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:01,990
In some situations the user might not have a logo ready when they set up the theme whatever their reason

28
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:02,620
may be.

29
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,230
You should have a backup.

30
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:08,090
Let's add the else block and manually create a link.

31
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:16,820
I'm going to use the static version as a template.

32
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:22,850
I'm going to replace the link and echo out the value returned by the function home yourself.

33
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:31,060
I'm going to pass in a forward slash so we can specify that we only want the route you are out inside

34
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:31,740
the tanks.

35
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:39,740
I'm going to call the blog info function This function takes in a string which is what pieces of information

36
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:43,850
about the blog we want in the resource section of this lecture.

37
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:46,670
I provide a link to more info about this function.

38
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,000
Here you'll find a list of values you can pass in the very first one.

39
00:02:51,020 --> 00:03:00,150
Its name which returns the name of the site so let's pass that in this function will automatically output

40
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:03,240
the value if you ever want the value returned.

41
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,450
Then you just use the get blog info function.

42
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,140
Let's refresh the page and check if everything is working so far.

43
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,650
If you look at the title you'll notice it updates accordingly.

44
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,220
The logo is also showing our text to change the logo to an image.

45
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,320
You need to click this button called customize.

46
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,850
This will take you to the customized which is a way to edit your site while also viewing the changes

47
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,660
in real time under a site identity.

48
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,580
You will find the form for updating the logo.

49
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,800
I don't have a logo image so I will leave this alone.

50
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:40,290
The next two things I want to do is update the menu and fix this advertising spot.

51
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:46,440
Before you do that I want to talk about this customization in the past the WordPress customized was

52
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,520
really hard to work with and did not have as much features.

53
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:54,920
This made developers make their own settings and options page to change how the theme functions.

54
00:03:54,930 --> 00:04:01,200
However in recent updates the Customize miser is starting to become the main way to modify a theme.

55
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,460
A lot of theme developers are opting to use the customize.

56
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:11,600
We will definitely be working with the Customize your suit for now let's focus on this secondary menu

57
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,600
on the top.

58
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,960
We've already created a menu before.

59
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:17,260
So try creating another one yourself.

60
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,160
If you aren't able to do it then let's try it together.

61
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:26,730
I'm not going to go over every detail so will fly by this quickly.

62
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,790
First in the setup function.

63
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:33,580
Use the registered nav menu function.

64
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:41,220
I'm going to reuse the previous code and replace these values with the words secondary like so with

65
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,330
the menu registered.

66
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,690
We can now display it.

67
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:49,380
I'm going to go into the admin dashboard and create a new menu and assign it to the secondary location

68
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:56,770
inside the header template.

69
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:08,210
I'm going to copy and paste the last menu into the other menu spot.

70
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:14,440
I'm going to replace these two values with the secondary menu and then set the depth to one since I

71
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,870
don't want drop downs for the secondary menu.

72
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:23,750
Refresh the page and you should now see the secondary menu being displayed.

73
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:27,200
So far everything is really coming together.

74
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:31,130
This ad spot has been broken for some time so let's fix that.

75
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:36,870
Previously we used the plug in WP subtitle to add subtitles to our posts.

76
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:43,250
We will be doing something similar to this and the resource section I provide a link to the WP quads

77
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,120
plugin.

78
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,720
This plugin handles advertisement for wordpress sites.

79
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,690
It's a really great plugin that is updated constantly.

80
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:56,870
The best part is that it's developer friendly we can create our own custom ad spots and have it managed

81
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,120
by this plugin.

82
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,750
This frees us from having to handle all the logic ourselves.

83
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:05,930
I want you to install and activate this plugin through the admin dashboard

84
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,770
after doing so.

85
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:16,770
Look inside the WP dash contents flash plugins folder.

86
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,480
This is where all your plugins are installed.

87
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:26,410
The quick dash adds sense dash reloaded plugin is the plugin we just installed open the includes slash

88
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:33,460
API dot HP file you'll notice in these comments the developer left notes on how to integrate this plugin

89
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,540
into your theme.

90
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:36,770
There are two steps you need to do.

91
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,310
The first step is to tell WP quads that you have a custom ad spot in your thing.

92
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:46,660
The second step would be to instruct it where to display the ad spot.

93
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,610
I'm going to register this ad spot in the setup function instead of the function's file.

94
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:57,310
The reason I'm doing this is because the setup function is called right after our theme has been loaded.

95
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:03,610
Therefore I know nothing has been officially processed unless it was put in the function file so it's

96
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:05,590
technically the same thing.

97
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:08,410
The only difference is that it's in separate files.

98
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:11,220
This makes our code look a whole lot cleaner.

99
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:18,890
I'm going to copy and paste the commented code into this function like so I'm only going to have one

100
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:19,610
spot.

101
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:22,470
You'll see that this code does two things.

102
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:28,610
First we use a conditional statement to check if the function quads register ad exists.

103
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:32,850
This way we know that the WP wants plugin is activated.

104
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,900
Then we call the function quads register ad which has two parameters.

105
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:40,800
The first is the idea of the location.

106
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:48,550
I'm going to call this Udemy header and for the description it will be Udemy header position with this

107
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:54,480
in place WP quads will now know we have an ad spot inside the admin dashboard.

108
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:59,380
You'll find the WP quads menu under the ad codes section.

109
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,300
I'm going to paste in an image tag

110
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:11,520
the image that I'm using is from a site called Place whole dot I.T..

111
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,630
I'll provide a link to this image.

112
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:19,190
This site allows you to modify the size of the image and create a temporary place holder.

113
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:26,550
This is really great for web development save the changes and then switch to the position tab.

114
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:30,270
You'll notice that our new position is showing up at the very bottom.

115
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,250
Activate this position and assign it to the first ad we created.

116
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:39,240
Make sure to save your changes our ad is ready.

117
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:45,770
And now all we have to do is display it inside the header template look for the div tag with the class

118
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:47,530
top dash advert.

119
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:51,140
Add a conditional statement that checks for the function quads at

120
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:02,460
then I'm going to call this function and pass in an array with the key location the name of the location

121
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:09,880
will be the location you pass into the quads register ad function this function will return the H.G.

122
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:11,760
mail we passed in previously.

123
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,720
So we have to echo it out that's it.

124
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:19,250
Let's check if our ad appears appropriately.

125
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:23,660
Just like that we now have ads on our site with custom locations.

126
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:27,310
This plugin is amazing and it takes care of managing ads.

127
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,460
This is the second plugin we've used in our theme.

128
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,640
It's extremely common for theme developers to bundle their themes with plugins.

129
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,390
This increases the value of your theme in a future lecture.

130
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:42,350
I will go over how you can bundle plugins with your theme properly.

131
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:47,630
The reason I'm not showing you now is because I don't want to have to constantly update multiple files

132
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,300
whenever we add a plugin.

133
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:53,440
I would rather knock it out all at once when our theme is nearly finished.

134
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:59,000
For now we will continue working on the header and eventually moved to the footer on the header.

135
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,330
We have these social icons for these icons.

136
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,640
We will be using the word press customized.

137
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:09,640
This will introduce us to how the it works and how to extend it.

138
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,570
I do want to give you a warning.

139
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:17,270
So far we've really just been calling functions and using Wordpress as templating system to handle a

140
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:23,510
lot of the logic for us WordPress will still help us with extending the customized R but we will be

141
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:29,090
writing a lot more code and be focusing more on the code rather than the visual aspect.

142
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:35,240
The customized can seem overwhelming but I promise you we will be using it constantly so you will get

143
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,910
used to it eventually.

144
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,630
I highly recommend you take a break before moving onto the next lecture.

145
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,240
See you there.
