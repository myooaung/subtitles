1
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,240
Now it's time to format the search form.

2
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:16,080
Unlike the other widgets WordPress makes it easy to apply styles and formatting to the search form.

3
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:22,740
You may be wondering why the search form is a more unique widget than the other default WordPress widgets.

4
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,440
The default WordPress widgets just provide links to other parts of your site.

5
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,620
However search forms are more complex and vary from site to site.

6
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:37,110
When it comes to design search forms can also appear in various parts of your site.

7
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,510
This makes it a reusable component.

8
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:46,200
With that said WordPress recognizes that the search form should be stylized by the theme and not WordPress

9
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,230
itself.

10
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:53,220
If you don't have any styles or formats available then WordPress automatically generates the HD UML

11
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,810
for the search widget.

12
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:59,170
So how does WordPress know if we have a search form template.

13
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,040
It's simple.

14
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:04,740
We just need to create a template called search form dot p p.

15
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,570
Let's create this file now.

16
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:15,990
Inside this template at the following each CML you can find the text inside these slash assets slash

17
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:24,600
extra slash search form dot t t file it will contain all the H2 UML and P HP code you'll need.

18
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,870
All right let's go over what's in this HCM L one by one.

19
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,440
The very first thing we do is generate a unique idea for the input fields.

20
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,180
This isn't required but it's good practice.

21
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:43,290
The unique ideas function helps us generate a unique idea we can pass in a string to pre pen to the

22
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:44,300
ideas.

23
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:50,670
Then we use the escape attribute function which will make sure the string is safe for use inside an

24
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:51,870
attribute.

25
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:56,530
WordPress provides a set of functions for making sure your data is safe for output.

26
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,910
One of these is called The Escape attribute function.

27
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:04,760
This will make sure the value can be used inside an H shemale attribute.

28
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,180
I'll talk more about the various sanitation functions in a future lecture.

29
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,040
For now let's keep moving forward.

30
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:16,970
Even though creating an I.D. isn't required I consider it an important step.

31
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,950
Templates are reusable.

32
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:22,340
The search form template is no exception to this.

33
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,810
This template can be used multiple times throughout any other template.

34
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:32,090
Since there is a possibility of having multiple search form templates then we want to make sure the

35
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,000
input has a unique I.D. each time.

36
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:38,730
This makes it easier to differentiate between forms.

37
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,320
Let's look at the rest of this HCM out.

38
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,930
First we need a form tag.

39
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:48,620
We must set the class method and action attributes.

40
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:52,550
The class should be set to search dash form.

41
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:57,620
This allows for any plugins to add any javascript into this form if needed.

42
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,950
You can also add additional classes if you want to.

43
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:07,110
The method should always be set to get as that's what's recommended by WordPress.

44
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,980
The action attributes should be the URL to the home page.

45
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,030
I'm introducing a new function here called home you are out.

46
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,680
This is a function provided by WordPress.

47
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,960
We simply pass in a forward slash to instruct it.

48
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,050
We just want the route home your URL.

49
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:30,230
We're also using the escape you URL function to make sure that the euro return is safe and is just that

50
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,750
you are out like the other functions.

51
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,400
This function is defined and provided by WordPress.

52
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,600
You do not need to do anything to make sure it's available to you.

53
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:43,580
Next we have to set up the input tag.

54
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:46,340
The name should always be s.

55
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,230
WordPress uses this name for something called the loop.

56
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:54,270
The loop is something we'll go over in a future lecture for now.

57
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:59,720
Just know you should always set the name attribute to s next.

58
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:04,600
The field's value will be set to the value returned by the search query function.

59
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:08,420
This function simply outputs the search query the user input it.

60
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:14,300
If there is no search query it will just output an empty string so you may be wondering where I'm getting

61
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,470
all this info.

62
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:21,710
Well there's a function called Get search form which will look for a file named search form dot p p

63
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,170
and then output it.

64
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,460
Otherwise this function will generate some default HDL for you.

65
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:31,960
This function is used from within the search widget in the resource section.

66
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,870
I provide a link to learn more about this function.

67
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:41,570
You'll notice that we're in the developer site of WordPress something I absolutely love about this site

68
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:46,940
of WordPress is that if you were just search for a function and scroll down you'll find a section called

69
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,120
Source.

70
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,520
This part of the page will actually show you the source code and WordPress.

71
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,310
Let's examine the source code.

72
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,960
A lot of this is mostly unimportant to us for the time being.

73
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:02,310
Further down you'll find a part of the code that generates a GM out.

74
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:08,920
There are two versions one version is for each team all five and another is for X each team out.

75
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:14,480
Currently our theme is meant for modern sites and so we're using the H GM L5 version.

76
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:21,660
What I did was started with this form as a base then I modified it a bit to match the design of my theme.

77
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:24,520
You are allowed to do the same if you wish.

78
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:31,130
There are only four important things we need to set and that is the method action the inputs name and

79
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,750
the current search value.

80
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:38,390
You do not need to have every class or HMO as the one word press generates.

81
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:42,420
The point of making your own template is to customize it to your needs.

82
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:48,420
Besides the four things I pointed out earlier everything else is completely up to you.

83
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,350
That's it.

84
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:53,770
Let's refresh the page and see if the form is formatted correctly.

85
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:57,450
This looks so much better because it fits with the rest of the theme.

86
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:04,040
We haven't created a search template yet so we can't actually see the results generated by the search.

87
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,610
We'll be doing that in a future lecture.

88
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:12,440
One last thing I want to note is that inside the form we're using a function called underscored E which

89
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,140
is similar to the double underscore function.

90
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:21,230
The difference between these two functions is that the underscore e function will echo out the translated

91
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,650
shrink rather than returning it.

92
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:27,300
That covers how to create a search form template.

93
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,340
Keep in mind that creating this template is completely optional.

94
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:34,990
You can just let WordPress handle it and that would be just fine.

95
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,190
All right I'll see you in the next lecture.
