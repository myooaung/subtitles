1
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,210
For this course we'll be using zap.

2
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:14,000
But I want you to be aware there are other environments such as map and wimp.

3
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:19,930
I don't like to use either because wimp doesn't come with the latest version of HP and map isn't completely

4
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:20,860
free.

5
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:25,120
I find zap easier to use and provides everything you need free of charge.

6
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:31,510
However WordPress will work on any of these without a problem with that being said I really recommend

7
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:36,480
you use zap along with me so you don't run into any problems with other platforms.

8
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:42,220
There is one additional option which is specifically made for wordpress in the resource section of this

9
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:42,910
lecture.

10
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:46,750
I provide a link to an environment called Local by flywheel.

11
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,150
This environment is specifically for wordpress sites.

12
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:54,030
It provides a lot of tools for helping you with WordPress development.

13
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,770
Currently it is completely free but there are plans to make a premium version.

14
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:04,480
There is something I do recommend you check out because it allows you to pick your PDP my Siebel and

15
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,010
WordPress versions on the fly.

16
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:11,410
However we won't be using it because it's a bit complex for our needs right now.

17
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,040
Later in this course we'll actually explore how to use this program.

18
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,120
Let's talk about tech senators now.

19
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:22,720
There are dozens of them out there but the one I prefer is Visual Studio code.

20
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,480
It's free and supports WordPress quite well.

21
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,180
It provides a lot of tools for debugging.

22
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:32,230
You're free to use any editor you like as long as you're comfortable with it.

23
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:37,720
I've had some students use Dreamweaver which is fine but you should be aware that Dreamweaver comes

24
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,160
with its own server.

25
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:44,740
Some students have had some difficulty setting up Dreamweaver server with Wordpress for that reason.

26
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,010
I don't recommend using Dreamweaver server.

27
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:53,920
You can still use Dreamweaver but you should probably stick to zap as a development environment since

28
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,200
all by using Visual Studio code.

29
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:00,260
I want to show you some features that I'll be using that you should be aware of.

30
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:04,240
You're not required to have these features but I use them frequently.

31
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,730
These features just make it easier to read and write code.

32
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:13,570
Visual Studio code does not add any features to WordPress or generate code that you can't generate.

33
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,180
You'll be fine with any HP editor.

34
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,280
I'm going to start up my editor.

35
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,260
I will open up a random file.

36
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,250
You do not need to do this yourself.

37
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,940
Just watch what I'm doing.

38
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:29,980
One of the features Visual Studio code comes with is called Code folding code folding allows you to

39
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,280
minimize certain sections of code.

40
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:37,930
This makes it easier to read and scroll up and down your code without having to temporarily delete or

41
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,280
move anything.

42
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,060
Let's look at how this works.

43
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:46,040
Code folding can only be applied to code that is nested inside a block.

44
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,640
This conditional statement has nested code.

45
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:54,400
If I want to minimize this then I would click on this minus button that is on the left by clicking this

46
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:54,960
button.

47
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:57,790
All code inside will be folded.

48
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:00,960
Visual Studio code does not delete or move anything.

49
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:04,910
It simply minimizes the code inside this block of code.

50
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:08,080
There are two things you'll also notice on the left.

51
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,220
I have my line numbers appearing.

52
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:15,820
You'll see that visual studio code accounts for this and we'll skip the line numbers inside the block

53
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,920
comment.

54
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:21,090
Another thing it will do is create this black square on the same line.

55
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,210
This indicates that there is more code that's being hidden.

56
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:29,380
If I wanted to view the code inside I would simply click on the button on the left again.

57
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:34,580
I'll be using this feature frequently to make it easier to read the code in larger files.

58
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:40,900
Another feature that comes with Visual Studio code is code hinting code hinting is not a feature exclusive

59
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,520
to visual studio code.

60
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:48,650
Code hinting we'll suggest code that you intend to write and we'll help you complete it for faster development.

61
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:55,420
For example if I were to begin writing the p p function include then my editor will suggest the function

62
00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:00,420
before I even finish writing it and will allow me to select it and autocomplete it for me.

63
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:04,180
This is a really great feature that is common among tech senators.

64
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:09,070
I'm going to remove this code as I don't want these changes applied to my files.

65
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:12,920
The last feature that I want to show you is the file search feature.

66
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:17,830
There are a ton of files that come with Wordpress searching for code can be tricky.

67
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:23,890
Luckily Visual Studio code allows you to search for code without having to know where to begin.

68
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:30,370
Let's say I wanted to know where the WP underscored dying function was defined on the left.

69
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,860
I'm going to click on the search icon.

70
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:36,030
This will open the search feature in Visual Studio.

71
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,670
Now I can search for anything I want.

72
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:44,310
I'm going to search for the following function WP underscore dot immediately.

73
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:49,690
Visual Studio code will return a list of results that match the text I inputting.

74
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:55,430
It it'll show the line where the text is used along with the name of the file and the line number.

75
00:04:55,690 --> 00:05:01,270
I'm going to double click on the first result the file selected will then be opened inside the main

76
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:06,040
Ed window and I'll be taken to the line where that piece of text was found.

77
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:11,690
This is a really great feature but can make it easy to find code that you have no idea where it is.

78
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:16,450
Throughout this course I rarely use this feature but I just wanted you to be aware of it.

79
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,380
It's not required that you have visual studio code.

80
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:27,480
As I said any HP editor will do a lot of these features just make it faster and easier to read code.

81
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:33,360
I just wanted to show you these features so that you could understand why my code looks the way it does.

82
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,060
All right that's it for now.

83
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,660
I'll see you in the next lecture.
