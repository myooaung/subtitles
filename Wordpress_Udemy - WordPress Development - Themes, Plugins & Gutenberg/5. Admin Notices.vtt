00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:13.060
WordPress provides a set of notices that we can use to display warnings or success messages.

2
00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.270
We could just use our own bootstrap classes but I don't want to use them.

3
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.990
This is because I plan on making the notices appear on most admin pages.

4
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.760
However I don't want to load bootstrap classes just to display messages.

5
00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.910
It's better to just use the word press stylings for this.

6
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.190
It's not hard to pull off.

7
00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.800
So let's get started.

8
00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.020
I want to display notices to the admin.

9
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.940
If there are more than five pending recipes inside the main plugin file.

10
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.410
Let's add the action hook.

11
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.580
Admin notices

12
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.670
this event will trigger when the admin notices begin loading.

13
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.620
So we want to load ours too.

14
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.590
The function will be called are admin notices

15
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.710
create a file inside the includes slash admin folder named notice stop page pete.

16
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.150
Define the function here and make sure to include it

17
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.210
inside this function.

18
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.320
We're going to output a div tag with the classes.

19
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:29.860
Notice notice dash warning is Dash dismissal.

20
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.520
I'm also going to give it the I.D. of our dash recipe dash pending Dash.

21
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.090
Notice

22
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.650
I'm going to insert a p tag for formatting reasons and inside it.

23
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.670
I'm going to output the message.

24
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.620
You have a couple of recipes waiting to be reviewed.

25
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:53.860
I'm also going to make this translatable.

26
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.950
This is the very basics of creating an admin notice.

27
00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.070
The only things worth highlighting is the class names.

28
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:06.850
The notice class is required to have WordPress format and space to notice for you the notice dash warning

29
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.730
class will determine the color of the class.

30
00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:14.770
There are four classes you can use to change the colors which are the notice dash info.

31
00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.430
Notice dash success.

32
00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.350
Notice dash warning and notice dash error classes.

33
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:21.100
And this example.

34
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.450
We're using the warning version which gives us the color yellow.

35
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.040
The last class is the is dash dismissive all class.

36
00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.790
This class will add a little close button to the far right which will allow the user to close this notice.

37
00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.210
Let's refresh the admin page and see if everything works.

38
00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:43.150
As you can see the notice is now displaying the only problem is that this notice is displaying on every

39
00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.500
page load.

40
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.600
Even if we were to click on the close button it'll only disappear on that current page load.

41
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.050
If we refresh the page again you'll see it reappears.

42
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.100
WordPress doesn't take care of managing notices for you.

43
00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.600
It all has to be done manually by you.

44
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.920
Luckily the process is very simple.

45
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.740
I'm going to create an option that will determine whether or not to display the notice.

46
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.100
The best place to put this is INSIDE THE submit dash.

47
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.970
User dash recipe dot P HP file.

48
00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.640
I only want this code to apply to this file because all posts submitted on the front end are automatically

49
00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.140
set to pending.

50
00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.080
Open this file and right before we output the response we're going to place the code here.

51
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.630
I'm going to add a comment so that it can be easier to read this file

52
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.540
right before we define the variables.

53
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:42.970
I'm going to include the WP DB variable so that we can make a query to grab how many posts are pending

54
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.190
then backup this spot.

55
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.270
I'm going to create a variable named pending recipe count.

56
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.040
I'm going to set this to the value returned by the method.

57
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.320
Get var of the WP DV object.

58
00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.660
Here is the query I'm going to make.

59
00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:07.400
Select count from WP DV posts where posts underscore status equals pending and post underscore type

60
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:08.270
equals recipe

61
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.880
this query is very straightforward.

62
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.950
I'm counting how many posts are inside the post state based table.

63
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.180
I'm filtering the results to only include the posts that are pending approval and that the post type

64
00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.710
is recipe.

65
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.780
After this I'm going to create a conditional statement that will check if the number is greater than

66
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.040
or equal to 5

67
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.410
if this returns true.

68
00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.660
Then I'm going to call the update option function.

69
00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.350
This function will automatically create the option if it doesn't exist.

70
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.920
So that's why we're using the update version instead of using the ad version.

71
00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.780
The option I want to add will be called our pending recipe notice.

72
00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:04.380
The value will be 1 1 will mean there are recipes pending and 0 will mean there are no recipes pending

73
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:05.670
just like that.

74
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.100
We've added an option only if there are currently more than five recipes pending approval.

75
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.960
The next step is to update the notice function to check for this value.

76
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.390
I'm going to add a conditional statement.

77
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:27.650
I'm simply going to check the value returned by the get option function.

78
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.760
We just pass it in the option we created earlier.

79
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.230
I'm going to check if this returns false.

80
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.840
If it does then we'll just return the function and preventing the notice from displaying

81
00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.710
the very last step to all of this is to remove the notice.

82
00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.200
If the user clicks on the closed button.

83
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.180
If we don't then a notice will appear permanently which we don't want.

84
00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:57.150
We'll need the help of javascript to accomplish this inside the assets slash J.S. folder open the admin

85
00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.270
dash global dot J.S. file.

86
00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:05.190
I've already provided the code for you to speed things up as the name suggests this file will be loaded

87
00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:06.780
on every admin page.

88
00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:12.300
This file should only have code that you'd want to load on every avenue page you don't want to bloat

89
00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.550
a user's admin dashboard.

90
00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.980
All I'm doing here is listening for a click on the dismiss button.

91
00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.090
If it's clicked then I'll make an action request.

92
00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:25.990
I won't be sending data besides the action name since this will be a pretty simple function.

93
00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:32.230
The name of the action is are dismissed pending recipe notice inside the main plugin file.

94
00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:35.430
Add this hook the name of the function will be the same name

95
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:49.550
then create a file inside the process folder called remove dash notice dot p p and define the function

96
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:50.280
here.

97
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.120
Make sure to be included as well.

98
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.700
All we will do is update the option R pending recipe.

99
00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:04.440
Notice 2 0.

100
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:05.330
That should do it.

101
00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:07.730
Let's test to see if everything works.

102
00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:12.950
I'm going to submit a little over five recipes from the front end publisher all right.

103
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:15.830
As you can see I have five pending recipes.

104
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:18.480
If you look at the top you'll see the notice appearing.

105
00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:24.590
I'm going to remove this notice and it should disappear if I refresh the page then it should still be

106
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:25.190
gone.

107
00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:29.000
Just like that you've added a nice little notice on the admin dashboard.
