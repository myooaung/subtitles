00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:10,610
The next set of tanks we'll talk about our link tanks.

2
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:14,800
These are tanks that return or output links to different pages of your site.

3
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:19,630
You can use these functions to generate links to a specific post or the home page.

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,680
Here's a list of functions that take care of generating those you or else a lot of these are pretty

5
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,310
straightforward.

6
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,760
So I won't be talking about most of them.

7
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:35,580
I just want to focus our attention on the Get search link and these search query functions.

8
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:41,580
Right now I'm inside my editor and I have the search template open up I'm going to scroll down to the

9
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,730
search box section and add my code here.

10
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:51,480
So one of the more interesting functions is the get search link function as its name suggests this will

11
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,020
return a you URL to the search page.

12
00:00:54,060 --> 00:01:01,450
I'm going to echo this function out this function has an optional parameter which will add a search

13
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:02,530
term to the URL.

14
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:07,240
I'm going to pass in the text Hello immediately right after this.

15
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:14,600
I'm going to echo a brake tag and call the function the search query that should do it.

16
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,110
Let's switch to the browser and try searching for something.

17
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:22,200
After a quick search the search template will load in our results.

18
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:26,490
Let's shift our focus to the text output it above the search box.

19
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:27,890
Two things are output it.

20
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:32,090
First is the euro generated by the get search link function.

21
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:36,800
You'll notice that the euro generated is different than the euro up in the address bar.

22
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,890
There are two ways to load the search template.

23
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:46,910
You can add the s query to the U.R.L. or you can access the slash search page followed by the phrase

24
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:48,170
like here.

25
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:51,640
I'm going to copy this your URL and paste it into the address bar.

26
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:54,730
We shouldn't see the search template load again.

27
00:01:54,770 --> 00:02:00,800
You'll also notice the value from these search query function also changes the value in the euro is

28
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,460
the value output from this function.

29
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:06,160
I'm going to comment out the code we added in the template.

30
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,960
That's basically it when it comes to link tags.

31
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:14,020
They output your Ls and they're mostly straightforward.

32
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:19,680
I only showed the search functions because I wanted to demonstrate the various ways to access the search

33
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,580
template.

34
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,580
I also wanted you to understand why WordPress generated that you URL.
