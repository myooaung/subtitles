1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,890
Comments deserve a lecture of their own.

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:15,150
We'll be taking a look at how to make a template for comments and how to submit a comment.

3
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,240
I'm still working inside the single template file.

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,290
Scroll down into you find a section called comments right before this.

5
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,570
We're going to call the function comments template

6
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:34,030
this function will look for a template file called Common Stock P HP and load it let's create that file

7
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:34,570
now.

8
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:38,890
I'm going to move the comments from the single template into the comments template

9
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,030
back inside the single template.

10
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:56,140
I'm going to wrap the comments template function with a conditional statement I want to check for two

11
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:56,840
things.

12
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:04,180
The first thing I want to check is to see if the comments are open using the comments open function.

13
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:09,560
The second thing I want to check is if there are already comments for this post using the get comments.

14
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:16,160
No function if there are already comments then will want to display those.

15
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:20,760
Even if the comments section is close let's go back to the comments template.

16
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:25,460
I'm going to set up a conditional statement and call the function post password required

17
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:35,170
this function will check to see if this post requires a password value before viewing it and if the

18
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:41,740
current visitor has not input it that password if this returns true then we shouldn't display anything

19
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,620
to the user.

20
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:49,030
In this case I'll just add a return statement like so you may be wondering will this really stop the

21
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,760
rest of the file from returning.

22
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:53,700
Wouldn't using the exit or die function be better.

23
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:59,710
Well keep in mind that we're calling this temple of file using the comments template function.

24
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:06,370
This function includes this file and so we can use the return statement to end this function early.

25
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:12,520
You'll also notice that I'm not even using the post password required function inside the single template.

26
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,800
In a way it would make sense to block the rest of the post from displaying but we don't have to do that

27
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:20,810
because WordPress already does that for us.

28
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:26,290
The only reason I'm using this function inside the comments template is because the comments template

29
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:28,490
can be used anywhere in our theme.

30
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:34,820
Comments are used everywhere in wordpress so we want to take into account of those situations as well.

31
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:39,810
Assuming everything is good so far we can begin displaying the comments and form.

32
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,740
I'm going to start with the form.

33
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,850
Scroll down to the section that says comment form.

34
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:50,940
I'm going to place this code directly inside the div tag with the I.D. of response.

35
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:56,170
There is a function variable that will help with generating the form which is the comment form function

36
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:03,920
this function has two parameters which are both completely optional in the resource section of this

37
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,760
lecture I provide a link to this function.

38
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,830
Let's look at the developer page for a second.

39
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:15,170
As you can see like most WordPress functions this function is heavily documented.

40
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:19,870
This function will generate a form where a user can submit a comment for a post.

41
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,460
You are allowed to create your own form but this function is plug all.

42
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,690
This is a new phrase we're learning here.

43
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:32,540
Anything in WordPress that it's plausible simply means that plugins are allowed to extend the functionality

44
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,150
of that bit of code.

45
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:40,370
Developers are allowed to add in their own fields or change the way it looks with plugins so it's always

46
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:44,620
best to use this function rather than creating a form manually.

47
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,060
There are a lot of options we can set here.

48
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:53,180
We won't be defining all parameters if we were to leave this function as is and do the page then you'll

49
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:56,510
notice that the form doesn't match the one in our template.

50
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,180
This can be fixed easily.

51
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:05,450
Inside the comment form function I want you to input and array this array can have a multitude of values

52
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:10,130
and keys but will only be setting a few which are mostly aesthetics.

53
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:12,240
The first key is the comment field.

54
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,300
Keep this.

55
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:20,000
Value will be the actual input field for the comment body from the template.

56
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:32,200
I'm going to cut and paste the HP AML for the comment body into this Key's value like so.

57
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,520
Next up is the rest of the fields.

58
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:42,260
The other fields are defined using the fields key this keys value will be an array of all the fields

59
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,020
available in the comments form.

60
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:51,080
There are three which are the author email and you are about all you really need to do is set each of

61
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,290
these keys values to the corresponding H UML in the static template.

62
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,830
I'm going to post this video and do this really quick.

63
00:04:59,430 --> 00:04:59,950
All right.

64
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,560
I'm back.

65
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:06,110
And as you can see I cut and pasted the HDL into each corresponding key.

66
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:08,300
There are two things I want you to notice.

67
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:14,800
The first is that for each label I actually made the text translatable which is completely optional

68
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,620
but always good practice.

69
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:21,260
The second is that you should take careful notice of the name of each field.

70
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,740
It's important that you assign each of these fields these specific names.

71
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:31,480
This is because we won't be processing the comments WordPress already takes care of processing and saving

72
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,340
comments.

73
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,940
WordPress expects these names for each field.

74
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:37,080
We're almost done.

75
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:43,390
There are three more keys to set which are the class submit label submit and title will apply keys

76
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:56,740
the class submit keys value should be the C assessed classes the submit button uses in the HDMI document.

77
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:05,010
I'm going to simply cut and paste like so the labels submit will be a translatable string but says submit

78
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:05,520
comment

79
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:23,510
the title reply Key's value will be leave a span comment span but is also translatable.

80
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,580
That should do it.

81
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:30,870
If you haven't already delete the static comment form then refresh the page and you should see something

82
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,630
similar to what I see.

83
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:37,810
This may seem like a lot of work but WordPress handles a lot for us behind the scenes.

84
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,570
This function does a lot more than output a form.

85
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:48,380
Let me go over what goes on first WordPress checks to see if the user is logged in and can submit comments.

86
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,810
It will also check if comments are open for submission.

87
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:55,170
It will also take care of submitting the correct post information.

88
00:06:55,170 --> 00:07:02,450
This comment belongs to try submitting a common if you like something I should also note is that the

89
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:05,160
form may be different if you are not logged in.

90
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,940
I want you to log out of WordPress and check before

91
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:17,260
as you can see WordPress displays these extra fields for logged out users.

92
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,420
I'm going to log back in and then go back to the comments

93
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,700
if you wanted to.

94
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,230
You could have just written this logic yourself but that's over complicating things.

95
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:35,270
Using this function is much more simpler cleaner and efficient.

96
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:40,700
If you wish to customize this form further then I highly recommend you read up on the documentation

97
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,020
to do so.

98
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:48,530
Now it's time to display the comments scroll all the way up to the comments list section inside the

99
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,880
ordered list tag.

100
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:57,600
I want you to delete all of the comments except one we will be using the single comment as a reference

101
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,410
then set up a for each loop.

102
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:05,380
WordPress puts all the post comments in a handy little variable called comments.

103
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:11,970
We're going to look through each element in this array and refer to it as comment.

104
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:16,400
You don't have to worry about tying us all together as WordPress does it for you.

105
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:20,450
It will automatically create the comments variable for you.

106
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,080
I'm going to cut and paste that single comment into this loop like so

107
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:37,830
just like the loop before all we have to do is simply replace the static content with template tags.

108
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:45,160
The first template tag for comments is the get Avatar function inside the div tag with the class comment

109
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:45,580
dash.

110
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:49,660
Author replace the image tag and echo out the get avatar.

111
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:55,990
Function this function in general gets the avatar of a user.

112
00:08:55,990 --> 00:09:02,650
Usually we can leave this function like so however we're using it inside a loop that's inside of a loop.

113
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,960
This makes things confusing for this function.

114
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:08,380
So we have to pass in the comments object itself

115
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:16,650
WordPress we'll be able to scan this object for the ideas of the user to get the correct avatar.

116
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:22,250
The second parameter would be the size for this template the size 60 is perfect.

117
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:25,010
The third parameter is the default image you are out.

118
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:28,920
If the user doesn't have one I'm going to pass in an empty string.

119
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,570
This will tell WordPress to handle the default image you are out.

120
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:38,640
I'm also going to pass in an empty string for the fourth parameter the value for this must be the text

121
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,760
to display inside the old attribute.

122
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,140
I don't want to display anything in the alter text so I'll leave this empty.

123
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,260
The fifth parameter is an array of additional settings.

124
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:54,090
I'm going to pass that in and set the class keep the value of this should be.

125
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:57,020
The class is inside the image tag below

126
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,460
scrolling down.

127
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:07,300
You'll find a div tag with the class comment author.

128
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,580
I'm going to replace the static author's name with the function comment.

129
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:18,510
Author unlike the previous function comments specific functions will only grab its values from the current

130
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,020
comment in the loop.

131
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,720
This function will output the name of the author of this comment.

132
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:29,520
The next one is the comments date function which returns a formatted date when the comment was made.

133
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:36,600
Lastly we use the function comments text to return the text made by the user.

134
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:44,450
Nothing much too and honestly if we refresh the page then you'll see the comment we made previously

135
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,280
appear.

136
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:48,930
The very last thing we need to do is add comments patch nation.

137
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:53,420
You simply call the comments Padgett nation function right after the loop

138
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,260
this next step is completely optional.

139
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:06,440
I don't want to display this part of the template unless there are comments I'm going to wrap this bit

140
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:19,830
of code inside a conditional statement.

141
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:27,110
I'm going to use the have comments function to check to see if there are any comments.

142
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:32,810
I'm also going to display the number of comments inside this H 3 tag using the comments.

143
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,130
No function.

144
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:36,850
Make sure you remove the comments text as well.

145
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,060
That's it for the comments template.

146
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:46,940
You may be wondering but what about spam protection actually spam protection is something we can leave

147
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,800
to plugin developers.

148
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:54,050
There are dozens of plugins available to block spam and so we won't bother adding a built in system

149
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:55,040
ourselves.

150
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,990
It would be a bit overkill.

151
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:00,590
