00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.070
World commerce is the best e-commerce WordPress plugin around.

2
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.240
It can be intimidating at first for developers but it's one of the easiest plugins to work with.

3
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:22.720
Unlike other plugins WordPress is well documented and coded unlike buddy press we can find a lot of

4
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.090
the answers to our questions online.

5
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.390
If your theme supports Web commerce then you would be adding a whole lot of value to your theme.

6
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.810
It's almost a standard today to support commerce and to come bundled with it.

7
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.420
If you're not familiar with e-commerce then let's take a quick tour.

8
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.520
Wu commerce allows you to convert your site into a store to sell physical and or digital products.

9
00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.940
It has over 21 million downloads and powers over 28 percent of all stores.

10
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.100
You'll even find a list of partners and supporters of Wu commerce.

11
00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:00.370
This is one of the reasons why Wu commerce is well documented and supported a lot of companies and individuals

12
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:06.100
rely on this software to work with so many people relying on such a software for generating revenue.

13
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.420
You can imagine the amount of work needed to extend it.

14
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.160
This course isn't about teaching you how to use Wu commerce.

15
00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.800
There are a lot of courses out there that teach you that what you'll be learning here is how to use

16
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.530
it in theme and plugin development.

17
00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.400
Let's get started.

18
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.190
The very first step is to install an activated.

19
00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:30.610
Go to the admin dashboard and navigate to plugins add new search for the plugin will commerce install

20
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:31.460
and activate it

21
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.870
this plugin is very big so it might take some time to install it.

22
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.720
Currently this plugin is on Version 3 which is very new and has a lot of breaking changes but all the

23
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:58.090
code we write will be compatible with this version after activation you'll be taken to a set of wizard.

24
00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.950
I want you to go through it with all the default settings.

25
00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.150
I didn't really bother going through the settings as I just use the defaults.

26
00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.820
Nothing special after going through the wizard.

27
00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.680
Commerce will also generate some pages.

28
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.100
This is very important.

29
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.750
Just like Buddy press will commerce needs to generate some pages to display the content it generates

30
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:26.320
and manages for you so be sure to generate all the pages it needs or else this won't work for things

31
00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.530
like the payment gateway.

32
00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.350
I'm going to use paypal.

33
00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.110
It doesn't really matter at this point.

34
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.860
You can always configure this later to your preferred payment method.

35
00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.840
After going through the walkthrough you can begin with preparing our theme for compatibility with commerce.

36
00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.850
You'll notice we have a couple of messages here warning us about extra steps we need to take before

37
00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.080
we can fully use will commerce.

38
00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.380
You may end up getting a message telling you that the current theme does not declare war.

39
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.050
Commerce support you may even be recommended a theme since we're developing our own theme.

40
00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.060
We won't take interest in the theme.

41
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.480
It should be noted that most themes are compatible with commerce by default.

42
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.610
Keep in mind that world commerce is a WordPress plugin and uses the same functions and hooks as any

43
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:10.680
other plugin.

44
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:17.200
So even if we don't make any changes to our theme we'll commerce will work as usual if we want to override

45
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.990
some of Commerce's behavior.

46
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.310
Then we'll need to declare support for it.

47
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.860
That's simple to do.

48
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:29.020
All we have to do is call the ad theme support function inside the after setup theme hook.

49
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.660
Let's do that now open the setup file and call that function right after the other support functions

50
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:43.120
pass and woo commerce all this does is tell you commerce that this theme fully supports its features

51
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.160
and design after routing it.

52
00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.050
We can now begin with development to make things easier.

53
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:55.920
I'm going to modify the menu to include the cart checkout and shop pages that Woo commerce generated.

54
00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.300
Make sure to save the menu.

55
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.500
The very last thing I want to do is import some dummy data.

56
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.720
Luckily for us we'll commerce already provides us with some dummy data we can use to test our theme

57
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:20.040
with commerce go through tools import that will commerce plug and provides to importers one for products

58
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.390
and one for rates.

59
00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.930
We won't be dealing with taxes in this course.

60
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.460
We only need to import some products run the Wu commerce product importer.

61
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.310
From here you can import a CSB file with your products.

62
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:40.380
You'll be asked to upload a file go to the Wu commerce plugin folder inside you'll find a folder called

63
00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:48.910
sample data this will contain quite a few files but we're only interested in the sample underscore products

64
00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:56.570
dot CSC file upload this file after uploading it you'll be asked to map the values mapping is the process

65
00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:02.300
of making sure the values inside the file are correctly inputted into the correct database columns.

66
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:07.850
If the file that's exported uses the same version as the Commerce version the file is being imported

67
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.650
in then you won't have to worry about mapping the value should match up fine.

68
00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.450
This is usually for product files that were exported with earlier versions of commerce.

69
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:23.210
The mapping may not correctly match with the current database design since we're using a sample product

70
00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:24.680
file from New Commerce.

71
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.710
We don't have to worry about this since it's maintained by the Commerce team.

72
00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:32.650
They'll usually make sure the file matches the current Commerce version.

73
00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.550
We'll just leave everything as is and continue.

74
00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:36.740
This may take a while.

75
00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:46.010
Just be patient.

76
00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.120
You should see a success message and be taken to the list of products.

77
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.770
If not then you can click on the products menu on the sidebar.

78
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.850
We now have a couple of dummy products imported which is nice.

79
00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.520
With that finished let's take a look at what we have.

80
00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.440
Go to the front end of the site and view the shop page you'll see some products imported.

81
00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.920
Which is what we want.

82
00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:11.530
You'll notice that the page really isn't that well spaced and our footer is broken.

83
00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.390
This is because of the CSX.

84
00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:18.010
It makes the product page for width which pushes the sidebar to the footer.

85
00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:21.280
This only happens on the shop and single product pages.

86
00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.300
If you were to view the checkout and cart pages you'll notice everything looks fine.

87
00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:27.370
So what is going on here.

88
00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:30.830
Well let's take a look at the cart page and try editing it.

89
00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:36.650
You'll notice that this is just normal page with a short code inserted that displays the carts contents.

90
00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.640
You can modify this page anywhere you like.

91
00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.610
I'm going to make it full width and press update.

92
00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.070
I'm going to do the same for the checkout page

93
00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:52.120
these two pages can be fully controlled like this.

94
00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:58.030
However if you were to edit the shop page you'll notice you can't edit the page the same way as before.

95
00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:05.250
There is no short code the reason for this is because the shop page generates more dynamic content than

96
00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:06.340
the other pages.

97
00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:10.530
Because of this it needs more flexibility than a simple short code.

98
00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:14.640
This is why we get different markup than the other pages in the next lecture.

99
00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:18.090
We'll tackle this problem and make everything fit well with our theme.
