A lot of languages in the world are written from left to right.

2
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:15,950
English French and German are just some examples of languages that are read and written from left to

3
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:16,780
right.

4
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:21,410
There are languages out there that read left to right or RTL like Arabic.

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:26,420
In these cases having your theme support these languages can increase your reach in sales.

6
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:33,260
Unfortunately there is a problem which is most of our content by default is L2 ja meaning left to right

7
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:41,130
actually developing a theme or plug in for RTL sites requires that you set up a wordpress RTL installation.

8
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:42,650
This would take too much time.

9
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:48,680
Luckily there is a plugin that someone developed that will help us test our site with RTL content.

10
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:56,060
Go to the admin dashboard and navigate to plugins add new search for the plugin called RTL tester install

11
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:56,810
and activated

12
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:10,040
this plugin will add a new menu item on a now bar that will let you switch from L2 ya to RTL switch

13
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,810
your site to RTL.

14
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,220
You'll notice things don't really change.

15
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,770
That's because we need to prepare the CSX that will move things from right to left.

16
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:23,920
This isn't a CSX course so I won't be going over how the CSX works.

17
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:31,010
Be aware that to make a site RTL you have to add CSX code that makes it appear RTL I've already created

18
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:34,540
the CSX files that changed things to load these files.

19
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:42,380
We have to register and cue them open the includes slash front slash and cued up HP file to save some

20
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,010
time.

21
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,820
I'm just going to paste the register styles functions

22
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,830
all these styles will make the necessary CSF changes required to make the site and content Artie already.

23
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:58,210
However I don't want to include these files right away.

24
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:03,240
I want to check to see if the site is an RTL mode inside a conditional statement.

25
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:12,270
Call the function is RTL if this function returns true then that means the site is an RTL mode.

26
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:17,580
If it is an RTL mode then I'm going to queue all the styles we just registered like so

27
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:27,400
now that we're loading the RC l styles.

28
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,660
Let's test it out.

29
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,550
Go ahead and refresh the page.

30
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,420
The content should now be reading from right to left.

31
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:39,430
Switch back to L2 ja to test if the site returns to normal after confirming the changes you should be

32
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:47,200
finished adding RTL support is as easy as including the C Ss files needed to make a site RTL you don't

33
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,830
have to use any special P2P functions or change the core.
