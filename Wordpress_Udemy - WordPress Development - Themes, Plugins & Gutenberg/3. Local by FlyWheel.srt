1
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,630
In the beginning we talked about the options available for running WordPress at this point.

2
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,890
You should feel confident with Wordpress.

3
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,840
Now I want to talk about an alternative environment called Local by flywheel.

4
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,730
Local is a wordpress specific environment.

5
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,670
It provides a lot of tools specifically for WordPress development.

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,820
If you scroll down a bit you'll see some of the few features it has to offer.

7
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,910
I want you to download this program.

8
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,680
It's absolutely free.

9
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,630
There's also a premium version but you most likely won't need that unless you're on a team.

10
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:45,300
The file size will be quite large so pause the video while it's downloading.

11
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:50,770
Let's go through the installation together local will tell you that it needs to install and configure

12
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:52,900
a couple of things before you can run it.

13
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:58,120
What local does is create a virtual machine for you when creating environments.

14
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,010
You have two solutions.

15
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:05,170
You can download a program bundle or like Zam to automate a lot of the process for you.

16
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:11,380
Alternatively you can set up a virtual machine a virtual machine is a way to create an environment with

17
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:16,830
its own file system operating system and settings independent from your current machine.

18
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:23,070
The problem with a program bundler is that they don't accurately represent a real life production server.

19
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:28,230
The problem with the virtual machine is that there's a bit of a learning curve to using them.

20
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,000
This is where local solves these two problems.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,260
It combines the friendly user experience of using a program bundler and features of a virtual box.

22
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,940
So with that being said let's get started.

23
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:45,610
During this process you'll get asked to approve certain permissions just allow local to do its thing

24
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,260
once installed you should see something similar to what I see.

25
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,180
Nothing drastic changes.

26
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:56,950
Unlike last time you don't have to download and install Wordpress.

27
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,560
Local will take care of that for you.

28
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,310
Let's create a new site.

29
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,500
You'll be asked to input a name.

30
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,400
I'm going to keep it simple and name it.

31
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:08,570
WP You can name it whatever you want.

32
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:11,590
You'll then be asked about your environment settings.

33
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:14,420
This right here is what I love about local.

34
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:18,600
You can create various signs and each site can have its own environment.

35
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,300
You can have one environment with Page 5 and another with Page 7.

36
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:30,110
You can also choose to use energy ion ex or Apache the combinations are endless and local always keeps

37
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,900
up to date with the latest changes in software.

38
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,360
I'm just going to go with the default settings.

39
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,450
You'll be asked about a couple more things.

40
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,390
Just keep going with the default.

41
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,400
Once you go through the setup local will begin installing everything.

42
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,100
This is something you should be aware of.

43
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:50,230
Local tends to take up a lot of space on your drive so make sure you have enough room.

44
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:55,220
The reason for this is because it generates a unique environment for each site you create.

45
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,850
This may take a while for some of you.

46
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,570
All right.

47
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:04,300
So the setup is finally finished and we can begin using our site from the beginning.

48
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,620
Local will boot up the server for you.

49
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:11,600
You'll see all the settings displayed here and you even have the option of changing your server settings

50
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,490
just in case you aren't happy with what you have.

51
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:18,830
To view your site simply click the View site button just like that.

52
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,530
We now have a wordpress site.

53
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,970
One thing you'll notice is the U.R.L. unlike last time.

54
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:26,650
We now have a unique domain for our site.

55
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:32,240
This is great as we don't have to worry about accessing our site from a nested folder structure.

56
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:37,970
If I go back to my control panel you'll see we have a tab for the database right below you'll see all

57
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:41,830
the database connection details so you can input those into Heidi yes.

58
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:47,840
Q Well to manage your database alternatively you can click the admin or button and that will open a

59
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,630
database management script in your browser.

60
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,850
I honestly think this looks bad.

61
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,470
I always prefer to use Heidi.

62
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:54,740
Yes.

63
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,280
Well in the end it's up to you.

64
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:03,620
Back in the control panel you can even enable SSL which is very useful when working with sensitive data.

65
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:09,800
SSL is always required when working with payment processors such as PayPal or stripe in the next tab

66
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,160
over.

67
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,890
You also have the option of using mail hog.

68
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,240
Let's put this up.

69
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:19,410
Mail Hong is a program that allows you to send and receive emails on your local machine.

70
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:22,570
This is automatically setup for you by local.

71
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:28,100
The last feature we have is the ability to make our site go live when you're working on a project and

72
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,500
want to show your client what you have so far.

73
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,070
Then you can just go line.

74
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:37,550
After a while the your real street appear and you can provide this link to other users to check out

75
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,960
your WordPress site.

76
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,400
Already you can see the power of local.

77
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:47,330
I highly recommend you play around with it and use it as your development environment for future projects.

78
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:51,500
I didn't show you earlier in the course because I thought it would be too overwhelming.

79
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:57,050
However at this point you should be able to understand what's going on here to find where the files

80
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:57,890
are located.

81
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:00,410
You can just click on this little icon here.

82
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:04,080
It's very subtle but this should open the file explorer for you.

83
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,430
You will automatically be pointing to your WordPress server.

84
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:10,460
Notice how I say server and not site.

85
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:15,950
Not only will you have WordPress installed but you will also find the configuration files for your server

86
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,800
here to find the wordpress installation.

87
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,350
You just navigate into app public.

88
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:26,160
The other files are just as worth exploring though so let's check those out.

89
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,380
You'll find another directory called logs in the logs folder.

90
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:33,990
You'll find all the information output from each program.

91
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:38,210
Usually these would be error logs that can help you debug your site.

92
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:39,320
So that's about it.

93
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:43,280
When it comes to local a lot of great features in a single program.

94
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,260
Once you're finished working on your site you can just click on the stop site button and that will turn

95
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:53,930
off your server if you want to make sites then you can just click this plus icon on the bottom left

96
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:54,690
corner.

97
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,510
Anyway that's it for now.

98
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,160
I'll see you in the next lecture.
