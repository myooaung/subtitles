In the past two sections we've been working on creating a single plug in and theme.

2
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:18,390
We've covered a variety of topics at this point you're more than ready to start developing your own

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,900
plugins and themes in this bonus section of the course.

4
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:27,270
We're going to explore some advanced topics a lot of these topics are useful when you're developing

5
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:33,090
a large plug in our theme what you'll learn here will help you manage large amounts of code and projects

6
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,010
a lot of this is experimental and so you should approach this section with care.

7
