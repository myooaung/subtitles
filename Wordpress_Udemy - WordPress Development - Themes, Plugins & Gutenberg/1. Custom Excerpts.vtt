In this section we'll be cleaning up our theme even further.

2
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.550
I just want to adjust a couple of things and prepare everything for production that includes translations

3
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:22.490
bundling plugins etc. Of course we'll have to learn how to battle test our theme and plug it in which

4
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.280
is what we'll tackle in this section as well.

5
00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.360
Let's begin.

6
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.840
If you take a look at the home page you'll find all the posts we've created this far.

7
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.730
However each post excerpt has these dots right after it.

8
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.710
Each of these are called an ellipsis.

9
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.630
And while they may seem great I personally don't like them inside the function's file.

10
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.810
We're going to add the filter hook called excerpt more

11
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.770
this hook will pass and the ellipses for filtering however we want to get rid of these dots.

12
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.150
There's a handy utility function that WordPress provides to return nothing.

13
00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.070
Instead of defining our own function that will return nothing.

14
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.880
I'm going to pass in the function underscore underscore return underscore false.

15
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.380
This is a wordpress function that does exactly as it's named.

16
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.370
It will return false.

17
00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.040
Open the WP dash includes slash function dot page for you file and search for this function

18
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.460
here's what WordPress sets.

19
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.610
Useful for returning false to filters easily.

20
00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.070
If you scroll above there is even a function for returning true which is also useful if you ever need

21
00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.630
it.

22
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.750
I encourage you to explore these functions if you ever need to use them in your own code.

23
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.910
Let's refresh the page and see if the dots are gone all right.

24
00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.750
That's it for the excerpt in the next few lectures.

25
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.650
We'll continue with working on our theme.
