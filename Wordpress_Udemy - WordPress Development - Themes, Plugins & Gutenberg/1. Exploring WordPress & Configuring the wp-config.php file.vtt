00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:14.890
WordPress comes bundled with various files but the most important file is the wp config top HP file.

2
00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:18.500
At the heart of every WordPress site is the configuration file.

3
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.060
Let's open the wp config DOP HP file.

4
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.260
It can be found in the root directory of your wordpress installation.

5
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:33.070
This file basically contains all your core settings such as the database log and details security hashes

6
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:41.060
salts etc. in the resource section I provide a link to the WP config Codex documentation page.

7
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.920
This page contains all the information that you'll need to know to make changes to the config file.

8
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.810
Unlike other core files you're allowed to edit this file without much consequence when word presses

9
00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:53.950
is updated.

10
00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.080
There are a lot of settings here but we won't be going over most of them.

11
00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:03.370
You don't need to worry about modifying this file much as the default settings are already optimized

12
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.510
for your site.

13
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.720
WordPress takes care of this automatically for you.

14
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.780
However there is one setting we should modify.

15
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.290
Go back to the config file and search for something called WP underscore debug.

16
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.500
By default this value is set to false.

17
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:27.560
Let's change this to true what this will do is display any errors you receive in your code.

18
00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.950
It will provide more information to help you with debugging.

19
00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.170
I highly recommend you always do this during the development phase of any plugin or theme.

20
00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:42.400
When you're ready for production be sure to change this back to false if this value doesn't exist.

21
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.910
Then you can just added in by default.

22
00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.790
It'll always be false.

23
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:53.800
So during installation this file was automatically created for you if you were to open the zip file.

24
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.080
You'll notice there never was a WP config file.

25
00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.320
Instead there is a file named wp config sample copy.

26
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.720
Pete let's open this file.

27
00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.660
It can be found in our installation of WordPress.

28
00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:14.410
This file is just a dummy file that we can rename to wp config dot page v file and use it as the main

29
00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:15.510
config file.

30
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.970
It's provided to us just in case WordPress is unable to generate this file for us during its user friendly

31
00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.250
installation you simply just have to change the values of these constants.

32
00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:33.070
If you're unsure when each value means then refer to the documentation for more information.

33
00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.270
We don't have to do this since the default installation worked for us.

34
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.850
One thing I do want to note is the authentication section.

35
00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.870
You can find it if you scroll down just a bit.

36
00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.050
If you have to manually create this file then this section is super important.

37
00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.410
These keys are used to hash your passwords and sensitive data.

38
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.180
You're free to come up with your own keys but if you're not confident with what you came up with then

39
00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.320
WordPress has you covered.

40
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:07.210
Go back to the documentation config page on the sidebar you'll find a section called Security keys for

41
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.630
me.

42
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.900
It's number one point for you'll find a link to an online generator that will generate random hard to

43
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:14.950
crack keys.

44
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:20.680
Let's check it out on this page you'll see that we get a set of keys that we can use in our file.

45
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.460
You can refresh the page and you will always get a set of unique random keys.

46
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:31.110
You can simply copy and paste this into the WP config page v file like so.

47
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.770
Keep in mind that these are values that once you set you shouldn't change afterwards.

48
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:43.030
Otherwise you can cause problems with currently active accounts just in case you can't find this link

49
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.850
on the Codex page then you can check out this block comment right above inside this block comment you'll

50
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:49.170
see.

51
00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:55.600
WordPress provides a link to the online generator as well that ramps up the topic on configuring the

52
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.530
WP config file.

53
00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:03.410
Feel free to explore this documentation for more information on this file for our purposes.

54
00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:09.690
Just setting up the WP Debug constant to true is more than enough to get started.

55
00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.880
Let's explore some of the other files and directories inside the root directory.

56
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.740
You'll find a couple of files here the files found inside the root directory determine what files should

57
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.380
be loaded on every page request.

58
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:31.720
Next we have these three folders called WP dash admin WP dash content and WP dash includes.

59
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.840
Let's start with a WP dash includes folder.

60
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.960
This folder contains classes and functions that help WordPress process requests.

61
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:45.550
It's important to understand that this is different from what you might find inside the root directory.

62
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:52.690
The root directory files help loads and set up WordPress the files inside the WP dash includes folder

63
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.660
provide functions and classes that WordPress uses to process data.

64
00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.140
A lot of the files inside this folder can't do anything by themselves.

65
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:08.950
For example if I were to open the WP comments post stop HP file you'll find a lot of logic being implemented

66
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:09.640
here.

67
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:16.060
This file will process commands for a blog post as you can see it doesn't bother defining functions.

68
00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.400
Instead it just loads files and prepares variables inside the WP.

69
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.820
Dash includes folder.

70
00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:29.970
Open the admin bar dot P V file inside this file you'll find a lot of functions defined here.

71
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:33.730
However you won't find any logic being executed.

72
00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:36.360
This file doesn't do anything by itself.

73
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.780
That goes for a lot of files inside this folder.

74
00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:45.550
Moving on the WP dash admin folder is another default folder in WordPress.

75
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:52.440
This folder handles its own requests unlike the other parts of WordPress WordPress uses the indexed

76
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.990
page file to handle a majority of requests.

77
00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:02.590
However if you visit the admin side of WordPress then the indexed P2P file doesn't handle anything.

78
00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:09.540
Instead WP dash admin is a directory that likes to be independent from the rest of the world press corps.

79
00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.220
All files here are just for the admin.

80
00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:13.390
There's nothing much to it.

81
00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:18.580
Honestly the last folder is the WP dash content folder.

82
00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.600
This folder will contain all plugins themes and uploads.

83
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.830
This is where we will be working for the majority of this course because of that.

84
00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:30.640
I won't be talking too much about this folder in this lecture.

85
00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:36.670
What I will say is that WordPress will automatically add some plugins and themes which can be a great

86
00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:40.240
way to understand how to build your own themes and plugins.

87
00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.840
You are allowed to freely modify a lot of these files without much consequence.

88
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:53.300
Before I end this lecture let's configure the server in the Zam control panel navigate to Apache config

89
00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:54.340
P HP dot.

90
00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:55.290
I am not.

91
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:59.360
This file contains settings for our p HP environment.

92
00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:05.000
There are 3 settings I want to change the first setting is the max execution time.

93
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:13.510
Search for it and set it to 500 this will allow our scripts to run for five hundred seconds.

94
00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:19.230
Realistically this should never be the case but if you ever decide to do something that is resource

95
00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:24.300
intensive then you can avoid timeout errors by setting this value to a high number.

96
00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:28.040
The next value to set is the post Max Size.

97
00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:32.700
Search for it and set it to 50 m.

98
00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:37.240
This will allow us to submit large requests up to 50 megabytes.

99
00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.010
There will be times where we will be submitting a lot of data.

100
00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:43.440
So setting this to a high number is beneficial to us.

101
00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:50.580
The last value to set is the upload Max file size 250 M which will allow us to upload files up to 50

102
00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:51.900
megabytes.

103
00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:53.000
That's it for now.

104
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:59.220
By making these changes to our environment we can now begin with developing plugins and themes for wordpress.

105
00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:02.990
You will need to restart the server for these changes to take effect.

106
00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:05.370
Do that before you move on to the next lecture.
