00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:12,200
There are only two sections left inside the single template that are static.

2
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,940
Those two sections are the author info box and the related post section.

3
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,920
Let's tackle the author box first.

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,340
This lecture we rather short to start things off.

5
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:29,770
I'm going to replace the name with the author function which will output the name of the author for

6
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:30,530
the URL.

7
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:36,250
We can simply echo the variable author you U.R.L. which already contains the URL to the author profile

8
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:40,070
nothing really new so far.

9
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,370
I'm going to save the image for last.

10
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:46,040
Let's skip onto the author description which is fairly simple.

11
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:52,130
We're going to echo out the function get the author meta which will grab a specific value that we can

12
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:56,300
decide in the resource section.

13
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,180
I provide a link to the author meta function.

14
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:06,200
As I stated earlier WordPress has a tendency to name their functions like this The get version returns

15
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,440
the value while the non get version will echo out the value.

16
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:14,300
The reason we want the value returned is because we want to format it.

17
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:16,470
I'll show you what I mean in just a moment.

18
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:19,430
Let's look at the possible values we can pass in.

19
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:25,100
If you look through this list you'll eventually find something along the lines of description.

20
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,810
This is exactly what we want.

21
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:30,650
So Alan put that now.

22
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:34,040
Make sure this is echoed out onto the page.

23
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,160
I'm going to refresh the page and we get exactly what we wanted.

24
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,990
If you don't see description then chances are the user doesn't have one.

25
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:48,860
In that case go to the admin dashboard and update the user's bio the user bios doesn't exactly have

26
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:49,610
a limit.

27
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:53,300
If the user had a long bio then this box can become unreadable.

28
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,640
The best way to approach this is to format it.

29
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:02,700
I'm going to wrap my function with another function called an L to be R.

30
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:10,300
This is a P HP specific function that will convert new lines to be R H team l tags refresh the page

31
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:14,310
one more time and you should see the description neatly formatted.

32
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,590
This is great.

33
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:22,150
Now you may be wondering why are we using the get version instead of the non get version of this function.

34
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,780
Well it's quite simple a value that is echoed out cannot be manipulated easily when you want to make

35
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:33,970
modifications to a value then you'll want to call a function that returns a value rather than output

36
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:34,520
it.

37
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:38,580
This is specific to P P in general and not WordPress.

38
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:43,660
There is a way to grab values that are already echoed out but we'll take a look into that later.

39
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:47,710
The very last thing to do is to display the user's avatar.

40
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,270
This is easy to pull off.

41
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:52,210
It's done by echoing out the get avatar.

42
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:55,980
Function this is nothing new.

43
00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:02,230
You've used it before when we worked on comments unlike last time we'll be using all the parameters

44
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:09,280
as I want to apply a class to this avatar and the resource section I provide a link to this function.

45
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:14,680
The very first thing we have to pass in is an I.D. email or a comment object.

46
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:17,010
Any of these three are perfectly fine.

47
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:23,980
We already have the authority so we can just pass that in like so the second parameter is the size.

48
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,020
I'm going to pass in 90.

49
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:31,260
The third parameter is the U.R.L. to a default Avatar image if one isn't available.

50
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:36,600
WordPress already provides one that's just fine with us so you can pass in an empty string.

51
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:40,870
The fourth parameter is the text to display in the altered attribute.

52
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,780
I'm going to set this as false.

53
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:48,730
Since I don't care much for that attribute the final parameter is an array of other values we can set

54
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,470
which are completely optional.

55
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:57,160
I'm going to pass an array with a key of class and its value will be I am G dash circle which will make

56
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,520
the avatar circular.

57
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,510
That's it.

58
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,970
Refresh the page and see if everything works.

59
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:04,930
We're almost done.

60
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:08,200
The very last thing is this related post section.
