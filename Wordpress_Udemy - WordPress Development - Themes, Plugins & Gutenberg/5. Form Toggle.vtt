00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.860
We're going to continue working with the night mode block.

2
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.920
Currently the only way to turn on night mode is through the toolbar.

3
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.500
That's perfectly fine but you may want to provide this option in the sidebar determining where an option

4
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.400
is placed is a user experience design decision.

5
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.570
Therefore that's beyond the scope of the course.

6
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:27.880
It's a case by case thing.

7
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.970
And so all leave it up to you where you think it should be placed.

8
00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.610
For now let's just say that we wanted this option to be present in the sidebar.

9
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:41.800
It's completely possible and allowed to have the same option available in multiple locations to get

10
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.510
started.

11
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.400
We're going to need to tell WordPress.

12
00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.550
We'd like to add in some content to the sidebar when the block is selected.

13
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.270
We already know how to do this with the inspector controls component.

14
00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:59.620
Let's load that in open the index dot J.S. file for the night mode block at the top d structure the

15
00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.640
inspector controls component from the WP dot editor object

16
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:12.800
we're also going to need some generic components from the WP components object D structure the panel

17
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:21.930
body panel row and form toggle components I'm introducing a new component here called form toggle.

18
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.220
This is a custom form field that will allow the user to toggle a value.

19
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.530
You'll see how it works soon enough.

20
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.930
The next step would be to create the attribute.

21
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.030
However it doesn't make sense to have two values for a night mode.

22
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.030
We'll just use the same attribute for the button.

23
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.070
Let's just head on over to the edit function since we'll be using the inspector controls component.

24
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.770
Then we'll need to return array instead of the block

25
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.560
right above the block.

26
00:01:50.580 --> 00:02:02.780
I'm going to use the inspector controls panel body and panel row components.

27
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.180
A lot of this should be familiar to you.

28
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.240
I'm setting the title to night mode and making it translatable.

29
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.580
We're going to use the panel row component as the form toggle component.

30
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.960
We're about to use requires the formatting provided by this component inside the panel row component.

31
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:28.380
Add the form toggle component first let's assign the I.D. attribute I'm going to set this to you to

32
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.720
meet Nash recipe.

33
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:37.710
Dash 9 dash mode dash toggle then we'll need to set the checked attribute.

34
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.270
This needs to be either true or false.

35
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.100
We'll set this to the night mode actual view.

36
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.560
Next we'll need to set the on change attribute.

37
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.990
What will happen if the user clicks on this field will want to update the night mode attribute.

38
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.190
This will be the exact same code we use for the button in the toolbar.

39
00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.170
Here's the problem though we're rewriting the logic in two different places.

40
00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.200
It would be better to make this into a reusable function above the return statement.

41
00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:16.080
Create a constant named toggle night mode cut and paste the function from the on click event

42
00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.130
now that we have a reusable function.

43
00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:33.470
Let's set the on change and on click events to the toggle night mode function before we declare this

44
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:39.350
complete the form toggle component will not generate a label so we'll need to do that ourselves right

45
00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:40.330
above the component.

46
00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:52.040
Add the label tag the text inside should be set to night mode that will also be translate ready.

47
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:58.380
I'm also going to set the four attribute however for is a reserved keyword in JavaScript so we'll need

48
00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.770
to use the HCM L for attribute instead.

49
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.950
This is one of those react quirks.

50
00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.450
The value for this should be the idea of the input field.

51
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:15.960
In this case it would be Udemy dash recipe dash nine dash mode dash toggle we're finished.

52
00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:24.390
Save your changes in C D into the blocks directory run the NPM run Dev command.

53
00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.880
You shouldn't receive any error so far.

54
00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.020
Go ahead and try creating a new recipe post.

55
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.120
You should be able to add that night mode block without a problem with the blocks selected.

56
00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.280
You should see the button appear in the toolbar and the form toggle field in the sidebar.

57
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.390
This is fantastic.

58
00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:46.790
If you were to click on the toggle then you'll see that Knight mode is enabled the button will also

59
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.210
be turned on you can click these in any or you want.

60
00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.060
Everything should stay in sync.

61
00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.890
WordPress will be able to manage everything for you.

62
00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.970
All you have to do is take the time to tie everything up.

63
00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.080
Once again it's up to you to decide where these options should be placed.

64
00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:09.060
My advice would be to not clutter the toolbar you want everything to be intuitive as possible.

65
00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.770
All right.

66
00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:10.840
That does it for now.

67
00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:16.040
In the next couple of lectures I'll introduce you to some of the other components for creating input

68
00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.670
fields.
