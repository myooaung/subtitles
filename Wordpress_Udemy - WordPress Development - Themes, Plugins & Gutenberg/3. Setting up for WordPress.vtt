1
00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.620
Let's prepare our machines for WordPress development.

2
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.980
If you already have things setup and prefer your own kind of environment then you're free to skip this

3
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:16.660
lecture.

4
00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.660
If not then just follow along.

5
00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.380
I'll try my best to explain everything.

6
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.690
The very first thing we need is a development environment.

7
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:31.040
There are various environments out there but the one I recommend is that it's free and constantly updated

8
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.210
with the latest versions of software for web development to download zap.

9
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.780
You'll need to visit the site Apache friends dot org.

10
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.940
I'll provide a link to this site in the resource section of this lecture.

11
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.140
Just a side note.

12
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.800
Most sites I talk about will be provided in the resource section of each lecture.

13
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.640
So just be aware of that.

14
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.230
You should see something similar to what I see.

15
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.050
Zap is a program that bundles various programs together.

16
00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.910
Let's take a deeper look at these programs.

17
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:07.640
The very first program is Apache the official Apache site is Apache dawg Apache is actually an Open

18
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.580
Source Software Foundation that provides free programs for everyone.

19
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.130
One of their most popular programs is the H TTP server program.

20
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.770
We can find this program under projects.

21
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.360
You'll find a link to the HDP server project.

22
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:28.070
This program allows you to turn your computer into a server that accepts and sends requests.

23
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.320
It's very lightweight and easy to use.

24
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.100
The next piece of software is Mario DB.

25
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.040
You can find more information about the software at Maria DB dot org.

26
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.740
Maria DP is a database that allows you to store data about anything you want.

27
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:49.100
There are all kinds of databases out there but the most popular choices are either Oracle or my sequel

28
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:55.580
my sequel and Maria TB are the two databases WordPress is 100 percent compatible with.

29
00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.070
So you may be wondering why are we installing Maria D.B. instead of my sequel.

30
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.170
Well there's a lot of business politics that I won't dive too much into because it's really boring.

31
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.410
But here's the overall gist of it.

32
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.320
My sequel has seen very little development in recent years.

33
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:18.020
A lot of developers have decided to force my sequel and continue developing and under a new name which

34
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:24.800
is Maria D.B. balking is just a fancy term for downloading open source code and then adding onto it

35
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.210
essentially.

36
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:31.780
Maria D.B. is my sequel but with more features and is constantly updated.

37
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.660
So most code that you write for my sequel will also be compatible with Maria D.B. and vice versa.

38
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.150
I promise that all code we write will be compatible with both.

39
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.980
Maria D.B. and my sequel The last piece of software is p HP.

40
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.140
You can find the official P HP site at P HP dot net.

41
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:56.570
BHP is the programming language WordPress is built with I assume you already know about BHP so I won't

42
00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:57.470
be talking about it.

43
00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.500
You'll notice that Perl is also bundled but we won't be using Perl at all.

44
00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.320
So you don't have to worry about that.

45
00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:12.490
The X in Zam stands for Operating System implying that Samp is cross compatible with all operating systems.

46
00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.540
All these programs combined together will create an environment you can run on your computer.

47
00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.860
This environment will allow you to install and work with Wordpress locally.

48
00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.110
There are other environments out there but I highly recommend you use them.

49
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.590
I find Sam the easiest to work with out of all the environments available.

50
00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.680
There are better options out there but those tend to be overkill in the next lecture.

51
00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.090
I'll talk about other options and why we won't be using them for now.

52
00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.210
Just keep following along with me.

53
00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.350
Let's download and install Sam.

54
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:50.130
There are various versions of Samp but I prefer the one that comes bundled with P P seven point two.

55
00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:56.270
People ask me all the time what version of P P they should be using and I always recommend P B 7 or

56
00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.960
higher.

57
00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:03.320
HP 7 is fast and allows for faster processing times which is great for development.

58
00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.170
Let me show you something really quick.

59
00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:10.730
Go to the WordPress dot org site and I want you to click the about link on the side.

60
00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.240
You'll find a page called requirements.

61
00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:19.040
WordPress will recommend you work with BHP 7 if you read a little further than you'll find that the

62
00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:26.510
absolute minimum version you need to run WordPress is p p 5.2 point for a lot of hosts will still use

63
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.110
p p point 5.2 or P P five point three.

64
00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.940
But I'm going to recommend that you don't develop for these versions of BHP.

65
00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:40.250
It may seem like you're limiting the amount of client she'll work with but you save yourself a huge

66
00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.330
headache by avoiding these versions.

67
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.020
The reason being is that these versions are no longer supported by BHP.

68
00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.680
These versions have security vulnerabilities and exploitations.

69
00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:57.500
Personally I only developed plugins and things that are compatible with P HP 7 and up.

70
00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:03.140
A lot of developers such as muffin group and theme fusion don't even support these lower versions and

71
00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.530
yet they still receive a lot of clients in the end.

72
00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:12.070
It's a you all code we write will be compatible with p p version 7 and up.

73
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.510
In case you are curious you can also check out this interesting link called statistics.

74
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:23.190
This page shows information about the setup most hosts use and what versions of each software they're

75
00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:24.150
using.

76
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.770
This should give you a good idea about what the market is like.

77
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.490
All right let's move on.

78
00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:35.940
Download and install and just go through the default settings as they usually will suit you best.

79
00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:41.490
I won't be going through the installation as I've already installed same ones installed.

80
00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.590
You can open up the control panel by searching for something called zap control panel.

81
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.930
The great thing about using SAP is that it automatically bundles and configure as most of the software

82
00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.510
you need to run a local development environment.

83
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.520
It's fast and easy.

84
00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:02.550
You'll notice that SAP installs other programs such as file Zilla Mercury and tomcat.

85
00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:07.620
We won't be using these software so you don't need to worry about what these do and what they're for

86
00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:09.180
to boot the server.

87
00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.190
You need to turn on Apache and my sequel.

88
00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:18.150
You should see the modules highlighted in green indicating that these modules have successfully been

89
00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.590
turned on and are currently running.

90
00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:26.560
If you don't then be sure to read the long below and ask for support at the Apache friends site.

91
00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:29.160
We can test to see if everything is working.

92
00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:34.490
By clicking the admin button inside the Apache row you'll be taken to local host.

93
00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.210
You may see a welcome message.

94
00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.760
I don't because I deleted those files.

95
00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.490
I'll show you where to delete those files in just a moment.

96
00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:44.550
Let's set up the database first.

97
00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:49.810
Open the control panel once again and click the admin button in the my sequel wrote.

98
00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:53.490
You'll be taken to a page called P HP my admin.

99
00:06:53.490 --> 00:07:00.690
Personally I don't like p p my admin because it is a web script almost like WordPress P HP my admin

100
00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:06.140
is a way to manage and view your database inside your browser just like any other script.

101
00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:11.860
This script will load javascript C assess and handle all requests with P.

102
00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:17.100
It works but it tends to be very slow at times because you have to wait for the page to load to know

103
00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.920
whether or not your request was successful.

104
00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:25.990
I prefer to use something called Heidi Eskew well which can be found at Heidi Eskew l dot com.

105
00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:32.040
You can go to the download section and just download the appropriate download for your operating system.

106
00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:36.760
Heidi doesn't work well for Mac systems so here's an alternative solution.

107
00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:41.000
If you're on a Mac OS system then you should check out sequel pro.

108
00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:42.570
It's fast and free.

109
00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:48.480
You should be able to connect to any my sequel and Maria DP databases without any problem.

110
00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.640
Once you have those installed open it up like so.

111
00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:58.130
Heidi yes you will is similar to HP my admin except it is written in a language called object Pascal

112
00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:04.430
which is a bit faster than a p p and can execute my sequel queries so much faster.

113
00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:09.090
This program also comes with more features which will be useful in later lectures.

114
00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:14.380
It'll take some time to get used to this but I promise it'll be worth it using Heidi.

115
00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:14.660
Yes.

116
00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:16.050
Well it's pretty simple.

117
00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:18.910
First you need to create a new session.

118
00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.490
Name it whatever you want.

119
00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:25.040
I'll be naming my local host a lot of the default settings are pretty good.

120
00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:33.330
The host should be 1 2 7 0 0 dot 1 which is the IP of local host the user name is Root and the password

121
00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:34.620
will be left empty.

122
00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:39.150
This user is automatically created for you when you installed zip.

123
00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:40.500
Everything else is fine.

124
00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:42.790
Make sure to save and then click open.

125
00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:46.190
You'll notice that I already have a few databases setup.

126
00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.400
Let's create a new database.

127
00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:55.110
You simply right click in the left column and under create click database you'll be presented with two

128
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:55.850
options.

129
00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.410
The name of the database and the Coalition.

130
00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:05.370
The name we'll be using is Udemy and the collation will be UTF 8 and before General S.I. the collation

131
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:08.910
determines how characters are sorted and compare.

132
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:15.200
For example you can have the letter A as uppercase or lowercase which gets displayed first.

133
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:18.950
What about characters where there's an accent above the letter A.

134
00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:25.170
As you can see there are dozens of collections with their own set of rules on how to compare characters

135
00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:32.280
or this course we'll be using UTF 8 and before General S.I. because it's been tested to be highly performance

136
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:33.330
and accurate.

137
00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:40.200
It works with all characters including Chinese Japanese and so much more click OK and that's it you

138
00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:44.550
can click on your database in the left hand column and you'll notice that it's empty.

139
00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:48.140
We can now install Wordpress in the previous lecture.

140
00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:52.130
You should have downloaded WordPress if you haven't then do so now.

141
00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:59.130
The file you downloaded should be in the form of a zip file have not file and hands next open the Zap

142
00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:01.430
control panel from the control panel.

143
00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.620
Click on the Explorer button.

144
00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:05.910
This is where zap is installed.

145
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:12.530
All files that are served from the server to your browser is located in the HP docs folder HD docs stands

146
00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:14.870
for Hypertext documents.

147
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:20.420
This folder is very important as we will be working inside it throughout most of this course.

148
00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:24.060
Feel free to delete any default files inside this folder.

149
00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:25.410
You don't need them.

150
00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:30.340
I already have some files here as I use them daily for web development.

151
00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:42.150
Open your zip file and drag and drop the files from the zip file into this HP docs folder.

152
00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:49.950
I'm going to rename this from WordPress to you to me we can now visit this by opening up the browser

153
00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:56.870
and navigating to local host slash Udemy upon arriving on the page.

154
00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.500
You'll be asked to begin installing WordPress.

155
00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:01.220
Let's do this together.

156
00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.610
You'll be asked to select your language.

157
00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:07.670
I'll be using English select whatever language suits you best.

158
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:13.250
Afterwards you'll be told that the WP config dot page Free File isn't available.

159
00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:17.820
WordPress will then ask you if you'd like to create this file now.

160
00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:22.090
I'm going to let WordPress generate this file before it can do so.

161
00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:29.520
It's going to ask us for the database details let's go through it one by one the database name is Udemy

162
00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:31.310
and their user name is Root.

163
00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:35.690
There is no password and we'll leave the rest as it's the last field.

164
00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:42.840
Is table prefix the table prefix allows you to give your database tables a unique name whatever you

165
00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:49.260
input here will be prefixed to all the tables WordPress generates WordPress will generate a little over

166
00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:55.380
10 different tables for your site the names it generates tend to be very simple and basic.

167
00:11:55.380 --> 00:12:01.180
This can cause issues if you already have tables inside your database to avoid naming conflicts.

168
00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:05.100
You can set a prefix to give each table a unique name.

169
00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:12.270
For example there is a table named posts if you set the prefix to WP underscore then the new name will

170
00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:14.760
be WP underscore posts.

171
00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:19.530
You should always be mindful of the setting as will be using it ourselves in the future.

172
00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:23.580
For now I'm going to leave this as is if you don't understand.

173
00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:24.490
That's fine.

174
00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:25.900
You'll understand what I mean.

175
00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:28.350
In a future lecture run the installation

176
00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:34.210
after some time you should see a success message.

177
00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:41.230
You'll be then asked to input some basic details about your site and set up a user account input whatever

178
00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:42.520
details you want.

179
00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.670
You can just copy what I put if you'd like.

180
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:51.040
Once you're finished you should see a success message and you can now log in

181
00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:56.570
congrats.

182
00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:59.200
We've successfully installed WordPress.

183
00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:00.570
We're pretty much done.

184
00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:03.890
There's one last thing I wanted to do before we finish things up here.

185
00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:11.240
Go ahead and log into your WordPress site then go to settings perma links change the perma link settings

186
00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.810
to post name.

187
00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:15.650
This will make our new URLs easy to read.

188
00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:19.040
It's not necessary but it will make your life simpler.

189
00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:20.140
We're now finished.

190
00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:23.000
That was a lot to go through but hopefully you got through it.
