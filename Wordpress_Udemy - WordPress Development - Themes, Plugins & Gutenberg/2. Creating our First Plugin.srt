00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,690
Creating a plugin is very similar to creating a theme.

2
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:16,750
All plugins can be found inside the WP dash content slash plugins folder by default.

3
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:22,190
WordPress will provide us with two plugins which are the hello dolly and a kismet plugins.

4
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,820
We also see the plugins we installed earlier.

5
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,690
Let's create our own plugin.

6
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:33,220
Unlike themes plugins can be created directly inside the plugins folder or in a sub folder.

7
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:39,640
However it's best practice to just create a sub folder with any plugin the plugin I want to create is

8
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,580
going to be called recipe.

9
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:46,040
I'm going to create a new folder named recipe inside this folder.

10
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:54,930
I'm going to create a new file named index top HP just like themes you need to provide a file header

11
00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:01,470
to tell WordPress that this plugin exists unlike themes though WordPress doesn't require a certain naming

12
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,100
structure for plugins.

13
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:09,340
Actually if we take a look at the fake your press plugin then you'll see that all code is in the faker

14
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,980
Prescott page for your file and not the indexed P2P file.

15
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,920
You can name the main plugin file whatever you want.

16
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,220
Some developers named after their plugins others just use index top P HP.

17
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,670
Either one is fine.

18
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,200
I just want you to be aware of the two common possibilities.

19
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,760
Its all preference for this course.

20
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,890
We're going to just keep everything inside the next page for your file.

21
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:38,310
There's only one requirement to make this an official WordPress plugin.

22
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,900
We must create a file header and define one property.

23
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:48,170
So let's create a block comment and inside this blog comments add the following plugin name.

24
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:51,520
Colon recipe.

25
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,420
That's it.

26
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:55,990
Go to your plugins page and you should now see your plugin appear.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,130
It doesn't have the rest of the information like the other plugins but it works.

28
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:04,860
This is the absolute minimum requirement for wordpress to recognize your plugin.

29
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,770
Nothing else in the resources section.

30
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,000
I provide a link to the file header Codex page.

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,860
WordPress provides a full list of optional headers we can define.

32
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,900
We're going to use a few of these.

33
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,420
Let's get started.

34
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:22,040
The second header we want to define is the description.

35
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:33,110
I'm going to put a simple WordPress plugin that allows users to create recipes and rate those recipes.

36
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,940
Up next is the version.

37
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,440
We'll keep it simple by sending it to 1.0

38
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,950
next is the name of the author.

39
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,900
Put your name down or the name of your organization.

40
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:51,100
I'm going to put down you to me the author you awry is a link to your personal site or organization

41
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:51,770
site.

42
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:56,550
I'm going to drop a link to the Udemy site.

43
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:00,100
Lastly we want to define the text domain.

44
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:05,130
I know we haven't gone over translations yet but this should always be set to the name of your plugin

45
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:05,850
folder.

46
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:13,110
So set this to recipe let's refresh the plugin page and see if everything works.

47
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,900
You should see something similar to what I see.

48
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:19,720
Feel free to look at the other headers and define whatever suits your needs.
