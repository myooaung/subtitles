00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.070
Creating the search template is fairly easy.

2
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.610
I'm still in the theme development Codex page on the sidebar.

3
00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.910
Click on Search top HP you'll see what WordPress recommends for this template.

4
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.350
Basically it just says we need to include results and a search form with the search query.

5
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.760
If a user input in 1 First things first let's create this file.

6
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.130
I'm going to be using the code from the index template.

7
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.840
I'm going to remove the breaking news widget before I do anything else

8
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.110
then open the static search template.

9
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.640
There are a few components that we need to add.

10
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.830
The first is the page title bar.

11
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:58.470
So add that right now.

12
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.790
The next thing the setup is the search form right above the posts inside the search template.

13
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.240
You'll find a section called search box.

14
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.120
Copy everything between these two comments and paste it inside the search template.

15
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:19.340
It should be placed inside the div tag with the class post content with both components added Let's

16
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.380
convert them into dynamic code.

17
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.330
Back to the search template right above the loop.

18
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.370
We already have a search form and so it would make sense to reuse it.

19
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:35.060
I'm going to replace this form with the Get search form function for the title.

20
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.220
I'm going to make this part of a text translatable and echo it out with the underscore e function

21
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:44.680
after that.

22
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.750
I'm going to call the function D search query.

23
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.480
This function will output the text the user searched for.

24
00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:00.550
Lastly I'm going to make this text translatable.

25
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.330
I'm gonna go back to the home page.

26
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.170
Now he can try and search for something and we should see some results.

27
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.150
Keep in mind that our posts are created using fake press which uses a.

28
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:17.750
If some generator regular English words won't work unless your posts actually contain English words

29
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.470
the search template should be working without a problem.

30
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.260
We can begin working on custom templates.

31
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.840
There are some situations where we want to make custom templates for pages posts and any other post

32
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:30.680
types.

33
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.500
For example let's take a look at the about us page.

34
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.510
This page contains our content on the left and the sidebar on the right.

35
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.070
A lot of themes out there provide the option to make this full width.

36
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.650
There are two ways we can replicate this.

37
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:50.120
We can code up our own logic and then perform checks to see if the user wants a full web page.

38
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.290
The second option is we can take advantage of WordPress as custom templates feature.

39
00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.550
I don't know about you but I think the custom template route seems simpler and it actually is.

40
00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.740
Let's see how this works.

41
00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:10.310
I'm going to create a file called Full dash with Dash page dot HP unlike WordPress templates you can

42
00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.700
name your customer template files whatever you want.

43
00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.330
I could have called this fire truck if I wanted to.

44
00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.250
Next I'm going to copy the contents of the page template into this custom template.

45
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.230
Then I'm going to remove the sidebar from this template and remove this dip tag with the class post

46
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.400
content.

47
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:42.190
I'm not going to remove what's inside only the opening and closing tag itself.

48
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.940
So now the question is how do you make WordPress recognize this as a custom template.

49
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.040
Well it's simple at the very top of the file.

50
00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.460
We're going to add a file header.

51
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.710
Do you remember how we make file headers.

52
00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:57.390
We use block comments.

53
00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.000
Let's create a blog comment.

54
00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:06.110
Now add the following text template name colon for web page.

55
00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:10.640
We have to pass in the words template name followed by the name of the template.

56
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:15.550
You can name it whatever you want but it's good practice to keep it short and concise.

57
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.950
Go back to your browser and try editing the about us page.

58
00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:24.990
If you look on the side you'll see an option to select a template WordPress automatically finds our

59
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:31.530
custom templates and we can select it as an option so let's select the full width page template and

60
00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:32.790
save our changes.

61
00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.010
If you look at the page now you'll see it's completely full width.

62
00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.920
We didn't have to code any logic whatsoever.

63
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.390
WordPress took care of checking our theme for custom templates and handling which template to load.

64
00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:50.420
The more you use WordPress the more you'll find out how powerful it actually is.

65
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.720
Now lets say I want to have a full width post.

66
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.240
Let's try viewing a post and then editing it.

67
00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.320
You'll notice that we don't have that template option available.

68
00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:08.660
This is because by default WordPress will only allow custom templates to be enabled for pages only.

69
00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:14.720
It's very simple to make custom templates available for any post type you want in the resource section

70
00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.620
of this lecture.

71
00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.400
I provide a link to the page template handbook.

72
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:24.710
This whole page talks about how to work with custom templates but the one section I want you to focus

73
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:30.980
on is the creating page templates for specific post types WordPress shows us.

74
00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:37.280
In the example that in order to make a template available for other post types you have to add the template

75
00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:43.270
post type setting followed by the name of the post type before you make a template for posts.

76
00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.810
I want you to notice one thing and that is this warning right below the example.

77
00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:53.570
It states that custom templates for post types other than pages has only been available since version

78
00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.050
four point seven.

79
00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:56.880
This is very important to note.

80
00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.640
If you ever work on a theme on a wordpress version earlier than four point seven.

81
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:02.840
Let's get started.

82
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:08.030
I will not be using the full dash with Dash page template as the full with post template.

83
00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:13.610
This is because this template is based on the original page template which is really just a stripped

84
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.310
down version of the single post template.

85
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:20.660
I want to have all the features of the single post template without the sidebar.

86
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:30.080
I'm going to create a new file named for dash with Dash post stop BHP copy the contents from the single

87
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:36.890
template into this newly created file unlike last time I'm going to remove the sidebar and remove the

88
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:42.240
div tags with the clasp post content just the opening and closing tags.

89
00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:43.220
Nothing in between

90
00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:56.190
the very top create a new file header set the template name as full width post and add the other part

91
00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:02.970
template post type with the value of post this file with template will only be for posts it will not

92
00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:10.990
be made available for pages try editing the post and you'll find the template available for use save

93
00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:12.610
your changes and view the Post

94
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.340
that save for custom templates.

95
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.280
Be sure to read up on this link I provided earlier.

96
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.770
For more information about custom templates.
