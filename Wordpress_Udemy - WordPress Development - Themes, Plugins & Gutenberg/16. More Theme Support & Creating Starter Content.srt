1
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,970
Right now I'm in the setup function.

2
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:15,530
I want to start filling in some gaps and adding some features so that's what we'll do here in the resources

3
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:16,220
section.

4
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:19,180
I provide a link to the ad theme support function.

5
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:24,740
WordPress provides so many features here that we should use the first one we should add is the feed

6
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,240
links feature.

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,890
WordPress will generate RSS feeds for us and always make sure it's updated with the latest posts.

8
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:36,330
If you're unfamiliar with RSS feeds you'll see what those look like in just a moment.

9
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:43,130
Inside these setup function let's use the ABX theme support function and pass an automatic dash feed

10
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:49,890
dash links which will instruct WordPress to setup some RSS feeds refresh the site and you'll notice

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,250
nothing's really changed but under the hood.

12
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:58,650
There is one small change right click and view the page source WordPress will generate these two tags

13
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:02,990
inside the head tag that links to RSS Excel feeds.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,040
Let's click on this link and you'll be taken to this Excel document.

15
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,310
The purpose of this document is for RSS readers to scan this document.

16
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:17,700
This document contains data about your post RSS feeds provide a way for users to know when new content

17
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:23,620
is available on your site without having to visit it RSS has been in decline for some time but there

18
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:29,190
is still a wealthy amount of people still using this technology whether or not you want to add it is

19
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,910
up to you for the most part.

20
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,960
It's fast and easy to use.

21
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,700
The next thing I want to add support for IS HCM L5.

22
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:45,190
It can be done by simply calling the same function again and passing in HCM L5 if you can remember.

23
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:49,100
WordPress will automatically generate H.G. market for the search form.

24
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,920
If we didn't have a template for it.

25
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:55,780
This isn't the only time WordPress generates markup for us by default.

26
00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:00,340
WordPress will make the H team l generated x h GM l compatible.

27
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:07,360
However if your theme takes advantage of HCM L5 tags then you'll want to enable this HCM L5 feature

28
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,310
to ensure all markup is up to standards.

29
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:16,180
If you look at the documentation you'll notice that the second parameter is an array every feature can

30
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,270
take advantage of the second parameter.

31
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,240
It varies in the case of each team L5.

32
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:25,200
You can specify which markup will have a team L5 applied to it.

33
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:31,780
Even though this parameter is optional WordPress still wants an array of HDMI 5 elements you'd like

34
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,820
to support.

35
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:36,460
I'm going to copy and paste the array from the example into our code.

36
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:42,870
Like so the next thing we want to add support for IS starter content.

37
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:46,230
This is a brand new feature in WordPress four point seven.

38
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:51,240
The purpose of this feature is a way for developers to add dummy content when the user is viewing the

39
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,760
theme in the customizing.

40
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:58,980
This dummy content will only be available when the current wordpress installation is fresh meaning that

41
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:05,340
the user just created the WordPress site and hasn't created any post pages or menus.

42
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:11,310
If you take a look at the ad theme support function developer page you'll notice there's almost no information

43
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:17,320
about this feature since it's new it's lacking in documentation on WordPress a site.

44
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,680
Instead there is a blog post about it.

45
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,670
I'll provide a link to the blog post in the resource section of this lecture.

46
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,190
Here's what the team has to say about it.

47
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:30,810
One of the hardest things for people setting up sites with Wordpress for the first time is understanding

48
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,630
what things are and how a given theme can work for you.

49
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,050
Especially when there's no content there to visualize.

50
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:43,890
There are also significant gaps between local theme previews screenshots and org previews even when

51
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,810
there are easy to use site customization tools.

52
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:52,470
It is difficult to figure out where to start and what things are going to be like to help users along

53
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,170
that path.

54
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:59,480
Four point seven introduces the concept of starter content themes specific functions of content helps

55
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:04,910
showcase a theme to users and serve as a starting point for further setup of new sites.

56
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,340
Let's learn how to use it.

57
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,400
Call the function at theme support and pass in starter dash content.

58
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:17,530
For the second parameter you'll need to pass in an array of dummy content to save time.

59
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:21,770
I'm going to copy in some code and I'll be going over how all this works.

60
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:26,480
Try and follow along unlike the other features.

61
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:32,500
This feature in particular requires that you actually set up the dummy content in this array.

62
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,370
You'll find 6 keys which are all required.

63
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:40,380
I'm going to minimize these for a second so you can get a better overview of what's going on.

64
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,930
Each of these keys are assigned arrays with their own settings.

65
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:49,980
The first is widgets as you may have thought the widgets array determines what widgets will be displayed

66
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:52,200
in these sidebars we created.

67
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,590
We currently have one sidebar and that is the J use sidebar.

68
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:00,960
You set this as a key and its value will be an array of widgets inside the sidebar.

69
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:06,630
If you look at the blog post then you'll see that the developers know what kind of predefined widgets

70
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,840
you can pass in.

71
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:15,900
I'm going to pass him three widgets called text business info search and text about WordPress will automatically

72
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,880
generate these widgets with the data they have in their system.

73
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,310
Since this is just dummy content I'm not so worried about what's inside the widgets.

74
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:27,890
As long as something is displayed the next key is attachments.

75
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:32,310
We haven't talked too much about attachments but attachments is the post type.

76
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:35,550
WordPress users to associate files and images.

77
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:41,190
If you were to go to the admin dashboard and click on media you'll be taken to all the attachments we

78
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,410
have on our site.

79
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:50,530
It's mostly images the attachments key allows you to simulate attachments without having to actually

80
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:53,110
upload anything into the media library.

81
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:56,980
This will be an array which will accept an array of images or files.

82
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,580
The key will be considered the I.D..

83
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:04,250
We only have one image which is the image dash about inside this array.

84
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,880
It's more information about this file image.

85
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,190
There are two required fields which are the human readable name and the location of the file.

86
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,070
The location is relative to the current theme.

87
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:21,470
If I were to open the assets slash images slash about directory you'll find the image right here.

88
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,560
The next key is posts.

89
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,320
This will allow you to define some dummy posts.

90
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:31,240
You'll notice I'm just creating the same kind of posts just under different names.

91
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:36,250
One thing you'll notice is that for the thumbnail key for each of these posts I'm using these curly

92
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,330
brackets.

93
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,660
This will tell WordPress to look for any attachments with the idea of image dash about.

94
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,420
This is the same idea we used in the attachments array WordPress.

95
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:53,110
We'll be able to make the connection for you the next key is the options keep the options key allows

96
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:59,500
you to modify the values in the WP options database table lets open the WP options table.

97
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:05,790
I'm going to be viewing the data in Heidi Eskew Well if you prefer a page from my admin that's fine.

98
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:11,860
WordPress stores all its information inside this table plugins and themes will also store their data

99
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,440
here and this array.

100
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:18,840
The key will correspond to the option underscore name field and the value will correspond to the option.

101
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:23,080
Underscore value field I'm overriding three options here.

102
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:29,440
The show on front field determines whether the front page will be a page we created or a list of blog

103
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,190
posts.

104
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:36,760
I set this to page the page on front is the option for determining what page from our list of pages

105
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,010
will be the front page.

106
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:42,810
Since we set show on front page this key is required.

107
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:48,850
Once again I'm using the curly bracket style to tell WordPress that the value will be a post in our

108
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:53,790
case it will be the home page we created earlier in the Post's array.

109
00:07:53,920 --> 00:08:00,430
We do the same for the page for posts keep the key theme mods is where we can override our own theme

110
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,300
settings.

111
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:07,610
These are the same settings we created in the Customize are the key and values are pretty self-explanatory.

112
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:13,010
The key is the idea of the setting and its value would be the value for that setting.

113
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:17,610
The last key should be nav menus which allows us to generate menus.

114
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:21,180
We have two menus which are primary and secondary.

115
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:24,550
These are the same menus we registered in our theme.

116
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:28,560
Each of these have arrays for additional settings about these menus.

117
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:31,220
First is the name which I make translatable.

118
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:37,600
The items are the actual links you'll notice on using page underscore and link underscore.

119
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:43,450
WordPress will read these values and if it starts with Page underscore WordPress will automatically

120
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:47,490
look at the posts key and see if we have any pages with the same name.

121
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:55,480
So Page underscore about we'll look for the about page the link underscore is internal WordPress links.

122
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,130
WordPress will generate its own links which we can take advantage of the link underscore.

123
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,630
Home is the link to the home page.

124
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:09,250
I also leave this note here that says note that the core home page is actually a link in case a static

125
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,230
front page is not used.

126
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,150
That wraps up this theme feature.

127
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:18,460
We can't actually test it right away because our wordpress installation is already beyond the point

128
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,240
of a starter site.

129
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:25,600
However we can temporarily restart it without having to do a fresh install or clean all our posts and

130
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,860
settings inside the WP underscore options table.

131
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:36,340
There is a value named fresh on your score site set this value to 1.

132
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:41,300
This will automatically trick WordPress into thinking that this site is a new site.

133
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:46,610
After doing that go to the Customize or and you'll notice our site is completely different than what

134
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,350
we see on the home page.

135
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:51,810
Keep in mind that this data will only apply to the customize.

136
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:56,990
It's a way of previewing our site without actually having to force apply these changes.

137
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:02,550
I'm going to set the fresh underscore site to zero as we're done with the starter content feature.
