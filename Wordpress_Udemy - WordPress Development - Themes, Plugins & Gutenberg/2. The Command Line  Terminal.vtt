00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.890
The very first thing you'll need to know is the command line the command line can be very intimidating

2
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.620
especially if you're new to web development.

3
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.820
However you will need to know your way around if you plan on doing Gutenberg development.

4
00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.970
So that's what you'll be learning in this lecture.

5
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.920
The command line is extremely powerful but you actually don't need to know every feature there is.

6
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.950
There are dozens of commands but will only be learning a handful.

7
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.640
The reason being is because we don't need to know the other commands or even use them.

8
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.220
You don't have to be a master at using the command line especially when it comes to WordPress.

9
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:48.390
The commands I teach you here will be the only commands you'll need for the rest of this course.

10
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.270
So let's get started.

11
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.490
The very first thing you want to do is open up the command line the command line can be opened by searching

12
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.200
for the phrase command prompt.

13
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.370
If you're on a Windows machine if you are a Linux or Mac then this will be called terminal.

14
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.060
The command line is just this basic window with a black background and white text before there were

15
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.070
Web sites and user interfaces.

16
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.550
We had the command prompt.

17
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.750
Everything you ever wanted to do would be through the command prompt.

18
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.520
The reason you would use a command prompt is because it's 10 times faster than using an interface.

19
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.010
You don't really need an interface for everything.

20
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.570
And as web developers we want to do everything as fast as we can.

21
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.290
Not only that web servers themselves generally don't have interfaces.

22
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.690
So learning how to use the command line is beneficial.

23
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.140
If you're on a Windows machine then you're faced with a major disadvantage.

24
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.600
The command prompt doesn't use the exact same commands as Linux or Mac.

25
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:51.230
This is a problem as most tutorials and resources use Unix like commands.

26
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.890
This has been a problem for a very long time.

27
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.310
However Microsoft developed another command line called the Power shell.

28
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.160
I want you to search for that and open it up.

29
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.540
The power Shell is a newer and faster command line than the command prompt.

30
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.050
Not only is it faster but it has the same exact commands as Unix like systems.

31
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.200
We'll be using the power shell for the rest of this lecture.

32
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:20.060
That way you don't have to memorize two different commands for the same thing when you first open the

33
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.750
command line.

34
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.380
You won't see much initially.

35
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.100
You'll just see where you are in your directory.

36
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.520
Some command lines will have a dollar sign to indicate that anything after that sign is user input a.k.a.

37
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.910
your own commands or text.

38
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.800
Right now I'm able to see my full path.

39
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:44.210
I'm inside the C colon backslash users backslash Jack directory some command lines will not even show

40
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:45.500
you the full path.

41
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.100
The reason for this is the save some space.

42
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.210
You may be in a directory that has a long name and it would be kind of annoying to have to see it for

43
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.210
every line on the command line.

44
00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:02.360
If you ever want to see the full path then you simply type in P WD P WD is short for present working

45
00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.400
directory.

46
00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.930
Upon entering this command you'll see the full path you're currently in.

47
00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.850
This is super useful especially if you can't use something like the explorer to tell you exactly where

48
00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:14.880
you want.

49
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.970
Now that we have an idea of where we are let's learn to navigate around before you can navigate around.

50
00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:27.350
You have to know where you can navigate to the next coming and you need to know is the L S command.

51
00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.320
This command is short for the word list.

52
00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.600
Enter this commands.

53
00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:37.250
This will output a list of files and folders currently in the directory you're working in as you can

54
00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.040
see here.

55
00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.880
I have all these files and folders along with information about when the last time each file was modified

56
00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.410
and their permissions.

57
00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:51.290
Now that I have an idea of where I am let's move into a folder to move into a folder.

58
00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:56.090
You need to use the C D command which is short for change directory.

59
00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.080
After this command you have to input the name of the directory you'd like to move into.

60
00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.420
I want to move into the music directory so all input that and press enter.

61
00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:06.320
Just like that.

62
00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.720
I'm inside the music directory.

63
00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.900
If I wanted to move back I would have to use these C D command again but this time I would input two

64
00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.550
dots like so two dots represent up one directory.

65
00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:22.230
This command will move you up one directory.

66
00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.220
We are back to where we started.

67
00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:30.020
If I wanted to move up multiple directories then I would just input dot dot forward slash dot dot.

68
00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.860
This will take me all the way up to the root of my drive.

69
00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:39.230
You can use forward slashes to indicate that you'd like to move through multiple directories.

70
00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.500
This also applies to moving into directories.

71
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.030
I know for a fact that my Zapp installation is inside this directory.

72
00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:57.300
I'm going to move into the HP docs directory by inputting CDE zap slash HD docs let's make this into

73
00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.440
an exercise.

74
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.720
I want you to move into your HP docs directory using the C D command.

75
00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.130
If you're not completely sure where it is then it's fine to cheat.

76
00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.930
You can open the file explorer and check where the full path is.

77
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:17.430
Once you know where the path is then you just use the L S and C D commands to help navigate your way

78
00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.750
around the command line to verify that I'm inside the HP docs folder.

79
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.140
I want to use the Ellis command to view the folders.

80
00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.010
I'll find my projects and the Udemy folder here as well.

81
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.620
There's one last command I want to use and that's the m k d IRR command.

82
00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.730
This command is short for make directory.

83
00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.790
This will create a new folder I want to create a folder called Learn Dash.

84
00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.930
J.S. entered this command and a new folder should be made.

85
00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.500
Let's double check this.

86
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:55.810
I want you to open your editor and then open this directory inside your editor that's basically it when

87
00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:57.030
it comes to commands.

88
00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.830
Not much to it honestly.

89
00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.050
These commands will just help you navigate around the command line.

90
00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:08.170
There's other commands that will help with modifying and deleting files but you don't need to know those

91
00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:11.220
since we'll be working in an editor most of the time.

92
00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:17.500
If you have visual studio code like me then you'll be able to open the command line by going to view

93
00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:22.930
integrated Terminal One of the great things about this is that it automatically points to the current

94
00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:24.310
directory you're in.

95
00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:30.370
This is a huge time saver as we won't have to use DCD command every time you wanted to move into this

96
00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:31.640
directory.

97
00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.820
I'll be using this terminal throughout the rest of this course.

98
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.090
If you don't have it then that's fine.

99
00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.350
You can continue using the command line your operating system has provided you.
