I said it once and I'll say it again.

2
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:15.160
The WP dash config file is one of the most important files in your wordpress installation.

3
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:21.500
You should take every step to securing one simple step is by moving the file up one directory.

4
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:28.550
Most production servers will store WordPress inside folders called public underscore H2 UML W WW or

5
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:29.350
web.

6
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.110
It varies from host to host.

7
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.870
By moving it up one directory you could prevent access to it from the web in general.

8
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:37.820
Moving the file is easy.

9
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.680
Open your WordPress site and cut it from the directory then move it up one folder like so

10
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.530
refresh your site and everything should work like normal.

11
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.920
So what's going on and how does WordPress know where to find the file.

12
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.600
Let's take a look at how WordPress loads the file open the HP access file.

13
00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.170
This file runs before any code is executed.

14
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.480
This file will check to make sure the request being made isn't specific to a certain file or folder

15
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.730
if it isn't it'll pass the request onto the index next page for you file.

16
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:19.500
Open this file now this file will load the WP dash blog dash header file that will then load the WP

17
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:26.300
dash load file the WP dash load file is the file that loads the WP dash config file.

18
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.910
However it does some conditional checks before doing so.

19
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.640
It'll first check to see if the file exists inside the root installation of WordPress.

20
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.580
If it does then it'll load the file if it doesn't it'll move on to the next check.

21
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.480
This statement will check to see if the file exists up one directory.

22
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.290
If it does then it'll load the config file.

23
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.350
However if it can't find the config file it will then boot up the Senate page so that it can generate

24
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.620
the file for you by moving the config code.

25
00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:01.040
You make it just a little harder for hackers to do anything malicious before I am this lecture.

26
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.360
I'm going to move the config file back.

27
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.770
Since we're working on a local server I'm not really concerned about where this file is placed.
