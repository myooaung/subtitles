00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,070
When it comes to navigation tags there's not much to go over.

2
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:15,680
If you look at the list of functions you'll see that there are only two functions.

3
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,930
We've already gone over the first function and the second one is not that important.

4
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,940
There is one thing I didn't mention though.

5
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,370
Let's go ahead and click on the WP.

6
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:26,850
Now many function on the sidebar.

7
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:32,330
You'll find a link to the section menu item C Ss classes upon clicking this link.

8
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:37,780
You'll be provided a list of classes that WordPress will apply to the navigation menu generated.

9
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:41,780
If you're creating your own Walker then these classes won't be applied.

10
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,300
You'll have to apply them manually.

11
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:48,100
WordPress also doesn't load any styles for these classes.

12
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:51,090
It's up to you to take advantage of them in your theme.

13
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:54,880
Currently the theme we have isn't using any of these classes.

14
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,310
That's perfectly fine.

15
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:58,000
We don't need them anyway.

16
00:00:58,010 --> 00:00:59,500
That's all I wanted to show you.

17
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,520
Let's move on to the next set of tags.
