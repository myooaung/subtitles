Developing a theme can be really fun.

2
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.120
But as you may have saw throughout this course I'm all about efficiency and organization creating a

3
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.570
theme from scratch can be time consuming to speed things up.

4
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.310
It's not a bad idea to use a starter template that takes care of all the boring stuff and templates

5
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.790
then you can just take it from there and customize it.

6
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:33.480
Here are some suggestions I recommend the best free starter template is called underscores underscores.

7
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.970
It's developed by a bunch of fantastic developers who all agree on how things should be developed.

8
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.470
The people who develop this starter theme are the same people who work on the word press corps itself.

9
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.450
Every single line of code in this template has a purpose and is carefully inputted for the best practices.

10
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.140
If you were to download this template and view some of the code you'll notice that they organized their

11
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.970
code a bit differently.

12
00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.430
That's perfectly fine.

13
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.200
You can organize your code any way you like.

14
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.360
You couldn't do it the way I taught you or you could use someone else's organization system or you can

15
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.670
just organize it the way you like.

16
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.100
There was no right or wrong answer here.

17
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.280
I recommend you download this theme and play around with it a bit.

18
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.970
It's well documented and easy to understand.

19
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.210
Another solution is under strap which is the underscore steam but with more features specifically it

20
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.270
has bootstrap for included.

21
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.360
If you like bootstrap then this might be something you'll want to use.

22
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.170
Next up is sage by roots.

23
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.220
This starter theme is for hardcore developers out of all the recommendations I provide.

24
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.140
This one is the most advanced.

25
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.170
It goes beyond the basic p p include statements and has support for bootstrap for Blade templates and

26
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.460
so much more.

27
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.340
This is something I want to go over with you in the future.

28
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.810
Let me know on the comments if you'd be interested in a section for this starter theme.

29
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.090
I truly believe it would be beneficial to anyone.

30
00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.430
An alternative is called Genesis by studio press.

31
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.190
This is the most popular premium starter template available.

32
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.160
I hear nothing but good things about this template.

33
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.290
It's about 60 dollars but it comes with so many features and it comes with functions that would be useful

34
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.270
to you for theme development.

35
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.110
The support is top notch and the code is well written.

36
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.770
I highly recommend this if you need help with theme development.

37
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.810
Another starter template is from Wu Commerce called store front store front is a starter template that

38
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.930
comes with Ru commerce integration out of the box.

39
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.660
It provides good practices and support.

40
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.140
I encourage you to explore any of these themes to learn more about theme development.
