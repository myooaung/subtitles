00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.960
Before we begin coding anything it's important to understand the various resources made available to

2
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.190
us by WordPress.

3
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:19.100
In this lecture I'm going to break down each resource provided by WordPress.

4
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.070
You can follow along with me by checking out the links in the resource section on this lecture.

5
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.570
If we were to search for wordpress you'll come across two sites which are WordPress dot com and WordPress

6
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.520
thought even though they have similar domain names.

7
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.560
You should be aware that there is a huge difference between the two.

8
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.070
The dot com domain is a hosting platform for wordpress that is supported by a private company.

9
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.130
I'll talk more about that company in just a moment.

10
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.580
Right off the bat I want you to know something very important about WordPress hosting platforms.

11
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.690
There are a lot of them out there but I do not recommend using these kinds of hosts as a developer.

12
00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.290
You'll want to have full control over your WordPress sites.

13
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.560
A lot of WordPress hosting platforms really limit what you can install and use while they're user friendly.

14
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.680
They're not developer friendly.

15
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.900
Sometimes you'll have a client asking one host to recommend for their site.

16
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.100
In these instances try to recommend something which gives you the developer more flexibility as this

17
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.380
course progresses.

18
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.640
I'll definitely talk more about hosting options and what you should be looking for in a host.

19
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.210
All right.

20
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.730
Let's keep moving forward.

21
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.060
The dot org domain is for anyone who wants to download the source code of WordPress and host it themselves.

22
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.600
This is where we'll be spending ninety nine percent of our time throughout this course.

23
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.550
Right away you'll find a button to download WordPress.

24
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:49.200
As of this course we'll be working with version 5 of WordPress download WordPress now as we'll be installing

25
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.620
it on our machines in a future lecture.

26
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:57.300
Don't worry if you see a higher version of WordPress all code we write will be compatible with future

27
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.640
and past versions of WordPress.

28
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.280
Throughout this course you'll find that features from versions as old as one point five are still supported

29
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.620
and used.

30
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.990
Let's explore this site a little more under its support.

31
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.180
Click documentation here you'll find information about WordPress and its features.

32
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.590
You'll notice that we're in something called the codex.

33
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.170
That's just a fancy word WordPress uses to call its own documentation.

34
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:30.300
Back in the early days WordPress used the codex for everything from code examples to simple explanations

35
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.530
about the user system.

36
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.530
However as WordPress grew the development team realized that mixing this information was not a good

37
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.920
idea.

38
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.910
So they took all the resources related to coding things and plug ins into its own site in the URL bar

39
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.970
changed the word codex to developer remove anything after that domain extension.

40
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.790
Here you'll find resources strictly related to developers throughout this course we'll be switching

41
00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.280
between the Codex and developer resources from time to time.

42
00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.610
You'll find that the Codex resource contains code.

43
00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.320
This is because the WordPress team hasn't fully transitioned all the code examples from the codex to

44
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.860
the developer site.

45
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.870
It's currently a work in progress.

46
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.550
One of the great things about the site is that it is dynamically generated.

47
00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.890
The WordPress team has made it so that this site will scan all the code in WordPress to help generate

48
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.280
the documentation.

49
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.810
This way the site is always kept up to date.

50
00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.770
Let's explore how to use this site very quickly.

51
00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:36.120
Right off the bat you'll be provided with links to four different sections a section for developing

52
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.550
themes plugins and applications.

53
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:44.290
This last section is actually new which provides information on how to use the WordPress CNY.

54
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.790
We'll be exploring all of these asked of course progresses all these sections are only guides if you

55
00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:57.020
want to look up a function or class then you need to scroll down and click the code reference link.

56
00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.380
You'll be taken to a search page where you can look up functions hooks classes and methods.

57
00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.760
We haven't gone over hooks so I don't expect you to know what that is.

58
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.240
Let's ignore that for now.

59
00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:16.310
Right below this you'll find that WordPress documents all the latest code added to the word press corps.

60
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.400
This is a really great way to check out what functions are added on the right.

61
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.950
You'll find all the API is available.

62
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.820
We'll be exploring most of these throughout the course.

63
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.510
Let's take a look at how to search for code.

64
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.260
I don't expect you to follow along you just need to understand that all this does is help you find more

65
00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:40.200
information about functions and other WordPress code by the end of this course you'll be more than comfortable

66
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.980
using this tool.

67
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.440
All right I'm going to search for something called the underscore content.

68
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.830
After submitting the search we should get about 10 results back.

69
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.940
I'm going to click on the first result.

70
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:57.720
WordPress will load this page that provides a lot of information on how you would go about using this

71
00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:58.520
function.

72
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.340
There are a couple of things I want to highlight.

73
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.650
The first is that you'll always be provided with the original source code.

74
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.790
Here you'll find where WordPress defines this function.

75
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:13.080
This is a really great way to understand how WordPress functions internally.

76
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.720
A lot of this code may not make sense but I assure you that you'll be able to read code like this and

77
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.890
understand what it means by the end of this course.

78
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.780
Next is the change logs section.

79
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:30.240
This will document when the function was first introduced and if there were ever any changes as you

80
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.500
can see this function has been around since version 0 point 7 1.

81
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:40.080
As I stated previously WordPress is a popular choice because most code you write will be compatible

82
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:46.170
with earlier versions not as early as this but you shouldn't have any problems with a few versions back

83
00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:47.670
down further.

84
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:50.510
You'll find a related uses section.

85
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.390
Here you'll find where a function is used within WordPress itself.

86
00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:58.080
This is a really great way to see how WordPress itself uses its own code.

87
00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.960
You'll find some really great examples by reading through the WordPress code itself.

88
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.020
The last section is the user contributed notes section.

89
00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:12.540
This section is available for anyone and everyone to submit some tips and tricks on how you would go

90
00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.390
about using this function.

91
00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:18.490
Something important I should highlight is that not all pages are like this.

92
00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:23.940
Some pages will provide even more information and others will provide very little for the most part

93
00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:29.220
though functions that are commonly used tend to be documented quite well.

94
00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:34.980
I know this is a lot of resources to take in but I promise you we will definitely be going over how

95
00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:37.930
to use both of these resources to your advantage.

96
00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:43.630
To reiterate the Codex is where you'll find information on Wordpress and all its features.

97
00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:50.220
The information presented here is user friendly the developer site provides information related to the

98
00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:51.660
code of WordPress.

99
00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:55.680
A lot of this information is technical and aimed at developers.

100
00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.700
Before I finish things off let's explore the site.

101
00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:05.430
Automatic dot com automatic is a company that makes huge contributions to the WordPress software they

102
00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:08.410
own plugins such as jetpack and commerce.

103
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:14.360
Even though they don't own WordPress they do have a big influence over the open source software.

104
00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:20.730
Automatic owns the dot com domain of WordPress but they do not own WordPress itself.

105
00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:24.790
It's very important to make that distinction anyway that's about it.

106
00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:28.620
We're almost ready to begin writing some code in the next lecture.

107
00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:31.770
We're going to start setting up our system for wordpress development.
