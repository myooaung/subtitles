00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.680
The last thing I want to do is create a log at length.

2
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.370
There is already a log out link inside the admin WordPress bar but I prefer to create one inside the

3
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:17.180
theme.

4
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.350
There are two ways we can go about this.

5
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:24.230
We could edit the theme and add the link or we can use hooks in our case.

6
00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:30.080
Either solution is valid since we're the creator of the theme but hooks work universally and we'll scale

7
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.520
better we'll go with the hooks root inside the main plugin file.

8
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.750
I'm going to add a new filter hook called WP nav menu items

9
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.750
this hook is triggered when WordPress begins to load in the menu items for a theme.

10
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.100
Navigation menu.

11
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.960
It'll be passed in the raw t email menu items for us to manipulate the name of the function I want to

12
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:55.280
call.

13
00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:05.290
We'll be called J you knew now menu items with a priority of 9 9 9 I set a priority to a high number

14
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.410
as I want the logout link to be placed at the end of the menu.

15
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.730
I'm going to create a new file inside the includes slash front folder called log out dash linked up

16
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.190
HP and define the function here.

17
00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.990
Lastly make sure to include it

18
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.360
since this is a filter function will be passed into value and be expected to return it.

19
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.690
The value that's passed in is items which is the raw HCM email menu items.

20
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.190
The first thing I'm going to do is create a conditional statement.

21
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:45.800
I'm going to check if the user is logged in I'll be using the is user logged in function to accomplish

22
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.320
this.

23
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.660
I want to check if they're not logged in.

24
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.500
If they aren't then I'm just going to return the items as it is.

25
00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.300
There's no point in displaying the logout link if they're not logged in in the first place.

26
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.990
If they are logged in then I'm going to generate the link to the logout page.

27
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.590
Create a variable named new link.

28
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:15.400
I'm going to set its value to a pair of opening and closing ally tags in between these tags.

29
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.230
I'm going to call the function WP log in and out.

30
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.060
This function will generate a link to the log in and log out pages of WordPress.

31
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.690
However since we're only displaying this link if the user is logged in it will always show the log out

32
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.590
yourself.

33
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.120
This is fine by us.

34
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.030
This function has two parameters which will want to take advantage of the first parameter is the URL

35
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.600
to redirect the user to if they successfully log out.

36
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.610
I'm going to set this to the home your function I'll pass in a forward slash to indicate I want the

37
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.960
URL to be the route you URL that should set up the redirection.

38
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.020
The second parameter is whether this link should be echoed out or not.

39
00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.270
Since this is a filter function and I'm returning data then I want this link to be returned by default.

40
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.000
This will be set to true which will echo out the link.

41
00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.020
I'm going to change this to false.

42
00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:15.320
To return the link now that the link is generated properly all we have to do is return the items and

43
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:21.960
append the new link variable along with these links after doing so.

44
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.790
Let's refresh the page and see what we get.

45
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.850
The logout link should appear if you're logged in.

46
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:34.270
There is one noticeable problem though the logout link appears in both the primary and secondary navigation

47
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:35.110
menus.

48
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.610
This is a bit redundant.

49
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.670
The filter hook we're using will apply our changes to all menu items regardless of their status or location

50
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:49.170
something I do want to know is that this filter hook will only apply to user generated menu items.

51
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:55.690
As you may know WordPress will automatically generate a menu item if a user doesn't have one set up.

52
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.530
This is usually the case on fresh installations of WordPress.

53
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:06.100
Anyway let's assume the user created a menu and we want the logout link to appear on the secondary menu

54
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.020
item only to force the link to appear in only the secondary menu.

55
00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.510
We only have to make one small change back inside the main plugin file.

56
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.930
We'll have to update the filter hook this filter hook is dynamic.

57
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:22.930
This is optional though to use the dynamic version.

58
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.830
All you have to do is add the menu slug right after the WP.

59
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.590
Now menu phrase in this case it would be secondary.

60
00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:38.900
Just like that the links should appear only on the secondary menu refresh the page to see the final

61
00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:39.790
results.

62
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.080
That should do it if you want to learn more about the log in alt function.

63
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.790
