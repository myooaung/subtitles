00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:06.510
Well are talking about the Course I'm watching.

2
00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.570
And today we're going to talk about initial court offerings otherwise known as i suppose.

3
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:19.360
So let's have a look in our layers of blotching and ICAO can actually happen on two different layers.

4
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:25.760
Most commonly what we see is actually happening on the Tolkien layer where I'm either under a theorem

5
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:32.210
or neo or another protocol somebody creates a new idea or has an idea how to use block change in an

6
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.490
industry or in a different way.

7
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:43.040
And they they then use block chain to all use and I say no to fund this idea.

8
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.680
And that's on the token there.

9
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.660
And at the same time and I see it can also happen on the protocol acquaints there where if somebody

10
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:58.820
comes up with a new protocol for four block chain then they can create it and they can issue the coins

11
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.440
that are going to be in that protocol in an ICU.

12
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.420
So there's just something to keep in mind remember but most commonly you're going to be dealing with

13
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.450
what are you going to be hearing about CEOs of tokens.

14
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.050
All right so let's have a look at how I feel that we were going to do this is we're going to compare

15
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.710
IPOs to CEOs.

16
00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:24.520
An IPO is an initial public offering and it's a way that companies are or have been historically used

17
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.600
to raising money from the stock market.

18
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.630
So let's have a look.

19
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.120
This is an IPO.

20
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.230
And how does it work.

21
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:45.070
Well let's say these three gentlemen Steve Jobs Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne wants to raise some money

22
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.270
for their company Apple.

23
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.690
Right.

24
00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.390
So how does this whole thing work out.

25
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.610
Well at the start they put in work.

26
00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:01.120
They say their labor and some initial capital into the company before any IPO is even considered yet

27
00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:02.570
into this idea.

28
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:08.750
They put in work an initial capital and in return they get shares in that company.

29
00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:16.530
Then what happens is they start producing products computers phones watches and so on and other products.

30
00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.580
And basically the company has products and services and in return it gets a profit.

31
00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.510
So that's how a company can operate before it's publicly listed company.

32
00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:28.890
Well it's a private company.

33
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:36.160
But then once they want to list the company publicly so the shares are available to the general public

34
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.970
for purchase.

35
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:44.530
They they conduct an IPO an initial public offering and what happens there is the public gives cash

36
00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.460
to the company and in return gets shares in that company.

37
00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:57.300
And so that way is a way that companies raise cash in order to fund their operations further.

38
00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.500
So once they know that idea is working and is showing promise they need a lot of capital in order to

39
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.250
grow and scale their business thats how they raise cash.

40
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:13.060
But in return they have to give shares to the community to the people that back or the people that invested

41
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:20.690
into the company and therefore these people are actually entitled to a part of the company even though

42
00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.820
its very small for every single person or might be quite large.

43
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:32.620
For larger investors such as companies so companies can also invest in different companies or investment

44
00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.040
funds.

45
00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:41.770
So with that entitlement to part of the company what comes also is some control and also what comes

46
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:50.050
is some share of profit so if the founders or the people over here they want to pay themselves part

47
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:56.050
of the profit now they are going to just pay themselves they have to pay shares to the public its just

48
00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:02.080
like a very basic overview is of course much more complex than that but in general this is kind of the

49
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.460
idea behind an IPO.

50
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.230
Now lets have a look at see what happens there.

51
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.510
Well the start is very similar.

52
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:15.190
So the founders they create a company lets say this is happening in a parallel universe so that these

53
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.750
companies are not related don't even exist in the same world.

54
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:25.450
And so the founders create a company they invest their work or labor an initial capital to get shares

55
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.590
in car parks and services which generate profit.

56
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.650
And then at some point they decide that they want to raise some more capital they need more money to

57
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.020
scale their idea to scale their business.

58
00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.910
And so in this case what they would do is they would put their products and services into an enclosed

59
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:46.990
environment so to say and they would say Okay so from now on we're going to introduce a coin call that

60
00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:52.750
say the apple kind or to be entirely correct sort of coin its a token right.

61
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.240
And if unless they create their own protocol then you will be a coin.

62
00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:01.030
But if they are creating a just a CEO in the third level it would be a token.

63
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:08.620
So the apple token which you can use to buy our products to get our services and so on and you can always

64
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:14.520
exchange used dollars for Apple tokens and you can still buy our products and services will use those

65
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.760
but will be more expensive so its better off to have Apple tokens and thats going to be like the fuel

66
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.310
of our economy.

67
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.660
How come and how are going to create this little economy of our own where people with Apple tokens are

68
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:30.270
going to be able to buy our products and services.

69
00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.310
And and so on and so on and so basically the public really knows that this company is quite successful.

70
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:36.030
The idea is great.

71
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.880
And so they see the value in having these Apple tokens.

72
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:46.540
And so what theyre going to do is now theyre going to invest money into these Apple tokens in NYCO as

73
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:54.400
soon as these coins or tokens are initially offered public is going to give the company cash or which

74
00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:59.560
usually happens in bitcoin or ether in the current.

75
00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.040
I see it as it were seeing.

76
00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.350
And in return they will get tokens.

77
00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:09.940
So we'll talk more about this further in the study tutorial.

78
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:15.680
But for now the important thing to understand is a conceptual difference and the difference is that

79
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:23.960
in the case of an IPO in the traditional approach the public gets shares and control and entitlement

80
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:30.370
to a share of the profit of the company whereas in ICAO the public gets none of that.

81
00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:37.970
The public just gets these tokens that they can later on spend on the products of the company and services

82
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:46.660
or they can instead late late or wait for these tokens to appreciate and value and sell them off more

83
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.130
at a higher price.

84
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:55.850
What is important here is that the founders of the company they keep all the control of the company

85
00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.140
and they keep all the shares of the profit.

86
00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.910
So that's an important part to remember here.

87
00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:11.770
And other comments here are that IPOs they go through a very stringent legal process.

88
00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:18.040
It's very hard to do and you know lots of lawyers have been well it's very costly it's very rigorously

89
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:27.000
audited and controlled by the government whereas I suppose currently are not or not yet.

90
00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:35.230
And so that's an important thing to keep in mind as well that while an IPO is limited to only two companies

91
00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:41.280
that are ready to take the next step and start scaling and are ready to be publicly listed and I see

92
00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:46.360
what can be done by anybody literally anybody will see examples of that for the dollar as well on this

93
00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:47.140
course.

94
00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:49.090
So that's something else to keep in mind.

95
00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:53.790
So that and I say it is just another way for a company to raise money.

96
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:57.050
You know in order to fund its operations better.

97
00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:03.430
And if you'd like to learn a bit more about CEOs then there's a great article on tech crunch called

98
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:06.870
WITF is an ICAO by Alex with them.

99
00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:08.010
So check it out.

100
00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:13.810
And there you might find some additional information on Lysias.

101
00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:16.390
And on that note we're going to wrap up today's Tauriel.

102
00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:18.270
I look forward to seeing you in the next one.

103
00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:22.310
Are we're going to continue this journey into the world of initial point offerings.

104
00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:24.190
Until then Jeb Bush is.
