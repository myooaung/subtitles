00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.110
Hello and welcome back to the course on block change.

2
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.610
And today we get to talk about the Dow attack.

3
00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:20.180
So the Dow was one of the first decentralized autonomous organizations created by himself and some other

4
00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:20.660
people.

5
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.220
And it was creating cells 16 on the theory.

6
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.180
So you see them as its core protocol.

7
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:35.900
And it was the concept behind it was to create a venture capital fund where it would help organizations.

8
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:42.100
It would help with the development of decentralized applications to run on the theory of block chain

9
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:51.590
meaning that this is like a noble cause to help others start their own projects that would be decentralized

10
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.070
and that would run on the block.

11
00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:02.300
And this dhal organization Bergdahl was stateless so it wasn't it's an interesting fact about it that

12
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:08.830
it didn't belong to any country and that already started raising some questions with authorities.

13
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.890
But there was something that was being sold later.

14
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.730
In the meantime the Dow was crowdfunded.

15
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.590
You threw a token sale.

16
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:25.750
And by May 2016 when the finally was over they raised a hundred and fifty million dollars.

17
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:32.150
That was the most successful crowdfunding campaign in the history of the world.

18
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.970
Fifty million dollars.

19
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:42.980
And yes people just believed in this whole idea of decentralization of making things on the block chain

20
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.730
and moving to this new type of engine a new type of world.

21
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.000
And so it's it's a great thing to see.

22
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:57.620
However unfortunately there was an error in the code of the doll in error in the code of the way the

23
00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.080
smart contracts were coded for this our a recession.

24
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.520
As we discussed previously.

25
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.870
So it's decentralized forms are exemptions they are governed entirely by smart contracts rather than

26
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:09.450
people.

27
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:20.180
And therefore the dot was hacked attacked and hacked on June 2016 for 50 million dollars and the interesting

28
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.010
concept or notion here is that the attacker didn't actually do anything illegal.

29
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:32.630
They just found this flaw in the code and they used it to leech money out of the dollar account into

30
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:33.600
their own account.

31
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.890
And so everybody saw this happening everybody saw the money moving like just being leeched from from

32
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.860
one account to the other and nobody could do anything about.

33
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.240
Nobody could do anything because the Dow is a total mess.

34
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.270
You can just tell them what to do it does things on its own.

35
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.340
It's governed by its own algorithms some code.

36
00:02:52.550 --> 00:03:00.220
And and at the same time there's this flaw in the contract which allows the attacker to perform this

37
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.660
as a valid transaction is a valid part of the contract.

38
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.550
And and the contract is immutable You cannot change a contract because once it's on the block chain

39
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.600
it's on the block chain you can just go and change things around because it would defeat the purpose

40
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.040
of the blotching.

41
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.840
And so that was a major problem.

42
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:30.100
However the good news was that the funds were cut again once again according to the way the Dow was

43
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.880
coded.

44
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:37.580
There was a failsafe mechanism which meant that funds cannot be taken out entirely.

45
00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.640
Like even though the tech and all the other accounts that was a child the company of the Dow and then

46
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.320
they could move them out later on to their own account.

47
00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.200
They've completely taken away.

48
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.980
But they will have to wait 30 days or somewhere around 30 days.

49
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.810
And so in that time the whole community had an opportunity to think and decide what to do.

50
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.760
And so there was a dilemma.

51
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.330
Dilemma is the is the Cold War is more or not.

52
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:11.320
And what that says is on one hand part of the community said no we're not going to do anything about

53
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.390
it because code is law.

54
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:14.850
That's how the contract was coded.

55
00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:20.150
And we cannot just go and change things that are supposed to be immutable.

56
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.240
And so we have to use it as it is.

57
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.860
The other part of the community said that no is too much money.

58
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:32.050
Fifty billion dollars belongs to people so we're going to we're going to do a hard four and we'll talk

59
00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.670
about forks in the next interval.

60
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:43.940
We'll do a hard fork of the chain and we will change the rules and basically for what they said it's

61
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.220
like we'll do we'll do the hard work and we'll change the rules.

62
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.450
And that means that we'll be able to change the

63
00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:01.170
rules of this contract we'll basically revert the rules of this contract so that we can pull the money

64
00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.430
back and give it back to the owners.

65
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:09.720
And so there was this dilemma even eventually they ended up doing a hard for it was the title IX initiative

66
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:16.350
to do the fork and they did the hard for it and now hard for it doesn't always imply that there's going

67
00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:17.230
to be a split.

68
00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.580
But in this case there was a split.

69
00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.870
And because some people were not really not happy with that decision that because they wanted to protect

70
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:31.580
their attacker but because they they wanted to preserve the integrity of this concept of the blotching

71
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:36.270
that if there's a smart contract it's a contract for a reason.

72
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:42.040
You cannot just go in and work things and that hard for theory was split into theory.

73
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.080
Anything classic.

74
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:51.660
So what we'll see in the next tutorial is on this version of ethereal hackers money went back to the

75
00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.960
Dow and go distribute back to people.

76
00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.130
But in this version of ethereal if you classic.

77
00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.000
The hackers money stage.

78
00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.590
Of course it's like it's like two parallel worlds.

79
00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:08.750
After a hard fought like two parallel worlds worlds and basically this money it's got duplicated among

80
00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.060
the two in this one it got returned to the owners.

81
00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:18.000
And this one it went to the Hague I know it sounds very very insane like how can we just make out of

82
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.780
$50 billion.

83
00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.220
How can we make double the amount.

84
00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.440
But that's how it works.

85
00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:28.340
We'll discuss this more in the coming tutorial and also I'll recommend some reading just now.

86
00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:36.420
And in the end the hacker walked away with 67 million dollars in 3M Classic.

87
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.010
Classic 67.

88
00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:44.160
That's because this was calculated later and the exchange changed so at the time it was less.

89
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:51.650
But if they held on to their money then at some point it became six to seven million dollars.

90
00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:59.610
And so another important thing to note here that the problem was in the Dow code not in the theory itself

91
00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:04.470
it was a problem in how the smart contract was coded not the platform.

92
00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.750
So this was a short overview of the attack.

93
00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:09.770
I know a few things might still be confusing.

94
00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:18.370
For instance how could everybody walk away happy that both the Dow investors got their money back and

95
00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:23.320
they either feed the gods in their money so how could that be possible.

96
00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:27.560
Well we'll talk more about Forex in an upcoming tutorial.

97
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:32.570
But for now if you'd like to learn more about the dollar tax like all the details how it all unraveled

98
00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:41.250
and everything worked then I would like to recommend a wonderful piece by Bloomberg.

99
00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.240
It's called the ether thief.

100
00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:48.570
We'll include the link in the course notes and it's very well written.

101
00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:55.180
It reads like a story or like a like a thriller or a detective story.

102
00:07:55.180 --> 00:08:02.490
You can see like additional comments and quotes you can always go to the right here and find out the

103
00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:09.010
details of things that are being discussed on the left you will receive of the code if you want to have

104
00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:14.470
a look at what they're talking about where where the error in the code was and things like that and

105
00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:15.410
I will.

106
00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:21.280
Another thing I like is that here they are and they say it's been about a year since the attack so they've

107
00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:25.930
added some information or maybe that's the time when they wrote it.

108
00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:31.340
Nevertheless there is some aftermath on what happened and things like that.

109
00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:33.850
So great piece by Bloomberg.

110
00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:39.160
You can definitely find out all the details you need or want from from here.

111
00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:40.530
It's called the ether.

112
00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:49.450
And yeah I hope you are excited like not about that task but just like about forks and the whole notion

113
00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:56.890
that people are super supportive of this world that they are investing millions of dollars that there

114
00:08:57.030 --> 00:09:04.930
is this promise basically that shows that there's promise in actions and in decentralized organizations

115
00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:05.350
and apps.

116
00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:08.510
I know even though this one failed you know that's how things start.

117
00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:15.000
They started they fail and then eventually after a few mistakes we learned and we changed the world.

118
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:15.950
There we go.

119
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.560
So I hope today's tutorial and 14:6 that until then Gibler change.
