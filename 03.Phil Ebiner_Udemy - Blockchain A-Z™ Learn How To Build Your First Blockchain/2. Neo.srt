00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:06,670
Hi everyone and welcome back in this video we're going to be taking a look at the platform and the neo

2
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:08,040
cryptocurrency.

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:13,840
Before we get started we can examine a few pieces of interesting information related to Neal.

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:20,170
It was released in 2014 ended up going through a rebranding and a really interesting note is that it's

5
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:26,980
known as the Chinese theory one benefit of Neo and we're going to get into it later is that it's very

6
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:32,920
useful for developers because it offers a range of mainstream programming languages to use to develop

7
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:33,340
with.

8
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,650
So keep that in mind as you move through the documentation.

9
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:42,040
Very easy to use at least from the development side known as a Chinese 3M release in 2014 and went through

10
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,930
a rebranding but let's jump right into it.

11
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:52,620
Similar to our other block chain platforms and coin's the base asset of the neo block chain is the neo

12
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:59,820
Tokie a benefit of Neo is that it supports a range of languages such as JavaScript and C++ by using

13
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,710
a customized version of docker called neo V.M..

14
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,840
And this will come into play a little later.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
But imagine for the developers standpoint being able to use specific languages or a range of languages

16
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,270
makes it very efficient very easy to implement and work with.

17
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:24,120
Also we saw in our introduction that Neal was launched originally in 2014 but as it shares through the

18
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:32,140
development company one chain and rebranded to Neo in 2017 a few months ago in March one chain.

19
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:39,740
Remember the one chain is the parent company distributed one ontology token for every five Nio in a

20
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:46,000
wallet that will be used to vote on things such as system upgrades and government issues on the neo

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,750
platform.

22
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,080
Similar to some other coins.

23
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,260
Neo is a nonprofit community based block chain project.

24
00:01:54,270 --> 00:02:01,050
It's open source and get help and the organization aims to help transform the smart economy remember

25
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:04,590
block chain and crypto are part of the disruptive technologies.

26
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,160
But let's take a look at the documentation and get

27
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,580
and we could see it listed here.

28
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:18,200
If you want to get more into the technicalities and the information related to it you can scroll through

29
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:22,330
see the support platforms development information how to contribute.

30
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:28,320
You can scroll through the repository niÃ±os you see open source released under the MIT license.

31
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,980
This is just a great reference if you want to scroll through further.

32
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:35,840
Remember you can visit it at good hub dot com slash Nio dash project slash new

33
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:45,550
and with that recurring theme with me you know we have the emphasis of the smart contract one aspect

34
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:49,540
and benefit is that it pushes the benefits for those looking to work with it.

35
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,240
Developers can easily get started with smart contracts.

36
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:58,600
Remember earlier we mentioned that it offers a range of programming languages that you are able to develop

37
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,320
with.

38
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:04,900
This helps because for instance if you're only used to working with one so you're working with Python

39
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:10,080
you can pick it up you won't have to learn a specific language to work with this.

40
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:16,770
As a developer and now we arrive at the distribution one of the key aspects of the cryptocurrency a

41
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:23,710
hundred million Nio were created in Genesis with 50 million Neo sold to early investors and the remaining

42
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:30,940
50 million locked into a smart contract each year 15 million are unlocked for the development team to

43
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,390
fund long term development goals gas tokens.

44
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:42,160
The alternative tokin are used to pay for transactions on the network and gas is generated at a rate

45
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,010
of eight gas per block.

46
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:52,210
Production is reduced by one token for every two million blocks and around the year 2039 gas circulation

47
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:55,200
will reach a hundred million and production will cease.

48
00:03:55,210 --> 00:04:01,260
Gas can be divided though unlike Neo and also for consensus.

49
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:10,960
Neo uses the deligated Byzantine fault tolerant consensus and its similar to steller and for some related

50
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:11,620
information.

51
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:20,610
This actually just happened very recently on July 4th 2000 18 Nijo entered the era of decentralization.

52
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,550
Keep that in mind for the near future.

53
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:29,830
And on a side note not to digress too much but a great method of keeping up with how these crypto currencies

54
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:34,650
how these platforms are doing is always to check their documentation to check their blogs.

55
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:40,400
Quite a few of them have blogs and put out press releases and just general information quite often.

56
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,630
Because with these Kryptos they're trying to be very transparent with block chain.

57
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:49,150
It's definitely one of the benefits that we can see is the transparency and with this you can scroll

58
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,790
through and take a look at the blog here.

59
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:55,960
Again other crypto currencies other platforms have them as well.

60
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:01,870
Just another great way to keep on top of information whether it's just technical or how the corn is

61
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:05,470
performing or any recent partnerships with the company.

62
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:10,930
As we wrap it up here with Neal The organization hopes to revive the connection between digital and

63
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:15,940
physical assets through a digital identity and its use of smart contracts.

64
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:21,420
Once the assets have been digitized decentralization and transparency become key and this is really

65
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,960
what E-o names are revived by using its blague train platform

66
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:34,160
so as an overview NIO is seen as the Chinese theorem has many benefits one of them being the adaptability

67
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,390
and use for developers.

68
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:41,600
Since you're able to take it on with many languages it's very transparent open sourced designed to build

69
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:45,010
a scalable network of decentralized applications.

70
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:54,320
Has the distribution created genesis of 100 million Neo coins and with the recent move into the era

71
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,430
of decentralization.

72
00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:01,850
On July 4th it's going to be interesting to see how this performs and keep in mind pay attention to

73
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:07,430
see which companies are which backing pick it up over the next year or two along with how the market

74
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,070
performs.

75
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:13,760
It's always interesting to analyze how the market is performing related to how these companies are being

76
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,960
supported along with who is picking them up as always.

77
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:23,850
If you have any questions please feel free to share them and enjoy cryptocurrency.
