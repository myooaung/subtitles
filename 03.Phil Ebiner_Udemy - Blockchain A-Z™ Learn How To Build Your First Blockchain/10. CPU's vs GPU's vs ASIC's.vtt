1
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.000
Alone will come back to the course on blotching.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.970
And today we're talking about hardware.

3
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.870
We're going to dive into the world of different types of mining hardware that miners use to solve the

4
00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:15.250
cryptographic hash puzzle.

5
00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.710
And specifically we'll talk about CBS News and A-6.

6
00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:19.870
All right let's get started.

7
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.360
So C-p you all heard the term central processing units.

8
00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:29.020
That's the main microchip inside our laptops or computers that's where everything goes through all the

9
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.570
commands go through and that's where they get executed.

10
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.830
It's like the center of operations for our computer.

11
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.010
And as you can imagine as the center of operations it has to be very versatile because it has to take

12
00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:45.010
charge of lots of different things and therefore it's very general in its nature is very powerful.

13
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.320
It can do very sophisticated things.

14
00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:55.180
So but at the same time it's in general so meaning it's not specialized to one specific thing and therefore

15
00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:02.890
it can definitely solve the shudder 156 Hashid can calculate it can calculate it compared to a human.

16
00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.200
Very fast.

17
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.090
But it is limited at about 10 mega hashes per second.

18
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.590
So 10 million hashes per second which in human terms it sounds like a lot but in terms of the overall

19
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.830
high rate of the bid Gwynedd work just taking just the kinetic work for instance.

20
00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:26.500
That is not that much because the hasher rate there is like 22 million trillion hushes per second.

21
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.740
So then we move on to more specialized components into the world of more specialized devices.

22
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.410
And the first one is HGP the graphics processing unit.

23
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:44.200
That's the basic unit that is the video card in our graphics card in our laptops or computers.

24
00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:45.680
And why is it specialized.

25
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.080
Well let's first put this here.

26
00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.870
It is specialized and why is this special is because it is designed to work with graphics and operations

27
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.620
that is specialized for our matrix operations.

28
00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:02.680
So matrix operations are those are required in order for videos to work for graphics to appear on our

29
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.340
screens and so on.

30
00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.860
And that is what the graphics of the GP is specifically tailored for to solve matrix operations major

31
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:19.630
Perrault's patients and now the matrix operations and that specific zation is already a benefit for

32
00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.340
their hash calculation as well.

33
00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:31.240
So with that specialization the GP who is able to solve hash is OK the hash is faster because the way

34
00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:38.770
to think about it is compared to the you it doesn't have lots of other components or functionalities

35
00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:39.900
that the CBO has.

36
00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.990
But because of that it is more efficient.

37
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.140
So it can do as many things as the Sibiu but because it because it has less components it's also more

38
00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:53.290
efficient at things that it can do and therefore the speed here is up to one DIGA hash per second which

39
00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.880
is 1 billion hashes per second.

40
00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.380
And then in 2014 something incredible happened.

41
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:08.410
The first A-6 device was shipped to a consumer in January 2014 and that changed the world of bitcoin

42
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.660
mining forever.

43
00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:17.680
Successful application specified specific integrated circuit and these devices are totally and utterly

44
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:24.170
specialized for one thing and one thing only and that is to calculate the Sharda 156 hash.

45
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:31.390
And so the way it works will have a look at an example just now but the way it works is that that integrated

46
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:38.170
circuit of this device is designed in such a way that the device doesn't have to perform any operations

47
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.010
like put this bit here.

48
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:46.510
And these two bits divide this by this and so on like the ECB or the GPO the async device just relies

49
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:53.320
exclusively on its circuit to perform that perform that calculation so as electricity runs through the

50
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:59.310
device just because of the architecture of the device the calculation is performed.

51
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:05.200
All that kind of physical level rather than on a logical level and therefore asix can achieve incredible

52
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.320
speeds over 1000 giga hashes per second.

53
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.510
So over one trillion one trillion hashes per second.

54
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.220
So there we go.

55
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.820
That's the three main types.

56
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.170
The differences as you can see they get more specialized as we go down this letter.

57
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.170
And while we're on the slide I just wanted to mention one more thing.

58
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:29.530
There's this type of mining called Cloud mining and that is when miners rent equipment of premises somewhere

59
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:35.980
far away and they pay a fee in order for that group and to participate participate in mining on their

60
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.400
behalf and therefore.

61
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:45.370
So they are just paying a fee in order to use someone else's basically equipment that is life like a

62
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.820
big server room or something like that.

63
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:50.560
Kind of like cloud computing or cloud storage.

64
00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.660
That's also a type of mining.

65
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.620
Miners can engage in.

66
00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:04.230
So there we go those are our types of different mining you GP you a sick cloud mining and here we have

67
00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.450
an example of an async integrated circuit.

68
00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.520
Just wanted to show you what it is like.

69
00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.420
I'm not an expert in electrical engineering whatsoever.

70
00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:21.030
But in this circuit in itself is designed in a way to calculate the shot 256 hash.

71
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.940
So basically as the electricity is running I'm not sure if it's going this way or that way but as electricity

72
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:32.850
is running through the circuit the calculations are being performed just by the structure by the way

73
00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:40.710
the electricity goes through the circuit rather than as in a you or or a GP you have to be psychological

74
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.960
operations with bits and bytes and things like that.

75
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.970
Here it just goes like input it just runs through it.

76
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:51.150
Output done at the same time it's important to note that.

77
00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.750
So first of all what you can see is that A-6 completely blue blow.

78
00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:01.300
So it's you abuse or abuse or abuse out of the water is exploding abuse of the water.

79
00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.750
So there's no point in using LGB you if somebody is using an AC at the same time it's important to note

80
00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.510
that A-6 can only be used for certain groups of currencies such as Bitcoin.

81
00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:17.550
You can use A-6 for Bitcoin because Bitcoin uses the Shatru 1:56 ASH and they are most A-6 are specifically

82
00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.520
designed for that.

83
00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:26.340
Whereas for example the theory we use is that if hash we haven't spoken about this but there is a different

84
00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:34.020
type of hash called the hash their own version of hash which is a memory heavy which is memory dependent

85
00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:41.640
and the term for it meaning that it requires access memory in order to pool soup's upside or random

86
00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.560
numbers from there to calculate the hash.

87
00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:50.250
So the async won't be the speed of basic won't be beneficial because you have to access the memory anyway

88
00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:56.320
so your speed of calculating hash will be limited by your access to memory speed and therefore you might

89
00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:04.020
to say that is theory is designed to withstand A-6 so that people cannot bring asix and start mining

90
00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:10.380
a theorem of it and therefore A-6 can be used on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency these shots on refugees

91
00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:10.930
hash.

92
00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:17.490
Or you could design A-6 for other types of hash like you could create different type of A-6 for a different

93
00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:19.690
type of action or use them there.

94
00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:25.170
But you cannot create an ASAC or so far nobody's been successful in creating async type solution for

95
00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:32.700
them because it's very heavy so in theory you can still use use because there are no A-6 to outperform

96
00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:33.590
that Yippies.

97
00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:41.290
So that's something important to note and so let's move onto some examples though.

98
00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:48.890
Cheryl let's first go to the search so I had to do a search for Gippi you mining rig and you'll see

99
00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:51.200
some examples so here you go to six.

100
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:56.550
You got six graphics processing unit six graphics cards basically sound thousands.

101
00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:58.220
And here you got.

102
00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:00.420
Not sure what that is.

103
00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:07.440
So you know like the price always depends of course on the highest rates and things like that.

104
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:10.310
And so this one was that whereas the one this one

105
00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:20.340
so shark I had to look at your shark is operating system as that cache theory am bitcoin mining and

106
00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:20.840
so on.

107
00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:23.630
You know like you can see the hash race here.

108
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:30.570
So question like no knowing what we know now from the tutorial and trivia.

109
00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:32.310
Why do they have Bitcoin here.

110
00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:37.760
Why would they say Bitcoin if it's a B you might.

111
00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:43.080
We know that G-B use are completely outdated for Bitcoin there's async devices there's no point.

112
00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:49.500
So if you just search for Bitcoin on this page is that Quantrell f bit coin.

113
00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:56.860
You will see that there is nowhere to be seen on the end like or is

114
00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:03.260
can be exchanged to bitcoin.

115
00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:05.100
See that's their claim.

116
00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:08.490
But if you look at the compatible currencies Bitcoin isn't actually here.

117
00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:13.550
This is just a marketing thing is false advertising that they're saying Bitcoin here just trying to

118
00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:20.060
get people who don't understand these things that you cannot mine Bitcoin have GP use anymore because

119
00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:25.810
as they said to us it just clicked here or maybe people are searching Google or ebay for my.

120
00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:32.210
So you know it's a way for them to get their product on on the on people on the front page or on people's

121
00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:32.850
eyes.

122
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:35.670
But in reality this is good for only certain things.

123
00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:42.860
Therian saccharine is a classic and so on so in theory I'm here so you can see that cash I like assuming

124
00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:46.970
that that is linked to that is the OEM thing that that's about right.

125
00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:51.200
Two hundred mega hashes per second for six to be used as of right.

126
00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:53.920
The fasters just be you ruthenium mining.

127
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:57.800
If we have a look here there are about Bassui.

128
00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:02.050
So this is just an article on croupe toys r us.

129
00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:06.290
So the first ones here you can see 31 32 25.

130
00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:14.570
So they were go so 610 studios about 180 mega hashes per second this fastest one ever is like 41 mega

131
00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:15.150
hashes.

132
00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:21.290
Again another important thing to note is you cannot compare what this shows is you cannot compare the

133
00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:29.800
hash rate between two different Crypta currencies because in theory you know its one type of hash in

134
00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:32.040
Zed cash is another type of.

135
00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.330
So one might be easier to solve one might be harder to solve.

136
00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:41.720
So therefore the rates will be different so only compare high rates if you are talking about the same

137
00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:47.030
crypto currency so if you took them out this Syria then you can compare two different devices on how

138
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.670
much hasher.

139
00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:51.740
If you're talking about two different currencies it's not a good idea because it's going to be misleading

140
00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:52.920
results.

141
00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:59.480
And what I like about that example is also that as you can see we're diving into the world of these

142
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:03.440
hardware of these devices we're learning more about cryptocurrency themselves.

143
00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:08.180
We're learning that theory is different to Bitcoin in the sense that it is a different type of hash

144
00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:14.360
that uses it as is hash versus Bitcoin which uses shut channel 56 We're also learning that you cannot

145
00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:19.880
compare different hasher is from different systems so for instance if I show you here the high rates

146
00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:26.920
of Mirriam you will see right away that like you you can see that that's how many hashes have shared

147
00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:28.280
Guga hashes per second.

148
00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:34.700
Two hundred fifty thousand giga hashes per second versus the Bitcoin 22 million trillion dollars per

149
00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:35.240
second.

150
00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:38.730
But now we know we can actually compare the two side by side.

151
00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:42.710
So it doesn't really say much to us in that sense.

152
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:50.060
Like these guys are hashing one type or solving one type of hash the ones in Bitcoin are solving a different

153
00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:50.760
type of hash.

154
00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:57.350
So what you could look at is the growth in the percentage growth in the rate you know and compare that

155
00:11:57.350 --> 00:12:01.040
side by side because that's like you know it's just a percentage.

156
00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:05.810
How much did the high rate grow in the past month or in the past year and that will tell us how fast

157
00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:12.680
the network is growing how many more players are joining or how quickly the computing power or the computing

158
00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.300
power is growing.

159
00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:18.480
How popular a network is by comparing just the right to the right.

160
00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:19.960
That's that's a no no.

161
00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:20.580
OK.

162
00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:27.090
So those are our GP use and this we want to A-6.

163
00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:29.270
So what does an async look like.

164
00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:32.570
Do do do do look at that ha.

165
00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:41.150
When I saw this for the first time I was so shocked like this little use beefsteak 333 mega hash is

166
00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:42.660
per second.

167
00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:47.690
I get it you can't really compare we can compare to what we had there.

168
00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:55.940
But like if you don't know that then like you compared to this we have 60 years but nevertheless even

169
00:12:55.940 --> 00:13:08.030
if you take even if you take like a an old type of GP you that was used to solve the hash puzzle on

170
00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:10.670
what's it called on Bitcoin.

171
00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:20.210
This like this is insane 333 mega hashes and we said that the GP would only go up to like one Gieger

172
00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:22.920
hash one Google hash.

173
00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:28.070
And this is like 330 Meghan's with a tiny stick on Bitcoin.

174
00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:32.510
And so that that's as crazy.

175
00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:39.070
And that's what A-6 devices did to the world of block change or blotching that use shot 256.

176
00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:40.320
And then you could see the bigger one.

177
00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:44.990
So this is just like some toy type of things that are real but they're good for playing around getting

178
00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:46.610
to know things that are quite small.

179
00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:52.680
There's one in Lucas Moira's be 1.60 second but so I'm actually here you can see the integrated circuit

180
00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:52.910
right.

181
00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:55.990
So you can see that there it is.

182
00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.120
That's that's the culprit.

183
00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:58.990
That's where the electricity goes in and out.

184
00:13:59.000 --> 00:13:59.940
Bam done.

185
00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:04.090
And everything is solved.

186
00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:09.550
Couple of what is it called 300 million times per second.

187
00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.180
Insane but.

188
00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:12.820
So these are the bigger A-6.

189
00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:18.110
These are the ones that you see like in the industrial level type of minds you know racked up together

190
00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:22.540
and racks and so important to note those are not if it's a bitcoin mine there's are not to be used.

191
00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:25.880
Those are A-6 as.

192
00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:31.670
So there is if you use the 1000 giga hash or this one goes up to like this is mega hash this is what

193
00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:36.760
Google has just 1000 gewgaw hash 1000 times faster than that and they leave the water cooling and make

194
00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:39.050
it all noise make a lot of heat.

195
00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:39.790
Yeah.

196
00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:42.810
And so those are asix here.

197
00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:47.870
You can see them here and based best basic devices.

198
00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:51.830
So here we go another article from tech creator.

199
00:14:52.300 --> 00:15:03.280
So there you can see like what me and mine are asinine would you get thirteen point five thousand Keiga

200
00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:07.420
hashes thirteen point five trillion trillion.

201
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:10.080
So Tara hushes trillion is per second.

202
00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:18.370
Yep you can then you know cut power usage is also presents you need to calculate that and so on.

203
00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:19.110
So there we go.

204
00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:19.660
Those are.

205
00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:21.380
That's what they look like.

206
00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:31.650
So hopefully seeing what that looks like will help better also understand you know just memorize what

207
00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:32.070
they are.

208
00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:37.520
And finally for today's additional reading I've got an interesting article I found this interesting

209
00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:39.640
it's on J.

210
00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:42.080
Pradeep dot com.

211
00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:45.200
And again we'll link this in the course notes.

212
00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:50.920
This one is about theorems memory Hardwick's hardness explained and the road to mining with custom hardware.

213
00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:54.580
It's quite a hardware or technical article.

214
00:15:54.580 --> 00:16:05.340
A little bit long but it explains quite well what's why the theory is a called a memory hard or memory

215
00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:11.920
bounds type of hash that it actually has to access.

216
00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:19.130
And as to access memory to ignore the Dagh file in order to pull out the pages in order to calculate

217
00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:22.440
its hash and that's why that's where the bandwidth is limited.

218
00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:27.150
So if you want to learn more about that's about the theory hash rate which is hash.

219
00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:28.460
Then check out this article.

220
00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:35.460
And yeah on that note I hope you enjoy this tutorial and the dive into the world of hardware of Bitcoin

221
00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:37.050
and other cryptocurrency mining.

222
00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:38.810
And I look forward to seeing you next time.

223
00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:40.470
Until then enjoy lotions.
