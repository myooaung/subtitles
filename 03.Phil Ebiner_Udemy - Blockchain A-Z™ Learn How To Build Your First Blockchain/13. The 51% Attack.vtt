00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.640
Hello and welcome back to the course of action.

2
00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:12.660
And today we're talking about the dreaded 51 percent attack.

3
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.770
If you've been following this course and reading the supplementary materials or you've been just talking

4
00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.780
to people about block chain then one way or another you've probably already come across you want the

5
00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:28.960
51 percent attack and maybe somebody has mentioned it or you've read it somewhere and this is an attack

6
00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:39.700
that it's a hypothetical attack but it could possibly happen and it's so common the feared or discussed

7
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:46.270
by blockaders and minors because it's so interesting and also because of the consequences that it can

8
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.450
have.

9
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.420
And today we'll talk about two things.

10
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.420
First we'll talk about what the 1 percent attack is not and then we'll talk about what the future on

11
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.660
an attack is.

12
00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:04.510
So let's start with the first one the 51 percent attack is not an attack designed to tamper with an

13
00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.780
individual or select blocks.

14
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.080
This is not the 51st attack.

15
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.920
The reason for that is why I decided that it's important for us to mention this is because back in one.

16
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:21.830
Remember how long ago that was when we were still just learning the bare foundations of what changed.

17
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.540
Well we had a tutorial about distributed peer to peer networks and there was an example that distributed

18
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.560
networks are great because for an attacker to hypothetically tamper with a bloke they would not only

19
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.340
have to hack into the computer or one person on top of this block and then with this.

20
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.080
And then you know a change that has changed Hashana hashed and rehashed all these blocks falling but

21
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.300
they would have to do that on many different computers or at least you know like half of all the computers

22
00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:57.340
so that that was just an example to illustrate the concept of the power of distributed networks in the

23
00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.840
proper 51 percent attack.

24
00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:05.650
What we talk about is 51 percent of the hash rate not 51 percent of the nodes that type that or this

25
00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.720
hypothetical example that we just described which is not even considered an attack because it's impossible

26
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.370
as well.

27
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.520
As well as the Bosch is a concern.

28
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.940
It's just it's just improved pretty much impossible to do that simply because you would have to hack

29
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.880
into computers of not just miners but you'd have to get hacked into computers of nodes who are also

30
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.570
part of the network and that those there's so many more of those than miners.

31
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.640
So that is basically the bottom line here is that that is the future on business and that is not that

32
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:46.190
is impractical or impossible even if you have more than 50 percent of it.

33
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:52.240
So on that note we're going to move on to what the 51 percent attack actually is.

34
00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.550
So here is what it is.

35
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.600
So here we've got our miters.

36
00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.770
This is the hole that will go miners.

37
00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.320
This might not be like Bitcoin.

38
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.660
As you can see we have eight binders here might be some other smaller cryptocurrency is more bloodshed

39
00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.600
like a start up type of collection is only and plus we're not illustrating all of them as old age here

40
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.330
and maybe in total is like 800 or something minor is on the chain.

41
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:21.550
So far eight thousand and they're just doing their thing mining the blogs.

42
00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.120
You know there's some more blogs come in and so on.

43
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:32.230
And then all of a sudden this other group of miners adjoins them and joins the network.

44
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.500
And so here they are as you can see they're red.

45
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.630
So that's a hint that they're malicious.

46
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.840
They're evil minors.

47
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.560
And what they do is they say hey guys can we join your network we want to mind your amazing cryptocurrency

48
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.640
with you let's do this together or in fact they don't.

49
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:49.960
They don't actually.

50
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.560
They don't actually talk that much.

51
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:59.390
They just go to this network and they get a copy of this of this chain.

52
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:00.750
They get a copy of the chain.

53
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.120
They get you know they set themselves up as if they're going to mind the network.

54
00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.840
So they get it what do they get they get a copy of the chain they get their meme pools they get all

55
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:08.760
everything set up.

56
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:14.140
And so we're got to just remember that the part in the point in time when they came into the network

57
00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.250
was this block this was the most recent blog we're going to put an hour ago.

58
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.510
And then what these guys do is they like.

59
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:20.160
All right.

60
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:27.700
So Nora and they close themselves off from the whole world so they just cut off the connection and they

61
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.170
don't broadcast anything back to the network and in fact they don't even care what the network tries

62
00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.810
to broadcast.

63
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.370
They just do their own thing now.

64
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.140
And so what are they going to do.

65
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.630
So these attackers are just going to keep whining.

66
00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:45.380
That's all they're doing there's nothing nothing like really the the concept of the attack is an attack

67
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.630
but they're not going to be doing anything illegal or breaking into anybody's computers or anything

68
00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:50.380
like that.

69
00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.180
So then what happens.

70
00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.580
These guys keep fighting.

71
00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.500
They get two blocks up to a certain time in the same time because there's more miners here.

72
00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.210
They have more hash rate.

73
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:01.120
They get more blocks.

74
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.300
They get four blocks.

75
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.750
These guys get blocks these guys get five blocks.

76
00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:05.980
These guys get three blocks.

77
00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.110
These guys get for four books or something like that.

78
00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:10.290
Yeah.

79
00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:17.430
So basically as we can see because there's more of them as more time passes.

80
00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:23.550
These these are my sample books these mine more blocks and the difference between them increases.

81
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.800
And then all of a sudden.

82
00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:32.080
So and the key thing here is that they're closed off certain they're not broadcasting information about

83
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.440
the blocks that they're mining to this network.

84
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:35.030
They're not.

85
00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.410
So this network is just doing their own thing.

86
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.470
They don't even know that you know they they don't even know that was going on here.

87
00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.990
They just think this is the only version of the chain.

88
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:52.600
And then these miners all of a sudden open up open up the seal they get back online they connect back

89
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.720
to this network and they do start broadcasting they start broadcasting the network.

90
00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.090
And so what is what happens here.

91
00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.890
So now we have all of a sudden this whole full that grew.

92
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.690
Now this becomes a full network and this full network we have two competing chains.

93
00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.460
We have one competing chain and second competing shape.

94
00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:15.340
And what is our golden rule of thumb How are how is the algorithm going to decide which is the correct

95
00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:15.780
change.

96
00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:25.300
The golden rule is that the longest chain wins longest chain is king and therefore these blocks are

97
00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:25.740
invalid.

98
00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.450
So the algorithm will look and will see OK up to here.

99
00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:30.660
The chains are identical.

100
00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:32.710
And then from here they are different.

101
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.420
OK so which one is longer this was longer.

102
00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:35.000
This one wins.

103
00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.770
This one has to go away as the die off.

104
00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:41.400
And so basically these guys effectively turn red.

105
00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.420
They become part of this chain.

106
00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:44.570
Now they're part of this chain.

107
00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:53.350
And so you know again there's there has been no no nothing illegal happening nobody's like hacked into

108
00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:56.300
everybody's computer what is the problem here what's wrong.

109
00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:07.330
Well what is wrong is that now like if these miners were smart from the start then they can have could

110
00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:12.670
have gained a significant advantage or they could have gained.

111
00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:17.920
You know like profits from the double spend problem.

112
00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:19.000
And how does that happen.

113
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.030
We mentioned the double spam problem.

114
00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:27.490
Previously we merged the double spend problem in the tutorial on orphan blocks and what that means is

115
00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:33.670
that now that these blocks have been canceled out all of their transactions remember what happens to

116
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:35.410
all the transactions in these blocks.

117
00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:38.270
Well they get released back into the meme pool.

118
00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:41.290
And since now they're in the meme pool.

119
00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:46.720
They are no longer Kuro their own confirmed transactions Uraga valid.

120
00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.550
So what these miners could have done is before.

121
00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:56.830
So at the very start back here when this block was being added They could have just gone to this network

122
00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:04.300
and not as miners but as nodes and they could have just purchased lots of stuff so they could have taken

123
00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:04.660
whatever.

124
00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:12.610
If this is Bitcoin they could have gone and took their Bitcoin and bought yachts and Ferrari's and airplanes

125
00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:13.650
and our exchange.

126
00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:19.830
Other good one is the exchange that bitcoin for like to coin a bitcoin cash and ether and other things.

127
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:26.860
So like spend spend a lot of money a lot of the cryptocurrency and then.

128
00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.630
So those transactions would have gone into that block.

129
00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:35.470
But now that block is cancelled out so the transactions are free to go but the transactions get out

130
00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:36.170
of the block.

131
00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:43.690
But they keep their assets or they keep their like coins or Bitcoin cash or ether or Ferrari's whatever

132
00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:48.820
it is they just get to keep it because it's cryptocurrency Well nobody will actually.

133
00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.490
Nobody actually knows who they are right.

134
00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:55.480
It's all it's all done through keys and sold and it's all done anonymously nobody can find them or track

135
00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:55.930
them down.

136
00:08:55.930 --> 00:09:02.620
That's a that's a huge advantage of cryptocurrency so nobody will ever find who they are is going to

137
00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:07.120
get to keep all their things that they bought and what happens to those transactions.

138
00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:07.840
Good question.

139
00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:08.050
Right.

140
00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:09.440
So what happens.

141
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:12.030
Well like a lot of people don't really.

142
00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:17.520
Well as far as I can imagine they don't really look like this through like a lot of people stop the

143
00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.590
stop.

144
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.430
I guess explanation or analysis of a problem there.

145
00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:27.790
But the trend actually really is back to the temple so how come there are those whose actions can go

146
00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:33.370
back into New blocks right so the transaction that this person or this miner bought a Ferrari can go

147
00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:34.830
back into a new block here.

148
00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:39.970
But it's because they still control 51 percent of the rate they're not going to let that happen.

149
00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:43.660
They're not going to pick that transaction to go into the next block.

150
00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:48.820
These guys might try to do that but they have less power or hash in power so these guys are more likely

151
00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:54.400
to put in the next block and so the next block won't hold any of those transactions that were released.

152
00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:58.900
That's important to understand because if they don't have the future 1 percent power after the attack

153
00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:05.180
is finished then those transactions releases them ampoules they can get picked up and put back into

154
00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:06.170
the blocks later on.

155
00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:11.720
So even though there's is a problem can be kind of fixed like that but because their control is still

156
00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:18.530
there on some of the temple they can just even mind empty blocks if they like or they can just put transactions.

157
00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:21.890
Others actually except for the ones that they don't want in there.

158
00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:23.580
They can't just keep putting them in.

159
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:28.570
And then a certain time of power will pass and these transactions will be released out of the pool back

160
00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:33.290
to their owners because there's a rule like for instance in Bitcoin right now it's 72 hours I think

161
00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:38.480
that if your transaction is in the stock in the temple for 72 hours then it gets released back to you

162
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:39.800
and it doesn't.

163
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:46.130
Nothing nothing happens because like me maybe it's because the fees are too low or whatever else.

164
00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:52.280
And so transactions again can get pushed out of the Temple back after a certain time.

165
00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:55.800
So that's all they have to do is just have to not include transactions for a certain time.

166
00:10:55.980 --> 00:11:00.320
And so why is this so powerful.

167
00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:03.850
Another reason is because it can last for so long.

168
00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:06.350
You don't like with the with the orphan blocks.

169
00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:12.290
We only we saw that that could happen for like one or two or three blocks maximum occasionally.

170
00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:16.490
And the old examples we saw were just like one block one orphant blog and then right away.

171
00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:23.610
The problem is solved because that happens kind of like accidentally whereas here is it's done maliciously.

172
00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:31.280
And why is it so powerful is because users on the on the block say they usually have like an agreed

173
00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:38.750
time frame when transactions can are considered properly confirmed where they usually take like six

174
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:39.200
blocks.

175
00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:47.360
So for instance a transaction that's happened in this block is only has two confirmations one confirmation

176
00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:52.280
to a confirmation is a new blog that comes after after the blog.

177
00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.920
So.

178
00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:55.160
So there we go.

179
00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.850
So this actually has two confirmations.

180
00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:03.020
And normally what they do is they wait for six confirmations.

181
00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:05.900
Everything in this block is considered to really have six information.

182
00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:09.440
So just a general rule of thumb it's considered to be safe.

183
00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:10.090
That's OK.

184
00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:14.130
So since it's got six confirmations we can say that it's pretty much safe.

185
00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:19.100
It's safe to say that there is going to be no double spend problem with Israel's actions here or in

186
00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:26.210
here because we've gone so far so deep there's so deep in the chain that they're probably not going

187
00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:28.940
to get reversed and really liking what they're going to arrest is very low.

188
00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:32.560
But in the case of an attack that's what the attackers are betting on.

189
00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:38.930
And while on Bitcoin it's extremely hard to do something like this because of the immense high rate

190
00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:41.750
that exists already on other chains.

191
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:49.070
It is it is possible on other smaller cryptocurrency it might not be as lucrative financially but it's

192
00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:50.330
still possible.

193
00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:57.380
And there you go so that's the 51 percent attack I like a very important notion.

194
00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:03.170
Very important to understand what goes goes into it and like it and said what it's not and what it is.

195
00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.340
And as we can see it's quite simple.

196
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:12.750
And interestingly enough it's not like as far as I understand it not doing anything illegal is just

197
00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:22.220
there there's just more of them and they approach this mining process by secluding themselves for some

198
00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:22.710
time.

199
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.160
And you know and then the double spend Yes they have malicious intent but are they doing anything illegal.

200
00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:28.490
Not.

201
00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:29.830
Not 100 percent sure about that.

202
00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:30.410
I don't know.

203
00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:34.830
Maybe they'll introduce laws around block chains and Bitcoin and so on that this will be considered

204
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:35.910
illegal in the future.

205
00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:38.860
But the threat is there.

206
00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:45.560
And what I wanted to recommend now at the end is a great article which I found very interesting is called

207
00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:48.040
choosing asix for s.a.

208
00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:50.130
And plus I added some comments here.

209
00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:57.590
Plus we suggest reading the comments at the bottom of this article and the reason for that is this article

210
00:13:57.590 --> 00:14:05.630
was written by David Warrick who's the CEO of s.a.a it's it's a block chain for storing It's like a

211
00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:12.940
block just like a Dropbox version of block chain version of Dropbox like storing file hosting.

212
00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:20.080
So it's a blog for file hosting just a D decentralized distributed file hosting.

213
00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:27.180
And so as you can see from the articles lots it's not called the 51 percent attack.

214
00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:35.130
It's actually about their choice of introducing asix which we discussed before into siaa.

215
00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:40.550
So they're the creators of CAA and they want to introduce A-6 into their own blotching so that people

216
00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:48.530
can excuse me so that people can mine their blog chain with it.

217
00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:50.420
So it's about that.

218
00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:55.520
But he really goes into a lot of detail on the future and present attack one of the reasons one of the

219
00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:59.460
big reasons why he's choosing to introduce A-6 is the huge trauma center.

220
00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:07.390
The reason why we're here here I'm suggesting it to read the comments is because by reading the articles

221
00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:14.090
you can get release drag a way into his way of thinking which you know might be a valid argument but

222
00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:23.050
he has a very very thin like 1 like 1 1 Sorriso on you describing everything from one position.

223
00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:29.210
Why is good is definitely good for the network and while you will learn a lot about the 51 percent attack

224
00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:32.990
and how it's good or bad and how it can be beneficial or not.

225
00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:38.830
For me like how can be cost effective or not for different types of scenarios.

226
00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:44.450
You can also develop like a very one sided view of why A-6 are good for a small watch.

227
00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:52.790
So the people in the comments they actually confront our confront they dispute that they have different

228
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:58.380
opinions so just on to get overwhelmed by the amount of arguments that he gives.

229
00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:02.760
Check the comments so that you get a different perspective on the other issues that he discusses in

230
00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:04.890
the in the article.

231
00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:05.620
So there you go.

232
00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:13.530
That's that's sort of almost an attack I hope you enjoyed today's tutorial and now you know what is

233
00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:15.140
and it all is all about.

234
00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.060
And I look forward to seeing it better next time.

235
00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:19.070
Until then enjoy auctions.
