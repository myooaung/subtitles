00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.210
Hi everyone and welcome back we're going to be examining car down here.

2
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.930
And if you have seen some other crypto currencies this one is going to be a bit different.

3
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.790
And that's what makes it interesting.

4
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.620
Besides a few technical features you'll get to them.

5
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:14.910
Don't worry.

6
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.930
Some key pieces to take away.

7
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.020
Before we dive right in.

8
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:19.980
Keep these in mind.

9
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.690
They're released in 2017.

10
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.250
Fully open source has proof of stake mining multi layer architecture.

11
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.840
Keep them in mind as well.

12
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:29.930
We're going to address those in a moment.

13
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:37.890
So what is Kardon is a deep centralized public block chain and cryptocurrency project fully open source

14
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.700
Cordani is developing a smart contract platform to deliver more advanced features than any current protocol.

15
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:51.960
What also makes it very interesting is that it is the first block chain platform to evolve out of a

16
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.010
scientific philosophy and a research first approach.

17
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.810
Keep that in mind as well as we're going to expand on that.

18
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.950
The development team is made up of a large group of expert engineers and researchers.

19
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.440
This isn't to say the other crypto currencies and organizations block chain projects don't have scientific

20
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.040
backing but Cardinall really takes it to another level.

21
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:23.360
Similar to other platforms Carrano is the platform and blog team project and Ada and I apologize if

22
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.340
I refer to it as out in the future.

23
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.140
For some reason I keep wanting to say Atta but Ada is the cryptocurrency.

24
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:37.760
It should be clear with cardno that more of their goal isn't just the coin but the platform to power

25
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.190
financial applications.

26
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:46.430
The huge benefit with this is that being built in layers allows for more flexibility and helps with

27
00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.030
maintaining it and upgrades with Soulforce.

28
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:57.050
Once the settlement layer this is that layer running Ada is finished a separate computing layer will

29
00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.460
be built.

30
00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:05.870
First smart contracts we can think about them in terms of digital legal agreements and I know we mentioned

31
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:12.050
the scientific philosophy and backing briefly but really cardno doesn't just strive for this but delivers

32
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:18.020
that scientific process and they hope it will lead to a greater financial inclusion.

33
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.920
If you examine some of the resources you can see they apply to all parts of the cardno ecosystem is

34
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:24.980
not just one piece of it.

35
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.050
For example they're not just focusing on the cryptography but really applying it to the entire Carrano

36
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.280
ecosystem and we can see it re-inforce if we examine the following statement.

37
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.040
If you want to expand on it please visit the following link as well.

38
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:43.820
The vision for Carrano is that its new style of regulated computing will bring greater financial inclusion

39
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.280
by providing open access for all to fair financial services.

40
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:55.730
But it's very interesting and also a great future of both cardno and Ada to have that scientific backing

41
00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:02.960
and scientific process applied to the whole ecosystem and let's progress directly on the coin during

42
00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:03.500
the launch.

43
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:12.740
The following amount of Ada was sold and the ADA supply cap is at about forty five billion with the

44
00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.210
remainder to be issued after launch.

45
00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:21.200
So with that cap we won't see more than 45 billion and we could see this amongst a range of crypto currencies

46
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.460
applying caps and it's a great feature.

47
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.680
Some differences though with mining Carcano is that use as a proof of stake algorithm instead of a proof

48
00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.940
of work with consensus generated by the coin holder due to the use of this staking mechanism.

49
00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:44.740
It makes it unnecessary to use brute force for the hash code so it saves a lot of energy with the block

50
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:45.830
chain creation.

51
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:55.400
And we can recap and take an overview of cardno along with the layers we have the use of these two letters

52
00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:03.620
the settlement layer supporting Ledger transactions and the computational layer or C-L for smart contracts

53
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.090
or DAPs de-centralized applications with cardno.

54
00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:16.670
Try to remember this key piece of information is that it uses proof of stake and to expand on it.

55
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.970
We see it mentioned here as well.

56
00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:25.480
And the card Dano introduction that the core idea of proof of stake is that instead of wasting electricity

57
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:32.770
on cracking computational heavy problems a node is selected to mean a new block with a probability proportional

58
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.350
to the amount of coin's this node has.

59
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.950
If a node has positive greater than zero state it is called a stakeholder.

60
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.890
If a node eventually becomes chosen to mental block it is called a slot leader.

61
00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.570
You can read more again by visiting the following link.

62
00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.350
But think of it in terms of a reduction.

63
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.430
This algorithm is more computationally efficient.

64
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.300
A reduction in electricity for computations.

65
00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:07.980
And also that layer those two layers the settlement layer and the computational layer in addition pay

66
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.160
attention and try to keep Cardinal on your radar.

67
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:17.970
We could see in a tweet on June 20th from the co-founder of cardno mentioned that the entry of Wall

68
00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.760
Street into the crypto sector will bring in tens of trillions of dollars.

69
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:28.200
So this is something that you should pay attention to again keep it on your radar with Carrano.

70
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:36.420
It really has that support and benefit of having that scientific backing applied to its entire process

71
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.480
along with the computational efficiency.

72
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:45.550
It's multilayered approach and its intent unbecoming in gaining steam with these smart contracts.

73
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:51.930
It's not just focused on the cryptocurrency the coin to coin but also applying this ecosystem these

74
00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.320
block chain and smart contracts for financial services.

75
00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:57.550
So pay attention to it.

76
00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:03.090
It's going to be interesting to see what the remainder of 2018 and 2019 bring forward.

77
00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:09.390
And with that we can wrap things up as always if you have any questions please feel free to share them

78
00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:10.440
in the Q&amp;A.

79
00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:12.340
And enjoy cryptocurrency.
