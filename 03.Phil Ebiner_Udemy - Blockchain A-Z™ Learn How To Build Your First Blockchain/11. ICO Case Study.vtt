00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.450
Own Welcome back to the course and blockade today we're going to have a case study.

2
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.000
And I see also read talked about what an issue is and how it works and how it is different to an IPO.

3
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.970
And now we're going to look into a specific example and a hypothetical example that will help us understand

4
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.990
a bit better how exactly.

5
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.290
I see those take place.

6
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.730
So as I started to say we've got Mary here.

7
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.980
Oh by the way this example I took from an blog post on medium.

8
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.500
I linked to it at the end of this tutorial if you'd like to read it there in more detail.

9
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.620
So let's say we've got Mary fear who decides to come up with a part of to create a theme park.

10
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:54.320
And it's a really innovative theme partially or Basically she sees some demands in the market.

11
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.710
She knows that she can do things a bit differently and making valuable to the community.

12
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:06.760
And then once she's bought the lines and everything she will invite businesses to create their own rides

13
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.140
there and you know to crew to help her with this theme park.

14
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.370
Right.

15
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:17.070
So she's got her whole case study about this and she's written a white paper and we took all our white

16
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:26.290
papers in a separate tutorial and basically she is ready to get things going.

17
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.270
And but she needs funds.

18
00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.820
She needs to raise some capital in order to buy the land in order to organize everything get all the

19
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.970
permits licenses and get things underway.

20
00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.720
So what she decides to do is to do and.

21
00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:40.610
And how is she going to do.

22
00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:48.550
Well she's going to put this whole idea into a box encapsulates this idea and say that inside this theme

23
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.860
park we're going to use National tokens.

24
00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:59.360
Let's call them as tokens and these as tokens are going to be what people are going to pay for for the

25
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.230
rides.

26
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.980
And that's what these businesses are going to receive in payments.

27
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:11.730
And so Mary decides to issue 1 million as tokens and they will never ever be more than that because

28
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.020
there's always going to be just one million tokens and she decides to issue them.

29
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.810
She splits them in half.

30
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:29.290
So 500000 as tokens and 500000 as tokens and one of those badges will be used for an ICU.

31
00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:37.540
So in the ICAO she'll actually offer to the public only 500000 as tokens and other 500000 she'll keep

32
00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.210
for herself which.

33
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:45.520
So that money later on will be used for you know upgrades the business floor to fund more projects within

34
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:51.610
that business or she'll just keep it as the as the father as you know like she sometimes foreigners

35
00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:58.690
keep those coins those tokens as though there's an ICAO announcement and some people are interested

36
00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:59.220
in this.

37
00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.270
So it might be because they're interested in the project and want to contribute and get some tokens

38
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:05.820
in exchange.

39
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.520
What they'll do with those tokens.

40
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:08.840
We'll find out in a second.

41
00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:16.900
So but basically the the way it goes is they pay cash for the tokens and they receive the token in the

42
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:17.120
case.

43
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:23.470
So basically here they get some tokens and they pay for instance the price is determined.

44
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:31.390
Mary sets the price at $2 per token the initial court offering is at 2.0 and you can buy one token one

45
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.020
as token for $2.

46
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.520
So that allows Mary to raise if she sells all $500000 marriage raise one million dollars which she will

47
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.140
then use those dollars to buy the land to start setting up the Empire.

48
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.710
And so what will these people do of these tokens.

49
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.200
Well there's two things and they can't wait until the theme park is live and then they can spend their

50
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.390
tokens in the theme park on the rides later on so they kind of like pre purchasing tokens.

51
00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.950
It is.

52
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.360
And I see it as a way of crowdfunding a project so instead of waiting until the theme park is built

53
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:10.210
and then buy and tokens because they believe in it so much they're buying the tokens now to later spend

54
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.030
enough to help Mary get started.

55
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.380
And then they will spend the tokens.

56
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.390
There are also these just for them it's just a timing difference or some of these people are buying

57
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.790
the tokens not to spend the theme park.

58
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:28.000
This is what we're seeing quite a lot these days in the world of initial court offerings in the world

59
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.370
of currencies.

60
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:35.770
People don't actually buy the tokens to spend them later on within the enclosed economy.

61
00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.720
And like we can see here in the box this is this is what is created like an encapsulated economy.

62
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:46.960
Instead of spending instead of buying the tokens to spend them later and that's incarcerated and people

63
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.170
often buy these tokens tokens.

64
00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.900
Or in speculative in a speculative manner.

65
00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:57.890
So they expect them to appreciate and price and to sell them off later on for a higher price.

66
00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:04.900
And so if they do a successful later on what will happen is more people will need tokens more you will

67
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:10.810
want to go to the theme park or invest in these tokens and so they will need to buy them off the people

68
00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.250
that have already bought them.

69
00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:19.120
And again they will get tokens but in exchange you will have to pay cash and because there's more people

70
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.470
interested in togas and there's never ever going to be more than one million as tokens ever.

71
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.400
The supply is limited but the demand is growing.

72
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.060
And so when that happens the price increases.

73
00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:38.080
And so because the prices increase now these people are going to have to pay for example $6 per token

74
00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:44.090
and they're going to buy them off these first people that initially got into the market.

75
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:45.950
And what are they going to do with them.

76
00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:52.180
Well they're going to also either keep them for investment purposes for speculative reasons and later

77
00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.740
on sell them off one day or they're actually interested in the theme park and they're going to go and

78
00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:04.220
spend those tokens at the park and purchase rides and you know maybe products that they're selling at

79
00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.650
the theme park are more surprising.

80
00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:10.140
Just jump on the horizon pay for the ride tokens.

81
00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:14.410
And so that's that's how this whole system works.

82
00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:15.970
The question only the.

83
00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.440
We still have left is what do these businesses do with those tokens.

84
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.900
So they've gotten all these tokens.

85
00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:28.960
Now what can they do with them because they might need to pay their employees they might want to pay

86
00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:34.320
some profits out they might want to just operate in tokens and want to be worth about $2.

87
00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:40.100
So a way to convert them back to dollars would be for example to sell them back to the public.

88
00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:45.170
So the public doesn't only have to buy the tokens from the people they're initially invested into the

89
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:47.600
ICAO they can also buy them from the business.

90
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:52.570
And again here they get tokens in exchange they pay cash at the current market price which might be

91
00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:54.130
$6 per token.

92
00:06:54.340 --> 00:07:00.420
And so if they want to either invest into tokens or use them actually in the parks.

93
00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:04.590
The idea is that tokens are actually designed to be used.

94
00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:08.270
And so if they want to use them in a tub in the park they need to go and buy them either buy them or

95
00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:13.350
these people or from the businesses in my view like that will exchange up Mary might set up here somewhere.

96
00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:18.960
And so they take it away you know takes the helps the businesses spread out these tokens are across

97
00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:20.200
people who are interested in it.

98
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:24.460
And again they go in and go back into the park and spend them.

99
00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:28.590
And so that's how this whole thing works.

100
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:34.160
An important thing to note here is as you can see there is no mining involved there's no mining of tokens.

101
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:40.960
Like when we hear the word mining that is associated with coins that are in the second layer because

102
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.890
they're used as a reward for miners.

103
00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:47.890
There will still be mining to support the block change to support the theory of blockade and to keep

104
00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:48.950
the thing growing.

105
00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:52.770
But that's kind of managed separately it's not related to the ICAO.

106
00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:57.310
So when you hear somebody talking about an ICAO and then you hear them talking about mining or those

107
00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:58.190
tokens.

108
00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:04.800
If it's an ICU on the third layer and over charge and then they're talking about mining those tokens

109
00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:07.180
they probably don't know what they're talking about.

110
00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:10.700
So you've got to be careful around those situations and.

111
00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:11.550
Yeah.

112
00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.710
And like so I've seen one of those in the media.

113
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:16.240
It was it was very interesting.

114
00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:17.860
But just be careful.

115
00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:24.470
There's no mining involved it's just a way to raise capital for a project to crowdfund a project.

116
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:31.120
And the key takeaway here here first of all it's no mining involved it's a way to raise crowdfund the

117
00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.690
project to raise Cappo for projects.

118
00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:41.180
The design the idea behind tokens is actually that they're used for something inside the economy here.

119
00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:46.660
And finally at the moment a lot of people actually buy tokens for speculative reasons.

120
00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.600
They're not even intending on using them inside that economy.

121
00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.650
They're trading on selling them off later on.

122
00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.010
So that's dangerous that's how bubbles are created.

123
00:08:54.010 --> 00:09:00.250
That's how you know and I see all crypto bubble can be created and that's that's generally something

124
00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:00.910
to be aware of.

125
00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:06.370
So an important point is to always understand what is the underlying purpose of these tokens and we'll

126
00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:09.240
talk about that in the next tutorial a bit more detail.

127
00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:20.580
But for now this is how tokens works I suppose work if you'd like to read this example.

128
00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:27.070
In this original version you can find that here what the heck is an ICAO by probating Krishnan on Hackleman

129
00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:28.820
or a medium.

130
00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:31.750
And so is quite a good article highly recommended.

131
00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:39.340
And if you want a more in-depth fine example of an ICAO that is or has been is more involved and has

132
00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:43.930
more moving parts and like concepts to grasp.

133
00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:49.300
Another example I highly recommend is called How crypto tokens will enable the disruption of businesses

134
00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:53.050
like Uber and Urbi by Andrew Finn and Andrew field.

135
00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:59.030
By the way is one of the co-creators of the blog called Wait but why.

136
00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:01.080
Which is run by Tim Orban.

137
00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:07.740
So here and so Andrew Finn has his own little a website where you can find some articles as cold Fin's

138
00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:15.060
cave dot com and this is quite a recent article where he analyzes like in detail a very involved case

139
00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:21.450
study of how a company like an ride sharing company could use block chain to completely disrupt Uber

140
00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:26.250
and Lyft through using Bosch and so very very interesting read.

141
00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:34.110
Quite a long article but well worth it so if you want to like enhance your disruptive thinking in the

142
00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:37.850
spatial block I'd definitely highly recommend checking this one out.

143
00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:46.590
Once again all of these links will be in the course notes and signs on that note thank you so much for

144
00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:49.110
being here and I look forward to see you next time.

145
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:50.700
Until then enjoy blushes.
