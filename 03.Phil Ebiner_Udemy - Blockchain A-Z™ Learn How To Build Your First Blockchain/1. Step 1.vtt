00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.460
Hello and welcome to module 3 create a smart contract.

2
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.010
So in this one we're going to take our had coins built in module too and we're going to do a nice few

3
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.250
issuing one million coins for the investors to be able to buy them or even sell them because we're going

4
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.940
to offer a buyback option which basically allows us to buy the coins back and therefore the investors

5
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:33.660
can get their money back at any time and we'll make all this secure and less through my contract which

6
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.560
we will implement on solidity and of course we'll use some other user friendly interfaces to interact

7
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:46.570
with our smart contract exactly as we did with post man in modules one and two and these user friendly

8
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.950
interfaces will be first get Nash to interact with the transactions and the plugs because we'll be working

9
00:00:52.950 --> 00:01:00.240
on the E3 MBLAQ chain and also we'll have a wallet my wallet which is an Ethiopian based wallet and

10
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.050
that's from this word specifically that will buy the coins or sell them back.

11
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:09.940
And that's where we'll see our equity in either U.S. dollars or at coins.

12
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.000
I can't wait to show you them in the end.

13
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.280
This one will also be epic.

14
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.310
So for now we're going to start with the instillations you know everything that is required to implement

15
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.880
all this.

16
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:28.520
And so will these three things First Well Danesh second my wallet and third solidity.

17
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.620
So let's add all this to get us ready and let's start with Ganesh.

18
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:40.230
So if you like chocolate Well you will have problem finding the Nashe by just typing cash here because

19
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.570
indeed that's how it is spelled that's what we want to download.

20
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.920
But you'll only find some Nashe which is a glaze icing sauce for pastries which of course is not what

21
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:50.660
you want to get.

22
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.890
Even if I really like chocolate we will have something else on the menu today and the something else

23
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.120
is truffle with chocolate.

24
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:05.370
Because indeed if you like truffle with chocolate Well here you will find what we want because indeed

25
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.460
if I press enter here truffle Guinness Well the first link.

26
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.340
Not this one but this one here.

27
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.900
The first link is not some Guinness with truffle food but it is exactly what you will need.

28
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.460
There is this user friendly interface with which you will interact with the smart contract as you can

29
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:30.370
see the Ethiopian blood chain Ganesh ships with an intern or javascript's implementation of the yttrium

30
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.010
blood chain which has additional programmatic capabilities and there we go.

31
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.220
That's our framework so let's click on it.

32
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:45.030
Ganesh and as we can see we can already feel the user friendly stel so you can navigate a little bit

33
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.420
to see what it looks like.

34
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.810
But really the only thing we need is to download it.

35
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.250
So here I'm on the Mac OS so I suppose it automatically recognized my system.

36
00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.540
No worries if you have a Windows or Linux.

37
00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.360
Well I suppose you will either get the right system here or you will need to click HERE ON need a different

38
00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:04.520
OS download.

39
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.310
All right so click on the download button and there we go.

40
00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.100
We will get cash in any second.

41
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.630
The download is right here and as you can see it takes little more than 30 seconds.

42
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.400
So we should get it very quickly and in the meantime we can have a look at what it looks like.

43
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.210
That's the interface that's exactly what we'll be using.

44
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:31.110
You know we'll have the blocks here to transaction's here and each time we mine a block or each time

45
00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.410
we do a new transaction will the text count will be incremented here.

46
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:41.160
So anyway I'll show you this in the demo idea of this module because now the download is finished so

47
00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.000
I'm going to go now to my download folder here it is.

48
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.430
So let's double click on it and open and Menashe one point one point zero Bayda.

49
00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:53.700
And here is again.

50
00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.280
So here I'm on a Mac.

51
00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.700
That's basically how you install a new app you just slide it over here and this installs again.

52
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:01.740
So pretty easy.

53
00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:07.010
Now I'm going to go to my applications to show you I must be right here.

54
00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.360
Here it is.

55
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.650
Here is an opening.

56
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.740
And here we are on Jaenisch So as you can see exactly the same.

57
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.990
But we're not going to do anything now because we don't have any smart contract yet.

58
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:25.890
So now what we're going to do is the second step of this installation which is to install might if you

59
00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:26.830
want.

60
00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:34.140
All right so let's close this let's go back to Google and open a new tab.

61
00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.440
And here now to find what we want.

62
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:42.130
Unfortunately or fortunately we won't be distracted this time by any food but to get what we want.

63
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:48.520
We just need to type Get have because we're going to get it on a page which is to get her page of mine

64
00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.240
into Word and just into the ether.

65
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.910
Well it can just press enter and there you go.

66
00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.080
It should be the first link.

67
00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.990
There it is.

68
00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.010
Get her KBH new ether wellat.

69
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:06.580
All right let's kick on this first link get her page of my wallet and now we're going to scroll down

70
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.690
and there you go.

71
00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.450
That's exactly where you want to go.

72
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:10.150
Click on this.

73
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:15.910
Download the latest release and now you have several ways of getting it either with the source code

74
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.440
or the Chrome extension.

75
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:23.200
But what we need is the Zip for there because we'll see that it contains NHT mail file which will allow

76
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:28.680
us to connect locally from our computer to my ether what that's the purpose of getting this.

77
00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.270
And so now make sure to click on this.

78
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.170
I won't do it because I'm using the previous version.

79
00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.110
Three point eleven point 2.4 which actually worked very well.

80
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.600
And if you have any issue with that version.

81
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:41.500
Well no worries.

82
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.130
I will share the version I use in the resources of this course.

83
00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:52.570
And so now if you're ready let's go back to our well first download folder because you'll find your

84
00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:53.510
file here.

85
00:05:53.530 --> 00:06:00.790
So take this file that you just downloaded that is your wallet and go to your desktop or anywhere where

86
00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:07.320
you created this whole block chain is that folder of the course which contains the three modules and

87
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.080
we are now in module 3.

88
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:16.340
Create a smart contract so make sure to go inside and paste the wallet right here.

89
00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.650
So that's what I did with the previous version as you see 2.4.

90
00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:29.610
So let's zip it and inside as I just said you'll find a new index H.T. a file which if we click on it

91
00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:35.660
we'll redirect this to my wallet from your local computer.

92
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.740
You see this is my address.

93
00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:45.420
This is my main user folder then desktop than black and it is that Mudgal three create a smart contract.

94
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:50.800
A well-lit zip folder that you just downloaded and the index a file.

95
00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:51.150
All right.

96
00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:57.720
And so when you open it for the first time well you'll find this page with all the warnings which I

97
00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:03.570
think should be right to be present because it's indeed very important to understand what you're dealing

98
00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:04.200
with.

99
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:09.910
There is anything that is related to E3 them smart contract or simply getting it.

100
00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:13.620
So I'm not going to read anything now but try to read this.

101
00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:16.110
This is really useful information for you.

102
00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:19.410
So my answer was not a bank that's for sure.

103
00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:24.930
You know the cryptocurrency is the blocks and technologies are a whole new revolution that is totally

104
00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:26.680
disrupting the banks system.

105
00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:30.540
That's why the message then my wallet is an interface.

106
00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:31.120
OK.

107
00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:37.980
So obviously then if you have not followed the intuition lectures by the real world you will be interested

108
00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:43.330
to have their definition of the blotching what the flowers the block chain.

109
00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.180
Here you have their explanation.

110
00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:47.740
So could always be useful to read that again.

111
00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:53.550
And after they give you their definition of a block chain Well they ask why are you reading all this

112
00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:55.470
which is also a fair question.

113
00:07:55.590 --> 00:08:01.590
And that's because if you really want to use my wallet for anything that is real there is not a simulation

114
00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.820
or demo like will do in this course.

115
00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:11.530
Well they remind you and they're very right that you and only you are responsible for your security.

116
00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:13.470
Be diligent to keep your private key.

117
00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:15.190
That's really important.

118
00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:20.280
And password safe your private key is sometimes adjacent fell by the way.

119
00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:22.320
That's good that we worked with Jason foules.

120
00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:28.710
That could allow you to handle even better the private keys and most importantly if you lose your private

121
00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:32.310
key or password no one can recover it.

122
00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:34.210
So that's the downside of a blank check.

123
00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:36.210
You know a bludgeon is not perfect.

124
00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:38.840
Cryptocurrency is not all white.

125
00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.100
It has some downside.

126
00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.870
And for me that's the worst one.

127
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.180
I don't know if you've heard the story of this guy who had a hard drive containing some private keys

128
00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:50.130
or password for a while that holding some bitcoins.

129
00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:56.040
But the thing is at the time the Bitcoin wasn't valued anything and therefore I think this guy put the

130
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.450
harddrive in the trash.

131
00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:02.940
And I heard that today he's still looking in the trash is in the country to find his harddrive back

132
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:04.620
to get the Bitcoins back.

133
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:08.590
Because indeed without the private key you cannot get the Bitcoins back.

134
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:11.090
So let's hope that doesn't happen to us.

135
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:17.250
And eventually last warning we should be careful with is if you enter your private key on a fishing

136
00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:20.430
website you will have all your phones taken.

137
00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:21.170
So no worries.

138
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.170
Nothing will happen here in this course.

139
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:24.430
This is just a demo.

140
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.630
We'll play with our coins which I remind our worst.

141
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:29.260
Absolutely nothing.

142
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:33.280
So all right next question what's the point of Mu.

143
00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.590
Where is my wallet.

144
00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:40.920
So of course since either him is by the way one of the best Fluxion technologies today at the time I'm

145
00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:41.660
speaking.

146
00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:48.180
Well the point the main point is of course that it's a decentralized system and it's a blocking based

147
00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:49.270
technology.

148
00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:55.890
OK and then they explain how you can protect yourself and your phone so we won't go through this because

149
00:09:56.250 --> 00:10:02.130
again we'll play with at coins how you can protect yourself from scams that could be interesting for

150
00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:06.840
you if you decide to go for real and how to protect yourself from loss.

151
00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.590
Again some more security tips.

152
00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.910
One more click and we are done.

153
00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:12.920
Really.

154
00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:13.520
No.

155
00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:14.280
I knew it.

156
00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.250
We still have this.

157
00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:19.310
But now in order to pop the champagne and start we just need to click here.

158
00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:20.550
Oh my goodness.

159
00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:25.410
Please just let me send for flowers sake.

160
00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:26.060
All right.

161
00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:27.010
So here we go.

162
00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:28.860
Welcome to my ether wellat.

163
00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:32.370
Now we done with the second thing we had to install.

164
00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:37.690
We won't go there now because this will be part of the demo but now we're going to move on to the third

165
00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:43.800
and main pillar of our implementation which is solidity and it's actually really simple.

166
00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:53.470
We won't have any Anaconda our Python to install because we will get solidity from remakes All right

167
00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:59.550
you can type here remakes sleety and you just need to go to the first link remix.

168
00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:05.440
So the idea is basically it's an idea in which you will be able to implement some solidity programming

169
00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:09.220
which is exactly what will use to build our smart contract.

170
00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:17.190
All right so let's click on this remix solidity ID and there we go welcome to solidity and remakes.

171
00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:24.850
So here you will all get this just as me is just a programming example for some law problem I think.

172
00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:27.580
I haven't looked at it in details but we don't care.

173
00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:35.200
We can just close this all right and now we're going to click on this plus button here to create a new

174
00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:44.810
file which will call at coin's IFCO right at coin's ICAO that sells solver's versatility.

175
00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.420
And then you just press OK.

176
00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:48.450
And there we go.

177
00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:55.880
We are ready to implement the smart contract for our initial coin offering of 1 million coins.

178
00:11:56.220 --> 00:12:02.190
So just before we say goodbye I'm going to put a title here so here I'm about to enter newcomer's which

179
00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:05.350
won't be executed once we execute the whole code.

180
00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:09.420
And that's just to give it time which will be add coins.

181
00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.690
I see the initial coin offering.

182
00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:13.600
Perfect.

183
00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:18.150
So now we're ready to move on to the implementation starting from the next tutorial.

184
00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:27.300
But just before we do this I just recommend to have a look at the solidity documentation because this

185
00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:28.200
is something quite new.

186
00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:34.560
You know I haven't made any other course on solidity So it's always good to have a look at documentation

187
00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:42.000
and see a little bit how it works for the C++ lovers you will have no problem understanding it because

188
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.810
as you can see it's a high level language for implementing smart contracts.

189
00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:54.160
But it was influenced by C++ and bicillin also but to me it looks more like C++ and Javascript.

190
00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:57.710
So there you go I recommend to read all these.

191
00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:03.510
Which by the way gives you also some more information and explanation on smart contract with again the

192
00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:06.720
blushing and basics the theory and virtual machine.

193
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:13.050
If you want to look at it in more details then I recommend to check this out solidity by example.

194
00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:19.470
So here you have some silly code which was the code we saw when we opened Rhythmix and it gives you

195
00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:21.870
know a lot of explanation here in the comments.

196
00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.810
Again with double slash and not hash keys.

197
00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:29.240
And then for those of you who want to study solidity more in depth.

198
00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:35.700
Well you have some more documentation here with the structure of a contract the types functions mappings

199
00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:36.830
everything.

200
00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:41.910
So you have everything here so any time you don't understand something in our implementation you can

201
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:43.080
always check this out.

202
00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:47.330
But of course I'll do my best to explain the code as well as possible.

203
00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:48.390
So check this out.

204
00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:51.780
And whenever you're ready let's build our smart contract.
