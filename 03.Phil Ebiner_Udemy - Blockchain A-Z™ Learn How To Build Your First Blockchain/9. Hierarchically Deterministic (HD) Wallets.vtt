00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.610
Hello I'll go back to the course on location.

2
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.970
Today we're talking about age do you WALLACE Or are we going to pronounce Strieber announces hierarchically

3
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.520
deterministic Wallach's.

4
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.130
That's what we're talking about today.

5
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.240
Let's have a look.

6
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:23.780
So here we've got a whole set up of private key public key message signature reification of and address.

7
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.190
And so we're know how this works won't go through that again.

8
00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.240
But the question here is about privacy.

9
00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:33.770
That's what we're going to address today.

10
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:41.290
So we know that Bitcoin and fluxions in general are meant to be or cryptocurrency is meant to be anonymous

11
00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.220
or not exactly anonymous synonymous.

12
00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.490
So like side by side on amisse.

13
00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.590
So as long as nobody knows who this private key is attached to.

14
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:51.700
They don't know who you are.

15
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:52.020
Right.

16
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.490
So they're not completely anonymous because if one day somebody finds out who is behind the private

17
00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:04.220
key then they will know exactly everything about how you've been acting so like your your private key

18
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:11.040
access like as a barrier is like a like Avatar or upside.

19
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.790
Sithen I'm inside an AM I guess for you and.

20
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.570
Yeah.

21
00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:23.770
And so that's you know that's how they're meant to be that people are not supposed to find out who you

22
00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.320
are basing your transactions are not supposed to be able to just monitor what you're doing and things

23
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.910
like that.

24
00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:36.310
But if we think about it this way that every time you want somebody to send you money you have to give

25
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.550
them your address and every time you send someone money you your public key ends up getting attached

26
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:43.840
to that transaction.

27
00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:50.040
And so somebody can just go through the whole LOCKNEY network and pick up every time you address a public

28
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.680
key pops up and they can like start observing things you know they won't know who exactly this addresses

29
00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.050
belong to or who was active.

30
00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.030
But they will see patterns they'll see that this address is Kip's receiving money from this address.

31
00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.980
And you know the public key is being used to send money to these three or five addresses or song and

32
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.960
like they can create different patterns or see different parents of what's going on.

33
00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:20.860
And they know and maybe at one point somebody might figure out that one of the addresses where you use

34
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.050
your public key to buy stuff is like a pizza shop near your city or in your city and they might be able

35
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.140
to track how often you go there and they might predict when you're going to be there and things like

36
00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.490
that.

37
00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.520
And there even though that sounds a little bit paranoid it's actually quite a big concern.

38
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:41.740
If a network promises that things like there's going to be privacy in the network then there has to

39
00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.720
be privacy in the network.

40
00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.080
Right.

41
00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.980
Rather than these kind of patterns being able to people be able to establish that.

42
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.950
And so what is the solution.

43
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.330
Well up until some point in time people will do this.

44
00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.850
I think if people really wanted privacy they would create multiple private keys and generate public

45
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.590
keys from each one and an address from each one and then you'd use a private or public key or an address

46
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.330
for certain things and then for other things you use different public your different dress or if you

47
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.700
are real privacy you just all the time you just generate a new public key and you address every single

48
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.080
time.

49
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.960
And you know thankfully there are no huge large numbers of there's almost unlimited like we can think

50
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.940
that there's a limited number of these public keys and addresses we can generate as many as you want

51
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.730
but it becomes very tedious keeping track of things and also maintaining these private keys safe and

52
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.510
secure.

53
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.770
And so like knowing where they are written down or things like that.

54
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:49.600
And so after a point in time Bitcoin introduced a improvement called bip 32 It's called the bill stands

55
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.000
for Bitcoin improvement proposal.

56
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.250
And in that proposal they propose exactly what we're talking about today hierarchically deterministic

57
00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.990
wallet's.

58
00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.830
So what is that.

59
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.620
Well with an HD wallet which you get is a monster private key.

60
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:10.000
That's your main thing that you get first and then from that Mussar private key then own the is a private

61
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.120
key generated from the master private and then the code is used to turn a public key and the public

62
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.630
key is used to generate the address.

63
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:25.540
So this part is kept secure so you can tell anybody your master private key or your private key.

64
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:33.070
Then what happens is and also same thing here address is something you can share freely publicly preferably

65
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.370
not to receive transactions like your public he'd better receive the money address.

66
00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:43.690
As we discussed before but now if you want more privacy if you need more public keys and addresses all

67
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:50.380
that needs to happen is your mosque private key can generate more of them by simply you just like your

68
00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.800
wallet.

69
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.230
What it will do for you is we'll add one to the project and then it'll generate a whole new set you

70
00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.560
know because it's using a hash function again.

71
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.120
So here it's using the hash function.

72
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:10.060
So basically once you add plus one by a completely different number eventually and you get a new and

73
00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:11.090
you set like that.

74
00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.460
And so it can add Plus to add plus three and so on so you can generate as many private key public key

75
00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.560
addresses you want as long as you just have access to this private key.

76
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:26.830
And this is all deterministic so you can just regenerate this at any point in time like there's no need

77
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:32.980
to remember all of these you just the wallahs will remember for you the you know the numbers that it

78
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:33.910
used and that's it.

79
00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:39.380
And you will be able to get your private keys so all you need is the master prac.

80
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.420
So that's the structure.

81
00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:46.870
And so how is this advantageous.

82
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:53.080
First of all it's very useful for wallet's they do this automatically when you need to receive money

83
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:58.480
or when you need to send money they put in different public keys and addresses all the time so and they

84
00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:05.950
just generate new ones and like that way nobody can ever track what was going on where money's going

85
00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:07.260
in where money is coming on.

86
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:12.510
Also this is an interesting idea for an organization.

87
00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:22.480
So if an organization is going to use bitcoin for cryptocurrency for their services or products for

88
00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:28.720
just running their business what they could do is they could have like the main like the director of

89
00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:35.430
finance have the promiser private key and then each department have a separate private key.

90
00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:41.350
And the beauty of that is that with the master private key you can always go into the block chain and

91
00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:46.660
you can always find out everything that the organization has spent all of the transactions that came

92
00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:51.370
from any of these private keys and you know like anything that happens like this that's what I call

93
00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:56.200
a hierarchical inter-ministerial is this hierarchy so if you have the master program and you go into

94
00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:01.530
the box and you can find all the transactions associated with any of these branches.

95
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:06.510
But if you only have the private key services let's say the division one division two divisions three

96
00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.310
to four well Division One can only go on the block.

97
00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:13.810
And they can only ever find their transaction because they can only generate their public key and their

98
00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:15.910
address that's linked to them.

99
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.580
From that comes from their private key they can never see what division 2 has been doing through division.

100
00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:27.550
So that's another great advantage of having this master private key so you have more oversight of the

101
00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:29.240
organization.

102
00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:30.560
That's where businesses.

103
00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:36.580
And another thing that was suggested as well in the 32 is a master public key.

104
00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:38.330
In fact this slide is libber wrong.

105
00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:42.960
The Mussar public shouldn't necessarily be inside this.

106
00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.600
In this in this square it should be outside.

107
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:52.190
So this square should finish here so it's not something you have to keep secure the muster public.

108
00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:57.040
And so the Mussar public key what is that used for all the massive public you cannot generate.

109
00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:03.040
You cannot get the private keys from the public but the master public key can recreate any of the public

110
00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.000
keys here.

111
00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.080
So you cannot.

112
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:09.330
So basically it's kind of like skipping the step you can already go through here.

113
00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:11.150
And what would you use the master public.

114
00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:20.860
Well you'd use the master public key in order to go and you'd give it to somebody like an auditor or

115
00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:25.890
somebody who doesn't need to be able to send transactions remember you need the private key to send

116
00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:31.870
money and the public key is used for verification and the address is used for receiving money.

117
00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:38.470
So we definitely need the private key to send funds to somebody else and therefore an auditor or somebody

118
00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:41.510
who is auditing a recession they don't need to be able to send money.

119
00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:46.090
But at the same time they need access to the public he has to go through the blockade and understand

120
00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:51.940
where where funds have been sent because we can see that through the public is and where funds have

121
00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:56.080
been received we can see that through the press through the addresses which can be generated from the

122
00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:56.730
public.

123
00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:59.300
So a pretty interesting set up.

124
00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:00.370
Very powerful.

125
00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:02.310
So that wasn't what was proposed.

126
00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:06.030
I'm going to at the end of this search are I'm going to link to her.

127
00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:13.510
Interesting article by metallic Tharon kind of critiquing this set up because there was like a flaw

128
00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:17.540
I'm not sure of the force still there but we'll get to the second.

129
00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:18.040
Yeah.

130
00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:26.950
And so this is this is the Arrakis this are hierarchically deterministic wallet's approach and that's

131
00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:36.760
what you probably like you will often encounter in your if you're ever using bitcoin for your self you'll

132
00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:41.500
encounter a deterministic world and you'll see that if you actually go through transactions you'll see

133
00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:46.000
that they're using different addresses or different public keys are attached to the dresses and the

134
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.320
wallet does that for you all in the background you don't have to worry about.

135
00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:52.850
But this is what happens as they say under the hood.

136
00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:59.360
And so let's have a look at one more thing that I wanted to mention today is that this Mosser private

137
00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.550
key.

138
00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:04.050
How do you keep it safe.

139
00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:11.450
So very often all you obviously like write it down or save it somewhere but very often the wallet provider

140
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:14.200
will prompt you to create.

141
00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:22.160
And the money they will give you the money to remember is 12 words that you actually ask you to write

142
00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:26.410
down with a pen on a paper and keep it somewhere safe like in a safe.

143
00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:30.770
And because that mnemonic is what generates your most private key.

144
00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:33.710
That's how you can recreate it.

145
00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:38.480
And you know there's a reason to the mnemonic is because there's a certain number of words in English

146
00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:43.790
language and when you take 12 of them then the possible number of possible combinations so large that

147
00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:50.060
is again very unlikely that two people will have the same mnemonic and therefore the same Mussar protein.

148
00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:56.420
But basically if you ever start a wallet and you see this that they ask you to come up with a mnemonic

149
00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:02.240
that's the reason they're asking you to do this is because from that mnemonic if you write it on paper

150
00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:08.600
and then if if like you lose your password or their servers get destroyed or something that you and

151
00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:14.420
that Master private key is lost you can always take that mnemonic and using that same algorithm you

152
00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:19.760
can generate your master private key and thrummed from me by surprise you can generate all the priorities

153
00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:25.000
all the public keys all the addresses everything can be restored completely just from this one Humani.

154
00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:30.110
So if you ever encounter that that's the reason why they're asking you to do this and it can be a good

155
00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:35.000
idea but you have to keep the paper safe because you know everybody else who has that paper can also

156
00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:38.990
just restore your master private key and take control.

157
00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:39.620
So there you go.

158
00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:41.890
That's a how age do you want it's work.

159
00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:45.620
And if you'd like to learn more then check out the article by Retallack return.

It's called deterministic Wolitzer advantages and their understanding flows.

161
00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:55.430
So it's a great description because some great knowledge is there about how to think about these while

162
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:58.450
it's this part about the understated.

163
00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:07.790
That is him referring to that that's what is it called like a bug or a vulnerability where if you share

164
00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:16.550
the public my master public key and the private keys the child private keys not the main not the massive

165
00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:20.320
private key but the child properties if you share them at the same time.

166
00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:26.640
So if somebody gets their hands on both at the same time for instance one of the leaders of the departments

167
00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:33.190
has a child private key and also so has the private key one of those that you generate those action

168
00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:37.450
ones the red ones that we saw and also get their hands on the one that the auditor gets.

169
00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:42.000
Then they might be able to break the system and find out the mass of the private key.

170
00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:47.690
But bear in mind this is an old article I'm not a developer and I don't know if that vulnerability has

171
00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:54.130
been fixed so take it with a grain of salt but the rest of the information in the article is quite great.

172
00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:57.880
If you want to understand as you will it's even better.

173
00:12:57.890 --> 00:12:59.660
And on that note I hope you enjoyed today's story.

174
00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.240
I look forward to seeing you back here next.

175
00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:02.900
And until then enjoy bludgeons.
