00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,490
Hello and welcome to this art to Tauriel.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:08,640
So we have a very exciting to toil ahead of us because in just a toil we are going to build the N-N

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,450
and fit it to the training set.

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:15,730
So right now it's time for action and let's build our first artificial neural network.

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:16,140
All right.

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:20,170
And as I told you in the previous tutorial we are going to use the best package for that.

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:25,950
That is the most efficient one that offers the most options and also one package that can run your models

8
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:27,270
very efficiently.

9
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:32,280
That's indeed very important because the models that we're going to build are complex and you know they

10
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,040
can run over many epochs.

11
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:39,510
So we need a package that will be efficient for these highly compute intensive tasks that are inevitable

12
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:44,550
when we build a deep learning model in this section in this Statoil we're not going to build a very

13
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,020
deep learning model.

14
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,770
We are going to have in the two hidden layers but still.

15
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:52,480
And if you need to work with a deeper artificial neural network.

16
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,070
Well of course it's better if you have the best package.

17
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:02,040
So there are several deep learning packages in our So we have neural net to build deep learning models

18
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:07,070
that are regressors and not classifiers so we cannot use this one.

19
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:12,570
Then we have an net that allows to build a deep learning classifying model but with only one hidden

20
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,780
layer and then we have deep net.

21
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:20,880
Another very good deep learning package that can build deep learning models with many hidden layers.

22
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,220
But that's still not the one we're going to use.

23
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,680
And so now I'm going to tell you the one that we're going to use it is called the H2 o package.

24
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,170
So why is it in my opinion the best package to build deep learning models.

25
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,760
Well it's for three reasons.

26
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:41,610
The first reason and that's the most important reason is that age 2 0 is no open source software platform

27
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:48,330
that allows you to connect to an instance of a computer system that therefore allows you to run your

28
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:49,830
model very efficiently.

29
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:56,820
So thanks to this connection to this computer system we will be able to train a deep running model very

30
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,230
efficiently like in a few seconds.

31
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:04,410
For those of you who follow the Python tutorials It's like connecting to a GP you know that allows you

32
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:07,330
to run highly compute intensive parallel computation.

33
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,030
So that's the first reason efficiency.

34
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:15,940
Now the second reason is that this package offers a lot of options to build your deeply moral.

35
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,820
So you know it will be very easy for us to choose different numbers of hidden layers and choose different

36
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:25,890
numbers of neurons and the hidden layers as well as other options to develop your model.

37
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,790
And speaking of options that leads me to the third reason why to me it is the best deep learning package.

38
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:36,540
Well the third reason is that one option of this age to a package is that it contains a parameter tuning

39
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:41,550
argument that allows you to choose some optimal numbers to build your deep learning model.

40
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:46,150
So we will see that by building the model and so let's start creating it.

41
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,850
So the first thing we have to do is of course to install the H-2 package.

42
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,050
So let's do this.

43
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:56,080
We're going to use the install packages command.

44
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:56,850
Here we go.

45
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:02,760
And remember this install the packages function when to input the name of the package in quotes that

46
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,020
is age 2.

47
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:08,240
So that's all h to o written the simple way.

48
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:13,180
And so you just need to select this line and execute it to install the package.

49
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,480
I already have it installed on my our studio here it is.

50
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,350
And it's also already imported.

51
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,630
But of course this will install this package without any issue.

52
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,020
And of course if you have an issue you can ask me some questions in the Q&amp;A.

53
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,710
I'll help you fix that.

54
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:29,620
So I'm going to put that in comment.

55
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:36,240
And now let's move onto the next line which is to import this package in case we have to automate the

56
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:43,230
scripts so to import it as you know we use a library and in parenthesis not in quotes the name of the

57
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,620
package age too.

58
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,450
All right.

59
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,170
Great.

60
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,660
And now we need to do something special.

61
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:54,130
It's not the usual package that we've been using throughout this course.

62
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:59,370
It's a new kind of package because it's a package that we're taking from an open source platform and

63
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:05,430
therefore that requires a connection to an H-2 instance and therefore what we'll do right now before

64
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:11,550
starting to create the model is to establish this connection and don't worry that's very easy.

65
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,900
We need to take our package age.

66
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:20,070
Oh then dot and then as you can see here it contains many functions and the function we're interested

67
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:28,410
in to make this connection and in fact initialize and H-2 instance well we need to take the in its function.

68
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:28,720
All right.

69
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:34,110
And as you can see in this function we have several parameters that allows you to connect to a specific

70
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:34,970
server.

71
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,890
For example this first argument here is IP which you can use to specify the IP address of the server

72
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:46,860
you want to connect to in which are H-2 instance will be running but that's only if you have an idea

73
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,310
of which server you want to connect to.

74
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,600
But in our case we will connect to some sort of a default available server and therefore we want to

75
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,020
use these parameters here.

76
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:02,100
However there is one that we'll use and that is the end threads Ravenor here and what does this argument

77
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:07,800
while this argument is the number of course in the system that you're connecting to that will be used

78
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,720
to build deep learning model.

79
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:14,880
Because you know building a deep learning model requires a lot of confutation highly compute intensive

80
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,440
ones.

81
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:18,890
And therefore we need many cores to run this computation.

82
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:25,820
And again that's the reason why we prefer Gippi use or VCP use because simply G-B use have many more

83
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:29,010
cores so he will take this argument and threats.

84
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:35,520
And now the trick is to input the value minus one because specifying this minus one value will take

85
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:39,060
all the available course of the system you're connecting to.

86
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,860
So don't even think about it.

87
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:46,080
I strongly recommend to use Manasquan here because this will optimize the number of course to use and

88
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,050
therefore the future computations.

89
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:48,760
Great.

90
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,870
And that's actually the only argument we need to import here in this and it function.

91
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:57,690
So we are ready to execute that to connect to the system.

92
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:03,350
All right so let's execute starting H2O JVM and connecting.

93
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:09,750
And here we go all the connections are established and now we're working on another system much more

94
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,660
powerful because we have an optimized number of course.

95
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:17,780
And so we were ready to build any kind of complex deep learning models.

96
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:18,260
Great.

97
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,920
Now we have everything we need.

98
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,750
We have a powerful tool with us.

99
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:25,260
So we are definitely ready to start building the deep learning more.

100
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:25,840
All right.

101
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:30,420
That's what we're going to do starting from the next to Tauriel and then learning
