00:00:00,420  -->  00:00:06,720
Hello and welcome to this art tutorial and the tutorial was a lot of interesting things to learn about

2

00:00:06,800  -->  00:00:11,590
our and what it can do to provide insightful information of your model.

3

00:00:11,670  -->  00:00:18,050
And now we only have to do left is to predict the test results ask for a simple in their aggression

4

00:00:18,060  -->  00:00:18,110
.

5

00:00:18,120  -->  00:00:19,560
It will be very quick.

6

00:00:19,560  -->  00:00:25,650
We will just need one line for this and it's going to be why I'm introducing the vector of predictions

7

00:00:25,650  -->  00:00:33,240
here why pred and then I'm going to use to predict function and then to predict function I will just

8

00:00:33,240  -->  00:00:34,420
use two arguments.

9

00:00:34,440  -->  00:00:41,760
One is to regress or you have to specify with which regressors you want to predict your test results

10

00:00:41,760  -->  00:00:42,040
.

11

00:00:42,090  -->  00:00:47,430
And of course it's with our multiple in our regression regress or that we define here.

12

00:00:48,000  -->  00:00:53,640
And the second argument is new data which is the set of the new observations.

13

00:00:53,640  -->  00:01:00,150
You want to predict the result you want to predict a profit and so of course this new data is going

14

00:01:00,150  -->  00:01:02,590
to be the test set.

15

00:01:03,690  -->  00:01:04,390
Don't worry.

16

00:01:04,410  -->  00:01:08,070
So far we're only making predictions about the test set.

17

00:01:08,100  -->  00:01:13,680
You will see that in the next sections we'll be making predictions of new observations which won't be

18

00:01:13,680  -->  00:01:19,030
the tested observations but some single observations you will understand why we will do this and you'll

19

00:01:19,050  -->  00:01:23,290
see that the purpose of doing that is actually going to be pretty fun.

20

00:01:23,640  -->  00:01:29,160
So okay so that's ready to predict function is ready it has it's two argument to regress.

21

00:01:29,180  -->  00:01:30,230
And the new data.

22

00:01:30,450  -->  00:01:34,520
So we're ready to select this and execute.

23

00:01:34,530  -->  00:01:35,260
All right.

24

00:01:35,550  -->  00:01:41,610
And now our White predator vector predicted results of the test set is ready.

25

00:01:41,610  -->  00:01:48,550
So what I'm going to do now is to type Y parade in the console to have a look at it.

26

00:01:48,750  -->  00:01:50,100
Here it is.

27

00:01:50,100  -->  00:01:53,760
So as you can see this contains ten predicted results.

28

00:01:53,760  -->  00:01:58,350
These are the 10 predicted profits of the ten observations of the test set.

29

00:01:58,770  -->  00:02:05,310
So for example let's compare the real profits and the predicted profits so let's look at our test set

30

00:02:05,310  -->  00:02:06,140
here.

31

00:02:06,540  -->  00:02:09,330
OK so let's look at our startups.

32

00:02:09,420  -->  00:02:14,390
Let's get started on them of course and started them before has a hundred and eighty two thousand dollar

33

00:02:14,400  -->  00:02:15,380
profit.

34

00:02:15,480  -->  00:02:16,830
And what about the prediction.

35

00:02:16,830  -->  00:02:19,850
A hundred and seventy is $3000 profit.

36

00:02:19,890  -->  00:02:23,550
So that's the predicted profit which is not far from the real profits.

37

00:02:23,550  -->  00:02:24,940
That's pretty good.

38

00:02:25,290  -->  00:02:26,540
OK what about the second one.

39

00:02:26,530  -->  00:02:31,590
One hundred and sixty six thousand for the real profit and a hundred and seventy two thousand for the

40

00:02:31,740  -->  00:02:32,850
predicted profit.

41

00:02:33,030  -->  00:02:36,330
Not too bad either then third observation.

42

00:02:36,330  -->  00:02:37,230
A hundred and fifty five.

43

00:02:37,230  -->  00:02:38,130
160.

44

00:02:38,130  -->  00:02:39,800
Good.

45

00:02:40,210  -->  00:02:42,330
146 135.

46

00:02:42,360  -->  00:02:44,100
Not too bad then.

47

00:02:44,130  -->  00:02:48,030
Ok then for example let's look at the start number 24.

48

00:02:48,130  -->  00:02:55,900
Number 24 had a real profit of $180000 and our predicted profit is a hundred and ten thousand dollars

49

00:02:55,970  -->  00:02:56,960
here we're pretty close.

50

00:02:56,960  -->  00:02:59,430
That's an accurate prediction a good one.

51

00:02:59,880  -->  00:03:00,610
OK.

52

00:03:00,720  -->  00:03:06,740
And oh that's even better for the last two ones because here it's 99000 here it's almost ninety nine

53

00:03:06,730  -->  00:03:11,950
thousand and ninety seven here for the last one and almost 97.

54

00:03:12,000  -->  00:03:12,870
So that's pretty good.

55

00:03:12,870  -->  00:03:19,320
That's a good model and remember that's the model with all the independent variables.

56

00:03:19,530  -->  00:03:25,110
But as we saw there is only truly significant viable which was the R&D spend.

57

00:03:25,200  -->  00:03:30,600
And so if we try to reconsider regressors by only putting the R&D spend in the pen and variable here

58

00:03:30,900  -->  00:03:36,810
you will see that the predictions are going to be the same with the same accuracy because the R&D spend

59

00:03:36,810  -->  00:03:40,360
is the only strong predictor of the profit.

60

00:03:40,530  -->  00:03:43,050
So you can try that yourself it can be a good practice.

61

00:03:43,200  -->  00:03:46,360
You can play around with the different independent variables.

62

00:03:46,410  -->  00:03:51,630
So I will let you do it yourself and continue to analyze interpret and play around with the multiple

63

00:03:51,830  -->  00:03:52,940
regression.

64

00:03:53,040  -->  00:03:54,410
That's the end of this tutorial.

65

00:03:54,420  -->  00:03:59,180
I was very happy to teach you how to make a multiple in their regression model.

66

00:03:59,190  -->  00:04:04,590
I look forward to see you in the next section when we'll be talking about a new kind of regressors because

67

00:04:04,590  -->  00:04:09,540
this time you're going to see that it's not a linear regress or it's going to be a polynomial regress

68

00:04:09,540  -->  00:04:09,920
or.

69

00:04:10,140  -->  00:04:15,150
And I can't wait to show you how it can give powerful predictions and we are going to use it on a very

70

00:04:15,150  -->  00:04:16,160
funny example.

71

00:04:16,230  -->  00:04:18,260
So there will be quite a challenge here.

72

00:04:18,390  -->  00:04:22,650
And just to give you a teasing of what we are going to do we are going to make kind of a line detector

73

00:04:22,950  -->  00:04:25,070
so I look forward to seeing you in the next section.

74

00:04:25,110  -->  00:04:26,930
And until then enjoy machine learning
