00:00:00.510  -->  00:00:05.880
The tutorial talks about the linear regression being a trend line that best fits your data.

2

00:00:05.970  -->  00:00:11.130
Today we'll find out how to find the best fitting light or in fact how the simple linear regression

3

00:00:11.280  -->  00:00:12.910
finds that line for you.

4

00:00:13.170  -->  00:00:15.990
So here's our simple your aggression.

5

00:00:16.020  -->  00:00:18.420
The same chart salary versus experience.

6

00:00:18.420  -->  00:00:25.500
We've got these red dots which represent the actual observations that we have in our data and we've

7

00:00:25.500  -->  00:00:33.210
got the trend line which represents the best fitting line or the simple linear regression model.

8

00:00:33.210  -->  00:00:39.270
So now let's draw some vertical lines from the actual observations to the model.

9

00:00:39.390  -->  00:00:44.030
And let's look at one of the specific examples to understand what we're talking about here.

10

00:00:44.370  -->  00:00:53.400
So here you can see that the Red Cross is where that person is sitting at in terms of salary so let's

11

00:00:53.400  -->  00:00:57.440
say this person with 10 years of experience is earning $100000.

12

00:00:57.510  -->  00:00:59.740
Well the model line.

13

00:00:59.790  -->  00:01:06.060
So the blackline at the bottom it actually tells us where that person should be sitting according to

14

00:01:06.060  -->  00:01:09.870
the model in terms of salary and according to models should be a bit lower.

15

00:01:09.870  -->  00:01:18.130
It should be somewhere without green crosses which is about maybe let's say thousand.

16

00:01:18.240  -->  00:01:23.020
So now the Red Cross is called Why I so why the subscript.

17

00:01:23.310  -->  00:01:25.470
And that is the actual duration.

18

00:01:25.590  -->  00:01:31.560
The Green Cross is called Why I have it and that is the model the observational.

19

00:01:31.570  -->  00:01:32.690
The modeled value.

20

00:01:32.700  -->  00:01:37.450
So basically with those that level of experience where would he be.

21

00:01:37.530  -->  00:01:39.440
Where does the model predict that he would be earning.

22

00:01:39.540  -->  00:01:43.860
And so the green line therefore is the difference between what he's actually earning and what he should

23

00:01:43.860  -->  00:01:44.280
be earning.

24

00:01:44.280  -->  00:01:48.000
So it should be what he's modeled to be earning.

25

00:01:48.030  -->  00:01:55.170
So therefore the green line will be the same regardless of what dependent variable you have whether

26

00:01:55.170  -->  00:01:57.640
it's salary or with it's grade school whatever.

27

00:01:57.750  -->  00:02:04.530
So it's the difference between the observed and the modeled for that level of independent variable.

28

00:02:04.530  -->  00:02:12.000
Now to get this best fitting line what is done is you take the sum you take each one of those green

29

00:02:12.000  -->  00:02:17.730
lines are those distances you square them and then you take some of those squares.

30

00:02:17.730  -->  00:02:21.960
Once you have the sum of the squares for you got to find the minimum.

31

00:02:21.960  -->  00:02:28.260
So basically what a simple linear regression does is it draws lots and lots and lots of these lines

32

00:02:28.260  -->  00:02:28.470
.

33

00:02:28.620  -->  00:02:34.560
These trend lines all this is like a simplistic way of imagining the linear regression draws all these

34

00:02:35.250  -->  00:02:42.670
all possible trend trendlines 3.0 and counts the sum of those squares every single time.

35

00:02:42.690  -->  00:02:49.260
And it's recall records that somewhere in a temporary you know for file or something like that and then

36

00:02:49.260  -->  00:02:55.590
it finds the minimum one so it looks for the minimum sum of squares and finds a line which has the smallest

37

00:02:55.590  -->  00:02:57.470
sum of squares possible.

38

00:02:57.840  -->  00:03:03.710
And that line will be the best fitting line and that is called the ordinary least squares method.

39

00:03:03.990  -->  00:03:09.330
So that's how the simple linear regression works and look for you on the next tutorial.
