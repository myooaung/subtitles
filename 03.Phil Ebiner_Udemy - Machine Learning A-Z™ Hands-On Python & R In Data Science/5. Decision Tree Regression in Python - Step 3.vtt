Hello my friends.

2
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:07.280
I hope you're feeling amazing and I hope mostly that you tried predicting that new resolve yourself.

3
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.150
And if you did.

4
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:09.480
I'm sure you succeeded.

5
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.120
And if not that's okay because we're now about to succeed together.

6
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.340
All right let's do this.

7
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.220
Let's create a new Kotel here to make that prediction.

8
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.460
And so now you know with what we did previously with the SVR or it's gonna seem so simple because indeed

9
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.220
in order to make that prediction since there was no future Skilling needed for a decision tree regression.

10
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:39.750
Well we just have to take our regrets or from which we just need to call the predict method and then

11
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.670
inside what do we have to input.

12
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:49.070
Well no transform method of course because there was no feature scaling but only that observation.

13
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.490
Six point five for which we would like to have the corresponding salary.

14
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:59.140
And then remember how we need to format that single position level of six point five.

15
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:07.570
We have to put it of course in a 2D array by adding here a double pair of square brackets inside which

16
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.600
you will put your observation six point five.

17
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:11.370
All right.

18
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:12.990
As simple as that.

19
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.610
And now.

20
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.420
Well the exercise is done.

21
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.880
We are ready to get this prediction is predicted salary of the position of six point five.

22
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:21.800
So let's see.

23
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.440
Let's see what our decision tree regression all returns compare to not only the previous predictions

24
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:35.430
of our other regression models but also you know compared to what this person mentioned to earn in this

25
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.710
previous company.

26
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.540
All right so let's execute the cell and the predicted salary of the decision true regression model for

27
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.290
are specific case.

28
00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.740
He is one hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

29
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.610
So before we make any comment on this because you know if we really stick to the scenario of our case

30
00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:00.480
study well this prediction would actually be bad because it would be lower than the requested salary

31
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.060
of this employee and therefore that would not be good.

32
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.960
But let's not comment on this because then you'll see as I told you that the visualization of the decision

33
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.410
to re regression results will not be pretty.

34
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.220
And that's because as I told you at the beginning of this section the decision tree regression model

35
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.940
is clearly not the best model to use on a single feature dataset.

36
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:22.320
Right.

37
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:28.560
It is more adapted to datasets with many features a high dimensional dataset and that's totally fine

38
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:35.400
because the code we are implementing here can be very easily used on other datasets with other features.

39
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.170
That's what I explained in the first story of the section with you know the only one or two changes

40
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.720
to make in the data repricing phase but I still want to show you the visualization results because we

41
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.650
can only do this in 2D.

42
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.700
That's why I chose this simple dataset it's in order to show you at the end what the regression curve

43
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.250
looks like for each of the regression models.

44
00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.720
And so we're going to still visualize that for the decision true regression model but you will see that

45
00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.360
it will be clearly not well adapted.

46
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.790
All right.

47
00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.090
So congratulation for that prediction.

48
00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.340
And now in the final tutorial this section we will plot the decision through regression curve in high

49
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.080
resolution to see what it looks like.

50
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.890
And until then enjoy machine learning.
