Hello and welcome to this tutorial.

2
00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:05.070
And this one we're going to learn how to import the data set.

3
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.330
OK so here I am on R and ask for python.

4
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.750
We need to set the working directory so to do this we have to go to files here.

5
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.380
Here I am on my desktop.

6
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.760
So let's go to our folder data processing part 1.

7
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.420
Here it is Section 2.

8
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.270
And this is the right folder that contains the data set data.

9
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:25.220
That's easy.

10
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.390
So this is the folder that you want to choose to set as working directory.

11
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.010
And now to set this working directory on our you to do one more thing you need to click on this more

12
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.270
button here and click on set as working directory.

13
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.000
And here it is.

14
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.810
Now we know that this is the right working directory and we are ready to start importing the dataset

15
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:47.210
OK.

16
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.120
So to do this in are what we need to do is very simple.

17
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.160
We will just need one line of code.

18
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.870
So as in Python we're gonna call it data set.

19
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.760
That's the variable that will be the data set itself.

20
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.730
And now to import a data set is very easy.

21
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:09.270
You need to type read that C as V and then in parenthesis you just type the name of your data set in

22
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.690
quotes.

23
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.580
So here you have to type data that C as V.

24
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.320
And that's it.

25
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:17.940
That's all you need to do.

26
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.480
So now we're going to select this line of code and execute.

27
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.800
Okay.

28
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.540
So let's have a look at our data set to do this you just need to click here on the data set and it just

29
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.460
displays here.

30
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:30.300
OK.

31
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.860
So we have our four columns.

32
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.940
Country eight salary per chased and our 10 observations.

33
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:42.010
And what's interesting to see here is that unlike Python indexes don't start at zero but at 1.

34
00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.050
So that's why the first observations started one here and adds a 10.

35
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.590
So that's the second distinction you have to understand between python and R.

36
00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.080
Of course you I have to program on both.

37
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.320
You can choose the one you prefer but if you want to program on both.

38
00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.500
As I usually do it's good to have this distinction in mind.

39
00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.880
OK.

40
00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.020
So we have our data set.

41
00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.890
It's all fine.

42
00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:10.390
And as I just said here we don't have to make the distinction between a matrix of features and a dependent

43
00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:11.470
variable vector.

44
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.480
And this will make perfect sense for you as we go along with this part 1 data processing.

45
00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.930
You'll perfectly understand why next materials.

46
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.790
OK.

47
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:27.550
So that's it for the importing the data said step of the data processing phase.

48
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:28.960
So that's it for this tutorial.

49
00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.420
I look forward to seeing you in the next one which will be to learn how to take care of missing data

50
00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.780
because sometimes your dataset will contain missing data and you have to take care of this.

51
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.350
And that's what we're going to learn in the next tutorial.

52
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:42.750
So I look forward to seeing you there.

53
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.530
And until then enjoy machine learning.
