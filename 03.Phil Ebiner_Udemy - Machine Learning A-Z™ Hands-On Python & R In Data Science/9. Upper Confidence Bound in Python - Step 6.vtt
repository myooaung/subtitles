00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.920
Our my friends.

2
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.280
Let's finish this implementation.

3
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.830
Indeed we're very close to the end.

4
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.530
We have already implemented step one step two and step three and now we just need to finish this by

5
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.680
you know updating these variables that were created and initialized right before this big for loop iterating

6
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.050
through the round through the users.

7
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.280
All right.

8
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:25.650
So let's start simply with this one at selected which is the full list of all the ads selected over

9
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.520
the round.

10
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:32.460
So let's paisa here you know here I'm back inside this first full loop iterating through around.

11
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.220
And right now how do you think we must update this at selected variable.

12
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.400
Well simply of course we have to add to this list the ad that was just selected you know right here

13
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.850
you know in this second follow up.

14
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:46.450
All right.

15
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.900
And you know the trick there is this append function in both and that allows to add an element to a

16
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.660
list and well that's exactly what we're going to use now we're going to add a dot here then add append

17
00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.030
for the append function and say this function you have to input the element which you want to add to

18
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.430
this add selected list.

19
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:04.740
Right.

20
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:10.960
And that's of course at you know that ad variable that was computed here in this second folio.

21
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.530
All right so that's how you update this for as valuable at selected then next step.

22
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:24.120
Well next step is simply to update this variable now numbers of selections which is a list of 10 values

23
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.550
corresponding to the 10 add.

24
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:32.640
And for each of these values while you have the number of times the ad was selected up to round in that

25
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.880
same round and we're dealing with right now in this first loop.

26
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.300
All right.

27
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.480
So let's paste it right here and now according to you how are we going to update this variable.

28
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:51.030
Well since this ad was just selected in this new round n well therefore we need to update the element

29
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:57.240
of index ad basically the index of the ad was just selected inside its numbers of selections list.

30
00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.220
We need to update that element by incrementing it by 1.

31
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.500
All right.

32
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.650
So here not only we need to take this list numbers of selections but we need to take mostly the element

33
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:14.230
of index at the index of the ADD that was just selected and then you have two ways to do this.

34
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:21.000
The first classic way is doing a plus equals one which increments this particular number you know the

35
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.370
element of index add inside it's numbers of selections list by one or you know if you don't like this

36
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:35.760
notation you can simply do it equal then you copy this again you pay that here and you just add plus

37
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.440
1 as you want.

38
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.090
That's exactly the same depends on how you prefer to see it.

39
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.450
OK.

40
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:48.690
Then let's update this variable sums of rewards which is the accumulated reward for each of the add

41
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.740
in the same list of 10 elements corresponding to the add.

42
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.310
So I'm copying this then I'm pasting in here.

43
00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:02.460
Then of course what we need to change inside this list is that element of index add you know that index

44
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.690
of the ADD that was just selected.

45
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:05.340
So there we go.

46
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.730
Let's here add in a pair of square brackets add the index out of add that was just elected and then

47
00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.240
same we're going to update it again you know we're going to take that.

48
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.080
And then according to you what do we have to add to this sums of rewards and especially to this element

49
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.070
of the next add inside this sums of rewards list.

50
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.950
Well that's exactly the reward that we got by selecting this ad.

51
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.700
You know this ad which had the maximum upper bound.

52
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.410
And where do we have these rewards for each of the ads.

53
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.850
Well that's of course in our dataset.

54
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.480
Right.

55
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.060
This dataset is a simulation telling us for each user on which ad they're going to click.

56
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.960
You know we don't know that in reality but this dataset is a simulation.

57
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:54.410
And therefore we have for each user and for each ad if the user clicks Yes or no on the ad.

58
00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.960
And since now we know with which user we're dealing with thanks to this you know round because the round

59
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.760
here corresponds to the user.

60
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:09.180
And since we also know which ad were selected you know because of this second full loop Well we can

61
00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.570
directly access the reward.

62
00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.020
That was just received at this particular round.

63
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:20.220
And for this particular ad that was selected and the way to do this is simply to take here are data

64
00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.090
set.

65
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.560
Right.

66
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.040
Because this is the original dataset.

67
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.260
But remember that we created dependent data frame in this data set variable.

68
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.500
So we need to take our data set and then remember we need to add a values you know to access a particular

69
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.560
value of this data set and then we need to enter inside some pair of square brackets.

70
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.920
Well first the index of the row of the cell.

71
00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:48.160
We want access which is of course n because n corresponds to the user meaning the row.

72
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.490
And then we need to enter the index of the column of the cell we're dealing with which is of course

73
00:04:53.490 --> 00:05:00.000
the add that was selected because now we need to get the reward of the ADD that was selected for for

74
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.940
the particular user we're dealing with right now in this first full loop and that's exactly data set

75
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.720
that values and at.

76
00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:08.430
Okay.

77
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.710
And now I'm just gonna do something so that it's really clear to you that this is the reward we got

78
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.960
at this particular round end.

79
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.140
And in order to do this I'm going to take that here.

80
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:26.530
Cut it and right between these two lines of code I'm gonna create a new viable which I'm going to call

81
00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.520
reward you know so that I can really highlight that this is the reward.

82
00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:37.830
You know the reward collected after showing this ad to this user in this is the reward and therefore

83
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.080
here I'm just going to add reward.

84
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.160
All right so that you can clearly see that very important concept in reinforcement learning.

85
00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.990
You know it's all about that reward.

86
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.970
The reward that is collected at each round.

87
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.010
And then the accumulated reward.

88
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:55.620
And speaking of the accumulated reward Well that's exactly our next step here because indeed the last

89
00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:03.250
variable which we have to update is that variable computing the total reward we get up to around 10.

90
00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:09.930
And now you will perfectly know how to update that total reward variable according to you what do we

91
00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.340
have to do here.

92
00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:20.130
Well you know we just need to add to this total reward variable that last reward which we just got at

93
00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:20.850
this round.

94
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:25.770
And this reward of selecting the ad and showing it to the user.

95
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.910
All right.

96
00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:28.110
And that's it my friends.

97
00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:32.380
Now the UCB algorithm is fully implemented.

98
00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:38.850
If this sounds a bit overwhelming Well I really encourage you to try to implement that fully again because

99
00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:42.090
really you just have to follow a logic and then everything makes sense.

100
00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:46.500
So I understand that you know this is the first time we implement such a code because you know so far

101
00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.350
we've only worked with libraries.

102
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:49.960
It was simpler before.

103
00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.860
But you also need to know how to implement such algorithms from scratch.

104
00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.600
And so here it's really good that we did it.

105
00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:00.900
But don't worry if it feels a bit overwhelming you just have to you know either we watch the videos

106
00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:06.450
or try to re implement this from scratch yourself and I promise you that this will sound easy peasy.

107
00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:07.040
OK.

108
00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.570
So no worries.

109
00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:09.920
Do this again if needed.

110
00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.010
And whenever you're ready.

111
00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:19.110
Meet me in the next material to plot the final histogram which will show us exactly which ad was identified

112
00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:24.570
as the best ad you know the ad with the highest conversion rate by this UCB algorithm.

113
00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:26.100
I can't wait to show this to you.

114
00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.990
And until then enjoy machine learning.
