00:00:00.240  -->  00:00:05.730
Hello and welcome to this art tutorial and to produce tutorials we implemented our logistic regression

2

00:00:05.730  -->  00:00:06.980
model on python.

3

00:00:07.080  -->  00:00:09.020
And this time we're going to do it on our.

4

00:00:09.270  -->  00:00:12.970
So the first thing need to do is to set a working directory.

5

00:00:13.170  -->  00:00:14.710
Right now I'm on my desktop.

6

00:00:14.730  -->  00:00:17.370
So let's go to the machine or an easy folder.

7

00:00:17.560  -->  00:00:21.860
Part 3 classification section logistic regression.

8

00:00:21.960  -->  00:00:23.850
And here we are on the right folder.

9

00:00:24.060  -->  00:00:29.490
So that's the folder to set up working directory let's make sure we have the social network ads.

10

00:00:29.490  -->  00:00:30.700
See as we file.

11

00:00:30.780  -->  00:00:31.500
All good.

12

00:00:31.500  -->  00:00:36.760
So I'm going to click on this more button here to set this folder as a working directory.

13

00:00:36.840  -->  00:00:37.620
And here we go.

14

00:00:37.620  -->  00:00:40.820
Everything is fine we're ready to start making the model.

15

00:00:41.040  -->  00:00:47.070
So the first step as usual is to preprocess the data and to do this of course we're going to use our

16

00:00:47.070  -->  00:00:50.640
data pre-processing template that we made in part 1.

17

00:00:50.700  -->  00:00:58.350
So I'm going to select all this copy and then I'm going to go back to my logistic regression file to

18

00:00:58.440  -->  00:00:59.860
paste it here.

19

00:00:59.940  -->  00:01:04.780
All right and now we just need to change a few things to pre-process are they.

20

00:01:04.780  -->  00:01:14.740
That's of course the name of the data set here which is social network ads.

21

00:01:14.790  -->  00:01:15.630
All right.

22

00:01:15.720  -->  00:01:17.580
And then we interchange another few more things.

23

00:01:17.580  -->  00:01:22.170
But first let's select this line to see what our dataset looks like.

24

00:01:22.170  -->  00:01:24.690
So command and control us enter to execute.

25

00:01:24.810  -->  00:01:27.240
Here we go the data set is well imported.

26

00:01:27.420  -->  00:01:29.000
Let's click on that.

27

00:01:29.250  -->  00:01:30.940
And here is the data set.

28

00:01:30.960  -->  00:01:37.410
So as a quick reminder this dataset contains informations of users of a social network.

29

00:01:37.590  -->  00:01:44.130
These informations are to user id the gender the age and the estimated salary and the social network

30

00:01:44.130  -->  00:01:51.360
has several business clients and its business clients put ads on the social network for marketing campaigns

31

00:01:51.360  -->  00:01:58.200
purposes and one of their business clients is a car company who has just launched its brand new luxury

32

00:01:58.200  -->  00:02:00.880
SUV at a ridiculous price.

33

00:02:00.960  -->  00:02:05.740
So this car company put ads of their SUV product on the social network.

34

00:02:06.000  -->  00:02:12.990
And then the social network gathered some informations about which users responded positively to the

35

00:02:12.990  -->  00:02:19.500
ads and by buying the product and those who responded negatively by not buying the product.

36

00:02:19.500  -->  00:02:21.440
So that's what the last column is about.

37

00:02:21.630  -->  00:02:28.230
The last column tells for each user if the user bought the car and then it's a one or didn't buy the

38

00:02:28.230  -->  00:02:30.150
car and then it's zero.

39

00:02:30.600  -->  00:02:32.760
All right so that's the business problem itself.

40

00:02:32.910  -->  00:02:38.940
And now our mission is to make logistic regression model that will try to understand the correlations

41

00:02:38.940  -->  00:02:45.510
between information such as the age and the salary and the decision of the user to buy yes or no the

42

00:02:45.510  -->  00:02:46.800
SUV.

43

00:02:46.800  -->  00:02:51.450
All right so let's go back to our logistic regression model and let's see what we need to change next

44

00:02:51.450  -->  00:02:52.110
.

45

00:02:52.110  -->  00:02:57.170
So this line is to select the variables who want to train our model with.

46

00:02:57.180  -->  00:03:02.130
So as I just said we're going to train our model with only the age and the salary.

47

00:03:02.130  -->  00:03:07.200
So that means that we want to predict that the user is going to buy the SUV based on only the age and

48

00:03:07.200  -->  00:03:08.220
the salary.

49

00:03:08.640  -->  00:03:13.160
So here will need to select the indexes of the columns we want to take for our model.

50

00:03:13.470  -->  00:03:18.100
So I'm going to remove that as comment and let's look at the indexes.

51

00:03:18.090  -->  00:03:23.620
OK so indexes in our data one that's one two three four and five.

52

00:03:23.760  -->  00:03:27.420
So we only want to take the indexes 3 4 and 5.

53

00:03:27.750  -->  00:03:29.400
So let's do this.

54

00:03:29.400  -->  00:03:33.710
We're going to choose from three to five.

55

00:03:34.020  -->  00:03:38.460
All right so now let's select this and execute.

56

00:03:38.580  -->  00:03:39.070
All right.

57

00:03:39.090  -->  00:03:44.370
And now if we go back to our data sets you can see that we only have our three columns of interest which

58

00:03:44.370  -->  00:03:47.850
are the age the salary and purchased.

59

00:03:47.850  -->  00:03:48.820
Okay.

60

00:03:49.380  -->  00:03:55.290
Now next step next step is to split the data sets into the training set and the test sets and here what

61

00:03:55.290  -->  00:03:58.690
we only need to change is the split ratio or maybe not.

62

00:03:58.950  -->  00:04:04.710
But we have 400 observations I think a good split would be to have 300 observations in the training

63

00:04:04.710  -->  00:04:08.160
set and 100 observations in the test set.

64

00:04:08.160  -->  00:04:12.300
And to do this we need to take 0.75.

65

00:04:12.300  -->  00:04:15.390
That is 75 percent go into the training set.

66

00:04:15.480  -->  00:04:17.180
That is 300 observations.

67

00:04:17.520  -->  00:04:22.560
Okay so let's look like this and come in or control us enter to execute.

68

00:04:22.560  -->  00:04:23.380
Here we go.

69

00:04:23.400  -->  00:04:28.570
Now let's look at our training set and our test set.

70

00:04:28.650  -->  00:04:35.040
All right so our training centers you can see has 300 observations and the test said has 100 observations

71

00:04:35.370  -->  00:04:36.310
listed here.

72

00:04:36.570  -->  00:04:37.800
Perfect.

73

00:04:37.800  -->  00:04:42.450
Now let's go back to a logistic regression and take care of the next step which is the feature scaling

74

00:04:42.450  -->  00:04:43.110
.

75

00:04:43.110  -->  00:04:46.770
So for classification it's better to do feature skating.

76

00:04:46.770  -->  00:04:52.240
So we're going to do it we're going to remove those guns here by pressing command or control plus shift

77

00:04:52.260  -->  00:04:53.590
plus seat.

78

00:04:53.840  -->  00:04:54.770
All right.

79

00:04:54.950  -->  00:05:01.960
And now let's check that we have the right indexes here we have indexes two and three here.

80

00:05:01.970  -->  00:05:04.160
The dependent variable is categorical.

81

00:05:04.380  -->  00:05:08.090
So we will only scale this and that's index 1 and 2.

82

00:05:08.340  -->  00:05:10.730
So let's go back to our logistic regression model.

83

00:05:10.830  -->  00:05:26.300
And so here we need to choose one to two let's do it for the 4 to 1 2 and 1 2.

84

00:05:26.310  -->  00:05:27.050
All right.

85

00:05:27.120  -->  00:05:31.170
Select this in a control and so execute.

86

00:05:31.170  -->  00:05:32.370
And here we go.

87

00:05:32.400  -->  00:05:34.410
Now let's have a look at our training sets.

88

00:05:35.160  -->  00:05:39.570
The age and the salary are perfectly scaled and the same for the test sets.

89

00:05:39.600  -->  00:05:41.340
Perfect perfect scale.

90

00:05:41.610  -->  00:05:45.250
All right so we are done with the data preprocessing phase.

91

00:05:45.330  -->  00:05:47.760
Now our data set is well preprocessed.

92

00:05:47.850  -->  00:05:49.400
So that's the end of this tutorial.

93

00:05:49.410  -->  00:05:56.190
I can't wait to build this logistic regression model on our dataset that is now prepared in the next

94

00:05:56.190  -->  00:05:57.230
tutorials.

95

00:05:57.270  -->  00:05:58.900
Until then enjoy machine learning
