00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.470
Hello welcome back to the course on machine learning.
1

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.380
Super excited to have you on board.
2

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.940
And today I'm going to show you how to install R studio and  the R programming language onto your computer
3

4
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.700
so it doesn't matter whether you have a Mac or a Windows PC.
4

5
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.480
The steps are very very similar.
5

6
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.800
And going to be doing this on a Windows PC.
6

7
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.400
So just follow along and we'll get it sorted in no time.
7

8
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.110
All right so first thing you'll need is as always a browser.
8

9
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:34.020
So I've got my Chrome browser here and the first website they're in to go to is https://cran.r-project.org
9

10
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.890
you don't have that in just a: cran.r-project.org
10

11
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.710
And so if you go here you will see a page like this.
11

12
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.430
And here you can download R for Linux, Mac or Windows.
12

13
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.950
So I'm going to install R for Windows and that's one which Click this link here but a select a version
13

14
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.710
that's best for your machine.
14

15
00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.600
And then once we here all we need to do is click this link.
15

16
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.040
This is what you want to install.
16

17
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.770
This is what you want to install R for the first time so it just showing you here exactly and then
17

18
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.430
just install the latest version of R So actually just download it
18

19
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.800
You'll get an exit file for Windows and then you'll just need to run it and that will install the R
19

20
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.790
programming language onto your machine.
20

21
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.900
So I'm just going to.
21

22
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.790
While it's downloading I'm just going to show you what it looks like for Mac.
22

23
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.920
So if you go for the Mac version and then here you just need to kind of read through some of these comments
23

24
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.670
I guess and download this version over here.
24

25
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.270
This is the latest one.
25

26
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.550
Again it depends on the version of your Mac if you have the latest version of Mac that will be obvious
26

27
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.500
which for download so you'll probably get this version or we're here and download on to Mac.
27

28
00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.560
And obviously, I don't need that version because my computer is a Windows.
28

29
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:56.190
Then once you have R downloaded just run this file it's going to ask Windows might ask you some security
29

30
00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.390
questions and then select OK and then just the standard installation process just go through.
30

31
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.490
I'm not going to do this because I already have it installed.
31

32
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.220
Best of course.
32

33
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.670
Install it on on the recommended drive and once installed That's it.
33

34
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.260
So you've got R on your machine. 
34

35
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:16.180
But the thing here is that we also need an IDE an integrated development environment to work with R
35

36
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.150
and the best environment for working with R
36

37
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.210
And that's that I find and probably most people find is R studio.
37

38
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:31.800
It's a environment developed specifically for working with R and it is very very convenient for a
38

39
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.970
data science type of thing.
39

40
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.980
So to get to R studio you need to go to WWW.RSTUDIO.COM one word and then just click R
40

41
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:45.330
studio over here in the bottom and next in this on this page just scroll down and download R studio
41

42
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.960
desktop so it's a free software just as R is free.
42

43
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:54.300
R studio is also free so just download R studio for desktop and then it's going to take you to download
43

44
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.980
page and then you just need to make sure just to get the free one you don't need the commercial license
44

45
00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.030
.
45

46
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.270
So you need R studio desktop to click download and then installer's.
46

47
00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:13.160
So again select your platform whether it's Windows Mac or something else and just download this store
47

48
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.580
and there you go.
48

49
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.290
It's going to download to a computer.
49

50
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.280
Give it a second.
50

51
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.900
It's going to start loading just now.
51

52
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:19.480
There it is.
52

53
00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.550
And so once it's loaded again all you have to do is run the installation process.
53

54
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:25.650
Very straightforward.
54

55
00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.320
And when it's all done you'll get R studio.
55

56
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.640
You'll be able to launch our studio which will automatically detect that R programming language which
56

57
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.780
installed into machine earlier and so R studio looks like this.
57

58
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.320
Congratulations If you've got an up to this step that means you've installed R studios.
58

59
00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:49.110
I'm going to expand it to full screen mode here and this is exactly the environment that we're going
59

60
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.190
to be working with and hopefully, you've already somewhat familiar with R.
60

61
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.980
And that will help you pick up the tutorials that are upcoming very quickly.
61

62
00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.980
And just to finish off today's tutorial I'm going to quickly show you how you can customize R studio so if you're
62

63
00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.280
windows you need to go to tool tools and go to Global Options on a Mac.
63

64
00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.530
It'll be somewhere on the left will be a button R studio and there will be preferences or you can also go
64

65
00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.610
through tools and it's how the preferences are Global Options.
65

66
00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.470
It's not it's not that hard to allocate.
66

67
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.860
It's a bit different than the Mac but still the same same kind of menu that you're looking for and then
67

68
00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.970
an appearance you can change the appearance of your R studio.
68

69
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.090
So it's up to you it's your individual preference.
69

70
00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.590
You can change what it looks like so let me click Apply let me try a different one.
70

71
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.930
It wasn't a good choice so Cobalt is a good one.
71

72
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.550
And then you can change the size.
72

73
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.290
So like I'm going to change the size and in this course you'll see that the size is changed so that
73

74
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.460
we can see better the code but you don't have to.
74

75
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:51.510
And then you can just change the different color schemes you want for your code and you've got some
75

76
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.500
lovely previews over here.
76

77
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.450
And that just helps you better adjust R studio to your preference.
77

78
00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:05.490
So if you want to default and you just select Text Mate and will be the default version and to finish
78

79
00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:14.340
off let's just quickly type in the standard coding practice for and install a new programming language
79

80
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.950
and computer.
80

81
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.960
So just type in print and then in brackets.
81

82
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.550
Hello world.
82

83
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:25.430
That will be our first program in R studio so just press enter after that.
83

84
00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.280
And there you go.
84

85
00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.310
It's a run for you on a Mac.
85

86
00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.760
I think it's Command return to run some code.
86

87
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:33.530
So there we go.
87

88
00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.730
That's our studio installed.
88

89
00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.700
And I look forward seeing you on the next tutorial, until then
89

90
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:39.580
enjoy Machine learning
