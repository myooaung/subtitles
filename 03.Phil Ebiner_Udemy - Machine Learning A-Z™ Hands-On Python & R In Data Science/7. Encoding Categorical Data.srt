00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,470
Hello and welcome to this tutorial.

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:05,310
Okay so we are halfway our data repossessing phase.

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,810
We learned how to import the libraries to import a data set.

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,960
We learned how to take care of missing data.

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,310
And today we're going to learn how to encode categorical data.

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:20,600
So the first thing that we're going to do is that we are going to explain why we need to do this.

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,120
So I'm gonna go to google sheets here to find my data set.

8
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:28,720
And in this data set we can see that we have two categorical variables.

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,640
We have the country variable here and the purchase is variable.

10
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:39,030
These two variables are categorical variables because simply they contain categories here the country

11
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,930
contains three categories.

12
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,060
It's France Spain and Germany and the purchase variable contains two categories.

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,130
Yes and no.

14
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,370
So that's why they're called categorical variables.

15
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:56,100
And now you can guess that since machine learning models are based on mathematical equations you can

16
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,050
intuitively understand that it would cause some problem if we keep the text here in the categorical

17
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,790
variables in the equations because we would only want numbers in the equations.

18
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:12,900
So that's why we need to encode the critical variables that is to encode the text that we have here

19
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,840
into numbers okay.

20
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,790
So in this tutorial we're going to encode these two variables country and poor chased and you're going

21
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,250
to see that the technique is quite different.

22
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,080
So here we on are we're going to use something very practical and are.

23
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:33,300
That is the factor function and the factor function will transform your categorical variables into Numeric

24
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:39,690
categories but it will see the variable as factors and you will be able to choose the labels of those

25
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:40,250
factors.

26
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:46,320
And due to the specific reason we will need to create three columns for each category we will just transform

27
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,190
the country column into a column of factors.

28
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,580
And we are going to specify what the factors are.

29
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:53,340
So let's do this.

30
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,370
Let's start by encoding the country column.

31
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:04,630
So we just need to take the column country and to do this we type data set $ country equals and then

32
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:11,490
we use the factor function factor and in factor we are going to specify three things.

33
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:15,390
So let's have a look at the fact a function to do this we click on F1.

34
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:15,720
OK.

35
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:19,320
So this contains some info about the factor function.

36
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:25,360
Let's look at the arguments the first argument is the data that we want to transform into factors.

37
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:32,490
So this is of course going to be our country column from our dataset.

38
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:40,310
OK then the second parameter is levels and that's the names of the categories in our country column.

39
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,590
So let's add here levels equals.

40
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:49,290
So we're gonna write the vector of levels here see parentheses and then we will input here are three

41
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,040
categories.

42
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:56,770
So that's France Spain and Germany.

43
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,490
All right.

44
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:04,810
So by the way C here is a vector and R so by creating this C France Spain Germany we are creating a

45
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,270
vector of three elements.

46
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:10,660
There is France Spain and Germany again.

47
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:16,480
The last argument that we need to input is labels because we want to choose which number we want to

48
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,120
give to France to Spain and to Germany.

49
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:25,780
So we're going to add here labels and then since we transform our country categorical variable into

50
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,600
factors we don't really care what numbers to use.

51
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:36,120
So let's use one for France to for Spain and 3 for Germany.

52
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:41,180
So this has nothing to do with my preference it's not because I'm French that I choose one for France.

53
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:44,260
It is absolutely non order related.

54
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,990
So it's just by default that I use one to three.

55
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,250
Okay so that's it.

56
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:54,310
We just I just forgot one parenthesis and I think this should disappear.

57
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:54,820
Yes.

58
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,540
Good.

59
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:55,770
Okay.

60
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:00,490
So the encoding of the country categorical variable is ready.

61
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,770
It's actually more simple than in Python.

62
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:10,180
So before selecting and executing this let's look at our dataset our dataset contains our country written

63
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,590
and text.

64
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:15,970
And now let's select this execute.

65
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:18,390
And now let's look at our data set.

66
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,230
Perfect.

67
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:27,250
Our country contains our encoded variable and as you can see one is France to Spain and 3 is Germany.

68
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:32,460
Okay so that's all good and now we need to do the same for the purchase column and it's exactly the

69
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:38,260
same we're going to use the factor function we're gonna transform the text category into numerical labels.

70
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,140
So let's do it right now.

71
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:43,100
We're going to copy this pasted here.

72
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:48,070
Here we're gonna replace country by pur chased.

73
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,680
All right.

74
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,430
Same for here.

75
00:04:53,460 --> 00:05:01,440
Here we need to change the levels because there are new categories so the liberals are going to be no.

76
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,540
And yes.

77
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,340
OK.

78
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:07,680
And now of course we need to change the labels.

79
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,510
So we're gonna put 0 4 no and 1 for yes.

80
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,020
I think that's what actually makes sense and parenthesis again.

81
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:17,620
That's right.

82
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:22,120
Let's look at the data set the data set contains no one yes and the purchase column.

83
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:29,670
And now if I select this and execute the data set contains now 0 and 1.

84
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,330
Perfect.

85
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,130
We're all good.

86
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:38,580
We we are encoded or categorical data and are and now you know everything that there is to know about

87
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:45,600
encoding categorical data in Python and R so congratulations we almost did the most difficult part.

88
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,260
We are approaching soon the fun and exciting part about making models.

89
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,690
So we are almost there.

90
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:56,370
Hang on for one or two more tutorials and this is gonna get very exciting.

91
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:00,630
Thank you for watching this tutorial and I look forward to seeing you in the next tutorial.

92
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,280
Until then enjoy machine learning.
