00:00:00,780  -->  00:00:06,540
Bearable trap last time we learn how to create dummy variables to replace our categorical predictors

2

00:00:06,540  -->  00:00:08,490
state in the model.

3

00:00:08,490  -->  00:00:12,580
We also discussed that you can never include both dummy variables at the same time.

4

00:00:12,630  -->  00:00:15,590
In our example we admitted the California dummy.

5

00:00:15,900  -->  00:00:17,280
Now why is that.

6

00:00:17,280  -->  00:00:21,830
What will happen if we include the second dummy variable in the model as well.

7

00:00:22,170  -->  00:00:26,870
Let's see then tension here is that you're basically duplicating a variable.

8

00:00:26,880  -->  00:00:35,700
This is because D2 always equals to one minus D1 the phenomenon where one or several independent variables

9

00:00:35,700  -->  00:00:41,370
in a linear regression predict another is called multicollinearity as a result of this effect the model

10

00:00:41,370  -->  00:00:46,140
cannot distinguish between the effects of D-1 from the effects from of D2.

11

00:00:46,260  -->  00:00:48,930
And therefore it won't work properly.

12

00:00:48,930  -->  00:00:51,470
And this is called the dummy variable trap.

13

00:00:51,660  -->  00:00:57,540
If you do the math behind this scenario you will see that the real problem is that you cannot have these

14

00:00:57,540  -->  00:01:02,920
three elements in your model at the same time the constant and both the dummy variables.

15

00:01:02,970  -->  00:01:07,170
I will leave it up to you to figure this one out on your own and let me know if you have any trouble

16

00:01:07,180  -->  00:01:07,200
.

17

00:01:07,200  -->  00:01:08,730
I'll definitely help here.

18

00:01:09,150  -->  00:01:15,870
So to sum up whenever you're building a model always admit to one dummy variable and this applies irrespective

19

00:01:15,870  -->  00:01:20,090
of the number of dummy variables they are in that specific dummy set.

20

00:01:20,340  -->  00:01:23,970
If you have nine then you should only include eight if you have 100.

21

00:01:23,970  -->  00:01:26,300
Then you should only include 99 of them.

22

00:01:26,490  -->  00:01:31,200
Also note that if you have two sets of dummy variables then you need to apply the same rule to each

23

00:01:31,200  -->  00:01:32,160
set.

24

00:01:32,160  -->  00:01:37,530
For instance we could have had a column which specifies the industry in which the companies operate

25

00:01:38,160  -->  00:01:43,110
to build the model in that case we would have had to perform exactly the same steps and create another

26

00:01:43,110  -->  00:01:46,060
set of dummy variables specifically for that column.

27

00:01:46,350  -->  00:01:51,770
And then we would include all but one of those dummy variables in our actual model.

28

00:01:51,780  -->  00:01:56,340
I hope this explanation was useful and you will never fall victim of the dummy variable trapped in your

29

00:01:56,340  -->  00:01:57,260
modeling.

30

00:01:57,300  -->  00:02:00,720
Next time we're going to cover the different ways you can build a model.

31

00:02:00,750  -->  00:02:06,400
We will learn all about backward elimination of forward selection stepwise regression and much more

32

00:02:06,530  -->  00:02:06,700
.

33

00:02:06,880  -->  00:02:10,330
Going to be an exciting tutorial and I look forward to seeing you then.
