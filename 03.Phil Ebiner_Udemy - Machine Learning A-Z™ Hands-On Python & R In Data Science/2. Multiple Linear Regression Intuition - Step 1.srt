1

00:00:00,210  -->  00:00:05,670
Multiple linear regression the same thing but many variables so bizzarro one constant and then many

2

00:00:05,670  -->  00:00:13,890
combinations or many pairs of B and X and it can go up to quite a lot depends on how many regressors

3

00:00:13,890  -->  00:00:14,810
you have here.

4

00:00:14,860  -->  00:00:16,780
Once again you've got a dependent variable y.

5

00:00:16,800  -->  00:00:21,870
So something you're explaining but this time the difference is that you think there might be a few causation

6

00:00:21,880  -->  00:00:22,150
so.

7

00:00:22,180  -->  00:00:27,930
So in the case of salary for instance it could be how much years of experience you've done how many

8

00:00:27,930  -->  00:00:37,650
other courses you've done how much you know how much time you spend at work or things like that or how

9

00:00:37,680  -->  00:00:43,840
valuable how much money you make for the company in terms of a student and his grades if you depend

10

00:00:43,840  -->  00:00:44,260
variable.

11

00:00:44,280  -->  00:00:50,160
What grade does a student get then in the independent variables could be how much the student has studied

12

00:00:50,160  -->  00:00:56,520
for the exam maybe how much he has slept before the exam how many lectures he has attended throughout

13

00:00:56,520  -->  00:00:59,410
the course and the things like that.

14

00:00:59,730  -->  00:01:01,040
The constant is still there.

15

00:01:01,080  -->  00:01:02,610
And also you've got the officials
