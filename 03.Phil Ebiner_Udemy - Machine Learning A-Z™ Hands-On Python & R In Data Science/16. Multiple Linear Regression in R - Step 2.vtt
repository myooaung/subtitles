00:00:00.270  -->  00:00:06.000
Hello and welcome to this art to toil in the previous toil we took care of all the data pre-processing

2

00:00:06.000  -->  00:00:09.510
and we made our dataset ready for multiple in our regression.

3

00:00:09.660  -->  00:00:15.540
So today in this story all we were ready to fit multiple in our regression to the trainset and that's

4

00:00:15.540  -->  00:00:17.160
what we're going to do right now.

5

00:00:17.160  -->  00:00:22.970
So ask for a simple regression the first thing that we're going to do is to introduce the multipole

6

00:00:23.000  -->  00:00:24.170
now regress or.

7

00:00:24.390  -->  00:00:26.950
And we're going to call it rigorous.

8

00:00:27.390  -->  00:00:30.850
So that's the common approach to make a regression model.

9

00:00:30.870  -->  00:00:36.360
You'll see that we will create each time a regress or that we will fit to the training set and then

10

00:00:36.450  -->  00:00:42.030
apply to predict function on it to make predictions to make the predictions of new observations like

11

00:00:42.030  -->  00:00:47.730
the test set observations and then ask for a simple regression we're going to use the LN function here

12

00:00:47.790  -->  00:00:52.040
Ellen and in parenthesis we're going to input the parameters.

13

00:00:52.380  -->  00:00:56.620
OK so let's have a look at the LN function here by pressing F 1.

14

00:00:56.630  -->  00:00:58.880
Here we go filling in your models.

15

00:00:58.890  -->  00:01:00.180
Let's look at our arguments.

16

00:01:00.210  -->  00:01:04.300
That's the same as for simple in our regression actually the first argument is formula.

17

00:01:04.320  -->  00:01:09.030
But this time you're going to see how we will need to change the formula syntax.

18

00:01:09.030  -->  00:01:13.350
For those of you who don't already know the trick I'll give you the super trick to write the formula

19

00:01:13.620  -->  00:01:18.620
very quickly and then the second compulsory argument input is the data.

20

00:01:18.750  -->  00:01:20.890
And of course it's going to be the trainset.

21

00:01:21.120  -->  00:01:23.180
So let's first input the formula.

22

00:01:23.650  -->  00:01:24.990
So formula here.

23

00:01:25.440  -->  00:01:32.370
So remember and simple in the regression we wrote the formula Sellery proportional to your experience

24

00:01:32.370  -->  00:01:32.500
.

25

00:01:32.580  -->  00:01:38.310
And here it's almost going to be the same but the difference is that we have several independent variables

26

00:01:38.320  -->  00:01:38.480
.

27

00:01:38.640  -->  00:01:46.260
We have four independent variables in simple enough regression the dependent variable was proportional

28

00:01:46.260  -->  00:01:48.620
to the only independent variable.

29

00:01:48.870  -->  00:01:50.580
Well here it's going to be the same.

30

00:01:50.580  -->  00:01:54.760
The profit is going to be proportional to these independent variables.

31

00:01:54.960  -->  00:02:02.460
Only the correct way to say it is not proportional but is the profit is going to be a linear combination

32

00:02:02.730  -->  00:02:09.630
of the independent variable and formula equals profit out.

33

00:02:09.720  -->  00:02:16.950
And and here the idea is to add all the independent variables separated with a plus sign.

34

00:02:16.950  -->  00:02:18.650
So let's look at them.

35

00:02:19.020  -->  00:02:22.720
It's our D span.

36

00:02:22.840  -->  00:02:29.570
I'm using the dot here because in the dataset we have some spaces and replace them by dots.

37

00:02:29.580  -->  00:02:36.150
So here is that then plus and then the other variable which is administration

38

00:02:39.150  -->  00:02:41.640
plus marketing spend

39

00:02:44.370  -->  00:02:47.380
spend plus state and that's all.

40

00:02:47.640  -->  00:02:54.240
So that's how you express the profit as a linear combination of all these independent variables.

41

00:02:54.240  -->  00:02:56.890
That's exactly what means this formula.

42

00:02:57.030  -->  00:03:01.780
However there is a trick to write this formula in a much more efficient way.

43

00:03:02.010  -->  00:03:08.550
It's Instead of writing all the independent variables here we can simply write a dot.

44

00:03:09.000  -->  00:03:10.360
That's what we can simply write.

45

00:03:10.380  -->  00:03:17.070
And that's the exact same equation are understands that you want to express the profit as a linear combination

46

00:03:17.250  -->  00:03:19.210
of all the independent variables.

47

00:03:19.290  -->  00:03:22.390
So the dot here just means all the independent variables.

48

00:03:22.590  -->  00:03:22.950
OK.

49

00:03:22.950  -->  00:03:27.690
So that's for the first argument formula equals profit as a linear combination of all the independent

50

00:03:27.690  -->  00:03:28.560
variables.

51

00:03:28.560  -->  00:03:30.320
And the second argument is data.

52

00:03:30.510  -->  00:03:39.000
And as we said it is of course the training set because we want to train our multiple in our regression

53

00:03:39.000  -->  00:03:43.590
model on the training set and then test the performance on the test later.

54

00:03:43.590  -->  00:03:48.220
All right so that's it for a building or multiple regression regressors.

55

00:03:48.360  -->  00:03:53.210
So we're going to select this and executes it we go.

56

00:03:53.220  -->  00:04:00.090
And now now there is something very important to do and this is something very practical very useful

57

00:04:00.090  -->  00:04:07.260
in our is that we are going to look at the informations of our regressors that we just built here and

58

00:04:07.260  -->  00:04:12.540
to do this it's really really simple we just need to it's actually like simple you know regression only

59

00:04:12.690  -->  00:04:16.230
here this time it's going to be more interesting because we will have several independent variables

60

00:04:16.230  -->  00:04:19.510
and some of them will have a stronger effect on the dependent variable.

61

00:04:19.530  -->  00:04:24.100
So we'll see it's going to be more interesting and so simple in the progression we're going to write

62

00:04:24.100  -->  00:04:27.500
a summary of our regrets are.

63

00:04:27.850  -->  00:04:28.610
All right.

64

00:04:28.680  -->  00:04:31.770
And just press enter and that's it.

65

00:04:31.770  -->  00:04:39.030
I'm just going to move that up and here we have all the info of our regressors.

66

00:04:39.480  -->  00:04:39.750
Okay.

67

00:04:39.750  -->  00:04:43.730
So here the first thing is just a reminder of what the formula is.

68

00:04:43.740  -->  00:04:50.250
So the profit is expressed as a linear combination of all the independent variables and our regressors

69

00:04:50.250  -->  00:04:51.800
trends and the trend sets.

70

00:04:52.020  -->  00:04:57.220
Okay perfect residuals we will be talking about that at the end of this part.

71

00:04:57.300  -->  00:04:59.490
So let's not focus on that right now.

72

00:04:59.760  -->  00:05:03.520
However that's the important part the coefficients here.

73

00:05:03.660  -->  00:05:09.960
That's what we need to focus on right now because as you can see it gives some info for each of your

74

00:05:10.170  -->  00:05:16.530
independent variable or by the way state to state three here are the dummy variables and that's because

75

00:05:16.530  -->  00:05:21.120
you know I told you that the library takes care of everything for you.

76

00:05:21.120  -->  00:05:26.340
Not only it created the dummy variables or knew that it had to create dummy variables for the state

77

00:05:26.340  -->  00:05:27.120
variable.

78

00:05:27.120  -->  00:05:32.310
And we helped our to understand that because we encoded the state variable as factors.

79

00:05:32.470  -->  00:05:38.970
So our Did all the job for you because not only he created the dummy variables for the state variables

80

00:05:39.000  -->  00:05:44.880
but also our didn't fall into the dummy variable because as you can see it automatically removed one

81

00:05:44.880  -->  00:05:49.690
of the evaluable to avoid some redundant dependency.

82

00:05:49.800  -->  00:05:50.670
So that's perfect.

83

00:05:50.670  -->  00:05:54.690
That's the beauty of our libraries as well as Python libraries in Python.

84

00:05:54.690  -->  00:05:59.490
I know we specified a new section to remove the dummy variable but that was just to remind you about

85

00:05:59.490  -->  00:06:00.160
the trap.

86

00:06:00.210  -->  00:06:02.390
We don't need to do it on Python.

87

00:06:02.400  -->  00:06:03.690
Take care of that for you.

88

00:06:03.990  -->  00:06:04.530
So that's great.

89

00:06:04.530  -->  00:06:08.700
That's a first thing to notice and then what I was telling you is that for each of the co-efficient

90

00:06:08.700  -->  00:06:14.610
we have different information we have actually the coefficient in the linear regression equation.

91

00:06:14.790  -->  00:06:20.730
Then we have the standard error then the T value then the p value here and then the significance level

92

00:06:20.750  -->  00:06:21.050
.

93

00:06:21.300  -->  00:06:27.660
So the most important info by looking at this are the last two columns the p value and the significance

94

00:06:27.660  -->  00:06:34.800
level because these cons tell us about the statistical significance of the independent variable onto

95

00:06:34.800  -->  00:06:36.450
the dependent variable.

96

00:06:36.450  -->  00:06:42.480
That means it tells us if each of the independent variable has a significant impact on the dependent

97

00:06:42.480  -->  00:06:43.550
variable.

98

00:06:44.070  -->  00:06:46.910
Ok so let me first explain what the p value is.

99

00:06:47.010  -->  00:06:53.940
The most important thing to understand is that the lower the p value is and the most statistically significant

100

00:06:54.240  -->  00:06:57.110
your independent variable is going to be.

101

00:06:57.300  -->  00:07:03.990
That means that the lower the p value is the more impact or affect your independent variable is going

102

00:07:03.990  -->  00:07:11.030
to have independent viable and generally a good threshold to use is the 5 percent threshold.

103

00:07:11.190  -->  00:07:16.740
That means that if your p value is lower than 5 percent then that means that your independent variable

104

00:07:16.740  -->  00:07:19.620
would be highly statistically significant.

105

00:07:19.620  -->  00:07:24.390
And the more it is about 5 percent the less it will be statistically significant.

106

00:07:24.390  -->  00:07:27.040
So that's how you must integrate the value.

107

00:07:27.270  -->  00:07:33.030
And then we have this last column which is just a faster way of interpreting the coefficients because

108

00:07:33.090  -->  00:07:38.790
as you can see we have this line here that explains us about the stars and basically what the stars

109

00:07:38.790  -->  00:07:44.760
mean because that's when the p value is between zero and 0.1 percent.

110

00:07:44.760  -->  00:07:50.400
Then there's going to be three stars which means a highly statistical significance of your independent

111

00:07:50.400  -->  00:07:51.150
variable.

112

00:07:51.480  -->  00:07:59.490
If the p value is between 0.1 percent and 1 percent then it's a quite high level of statistical significance

113

00:07:59.490  -->  00:08:00.000
.

114

00:08:00.000  -->  00:08:06.180
Then if your p value is between 1 percent and 5 percent then the independent variable is still statistically

115

00:08:06.180  -->  00:08:10.940
significant but will have a less strong effect than the first categories.

116

00:08:11.310  -->  00:08:16.920
And then if your p value is between 5 percent and 10 percent it's borderline The independent variable

117

00:08:17.120  -->  00:08:23.610
might have a certain level of statistical significance but not that much and you weigh a lot less than

118

00:08:23.610  -->  00:08:27.300
those independent variables that have three stars two stars.

119

00:08:27.660  -->  00:08:34.280
And then if your P P-value is between 10 percent and 1 then there is absolutely no statistical significance

120

00:08:34.280  -->  00:08:34.300
.

121

00:08:34.290  -->  00:08:39.280
That means they are independent variable won't have any effects on the dependent variable.

122

00:08:39.360  -->  00:08:46.140
So that's very interesting because when we look at our independent variables here we notice that only

123

00:08:46.140  -->  00:08:51.210
one variable has a high statistical significance on to the dependent variable.

124

00:08:51.240  -->  00:08:52.740
It's the R&D spend.

125

00:08:52.980  -->  00:08:58.020
So it looks like the profit is mainly governed by the R&D spend.

126

00:08:58.020  -->  00:09:04.220
That means that it's the R&D spend that has the only strong effect on the profits.

127

00:09:04.230  -->  00:09:09.210
So that's very important information for investors because they now know that they shouldn't only be

128

00:09:09.210  -->  00:09:15.720
looking at the profit itself by you know just looking at the maximum profits to decide where to invest

129

00:09:15.720  -->  00:09:15.960
.

130

00:09:16.050  -->  00:09:20.940
But also it should be looking at the R&D spend variable that should be looking at the amount spent in

131

00:09:20.940  -->  00:09:25.420
R&D to add another criterion in their investment decisions.

132

00:09:25.590  -->  00:09:26.960
So that's a very good info.

133

00:09:27.000  -->  00:09:32.250
And basically what it means what all this means is that among all the independent variables here the

134

00:09:32.280  -->  00:09:39.810
only predicter the only strong predictor of the profit is the R&D spend the rest is absolutely like

135

00:09:39.950  -->  00:09:41.130
and useful.

136

00:09:41.130  -->  00:09:48.780
So actually what this means is that we could we could rewrite this multiple in our regression equation

137

00:09:48.780  -->  00:09:55.470
and turn it into a simple in the our regression because since the only independent variable that has

138

00:09:55.470  -->  00:10:01.910
an effect on the profit dependent variable is the R&D spend then the formula could be profit equals

139

00:10:01.990  -->  00:10:09.600
r dot d dot spend and that would be okay that would actually give us the same prediction.

140

00:10:10.450  -->  00:10:11.070
Okay.

141

00:10:11.070  -->  00:10:16.560
So you learn a lot of stuff in this tutorial but that's very important things to know and in our regression

142

00:10:16.570  -->  00:10:16.740
.

143

00:10:16.890  -->  00:10:18.360
So congratulations.

144

00:10:18.420  -->  00:10:22.360
We only have one tutorial left where we will be predicting the test results.

145

00:10:22.530  -->  00:10:24.120
So I look forward to seeing you there.

146

00:10:24.120  -->  00:10:25.880
And until then and machine learning
