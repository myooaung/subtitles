00:00:03.070  -->  00:00:09.070
A simple integration is basically this formula where y equals zero plus B one times x.

2

00:00:09.090  -->  00:00:14.940
And you might recognize this formula from back in high school it's just a formal over a trend line or

3

00:00:14.950  -->  00:00:20.370
a slope sloped a line on a x y axis.

4

00:00:20.520  -->  00:00:27.040
And let's go through these variables and coefficients one by one.

5

00:00:27.030  -->  00:00:34.790
So this is the dependent variable the dependent variable something you're trying to explain for instance

6

00:00:34.800  -->  00:00:39.120
how does a person's salary change with the years of experience that he has.

7

00:00:39.120  -->  00:00:45.540
So in that case why would be the dependent variable or how What grade does a student get.

8

00:00:45.540  -->  00:00:50.640
Depending on how much time he's put into studying in that case why would be the dependent variable so

9

00:00:50.640  -->  00:00:58.590
something that you're trying to understand how it depends on something else X is your independent variable

10

00:00:58.590  -->  00:00:58.620
.

11

00:00:58.620  -->  00:01:01.630
In this case and the simple integration only have one independent variable.

12

00:01:01.710  -->  00:01:08.130
So we don't even have to call X Y or we could just call X and this is the variable that is.

13

00:01:08.130  -->  00:01:13.600
You're assuming that it is causing the depend variable to change or as we will learn further.

14

00:01:13.860  -->  00:01:18.240
Sometimes the independent variable might not be a direct causal factor but it's still there might be

15

00:01:18.240  -->  00:01:20.380
an implied association between the two.

16

00:01:20.610  -->  00:01:29.340
And in that case you're trying to figure out this association then B One is the coefficient for the

17

00:01:29.460  -->  00:01:30.540
independent variable.

18

00:01:30.660  -->  00:01:38.640
And it kind of says how the effect or how a change in X-1 a unit change in x y and we'll be talking

19

00:01:38.640  -->  00:01:39.600
about this a lot.

20

00:01:39.600  -->  00:01:44.580
Unit changes a unit change in X-1 how that affects a unit change in Y.

21

00:01:44.580  -->  00:01:52.660
So it's kind of think of it as the translator or the multiplier or something like that that that's connects

22

00:01:52.710  -->  00:01:58.860
to the connector between y and X-1 so you can just say you can always say X-1 is directly proportional

23

00:01:59.040  -->  00:02:00.340
there is.

24

00:02:00.510  -->  00:02:06.960
Well you going to say why the change in x is always equal to change and why there might be this coefficient

25

00:02:06.960  -->  00:02:14.310
of proportion to which proportion that change is inflated or deflated and Bizarros the constants as

26

00:02:14.310  -->  00:02:19.150
a constant term and we'll talk about the constant just in a few seconds.

27

00:02:19.170  -->  00:02:22.920
So now let's look at the simple in your regression because it's the easiest one to discuss.

28

00:02:22.920  -->  00:02:26.740
It's very pretty straightforward you can visualize it quite well.

29

00:02:26.760  -->  00:02:29.540
So here we got the y and x axis.

30

00:02:29.670  -->  00:02:32.840
Let's look at that specific example where we have experience and salary.

31

00:02:32.880  -->  00:02:35.000
So experience is going to be our horizontal axis.

32

00:02:35.040  -->  00:02:41.530
Salary is all vertical axis and we want to understand how people's salary depends on their experience

33

00:02:41.540  -->  00:02:41.740
.

34

00:02:41.880  -->  00:02:47.010
Well what we do in regression is we don't just come up with a theory we look at the evidence we'll look

35

00:02:47.010  -->  00:02:50.790
at the live hard facts so here are some observations we've had.

36

00:02:50.790  -->  00:02:56.730
So in a certain company this is how salaries are distributed among people who have different levels

37

00:02:56.730  -->  00:02:59.770
of experience and what a regression does.

38

00:02:59.850  -->  00:03:01.590
So that's a formula for aggression.

39

00:03:01.800  -->  00:03:06.860
In our case it'll change to salary equals be zero plus BE1 Times experience.

40

00:03:06.870  -->  00:03:13.080
And what that essentially means is just putting a line through your chart that best fits this data and

41

00:03:13.080  -->  00:03:17.660
we'll talk about best fitting in the next tutorial when we're talking about ordinary squares.

42

00:03:17.730  -->  00:03:19.690
But for now this is the chart.

43

00:03:19.710  -->  00:03:22.950
This is the line that best fits as Darren even looks like it right.

44

00:03:22.950  -->  00:03:29.380
So I don't it's it's quite hard to draw a line that fits is not a better and assumption here is impossible

45

00:03:29.460  -->  00:03:32.890
this is the best line that approximates is not.

46

00:03:32.890  -->  00:03:33.930
What does that mean.

47

00:03:33.930  -->  00:03:36.360
Well we'll talk about that in the next term once again.

48

00:03:36.570  -->  00:03:41.880
For now let's focus on the coefficients and the caffeine and the constant.

49

00:03:41.910  -->  00:03:43.870
So what does the constant mean here.

50

00:03:44.010  -->  00:03:52.280
Well the that actually means the point where the line crosses the vertical axis and let's say it's $30000

51

00:03:52.310  -->  00:03:52.370
.

52

00:03:52.380  -->  00:03:53.070
What does that mean.

53

00:03:53.070  -->  00:03:56.040
Well it means that when B when experience is zero.

54

00:03:56.040  -->  00:04:01.560
So when as you say on the horizontal axis when experience is at zero in the formula on the right you

55

00:04:01.560  -->  00:04:08.120
can see that the second part BE1 Times experience becomes zero so salary equals zero.

56

00:04:08.160  -->  00:04:14.630
That means that salary will equal to $30000 when a person has no experience so soon somebody is know

57

00:04:14.640  -->  00:04:16.970
fresh from University and joins this company.

58

00:04:17.100  -->  00:04:20.420
Most likely they will have a salary about $30000.

59

00:04:20.550  -->  00:04:25.370
You know there will be some confidence intervals there but we won't go into that right now.

60

00:04:25.470  -->  00:04:31.720
Just we can say that according to this model that person will be probably getting paid $30000.

61

00:04:31.740  -->  00:04:35.400
Now what is being one big one is the slope of the line.

62

00:04:35.400  -->  00:04:43.020
And so the steeper the line the more you get more money you get per extra year of experience.

63

00:04:43.020  -->  00:04:43.680
Let's look at this.

64

00:04:43.710  -->  00:04:50.670
In this particular example let's say somebody went from I don't know maybe four to five years experience

65

00:04:50.670  -->  00:04:51.090
right.

66

00:04:51.090  -->  00:04:56.910
So then to understand how his salary increase you have to project this onto the line and then project

67

00:04:56.910  -->  00:05:04.410
that onto the salary access and you can see that here for one of your experience the person will get

68

00:05:04.500  -->  00:05:07.660
an extra ten thousand dollars on top of his salary.

69

00:05:07.800  -->  00:05:15.120
So if the coefficient one is less than the slope will be less and that means the salary increase will

70

00:05:15.120  -->  00:05:17.220
be less per every year of experience.

71

00:05:17.220  -->  00:05:26.850
If the slope is greater then that means the experience will yield more increase in salary and that's

72

00:05:26.850  -->  00:05:27.390
pretty much it.

73

00:05:27.390  -->  00:05:29.580
That's how a simple your regression works.

74

00:05:29.580  -->  00:05:35.460
So the core goal here is that we're not just drawing a line theoretically that we can we came up with

75

00:05:35.460  -->  00:05:42.390
some how we're actually using observations that we have to find the best fitting line and what best

76

00:05:42.390  -->  00:05:45.410
fitting line is we'll talk about that in the next tutorial.
