00:00:01.440  -->  00:00:03.540
Today we're talking about dummy variables.

2

00:00:03.930  -->  00:00:10.050
So basically the information that we have is the profit of each company or of each startup then the

3

00:00:10.050  -->  00:00:16.470
R&D spend the admin spend the marketing spend So those three are expenses that the company incurred

4

00:00:16.530  -->  00:00:20.580
and then the state in which it operates either in York or California.

5

00:00:20.910  -->  00:00:26.490
The challenge that we're faced with is that the venture capitalist Fund wants to see if there's any

6

00:00:26.490  -->  00:00:34.530
correlations between profit and the months that have been spent on different expenses R&D admin and

7

00:00:34.530  -->  00:00:39.520
marketing and also with on which in which stage the company operates.

8

00:00:39.600  -->  00:00:46.410
Is there a correlation between profit and all these variables and how would you go about creating a

9

00:00:46.650  -->  00:00:53.940
model to understand how knowing R&D spend admin and marketing and stay to predict profit and so therefore

10

00:00:54.060  -->  00:00:59.760
profit is our dependent variable and the rest the blue ones are all independent variables.

11

00:00:59.880  -->  00:01:03.650
And what we need to do is build a linear regression.

12

00:01:03.840  -->  00:01:10.680
So let's go ahead and get started as we would with multiple inner aggression we would start by saying

13

00:01:10.710  -->  00:01:13.760
Y which is profit is equal to what.

14

00:01:13.770  -->  00:01:14.510
What does that equal to.

15

00:01:14.520  -->  00:01:20.250
Well first of all there is a constant in this case it's been 0 and I've put it under the profit column

16

00:01:20.250  -->  00:01:22.470
just because I needed to fit it somewhere.

17

00:01:22.740  -->  00:01:26.490
And then we would start adding on these variables into our equation.

18

00:01:26.490  -->  00:01:32.370
So then we've got the big one coefficient times the X1 variable which is R&D spend in this case and

19

00:01:32.370  -->  00:01:37.750
X-1 is actually the amounts the dollar amount that you see in the R&D column.

20

00:01:38.160  -->  00:01:43.280
Then you've got that Azmin variable which is x 2.

21

00:01:43.290  -->  00:01:47.790
It's got a confession of BE2 once again adman's or in this case X-2 is going to be the dollar amount

22

00:01:47.850  -->  00:01:49.110
you see in the admin column.

23

00:01:49.290  -->  00:01:54.670
Then you've got the marketing spend extra which will be the dollar amount you see in the marketing column

24

00:01:54.670  -->  00:01:54.900
.

25

00:01:54.990  -->  00:02:02.790
And then you've got the state variable and here when we get here we're questioning what should we place

26

00:02:03.000  -->  00:02:08.340
in our equation for the state column because we don't actually have a number we don't have a dollar

27

00:02:08.340  -->  00:02:14.340
value or any other type of number to add into our equation or we can just add a word into the equation

28

00:02:14.360  -->  00:02:14.570
.

29

00:02:14.790  -->  00:02:21.120
And the thing here is that the state is actually a categorical variable so we talked about types of

30

00:02:21.120  -->  00:02:26.810
variables before and we understood that there's categorical variables and there's numeric variables

31

00:02:26.830  -->  00:02:27.000
.

32

00:02:27.150  -->  00:02:32.460
Well in this case state is a categorical variable and therefore we can add it to our equation.

33

00:02:32.460  -->  00:02:39.240
We need to do something about this situation and the approach that you need to take when you face categorical

34

00:02:39.240  -->  00:02:43.190
variables in regression models is you need to create dummy variables.

35

00:02:43.230  -->  00:02:45.620
Let's see how we we can do that.

36

00:02:45.690  -->  00:02:50.060
First you need to go through your column and find all the different categories you have.

37

00:02:50.160  -->  00:02:52.180
So in this case we have two categories.

38

00:02:52.470  -->  00:02:56.930
So for every single category that you followed you need to create a new column for New York we're going

39

00:02:56.970  -->  00:03:01.290
to create a column called New-Yorker for color for immigrants create calm California so we're kind of

40

00:03:01.290  -->  00:03:06.180
expanding our data set and adding some additional columns into it.

41

00:03:06.180  -->  00:03:07.440
And how do we populate the column.

42

00:03:07.440  -->  00:03:10.340
So this is the fun part to populate these columns.

43

00:03:10.410  -->  00:03:11.560
The start of the New Yorker.

44

00:03:11.870  -->  00:03:17.700
You find all of your rows where the state actually says New York and you need to for those Rosing to

45

00:03:17.700  -->  00:03:23.870
put a one in the your column and then in California for all the rows that say California.

46

00:03:23.970  -->  00:03:29.670
Basically for all the rows that don't say new or whatever else they say you just put a 0 and then for

47

00:03:29.730  -->  00:03:32.740
California for the column California you do the same thing.

48

00:03:32.790  -->  00:03:40.530
Wherever A says California in the state column you place a 1 in the California column and for any other

49

00:03:40.530  -->  00:03:44.630
values in the state column you place a zero in the California column.

50

00:03:44.850  -->  00:03:52.140
And so you end up with a data set like this and these two new columns are called dummy variables and

51

00:03:52.140  -->  00:03:55.040
building your regression model from here is very simple.

52

00:03:55.050  -->  00:04:00.870
All you have to do is use the New York column and you're going to be using it instead of states you

53

00:04:00.860  -->  00:04:02.840
know going you'd be using state anymore.

54

00:04:02.940  -->  00:04:09.000
And basically you add a variable which is before times D1 and D1.

55

00:04:09.000  -->  00:04:15.710
In this case is your dummy variable for New York and you don't use the California column either.

56

00:04:16.200  -->  00:04:21.660
So as you can see here all the information in our data is preserved.

57

00:04:21.750  -->  00:04:27.450
If we just stick to the one New York column because you can tell right away if one is a one then it's

58

00:04:27.450  -->  00:04:29.600
a company that works and it operates in New York.

59

00:04:29.670  -->  00:04:32.340
If one is a zero it's a company that operates in California.

60

00:04:32.340  -->  00:04:37.270
So we didn't lose any information by including only the New York call.

61

00:04:37.380  -->  00:04:43.350
And we will actually talk more about why you should never include all of your dummy variable columns

62

00:04:43.680  -->  00:04:45.120
in your regression model.

63

00:04:45.120  -->  00:04:51.830
We'll talk more about that in the next tutorial when we're talking about the dummy variable trap.

64

00:04:51.960  -->  00:04:59.340
But for now I would like to discuss two things so first of all the New York column or all of the dummy

65

00:04:59.340  -->  00:05:01.500
variables they work as switches.

66

00:05:01.500  -->  00:05:05.770
In this case let's look at the New York column which we're including in our regression.

67

00:05:05.790  -->  00:05:12.900
It works like a light switch so if it's a one then you know that this company is in New York.

68

00:05:12.900  -->  00:05:19.080
If it's a zero Sol off in this case in the case of the picture then you know that the company doesn't

69

00:05:19.080  -->  00:05:23.520
work in New York option so the dummy variables work like light switches.

70

00:05:23.550  -->  00:05:27.630
And that's why they're ones and zeros and they don't need any other values in them.

71

00:05:27.720  -->  00:05:31.380
And the second thing is that when you look at this approach it might seem biased.

72

00:05:31.380  -->  00:05:36.480
So we are including a variable for New York and there's a coefficient for New York so we basically have

73

00:05:36.480  -->  00:05:43.410
this benefit of having a coefficient in our equation for New York which is before but for California

74

00:05:43.440  -->  00:05:48.990
there's no coefficient because when D-1 is zero that whole loss part of the equation becomes zero and

75

00:05:49.380  -->  00:05:55.170
there's no benefit of a coefficient in our equation for California and might seem biased at first but

76

00:05:55.500  -->  00:06:01.140
in reality that's not the case because the way regression models work is that they will take by default

77

00:06:01.710  -->  00:06:09.210
that state or that variable that dummy variable that you have not included will become the default situation

78

00:06:09.210  -->  00:06:11.250
for this regression model.

79

00:06:11.250  -->  00:06:19.170
So basically what that means is that the coefficient for California is going to be included in the constant

80

00:06:19.190  -->  00:06:20.350
and be zero.

81

00:06:20.640  -->  00:06:28.440
And by default when D1 is equal to zero this whole equation will turn into an equation you can think

82

00:06:28.440  -->  00:06:30.580
of it as it'll turn into equation for California.

83

00:06:30.720  -->  00:06:38.910
But then when Diwan becomes one you're adding before which is once again like this is a very basic explanation

84

00:06:38.940  -->  00:06:43.520
but you're adding a coefficient which is the difference between New York and California.

85

00:06:43.530  -->  00:06:44.000
So.

86

00:06:44.100  -->  00:06:49.740
So basically you're altering from California to New York by flipping this light switch if it's on off

87

00:06:49.770  -->  00:06:54.110
then kind of default state and the whole equation is working for California.

88

00:06:54.150  -->  00:07:01.350
If it's on on then by adding that before you're altering the equation from the default state of California

89

00:07:01.380  -->  00:07:02.230
to New York.

90

00:07:02.370  -->  00:07:08.180
So that's a intuitive way to think of dummy variables so there's nothing wrong with the fact that we're

91

00:07:08.180  -->  00:07:15.360
only including one and once again in the next tutorial We'll talk more about why it is a bad idea to

92

00:07:15.720  -->  00:07:17.480
include both dummy variables.

93

00:07:17.720  -->  00:07:20.940
I'll look forward scenics them until then happy analyzing.
