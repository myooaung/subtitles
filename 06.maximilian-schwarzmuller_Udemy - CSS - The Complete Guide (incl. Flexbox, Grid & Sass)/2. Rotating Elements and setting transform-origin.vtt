00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:04.690
Now to dive into CSS transformations,

2
00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:10.840
I'm back in our project and now I want to transform this badge, this recommended badge we have here.

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.560
We can rotate it and so on

4
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.020
and that is exactly what we'll start with.

5
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.510
So back in our code, let's go into the packages folder and there in the packages.css file and

6
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.490
there, we have this package badge class or this class selector.

7
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.080
Now right now, the badge is positioned with position

8
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.570
absolute and top right zero,

9
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.040
it has a margin of 1.2rem.

10
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:38.720
First of all, let's change that margin to zero so that we have no margin on this element anymore,

11
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.410
it now sits directly in the top right corner.

12
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:48.590
Now this is no transformation, transformations are applied with a special property, the transform

13
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.000
property.

14
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:56.720
Now we got a couple of key transformations and that are moving the element, which we of course also can

15
00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:03.140
do with the help of top right and for non-absolute elements, we also can move an element with the margin

16
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.240
for example

17
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.440
but this actually is hardware accelerated

18
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.330
and it keeps the element in the document flow.

19
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.390
Well, not for this element because position absolute but for a normal element it would.

20
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.200
So moving the element with transformations is always a good idea if you really just want to move it

21
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.930
visually.

22
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.190
I want to start with a different transformation though, not with moving the element but with rotating 

23
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.960
and for that, let's use rotateZ. I'll dive into the other options later in this module when we dive into 3D

24
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.460
transformations.

25
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:42.990
So here, we enter a value in degrees, like 45 degrees for example. If we enter this and we save that

26
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.410
file,

27
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.100
let's reload that page.

28
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.460
Now we can see that our badge indeed is rotated by 45 degrees.

29
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.430
Important,

30
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.200
it rotates around the center of the element.

31
00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.220
You can change that though, you can change it with the help of the transform origin property,

32
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.940
that's the second important property when it comes to normal 2D transformations.

33
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.040
By default, this is set to center

34
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:15.080
but you can also set it to a value like left or left top and if you would set it to left top for example, watch

35
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.810
this badge if I reload,

36
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.240
now it actually seems like it just moved down

37
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.190
but what actually happened is this top left corner,

38
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.970
it stayed in its place.

39
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.520
This is the place where the corner also was before we rotated it because now it's rotating around

40
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.720
that corner,

41
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.820
so clockwise around this corner with positive degrees. If we enter negative degrees, it goes in the other

42
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:36.650
direction.

43
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.180
So this is what's happening now, it's rotating around the top left corner.

44
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:48.270
You can also enter a value with pixels or rem to simply move the origin into the element; 0, 0 would

45
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.240
be the same as top left by the way

46
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:57.420
but you can also enter something like 1rem, 1rem to move 1rem to the right and 1rem down from

47
00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.420
the top left corner or a percentage value; 50%, 50% would be equal the center which is the

48
00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.590
default and therefore doesn't need to be set

49
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:12.600
but of course you can also specify something like 25%, 50% to move it in 25% and

50
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:20.010
down 50%, then the origin would be somewhere where the c is probably. Now that is what you can

51
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.600
do,

52
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.120
I'll stick to center here

53
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.300
and you don't need to specify transform origin in this case because that's the default

54
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.940
but for the reference, I'll add it here.

55
00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.440
Now with this added, if we reload this, now we're back to the original view where it's just rotated

56
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.220
around the center of the box. Rotating of course

57
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.700
is great but it's in the wrong position,

58
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.410
let's see how we can fix this in the next lecture.
