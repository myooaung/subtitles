1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:09,120
We took our first steps when it comes to styling by assigning properties and values for the properties,

2
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:15,600
now the next step is to ensure that we don't apply the same styles all over our page.

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,250
Sometimes you want this, sometimes you want every h1 tag to look the same,

4
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,270
for example when it comes to its font size, that's a pretty common thing

5
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,680
but sometimes like in this case, you don't want that.

6
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,500
Semantically, we got two h1 tags but they should look different here.

7
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,790
Now right now, we always cite the same section and the same h1 tag,

8
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,860
thankfully we have more than just the tag selectors which we're currently using in CSS,

9
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,520
so let's see which other selectors we have.

10
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:47,220
We did have a look at the so-called element or tag selectors, there we set equal styles for all these

11
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:50,210
elements and it looks like this, in HTML

12
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:57,070
we got a couple of elements and the h1 tag here would have a red text because of this rule, we select

13
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,960
the h1 tag and we assign a color of red.

14
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,650
Now that is what we saw thus far but there is more,

15
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:09,060
for example we also have class selectors. Classes are something you might have never heard before because

16
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,930
they are a concept strongly connected to CSS.

17
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:20,390
With classes, we can define a style which we then apply to all elements that have the same class and a

18
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:27,240
class is added to an element in HTML by adding the class attribute as you can see here, in this snippet,

19
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,910
all the elements actually have the blog post class.

20
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,490
Now the blog post class is not something which is predefined by the browser,

21
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:39,530
you define classes instead. In CSS the code would look like this,

22
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,270
please notice that this selector is a bit different than the tag selector,

23
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:49,560
it starts with dot and then your class name and you are free to choose any class name you want.

24
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,960
Here, the color is then also set to red, that's the declaration in that rule and therefore, all

25
00:01:55,030 --> 00:02:00,910
HTML elements that have this class will get the red text color. Now

26
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:05,820
sometimes you also want to set a certain style for all elements on the entire page

27
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,500
and in this case you have the universal selector.

28
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:14,530
So here's an example where we have one element without a class and one with a class and let's say the

29
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,430
top two rules wouldn't exist,

30
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:22,350
so the only rule we could then add to turn everything red would be this one, with the star selector,

31
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,040
you style every element on your page

32
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,680
and to be honest, you rarely use this one.

33
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:33,630
The reason is you rarely want to have the same style on every single element on your page,

34
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:38,620
there is one specific use case we'll also have a look at later though where this makes sense.

35
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:40,780
Now we're not done yet though,

36
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:44,960
there are two other kinds of important selectors, ID selectors

37
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:50,720
for example allow you to select elements by the ID they have and then apply a style to that one specific

38
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,360
element,

39
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:57,730
Since an ID only exists once on a page, we only apply the style to one single element. In HTML,

40
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,110
it would look something like this,

41
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,620
here we have an h1 tag with an ID, main-title in this case, the ID of course can be anything

42
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,280
you want

43
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:10,230
and then in CSS, you're targeted by adding a hashtag in front of the ID name

44
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:16,160
and then again you define the rule, so that declarations for that rule to be precise and this would turn

45
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,460
this text red in this snippet here.

46
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:26,960
Now the last type of selector, of main selectors you have, are attributes selectors. There you select

47
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:29,710
HTML elements by the attribute they have

48
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:35,080
and this again can select multiple elements, unlike the ID selector which only selected one.

49
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:41,500
Here, you set the equal style to all elements with the same attributes, in HTML,

50
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,250
here we would have a button with the disabled attribute, standard

51
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:53,010
HTML button attribute you can set and in CSS, you would select all buttons or all elements with

52
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:58,280
the disabled attribute by enclosing the attribute name in square brackets,

53
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,520
that's just the syntax

54
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:05,960
CSS uses and then assigning your declarations. So this CSS code would assign a red text

55
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:12,190
to all elements, no matter if there are buttons or not, which have a disabled attribute.

56
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:13,710
This is a little bit of theory,

57
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,360
we will see all these selectors throughout the course.

58
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:23,870
Thus far we only use the element selector but maybe one or multiple of the other selectors can help us with

59
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:28,070
our problem of styling the things we have on our page right now

60
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,080
differently.

61
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:34,980
So back in our code, right now we only use the element selector, section, h1, these are element selectors.

62
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,980
Now I said I want to have different styles,

63
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:42,320
so for example what you could do is we could assign IDs to these sections.

64
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,650
We could add an ID here to the first section and maybe name it

65
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,450
product-overview,

66
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,720
the name of ID is totally up to you. Now

67
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:58,460
IDs are not an attribute which you only add because you want to style the element, IDs also allow you

68
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:03,830
to add a hashtag at the end of your URL and the browser will immediately jump down to that element

69
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,720
in the page, so it will scroll down there so to say

70
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,950
but they can also be used for styling as you will see.

71
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,560
Let's also assign an ID to the second section,

72
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,780
maybe let's call this one

73
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:20,750
plans because I plan on adding my plans here, so the plans the user may choose from.

74
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:29,390
So now we got two IDs and this allows us to adjust our rules, instead of selecting a section and setting

75
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:31,300
the background to this color,

76
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:37,850
I only want to do this for the first section which has the ID of product overview. So let's copy that

77
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:43,870
ID name and let's replace this section element selector here with the hashtag,

78
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,730
product overview selector.

79
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:48,640
If we now save both files,

80
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:53,620
so CSS and HTML and we reload the page, you see

81
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,070
the second one seems to be gone but actually the text is just white still,

82
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,430
so we don't see it

83
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:02,840
but the first one now is the only one with the reddish background.

84
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,200
This already shows us a big advantage of using different selectors,

85
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:11,860
the ID selector only matches elements with that ID and semantically, an ID should only occur once on

86
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,430
a page,

87
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:17,700
so it only selects this section and therefore only applies the styles there.

88
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:22,670
Now if we want to have a different style for the second section, we could of course target it with that

89
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:23,920
plans ID.

90
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:30,680
However for the second section, for now I actually don't want to change the section as a whole,

91
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,510
just the h1 tag.

92
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:37,330
Now there are actually multiple ways of getting access to this h1 tag

93
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:43,720
in the second section, one way we can do it is by adding a class to the h1 tag.

94
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:49,970
So let's add a class by adding the class attribute and let's name it section-title.

95
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:56,180
Again the class is up to you, though I do recommend that you pick class names which first of all use

96
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:02,120
the kebab case, so where you have lowercase names, where the words are separated with dashes.

97
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,020
This is important because CSS is case insensitive,

98
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:12,320
so something like sectionTitle, written like this which is readable to humans is the same like sectiontitle,

99
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:18,960
like this and therefore it can be harder to ensure you are not overwriting class names,

100
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,340
hence kebab case is recommended

101
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:26,540
and the second thing which is important about classes is you can reuse them. Unlike IDs,

102
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,610
you don't just use them once,

103
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:32,650
you can add them multiple times and a class is always a good choice

104
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,690
if there is a decent chance of you reusing it,

105
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:43,020
otherwise an ID might may be better, though you can always use class if you want. Here I defined my

106
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,650
class, the name is up to you

107
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:51,150
and with that we can go to the main.css file and I'll leave that h1 selector for now

108
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:57,210
but I'll also add a third selector now, with a dot at the beginning and then the class name,

109
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,400
this is a so-called class selector

110
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:07,180
and then in the rule set, I'll add a declaration where I set the color to another color.

111
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:14,310
Here I'll use #2ddf5c, another color I picked in advance,

112
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:20,760
it's a nice green which will be our main theme color of this project. If we now save both files, CSS and HTML

113
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,860
and we reload the page,

114
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:30,360
now we actually see that the second h1 tag has that green color because we did use a different

115
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,120
selector. Now on the slide I showed you, there were other selectors too

116
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:37,760
and we will encounter these throughout the course too

117
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:43,480
but for now, this is a great first step when it comes to ensuring that our things look differently.

118
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:48,280
These selectors we use right now, the ID selector, the tag selector and the

119
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,350
class selector are already three

120
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:54,590
very important selectors which you will see a lot in your CSS code.
