00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:09.740
Welcome to this module. With the background images and the images being sized, at least as a first step before

2
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:17.420
we have a look at responsive design later, it's time to have a look at dimensions, sizes and units because

3
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.320
there is more than pixels.

4
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.570
What does this mean and what will we do in this module?

5
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:31.820
Well, we will start by having a look at the theory because so far, the main unit used on our website is

6
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:39.080
pixels and partially percentages but there are more units available which help us to change the size

7
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.440
of our boxes or of the font for example,

8
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.410
we'll of course dive into that in this module.

9
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.950
After that, we'll have a look at percentages and the containing block because although we use percentages

10
00:00:51.950 --> 00:01:00.980
so far, we are not totally sure what drives the actual size of our element because the percentage has

11
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.920
to refer to another element because it has to be the percentage of something

12
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.510
and we will find out what this something actually is.

13
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:17.750
After that, we'll also have a look at min width and max width. These are some properties, some special width

14
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:25.070
properties which by the way can also be applied for the height property and we will see how we can use

15
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:31.640
these properties to do our first steps towards a more responsive design.

16
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:39.980
After that, we'll understand rem and em and rem is not a band, R.E.M., sorry I had to make this joke,

17
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:47.150
I know it's not a good one but basically rem and em are units that are based on the actual font size

18
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.000
on our website. What we can do with these, how these work,

19
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:58.760
let's find out all this in this module and after we understood rem and em, we'll also have a look at vw

20
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.060
and vh. I could make another bad joke about vw,

21
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.120
I won't do that now

22
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.420
but these are also units we can use

23
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:12.500
and because of that, we should also understand how we can use them and what we can use them.

24
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.640
So that's what's inside this module

25
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:21.830
and with that, I think it's time to start and a good starting point again would be our current project

26
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:29.500
because as we said a few seconds ago, we already applied some pixels and percentages to our website.

27
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.230
So I think it makes sense to have a closer look at that before we dive deeper.
