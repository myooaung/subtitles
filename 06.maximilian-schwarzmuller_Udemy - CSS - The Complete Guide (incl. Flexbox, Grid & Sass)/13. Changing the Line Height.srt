1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,880
So what is the line height property?

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,930
Well for that, we will first delete the whitespace right here because we understood how it works and

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,370
we don't need it anymore

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,330
and then go to our packages page

5
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:17,650
back again right here and then to the package info

6
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:25,560
class. So I'm again right here on this page and right here in this package info, specifically I will

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:32,160
focus onto this class right here because it only consists of one line and this is what we need to understand

8
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,600
the line height.

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,170
Now let's add this line height property then, so line height

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,520
and let's start with a value of 1 and 

11
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:41,860
let's see what that means.

12
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:51,320
So let's save that and reload the page and if we now inspect it right here, we can see down there that

13
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,240
we now have line height of 18.8 pixels.

14
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:56,330
OK,

15
00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:05,340
let's keep in mind our font size because the font size we actually have is this one, 19.2 pixels,

16
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:11,030
you remember 1.2rem and that's pretty close to that value actually.

17
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,220
Now let's see if we can get closer.

18
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:19,340
The first thing we should do is we should reduce our zoom level because I again zoomed into the page to

19
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,860
make sure you can see everything

20
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:26,210
but as we can see, have a look at the height right here of our content box,

21
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:35,010
the height decreases and now we are at 19 pixels already which is pretty close to the 19.2 pixels

22
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:41,710
and the reason for that is that the line height calculation simply does not consider the decimals.

23
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:45,730
Therefore, it will just stick to the 19, not the 19.2

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,570
but with that, you already saw what the line height actually is. The line height lets us define the top

25
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,540
and the bottom, so the space between the top and the bottom

26
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,400
of our content box

27
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,850
and with that, we have 19 pixels now

28
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:07,810
and if we follow our calculation right here, if we change that to two, then there should be 38.

29
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:16,350
And if we scroll down again, then we can see it is indeed 38 because we take our actual font size which

30
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:23,880
is the 19.2 pixels calculated based on the 1.2rem and 19.2 pixels times the two we added

31
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,410
right here is 38.4

32
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,490
and then the decimals are not considered,

33
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,310
therefore we have 38 pixels of line height right here.

34
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,580
So this is one way how to define the line height,

35
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:41,090
I will keep it zoomed out like that because it makes it easier to follow this pattern

36
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:47,040
right now. This line height can of course also apply to other font families,

37
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:52,490
let's for example use our Monserrat font that we used throughout this course.

38
00:02:52,680 --> 00:03:02,330
If I use this one and I reload, you can see that if we inspect it right here, that the line height is again

39
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:09,980
38 pixels but there is one interesting thing. If I change the line height from two to normal

40
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:18,260
which is the default value, then you will see that right now, we have a line height of 24 pixels for our

41
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:23,740
Monserrat font but if I change it back to AnonymousPro,

42
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,240
so our custom font,

43
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,010
this one right here,

44
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,040
keep in mind we had 24 for Monserrat,

45
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:36,540
then you can already see it actually we only have 19 pixels of line height right now.

46
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,370
So that's important to keep in mind.

47
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:44,260
By default, the line height depends on the font family we are using.

48
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:51,110
If we change that behavior and add the line property with a value of two for example, then this will

49
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:55,340
always refer to the font size and as the font size,

50
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,740
in our case at least, is the same for all font families,

51
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:05,350
we have the same line height no matter which font family we are using. Now of course we are not only

52
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:13,000
limited to using this number, we can also use pixels like 32 pixels for example and if I now reload

53
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,280
the page, as you can imagine,

54
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,210
now we have a line height of 32 pixels. What's of course

55
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:23,010
also possible is using percentages for example,

56
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:29,170
so if we use 200% like that, then we would simply apply a value of,

57
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:39,280
if we scroll down again, you can see, 38, so 200% of the initial font size.

58
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,240
So that's basically how it works with percentages.

59
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:49,150
However, I would always recommend not using percentages like here but simply using the numbers like we

60
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:56,980
did it before because percentages sometimes lead to an unexpected behavior when it comes to inheritance

61
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:03,940
because sometimes the calculation basis for the percentage is not the font size of the element itself

62
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,190
but of an inherited font size of a parent

63
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,540
and then this can,

64
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,780
as I said, lead to unexpected results. By using the number right here,

65
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:19,980
we always make sure that the line height is calculated based on the actual font size of the element

66
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:26,470
we apply this line height to and that's probably the approach we can follow to ensure that our site exactly

67
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,840
behaves the way it should behave.

68
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:36,190
However, we don't need the line height actually right here, so we can simply get rid of that and that's actually

69
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,430
the basic concept of the line height,

70
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:45,460
so you basically define the height of your content right here. Attached to this video,

71
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:52,290
you can also find an article which will give you additional information about the line height property.

72
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,040
So in case you want to dive deeper,

73
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,190
feel free to have a look at this article.

74
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:00,290
So with that, we understood the line height.

75
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:05,810
Let's now have to look at text decoration and text shadow in the next lecture.
