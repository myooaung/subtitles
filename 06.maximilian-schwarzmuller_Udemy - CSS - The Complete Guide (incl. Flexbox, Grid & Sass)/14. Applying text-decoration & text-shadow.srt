1
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:06,520
So what can we do with text decoration and text shadow?

2
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:08,650
Let's start with the decoration first.

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:16,570
For that, I'm again right here in our package info class and now I will add the text decoration property

4
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:17,320
right here.

5
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:22,220
For this element right here, we didn't apply any text decoration by default

6
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:28,750
but what we could do is for example, we could apply a value of underline. If we do that and reload the

7
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,520
page, we can see that,

8
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:35,060
well as expected probably, the text is underlined.

9
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:41,830
If we have underline, we probably also have overline right here. If we change the value and have a look

10
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:42,710
at the result,

11
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:51,310
we can see that now we have an overline for our text right here. So we have an underline, an overline,

12
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:56,000
well we can probably also line through our text right here.

13
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,620
Let's see if this also works,

14
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,580
if I reload that, like that, yes.

15
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,700
So that's what we can do,

16
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:09,070
we can add an underline, an overline or a line through. We can of course also more specify the line

17
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:15,340
we want to have, we could add dotted right here for example to create a dotted line, like this.

18
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,700
So you can see, now we have the dotted line,

19
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,930
this can of course also be applied to all the other values we had,

20
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:27,360
for example the underline again, so that we can see it better and you could also choose a color of your

21
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,240
choice, for example red right here. If we do that and reload the page, we have a dotted underline with

22
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,530
that red color.

23
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,300
Another really nice line type is also

24
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,200
this one here,

25
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:46,890
so if we change dotted for wavy. If we do that and we load our page, you can see that we have this

26
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,790
wavy line below our text right here.

27
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:55,350
Looks kind of like an error, so maybe not the line type you always want to use but I just wanted to

28
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,240
show you this one,

29
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,320
of course it's also available for overline and for line through,

30
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:06,550
so this will be the overline style for this one, like that

31
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:12,200
and that's actually the main purpose of this text decoration property.

32
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,240
We don't need it right here of course, so we can again get rid of it

33
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:23,720
but one important thing we should also keep in mind when using text decoration is that if we go to

34
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:29,730
our shared.css file right here and then go down to our anchor tag selector,

35
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:36,360
so this one, there you could see that we used text decoration already. If I quickly comment that out now,

36
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:44,420
like this and like that and reload the page, then you can see that this default text decoration for links

37
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:45,910
is back in again.

38
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:52,970
So don't forget to use text decoration for both, to add such a decoration of course but also to remove a

39
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:56,100
default decoration, like we did it right here.

40
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:02,160
Let's comment it in again because we want to make sure that our text decoration for the links is not visible.

41
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:07,120
Another property in connection with the text is the text

42
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:07,830
shadow,

43
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:12,540
so let's go back to our packages file right here and add such a shadow right now.

44
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:15,400
So the property we need is text shadow,

45
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:21,750
this one right here and now we have to specify an offset to the x-axis, so 5 pixels maybe

46
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,870
and to the y-axis, also 5 pixels.

47
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,160
So with that, let's see what this looks like

48
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:36,000
if I reload the page, yes this looks interesting but probably not as we intend it to look.

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,630
I think we need two additional things; we need a blur radius or a blur at least to blur the

50
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:46,310
actual text because it should be a shadow and not a copy of the text

51
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:49,570
and then we need maybe a different color also.

52
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:53,160
Let's see if we can add these two things and to add the blur,

53
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,420
we simply have to add a third value right here

54
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:04,750
and let's say we use a blur of maybe 2 pixels, something like that and the color of grre, like this,

55
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:10,290
maybe we can also use a lighter grey, something like that. With that

56
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:16,160
if we go back and reload the page, we can see that our shadow looks a lot better,

57
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:22,890
it's probably a bit too far to the right and to the bottom and still too sharp, so let's reduce the offset

58
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:31,170
to the x-axis and to the y-axis and increase the blur to maybe 7 pixels.

59
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,620
Let's see what this looks like, like this,

60
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:42,390
yes I think now it looks quite cool because now we have a really slight text shadow behind our text.

61
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,760
And of course we can play around with that a lot,

62
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:51,480
we can also increase the blue more, we can for example add a color to the text shadow and make a blur of 20

63
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,180
pixels, something like that,

64
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:54,540
just as you prefer.

65
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:57,920
So as you can see, this would create this look.

66
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:03,510
You could also set an offset of 0 if you want to, like this and like that,

67
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,310
right,

68
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,710
would also not be a problem,

69
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,570
if I reload, you can see that's what it will look like then.

70
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:13,290
So feel free to play around with these values right here.

71
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:20,610
Again for our project, I don't think we need the text shadow, so we unfortunately have to delete it once

72
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,220
again

73
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:25,060
and with that, bring back our initial cleaner look

74
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:33,550
as I would call it. And with that, we already saw all the core properties that are font related.

75
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:39,720
Therefore in the next video, I think it's time to show you the font shorthand, which kind of combines all

76
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:45,810
these properties if you want to but which also has one alternative functionality.

77
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,420
So let's have a look at this

78
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,440
shorthand in the next lecture.
