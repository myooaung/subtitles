1
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:05,960
So what is my problem with the navigation bar?

2
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:12,050
Before I show you that, there is another fix that we should implement because if we go back to our code

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:20,960
and to our main.css file, you remember that we added this media query right here with the min width

4
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,730
and the min height,

5
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:27,980
so this logical operator where we say that both criteria must be fulfilled.

6
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:33,460
Well the problem is that the min height was set a bit too high for our purposes.

7
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:38,410
So in case we are using a laptop for example, the image might look kind of awkward,

8
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:45,200
therefore what we could do now is we could also set the main height to 40rem and with that, we can ensure

9
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,950
that our image also looks good on laptops for example.

10
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:54,490
That's just a small fix, you won't see a difference right here because on my screen, it looks good.

11
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:00,620
So this was the quick fix but now I'm coming back to the navigation bar because if we look at the structure

12
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:09,140
of our navigation bar, so right here in the header and then we have our div right here and then we have

13
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:13,550
our anchor tag and inside this anchor tag, we have our image.

14
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:18,340
So we defined a height of 2.5rem for our image,

15
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:21,680
that's what we did when we worked on the responsive design

16
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:28,260
but the anchor tag actually has a font size defined, 1.5rem

17
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:35,000
and this leads to the issue that if we look at the height of our image, this is like 40 pixels but the

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,200
anchor tag is 46 pixels, as you can see it in the left upper part of the screen

19
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:45,860
and although this is not a big problem, I don't think that's a logical behavior. Therefore, wouldn't it

20
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:54,020
make more sense to simply get rid of the font size right here of our anchor tag and define a fixed height

21
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,950
for our anchor tag of 2.5rem,

22
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:03,050
so the height we had for our image and then the image can simply have a height of 100% of its

23
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:08,350
containing element which is the anchor tag and then the structure would be a bit better.

24
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,750
I think this would make sense,

25
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,580
so let's go back to the code

26
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,170
and let's now change this.

27
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,270
For that, we have to go to our shared.css

28
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:25,160
file, this one right here and now go to our main header brand and main header brand image selectors.

29
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,090
So the main header brand shouldn't have a font size,

30
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:35,780
we will delete that but it should have a height of 2.5rem, as we just said,

31
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:40,550
this is the height we had so far for our logo, for our uHost logo.

32
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:47,180
So as we now defined the height in the anchor tag which is the containing element for our image, for our

33
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:51,170
logo, we can simply set this height to 100%.

34
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:55,710
If we do that and we load our page, we can see that nothing changed.

35
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,020
We have this little gap right here,

36
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,100
we'll fix that soon

37
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:03,140
but the cool thing though is that we have a height of 40 pixels right here for our image and of 40

38
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:07,670
pixels right there for our anchor tag, so for the containing element.

39
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:11,250
And I think this is a better code structure and we want to have a good code structure,

40
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,520
so I think that was a nice fix.

41
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:18,550
However we now have this little gap right here between the background image and our navigation bar,

42
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,820
this is simply 2.5rem

43
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,390
we now have for our image and for the anchor tag

44
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:30,890
and in addition to that, we also have, right here in our header, we have this padding right here as you

45
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:36,010
can see it, we have a padding of 0.5rem to the top and to the bottom.

46
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:42,740
And this simply means if we select our background image right here and go down in the code and see that

47
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:46,780
we have a top margin or margin top of 3.75rem,

48
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:49,090
well then this is a bit too much.

49
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,850
So if we simply go back now to our

50
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,070
main.css

51
00:03:52,070 --> 00:04:00,520
file and go to our image right here and simply change this margin top to 3.5rem, like

52
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:08,680
that and reload our page, we can see that now we fixed our navigation bar and our image still looks

53
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,420
nice in all versions,

54
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:14,410
so be the mobile version or the desktop version.

55
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:20,750
So this is just a fix for our navigation bar and the two little fixes for our background image.

56
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:28,480
Now there is only one final fix that we should also apply as part of this responsive design module because

57
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:33,500
the footer, we talked about that, is kind of positioned in the middle of nowhere now

58
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,960
and this is also something we should have a look at now.
