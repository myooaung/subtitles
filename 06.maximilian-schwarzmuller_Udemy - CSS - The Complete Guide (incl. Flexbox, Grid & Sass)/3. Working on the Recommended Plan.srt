1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,990
So let's continue working on our plans.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,530
We got our first nice look,

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:14,870
now I want to ensure that the plan in the middle really looks different. For this, I want to change its

4
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:16,060
background color,

5
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:20,460
I also want to highlight this recommended batch so to say

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:27,680
and with that, we would have a layout, a look that would probably push the customer more into picking

7
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,140
this plan which is something you typically want to implement on your pages.

8
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:40,180
So for that, we first of all need to go back to the HTML code because to control for example this recommended

9
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:47,570
badge, I need to give it an extra class of course So you could add any class you want to the h1 tag

10
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:49,310
holding the recommended text,

11
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:54,470
I will add a class which I'll name plan__annotation,

12
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:58,910
again following this naming convention where this belongs to the plan,

13
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:03,510
hence it starts with plan but then it's like a sub-element of the plan.

14
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,060
It's

15
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:10,510
the annotation or the, you can name it subtitle, you can name it badge, whatever you want.

16
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,610
So this is the first thing I want to add,

17
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:18,110
the second thing is I want to add a second class to the article element itself.

18
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:24,370
This second class should allow me to change the background color, to highlight this plan,

19
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,300
so I will add plan--highlighted here.

20
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:34,510
This is a helper class which I can use to still get the default plan styles which I want,

21
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:40,690
I want to get that inline block style, I want to get that vertical align style but I actually want to overwrite

22
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:45,930
the background color and I can do that with the help of the plan--highlighted class.

23
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:52,880
So let's pick that plan--highlighted class here and let's use it, in the main.css file,

24
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,360
I will add it below my plan class here,

25
00:01:55,460 --> 00:02:04,030
so plan--highlighted and I simply want to set the background color to a darker green here.

26
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:11,750
Now the green I picked is #19b84c but of course you can pick any color you want

27
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:19,040
and with that if we now save both files, so the index.html and the main.css file and we reload,

28
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,370
the middle plan already stands out more.

29
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:29,870
Now this looks nice, one other thing we can do though is we could try changing the text color,

30
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:35,580
so set the color to white for example. If we set it to white,

31
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,120
now in my opinion the text is a bit easier to read,

32
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:46,700
so I want to keep that look too. The next thing that I want to do or that I want to add is

33
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:50,870
I want to add a little drop shadow behind the plan.

34
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,580
Now for that, we can use the box-shadow property.

35
00:02:54,890 --> 00:03:01,730
So on the plan--highlighted class, I'll add box-shadow and the box-shadow property is something

36
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:03,740
we didn't dive in yet.

37
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:11,180
The box-shadow property allows you to define a drop shadow or an inset shadow by adding inset as the

38
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:15,280
first keyword and then adding the same parameters as I'm going to show you

39
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:20,690
but here I will not add an inner shadow, so I will remove that and then the other values which you would

40
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:28,860
also add for an inset shadow then are the positioning of the shadow on the x-axis,

41
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:34,200
so here I will pick 2 pixels, on the y-axis I will also pick 2 pixels here,

42
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:40,010
so it's positioned 2 pixels to the right and to the bottom of the original shape.

43
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:47,090
Then you can define the blurriness, here I will pick 2 pixels too and the spread,

44
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:54,080
so how much the shadow should actually spread beyond the borders you define with the first two values

45
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,070
and here I will use 2 pixels too.

46
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,700
You can omit the spread and you can also omit the blur

47
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:04,640
by the way, then you would get a very sharp shadow which directly ends after the 2 pixels or you add

48
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,620
all four things of course

49
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,250
and then you add the shadow color.

50
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:15,890
You can use any color here, like green but I want to use a transparent black and for that, here's a second

51
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:18,180
new thing, a color function.

52
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:24,360
We thus far always defined colors with either a word, like red or a hashtag.

53
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:30,330
Now actually, there are more ways of defining colors than that and color functions are one other way,

54
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:37,280
for example you can use the rgb function to define a color by setting its red, green and blue value

55
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:41,120
which is a value between 0 and 255.

56
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,790
So for example, this would essentially yield white

57
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:49,730
and in my IDE you can even see a preview, even pick a different color if you want.

58
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:53,060
So this is the rgb way of defining a color, black

59
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:59,330
on the other hand would be 000 and there's an alternative to rgb,

60
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:08,430
there is rgba. Rgba also allows you to add a fourth argument, the alpha channel which defines the transparency

61
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:14,680
of this color and here I will set this to .5 which means it has transparency of 50%.

62
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,620
If you add one here, this will mean it's fully opaque actually so it's not transparent,

63
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:27,600
if you use zero here, it's fully transparent and you can always confirm this in the IDE that you're using

64
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,150
or in the developer tools of your browser,

65
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,220
there you can also go to the color picker

66
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,300
and here you would see the transparency level too,

67
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,680
now I will set this to .5.

68
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,460
So this is a box-shadow and a color function,

69
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,320
so two new things in one step,

70
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,560
awesome

71
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:48,810
and with that, we can save that and reload the page.

72
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:57,210
And now we see we get that box with this slight drop shadow to the bottom and to the right which has

73
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:59,750
a light blurriness and a little bit of spread,

74
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:05,680
so a little bit of rough edges so to say, spreading out a little bit beyond the 2 pixels we defined

75
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:12,390
and as you can probably also tell, it's not fully black, it's transparent, it looks great but it's actually

76
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,700
transparent.

77
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:19,160
And for this, I like the look, this really makes this item in the middle stand out,

78
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,960
we'll continue working on the look of this layout throughout the course

79
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,370
but for now, this looks good to me.

80
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,620
Now let's continue working on this

81
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,480
and let's next add a better look for this badge here.
