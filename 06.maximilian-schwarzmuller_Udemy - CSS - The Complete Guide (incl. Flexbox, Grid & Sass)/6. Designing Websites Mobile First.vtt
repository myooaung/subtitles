I have to admit something, we did a mistake when creating the website so far.

2
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.360
Now

3
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.940
no worries, we didn't do a mistake,

4
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.300
we did it on purpose

5
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:21.000
but actually the approach, how we created this website is not the state of the art approach we use nowadays

6
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.060
because normally, you'll start creating your website mobile first.

7
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:32.530
This means you start creating the page in a way that it looks nice on mobile devices.

8
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.840
The reason for that is simply that many users are using mobile devices now to access websites

9
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.060
and with that, you want to make sure that you have a nice looking website for mobile devices.

10
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.670
As soon as you got the mobile version, you'll also have a look at the desktop version and also ensure

11
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.450
that you implement a responsive design which also translates nicely into these desktop websites.

12
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.050
Now this brings us to the question, why didn't we follow this mobile first approach then?

13
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.960
Well because we just learned how to work

14
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:13.500
with CSS and learning CSS is easier if we use a normal desktop website because we have more space available

15
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.760
and we can try out things in a more convenient way

16
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.940
but now that the basics are set,

17
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.700
it's of course time to change this way we think and only work mobile first from now.

18
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.000
This means that in the next lectures, we'll always have a look at the mobile version,

19
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.010
make sure it looks nice and then check the desktop version,

20
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.640
so that's the approach we will follow from now on throughout the entire course.

21
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:46.470
With that in mind, we can now continue and finally learn how to use media queries because you would probably

22
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.200
agree that this page right here doesn't look really good at the moment. So let's improve that.
