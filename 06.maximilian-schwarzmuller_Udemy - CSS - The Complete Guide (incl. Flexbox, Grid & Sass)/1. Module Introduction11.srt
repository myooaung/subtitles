00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:05,810
So welcome to another module with me again, Max.

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:13,410
Now that we worked a lot on the look and feel of our page, on the responsive design and that Manuel

3
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:14,220
ensured that

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:20,820
you learned how you can do that, how you can adjust your page to different device sizes and screen

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:21,830
sizes,

6
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:24,310
now that we got all of that out of the way,

7
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:28,930
let's dive back into adding some content to our demo page here

8
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:37,340
and let's add some content which is basically available on almost any webpage you see; forms and form

9
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:46,210
elements, elements where users can input data, be that an email address, a password or anything like that.

10
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,060
So what's inside this module?

11
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:52,100
You will learn how you can style inputs and buttons,

12
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:58,310
we'll have a look at different kinds of inputs and how you can adjust their look to fit the overall

13
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:00,800
look of your page or the look

14
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,940
you basically want to achieve.

15
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,200
We'll also have a look at validation styles,

16
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:14,480
so how you can give the user feedback about whether a value entered into a field is valid or not, how

17
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:21,350
you can give such feedback to the user by changing the way the input looks, for example by adding a red

18
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,260
border or something like that.

19
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,110
That's what we'll dive into,

20
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:30,010
so why don't we just start and have a look at all these things starting with the next video.
