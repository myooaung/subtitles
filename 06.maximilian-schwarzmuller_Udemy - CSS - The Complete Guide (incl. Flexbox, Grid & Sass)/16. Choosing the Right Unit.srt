1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,220
So which unit should I choose? 

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,460
Well we basically have different properties,

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,020
we saw that and we have a recommended unit

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:19,440
and before we dive into that, have a look at the quotation marks around recommended because as always

5
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,480
in CSS, there are better and worse ways to achieve a goal,

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,420
therefore this recommendation is also part of my personal experience of course.

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,380
Therefore feel free to change that of course depending on the needs of your project

8
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,040
but I think to give you a general guidance,

9
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,440
this slide might be really helpful in the future.

10
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:46,900
So having said that, let's have a look at the properties we had because we know our properties, right?

11
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,980
Let's start with the font size property,

12
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:50,880
important,

13
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,120
the root element.

14
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:59,310
We talked about that when we decided if we want to add a specific font size to our HTML element,

15
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,540
one recommended unit is percentage.

16
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:03,930
We had a look at that,

17
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,840
applying 100% doesn't make a lot of sense but you can do that if you want to but you can

18
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:16,740
apply 75% or some value below 100% in case you want to make sure that the default font

19
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,870
size on your website is smaller than the browser setting.

20
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:25,430
Another possible unit is of course this one, nothing

21
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,710
and that's also the one we use in this course because I explain that we want to decide how the font

22
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:38,190
sizes change depending on specific elements but in general, the font size can be in line with the browser

23
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,420
setting.

24
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:45,680
The second property we can use to apply some units to is the font size in general.

25
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:51,070
Here we saw that rem is probably a nice idea to follow,

26
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,770
it's easy to use,

27
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,770
it's easy to see also for other developers

28
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:02,610
and if you didn't apply any kind of specific font size to the root element, it's always clear that the

29
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:07,160
font size with rem refers to this root element.

30
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,600
You can also use em,

31
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:13,070
we saw that but I would recommend only using it for children,

32
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:20,310
so not some em chain, so applying em to the parent to the child and to other child because you saw

33
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:28,170
it in the example, it can get messy quickly and I'm not sure if you liked that but as I said, I do not

34
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,000
recommend just using rem

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,400
actually, you can use both and play around,

36
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,340
I personally prefer rem though. The next properties are the padding and margin.

37
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:43,170
We saw that in our example on the website, we used rem for both.

38
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:48,270
Of course if you want to have a different behavior and you say you want to have fixed margins between

39
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:51,640
the elements, feel free to not apply rem right here.

40
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,800
Then we had the border where we followed a different approach. For the border we used pixels because

41
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:06,420
my rationale is that a border should just be a border but I don't want to have a border of, I don't

42
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,250
know, 30 pixels in the end,

43
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,870
that's definitely not something you normally want,

44
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:15,940
so I would recommend using pixels for borders.

45
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,800
Then we had width and height and for these, we have two options,

46
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,230
we can either use percentages.

47
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:27,420
The important thing about percentages though is that we always have to be aware of the containing block

48
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:31,070
which depends on the position property applied to our element,

49
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:38,850
we were diving into that in a lot of detail and we can use vw or vh, viewport width, viewport height

50
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,270
or view min, view max,

51
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,210
we also saw that.

52
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,930
Which one do I recommend?

53
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:50,790
Well to be honest, it depends of course on what you want to achieve. If you want to relate your width or

54
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,310
height to the viewport,

55
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:57,010
I think choosing the viewport unit is definitely not a bad idea.

56
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:03,630
On the other hand, you can also solve this issue with the position fixed property for example and percentages.

57
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:10,710
So again, you are free to choose either of the two because I would stick in most cases to these, an exception

58
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:13,470
right here is maybe max width or min width,

59
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:20,730
we saw that, there it's also possible to use pixels because you might want to set a real pixel-based

60
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:24,240
limit for your maximum width of specific elements,

61
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,470
I also showed you an example of how this would work.

62
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,990
Now for the top and bottom properties,

63
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,120
so how we can move our elements,

64
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:39,000
well I would normally stick to percentages because there you would normally need the relation to

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,070
your containing block,

66
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,090
so why wouldn't you use percentages?

67
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,940
Definitely a good idea right here.

68
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,430
The same thing is true for left and right of course, there using percentages would also be my recommendation.

69
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:58,080
Now I said in the beginning and I have to repeat myself, this is not the final and definite guidance

70
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,950
how to approach such problems but it's supposed to be a good starting point for you

71
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:10,710
in case you are not sure about a specific property and which unit might be a good selection in combination

72
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,100
with that property.

73
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:17,030
With that, we are getting closer towards the end of this module,

74
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,590
there is one quick tip,

75
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:25,790
another one that I have for you that can help you to quickly center your elements.

76
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,050
Let's have a look at this tip in the next lecture.
