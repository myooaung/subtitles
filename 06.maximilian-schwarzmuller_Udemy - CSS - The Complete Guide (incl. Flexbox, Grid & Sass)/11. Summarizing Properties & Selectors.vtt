00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:09.140
In this course module, we set some important foundations about the way CSS works and we worked with selectors,

2
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.830
properties and values.

3
00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:18.770
Now just to bring this back into memory, selectors are things like div, class blog post, ID main title,

4
00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:24.140
the disabled attribute or the universal selector. Properties are things like background color, we haven't

5
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.490
seen that,

6
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.140
we used background,

7
00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.880
it's connected to that of course though, width, color, margin, display. Here are also a couple of properties

8
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.260
we haven't used before,

9
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:40.310
we will use them throughout the course. Values then are things like red, percentages, colors and hex codes,

10
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.070
pixels or clearly defined values like block, again

11
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.090
these are things we will also see throughout this course.

12
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.420
Now if you're wondering how do you know which properties and which values exist,

13
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.220
let me start with the properties.

14
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:04.400
If you google for MDN CSS reference or you use the link you find in the last lecture of this module,

15
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.410
you will find this page where you got a basic explanation of the CSS syntax and where you

16
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.650
then got this keyword index.

17
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.710
Here you see not, just the properties CSS knows but all the things like all pseudo classes and elements, 

18
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.850
something we hadn't had a look at yet

19
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.300
and this is a great way to finding that specific property you're looking for or finding more information

20
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.310
about that property you found in the solution on stack overflow

21
00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.430
but which you don't fully understand. Now please here's one thing you should not do,

22
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.680
don't learn this list by heart. 

23
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.550
It's way too long,

24
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.430
there are properties you don't use at all and in the end, once you made it through that course and once you

25
00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:54.620
start working on project with CSS, you will see that you use the same set of maybe 20 properties all

26
00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.430
the time and it's really hard to memorize these.

27
00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.600
So this is a great reference but not something you should start learning right now,

28
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.660
just want to point you to it so that you always know where you can look things up.

29
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.530
Now what about the values though?

30
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:15.710
For one, in the reference I just showed you, if you click on a specific property, you also see how you

31
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:22.910
can configure it and which values it will accept because values are tightly coupled to specific properties.

32
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:29.900
You can roughly categorize the types of values into four categories, though there are a bit more in some

33
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:30.760
special cases

34
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.970
but here are the four categories I came up with.

35
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.050
You get properties that simply use predefined options, something like display block,

36
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:44.180
we didn't learn about this property yet but this simply is a property, it doesn't use a hex code, it doesn't

37
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.300
use a number, it just accepts a couple of predefined values,

38
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.950
overflow

39
00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.520
auto would be another example.

40
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.040
Then you have colors,

41
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.100
they work with red hex code

42
00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:03.080
or a shorter version of the hex code and also some special color functions, something we'll also dive

43
00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.420
in later.

44
00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:12.930
Then we got length, sizes and numbers, something like pixels or percentages or just integers,

45
00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:19.340
again all these properties, we'll see them a couple of times throughout the entire course. And last but

46
00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:26.450
not least, we got functions, something like a URL where we seem to be using something different than

47
00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:32.930
just a color as a background or transformation functions where we can scale or rotate elements, something

48
00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.390
we'll cover in the transformation module.

49
00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.220
And of course there are more values,

50
00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.880
again the reference holds them all

51
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.290
and you will see way more in this course,

52
00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:47.120
just wanted to round this up by letting you know where you can find more information and how this generally

53
00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.820
works.
