00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:04.260
So this really was a lot of work

2
00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:05.190
but we did it,

3
00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:06.460
that's the great thing

4
00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:14.410
and what's also great is that we now turn our nice desktop website into a fully responsive website

5
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.730
and for that, we only needed to apply some core concepts.

6
00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.150
Now what did we apply, what did we learn?

7
00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:29.990
Well the first thing we learned is that the responsive design is required to make our website look beautiful

8
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:36.140
on all devices, so not on the desktop device only but also on the smartphone, on the tablet, on any device

9
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.180
that we want to use.

10
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:45.020
We also saw that the viewport meta tag is a really important starting point to ensure this responsive

11
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:52.190
design really works in the end because it allows us to adjust the viewport according to our device sizes

12
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.700
and what this specifically meant is that with this viewport meta tag, we are able to convert the hardware

13
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:05.160
pixels, so the actual pixels you read in the hardware specifications of your device, into the software

14
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:11.510
pixels which basically take into account the actual width, the actual size of your device.

15
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:17.960
We saw that based on that pixel ratio and we also saw that with that, the pixel amount decreased and

16
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.780
therefore the content size increased, 

17
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.620
so the readability was improved and then we had the media queries.

18
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.790
These allowed us finally to change also the properties and therefore the entire look of our website

19
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.080
depending on the width or the height of the device we're using and we can simply add these media queries

20
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.510
by adding @media to our CSS code

21
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.530
and with that, we were able to create this awesomely responsive website.

22
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.930
Now we are of course not done yet,

23
00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.680
that's also the reason for example why we didn't put all the media queries at the end of the code.

24
00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.980
As I said in the beginning, this is actually the way you add these media queries but we have to add more

25
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.490
features to our website,  

26
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.380
so we might come back to the media queries again but in the next lecture,

27
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.360
it's now time to hand over to Max again because he will show you how you can easily create forms with

28
00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.980
CSS.
