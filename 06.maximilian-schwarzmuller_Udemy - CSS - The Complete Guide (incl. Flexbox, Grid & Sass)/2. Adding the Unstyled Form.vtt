00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:09.010
So back on our page, the page I now want to work on is this start hosting page, which we currently don't

2
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:09.440
have,

3
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:16.030
that's why clicking start hosting in the nav bar or why clicking yes here in our modal always leads to

4
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.660
not found error.

5
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.860
Now we're going to change this. Attached to this video,

6
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.870
you find the content for the to be added page. For that, we

7
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.780
first of all need to add a new folder in the root level of our project and I'll name it

8
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.860
start-hosting. Now

9
00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.810
the naming here is important,

10
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.730
you're generally free to name this however you want but you should keep in mind that we already got

11
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.350
some links to that folder,

12
00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.340
for example in our navigation, we link to start hosting and then index.html,

13
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.200
so you should keep that structure to ensure that all these links work.

14
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.830
That's the next thing we have to add,

15
00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.010
we should add an index.html file in there so that we can add some content.

16
00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.980
Now the content for that file however can be found attached to this video,

17
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:10.450
there you find some HTML code which you can simply enter into this file here, into that index.html

18
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.200
file,

19
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.030
it's a HTML skeleton as you know it,

20
00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.700
we have our navigation bar, we have the backdrop,

21
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.780
we got some form content then too. Now

22
00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.930
if we save this and we reload the page and we click on start hosting or on

23
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.670
yes here in the modal,

24
00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.500
we see that newly added page.

25
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.190
Here it is, a bit bigger. Now

26
00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.810
the footer and the header looks OK,

27
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.620
now the footer has a tiny issue, footer class

28
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:49.450
my main footer, we're missing some footer class here, so let's quickly add that, we can take it from the main

29
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:50.850
index.html file,

30
00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:57.910
there we can basically copy that unordered list element with the main footer links class and the list item

31
00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.940
element with the main footer link class and we replace the unordered list opening tag and the list

32
00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:10.340
item opening tag with that and then we also copy the class on the list item to the second class or to

33
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.610
the second element.

34
00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:17.920
With that if we reload, the footer looks good, the overall page looks good except for the form maybe.

35
00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.820
We definitely can work on that

36
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.260
and this will be what we work on in this module.

37
00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.010
So let's dive into how we can style the different elements here,

38
00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.490
you see we have a dropdown,

39
00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.960
we've got normal inputs and we got a checkbox as well as a button,

40
00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.130
how we can style all these things.
