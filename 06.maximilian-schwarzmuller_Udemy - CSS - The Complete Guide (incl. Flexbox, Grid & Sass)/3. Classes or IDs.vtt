00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:05.200
Now that we learned more about CSS class selectors,

2
00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:11.850
there also is some obvious question you could have. You get CSS class selectors and CSS ID 

3
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:19.960
selectors, of course you also got tags and so on but there are cases where you would just use a class selector

4
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:20.680
once, 

5
00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.070
should you then use it or should you use an ID selector instead,

6
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.910
when should you use which kind of selector?

7
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.350
Well, let's see the basics real quick. A class selector is defined like this, an ID selector like this,

8
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:33.700
with the hash symbol

9
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:41.530
and if we add some HTML code, this class selector would select these two HTML elements on the left,

10
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.530
the ID selector would only select the first HTML element in the snippet on the right,

11
00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.060
so this is how they work.

12
00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:55.300
Now let's have a look at when we should use which. The advantage about CSS classes is that they're

13
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.030
reusable,

14
00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.780
you can add them to any HTML element which should get a certain style,

15
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.300
they allow you to mark and name things for styling purposes only.

16
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.050
With that I mean that you create these classes only to apply certain styles,

17
00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.990
they don't really have any other meaning.

18
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.470
You can use them in conjunction with Javascript as you will see later in the course but that's about

19
00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:17.840
it

20
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.350
and even then, it's often tied to CSS related logic.

21
00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:30.310
So classes are really something strongly connected to CSS and therefore, using a class to styles something

22
00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.430
is rarely wrong.

23
00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:40.120
They should be your first pick because other selectors, like for example tag selectors, often have the disadvantage

24
00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.580
of giving you less control,

25
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.620
it's easy to mess something up just because you style your h1 tag with the tag selector and you

26
00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.370
accidentally style some other h1 tag on the same page in the same way

27
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.050
even though you didn't want to do that.

28
00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:59.050
So only use tag selectors for some generic styles that really should affect all elements of that tag.

29
00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:00.330
Class selectors

30
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.620
on the other hand are always a good choice

31
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:09.070
and they're the most used selector type therefore. ID selectors can be a decent choice too though. They're

32
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.330
only used once per page or an ID is only used once per page I should say

33
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.820
and therefore, if you get a certain style that really should just affect one element on your page and

34
00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.080
never more, using an ID selector definitely is not a bad idea.

35
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.860
However, it's important to keep in mind that IDs also got a none CSS meaning on your page,

36
00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.090
mostly the thing that you can link to IDs.

37
00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.410
I'll show this on the demo project

38
00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:36.590
in a second.

39
00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.580
So therefore using IDs just to apply a style is not really something I can recommend,

40
00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:43.960
use a class instead

41
00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:50.300
even if you only use it once because the ID introduces some other effects which are not horrible or

42
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.940
unnecessarily bad but all is not optimal maybe. So therefore use ID selectors

43
00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:02.290
if you planned on using an ID anyways, if it semantically makes sense but don't just add them because

44
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.900
you want to add some style.

45
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.990
Now let's have a look at what I mean with that linking thing. Back on our page,

46
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:15.530
if we inspect the HTML code, you can see that on both anchor tags, I actually linked to an ID,

47
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.090
we do this by adding a hashtag and then the name of the ID.

48
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:25.780
The IDs are then used on the sections and because the sections have a height of 800 pixels, simply

49
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.270
just to ensure that we can scroll on the page,

50
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.120
I can actually show you what these links will do.

51
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:38.410
If we go back to the page, I can scroll down to the outro section here but I can also click on outro and

52
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:46.030
then my browser will jump there, because in the URL, it added outro at the end of the URL. This is

53
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.760
one thing that's baked into HTML,

54
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.710
it's not related to CSS at all, has nothing to do with it.

55
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:53.750
It's a nice behavior,

56
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.560
it allows you to link on a page.

57
00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.950
It also means that IDs are not just there for styling purposes though, that is what I meant on the previous

58
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:03.430
slide.
