WEBVTT
1
00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.980
So what is this right here, what do we have there?

2
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.760
Well as I said before, this is basically the font weight and

3
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.000
we also have the font style, I'll come back to that in a few seconds

4
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.550
but let's first focus onto the font weight.

5
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.650
Now what does this mean?

6
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:25.360
If we go back to our code and to our package info right here, then we added the font family Roboto

7
00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:34.150
and below that, we could now add a font weight, like that and my IDE already shows you the options you

8
00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.520
have,

9
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:43.120
you basically have numbers from 100 to 900, where a bigger number is equal to a bolder or fatter weight

10
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.270
of the font

11
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:50.530
and then you have bolder for example which basically means that it is bolder than the inherited font.

12
00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.340
We already talked about inheritance throughout this course,

13
00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.400
therefore I will not dive deeper into that,

14
00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:05.140
what I will dive deeper into are these numbers because basically, the numbers as I said allow you to

15
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:14.380
specify the weight of your font and a number of 400 is the equivalent you could say to a normal

16
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.100
font weight,

17
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.770
so you could also write normal, right here like that,

18
00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.350
this would be then a number of 400 and a number of 700 would be bold,

19
00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.620
so the one down here.

20
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.870
Now what happens if we add something like 900 here for example? Well let's see, if we go back to our

21
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:40.770
page right here and reload it, you can see that nothing is happening and this is actually strange, right

22
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.340
because if we go back to Google fonts right here, you can see that 900,

23
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.960
this right here is actually defined.

24
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:59.870
The problem is that we only imported so far the regular font face, so this regular 400 font face.

25
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.660
So what we did is basically we have Roboto 400 right here,

26
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.450
that's our font family and the font weight,

27
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.540
so that's basically what we can see right here,

28
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:16.600
Roboto only. If we would like to use this 900 style I just showed you,

29
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:17.750
so this one,

30
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:24.640
then what you can do is we can click right here, now now hit the plus again, open this menu,

31
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.490
then you can see something interesting.

32
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.970
Previously we only had Roboto here,

33
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.530
right,

34
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.150
you remember when we just imported the regular 400 font face.

35
00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.190
Now we added a second font face,

36
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.800
this 900 font face right here

37
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:46.060
and so we can see that this was the regular style, the 400 and now we also have to add the 900 style.

38
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:54.200
So what we can do now is, we can simply copy both of these and add them right here, we need a colon first

39
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.390
and then paste it, like that

40
00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:05.210
and with that, we now told our code that we want to import the Roboto top font family with the 400 and

41
00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.430
900 font face,

42
00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:08.380
that's important.

43
00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:09.710
The font faces,

44
00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:10.850
let me close that,

45
00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.320
these are the different font faces we have

46
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:20.570
and we have to import each font face separately to be able to retrieve the information for the corresponding

47
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.730
font face on our website.

48
00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:30.300
What this simply means is that right now, if we go back to our packages file and we change it back to 900,

49
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:36.090
the font weight right here and now go back to the packages page and reload it,

50
00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:42.370
now the font weight increased and that's the important concept you have to understand when working with

51
00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:50.200
fonts. Each or most of the font families have different font faces applied and you have to import each

52
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.780
of these font faces to your website,

53
00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.630
in the case of a web font, you can do this simply by adding it like this

54
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:03.130
as we saw it right here for Google fonts and with that, you are able to change the font weight,

55
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.780
that's important.

56
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:11.710
If you took a closer look, you also saw that different weight was not the only parameter that impacts

57
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.000
the font face,

58
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.650
we also see italic right here, that's the font style

59
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:23.860
and if we select for example thin 100 italic, right here and add this one, we can again see that this

60
00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.590
is also right here at import, now added right there,

61
00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:28.870
so 100i.

62
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.290
So let's add that right here in front of the 400,

63
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.840
right here at the Roboto font family,

64
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.460
so 100 i,

65
00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:44.670
like that, add a comma and we could actually also get rid of that space right here, like that and save that

66
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.600
and now go to the packages file

67
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:54.850
and now important, change our font weight to our new 100 that we just imported, the 100 i and now add a font

68
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.420
style of italic,

69
00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.870
this one right here.

70
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:05.800
Now let's see, if we minimize that and go back right here and reload the page, we can now see that we have

71
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.780
this thin 100 italic style.

72
00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:16.240
Now an important information, if I would now go back to the shared.css file and remove the i after italic,

73
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:22.720
so just to make sure we have our thin 100 style right here. If I now would go back and reload the page,

74
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:28.220
you can see the styling changes but it only barely changes and

75
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:35.890
the reason for that is that the browser is able to kind of add an italic style to our website, even

76
00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:39.240
though we didn't specify this individual font face

77
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:45.820
but as you could see, if I go back and add the i once again right here, we can see it changes indeed

78
00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.350
the way the italic style is displayed.

79
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.930
However, I don't think we need that i right here so we can delete this

80
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.240
i after the 100,

81
00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:55.780
we don't need the italic style

82
00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.440
and I will also change this back to 900.

83
00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.310
I'll keep that italic style,

84
00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:08.090
so this default browser italic style, though for the moment we'll get rid of that soon in the next lectures.

85
00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:09.260
So if I now reload,

86
00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.560
this is the look we have at the moment on our website.

87
00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:19.540
And with that, you saw that it's really important to import the right font face that you want to have on

88
00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:26.180
your website, especially for the font weight but also for the italic style to make sure you really match

89
00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.130
the style that was intended from the beginning.

90
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:35.800
And with that, we also saw that we have these different font faces and how we can use them in connection

91
00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:42.620
with web fonts but there is one additional way how to import fonts to our website

92
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:45.370
and this is creating our own fonts.

93
00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:47.900
Let's look at that in the next lecture.
