1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:07,130
With partials and better import out of the way, let's move on to advanced media.

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,220
Now what is that about,

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,920
what does this mean?

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,820
We obviously have media queries

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,980
in normal CSS too and we got one at the bottom of our file here,

6
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,670
it just changes some sizes here.

7
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:22,060
Now, media queries can still be used like this,

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,780
nothing wrong with that.

9
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:29,120
Now of course you can also use SASS features, like variables or nested selectors in here if you wanted

10
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,240
to do that,

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,860
this is all normal SASS code

12
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:37,110
in the end but you can also write your media queries a bit differently if you want.

13
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,280
You can take that media query code here,

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:48,530
let's say for the HTML element and go up to the HTML element and actually nest the media query now.

15
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,520
Now what you can do is you can get rid of that selector, since you already nested the media query in

16
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,520
that selector

17
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,330
and of the first curly brace and just keep the closing curly brace of the media query and now if you

18
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:07,860
save that, what this will do is, it will still generate a separate media query, so valid CSS code

19
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,390
which nests this HTML rule

20
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,800
but you as a developer have this convenient way of keeping your media queries close to the elements

21
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,300
which they affect. You don't have to use it,

22
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:25,470
you can still use the other approach of collecting all your elements that should go into a single media

23
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:31,830
query but this is a way you might like because it's keeping your code closer to where you use it.

24
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:40,110
So if I also do that for sass-introduction here, I'll cut the entire media query, go to my sass-introduction

25
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,550
and add it here,

26
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:50,650
get rid of the HTML part, get rid of the selectors here and reformat this and now I can also copy that over

27
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:54,670
to details where I also wanted to use that.

28
00:01:54,760 --> 00:02:00,820
Now I got this restructured and maybe a bit more readable to us as a developer because the media query

29
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:04,960
is always sitting on the element which it affects and again behind the scenes,

30
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,680
this compiled to code like this. If we go back to our running application and we reload it,

31
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:15,070
we shouldn't see a difference because it still leads to the same code,

32
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,220
it just is a bit more readable to us.

33
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,830
Again this is only an option,

34
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:21,990
you don't have to use it but you can use it if you want to.
