00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.350
So we want to open our side menu when we click that button,

2
00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:12.430
now let's first of all do that with the way we already know. We need to select our button here,

3
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.650
so our toggle button, we can get access to it

4
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:23.660
for example with the toggle button class and add an event listener which in turn should somehow show

5
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:30.020
our mobile nav to which we can also get action through its selector here, through its class selector and then

6
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.790
change the display property.

7
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.050
Now let's quickly do that, let's add two new variables to our Javascript code.

8
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:43.970
The first one is a toggle button and here I will use document query selector as we learned it

9
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.990
and now here we can use the toggle button class which is added to the button as we just saw

10
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:56.160
and I'll add a second variable which is my mobile nav and these variable names

11
00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:03.670
as mentioned before are always up to you. Now there, I will also use my query selector and select it by the

12
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.690
mobile nav CSS class which it has.

13
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.280
So now we can get access to these two elements,

14
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:16.470
now I just need to add event listeners. So I'll add an event listener to my toggle button by using the add event listener

15
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:24.230
method and listening to a click event and I want to execute a function here whenever this is clicked.

16
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.080
Now in this function, I want to change the style of my side nav,

17
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:37.490
so I will use mobile nav style display and set it to block here. Now it should actually be closed when

18
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:38.700
we click a backdrop,

19
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:49.040
so I will copy that and go to my close modal method I guess which we are triggering when we have

20
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.630
a click on the backdrop.

21
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:57.150
So maybe here, we actually should use another anonymous function again

22
00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.030
and now in that function, set mobile nav style display to none

23
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:08.890
but since we also still want to close that modal, we can also execute this close modal here.

24
00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.410
Now this will also run if the modal isn't even open but it won't hurt, the display style would have

25
00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:15.390
been none anyway

26
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.990
in that case.

27
00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.600
So now we got code to close the side nav when we click the backdrop and open it when we click the toggle

28
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:29.740
button. Let's save this and go back to our code and reload the page, if I now click this hamburger menu,

29
00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.830
you see it opens

30
00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:38.740
but we can't click the backdrop because it didn't know because I forgot to also set the backdrop style

31
00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.060
to block here.

32
00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:47.980
So let's add backdrop style display block in our function which runs when we click the toggle button

33
00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.530
and now with that saved if we reload again,

34
00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.550
now we also get a backdrop and we can now also close that side menu,

35
00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:02.980
however the backdrop doesn't disappear and this is because I accidentally wrote this here, you might have

36
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.830
wondered what this means anyways.

37
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:05.920
We don't need it,

38
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.910
it should just be close modal in our backdrop event listener,

39
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:10.840
sorry about that.

40
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.890
So just close modal,

41
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.560
that's our function name,

42
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:24.430
now for a last time if we reload, this opens and this closes and our modal also still works as you

43
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:25.400
can see.

44
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.590
So this is now all working as it should

45
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.030
and we can also navigate around.

46
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.430
We don't have our hamburger icon

47
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.480
on the other pages, we'll add it there

48
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:43.410
but before we do that, let's actually change the way we open and close the menu.

49
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.520
This does work,

50
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:53.830
no question but actually, let me show you an alternative way of changing styles by attaching and removing

51
00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.120
CSS classes.
