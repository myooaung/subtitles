00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.540
In the last module, we already had a look at pseudo classes.

2
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.710
Now I mentioned that you should really just dive in and play around with these to find out if there is

3
00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:12.750
something you need,

4
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.230
we'll also see some of them later in the course,

5
00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.910
for example invalid or focus.

6
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:25.390
There is one special pseudo class into which I want to dive right now though and that's the not pseudo class.

7
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:33.310
This is an interesting pseudo class because it allows us to basically reverse a certain rule or exclude

8
00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.050
a certain selector.

9
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.960
So here for example, in that example you can already see, we would apply a certain style to anything that's

10
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.720
not a paragraph,

11
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.840
so it will exclude the selector you pass between the parentheses. Now important,

12
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.640
some browsers support more complex selectors here but most browsers don't.

13
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.950
You can all see down there, the ability to list more than one selector is experimental

14
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.880
but let's see it in action in our little project here.

15
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.960
How can we use not?

16
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.380
Let's say we want to select any anchor tag that is not active.

17
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.100
Here we got our A active combination,

18
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.350
now let's do the opposite,

19
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.080
let's use our anchor tag,

20
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.750
combine it with not and then add active here.

21
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:29.100
So this will select any anchor tag which does not have the active class and let's simply give this a color

22
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:37.120
of blue let's say. If we save this and now reload, we see the second anchor tag is blue and if we inspect it,

23
00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.920
we can see it's blue due to that rule,

24
00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.280
the first anchor tag on the other hand does not have that rule applied because it clearly doesn't apply

25
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.680
here,

26
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:52.540
we're excluding exactly that case, any anchor tags which are not having the active class. By the way, it's

27
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.710
important that we don't add a whitespace in here for the same reason you learned earlier in this module,

28
00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.220
adding a whitespace would select any elements that are nested in an anchor tag and that do not have

29
00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.260
the active class

30
00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.270
but here we want to select all anchor tags which directly don't have the active class.

31
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.570
Now this shows how to use not,

32
00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:18.460
it can be really handy in some situations but often, you also can find a positive way of writing such

33
00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:19.230
a rule.

34
00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.600
For example here, chances are that you simply want to have blue as a default style for all links,

35
00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.590
so you could write it like this and simply overwrite it for active links

36
00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.520
and since we have more information here, we don't even need to switch the order,

37
00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.610
this will have a higher specificity.

38
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.040
So this set up here, if we save it, will in the end lead to the same style,

39
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:44.460
the only difference is that technically, this intro link which has the active class now also receives

40
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.770
the blue color style but it gets overwritten by the more specific combination with the active class.

41
00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.540
So there is a technical difference,

42
00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.040
the result is the same though

43
00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.800
and I recommend using this way,

44
00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.870
so the positive cases, simply because it's easy to mess up with the not selector,

45
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.090
you can write overly complicated and hard to understand rules

46
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.020
and from a performance perspective, keep in mind that your CSS code has to be parsed and applied.

47
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:18.130
It's also better because not, as you can imagine, is harder to check than simply going through all

48
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.420
the positive cases from top to bottom.

49
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.500
So use not with caution but there can be situations where it allows you to achieve exactly what you

50
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.650
want it to achieve.
