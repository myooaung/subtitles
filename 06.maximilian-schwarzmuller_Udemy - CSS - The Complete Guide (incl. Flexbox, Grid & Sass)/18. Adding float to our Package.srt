1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:06,710
So this middle plan should be positioned on the right of our page.

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:11,970
How can we do this, how can we achieve this? Now with text align right,

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,670
we can't do it because that's no inline element.

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,120
If we turn it into one, then we will probably mess up the other styles,

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,280
inline block also doesn't look that promising,

6
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,030
what we can do is a so-called float.

7
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:32,160
We haven't had a look at floats yet because it's a feature which you don't use that often, you use it a lot

8
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,590
in the past to layout pages

9
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,870
but thankfully, these times are over because you introduced a lot of problems with such floats.

10
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:46,050
Now we got better ways like flex box which we'll dive into in this course but they can be useful, floating

11
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,580
elements can be useful to position some elements differently

12
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:55,030
in your document flow but what does float mean to begin with?

13
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:02,610
Float means that you overwrite the default positioning and tell the browser to push an element to the

14
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,810
left or the right of the page.

15
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:10,010
Now the left is actually already the case but with float, you can also and that will automatically happen,

16
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,140
take it out of the document flow,

17
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,960
this is also why we're not using floats that often because you rarely want this.

18
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,910
Let me show you how it works.

19
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:28,260
If I add a float to my free plan, so if I go down to my free selector here, we add it by adding the float

20
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:35,220
property and then adding right as a value to float this to the right. If I now reload,

21
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,590
you see it's moved to the right and the bottom element takes its place.

22
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,050
Now I said that it's taken out of the document flow,

23
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:50,970
as you can see this is not entirely correct, the text now floats around this element and that's the idea

24
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,110
behind float.

25
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:59,970
It's great for positioning an image in text and make sure that the text actually flows around the image,

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,520
it's not as great for positioning block level elements as we do because the text will respond to it,

27
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,610
the other block level elements won't

28
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:09,800
so to say,

29
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,220
so that's why we end up with this layout.

30
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:19,880
What we have to do is we have to basically keep its space reserved and tell the other block level elements

31
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:25,050
that come after it that they shouldn't respect any previous floatings

32
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:31,350
and we do this with a little hack and that's why you don't really use floats for positioning anymore,

33
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,430
it's ugly,

34
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:40,350
you add an additional helper div after the element you've floated, so after the free plan section here,

35
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:48,060
a div which you simply give a class with any name of your choice, I'll name it clear fix because I will

36
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:55,730
fix the floating with something which is called clear and then you define that class, I'll define it

37
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:02,650
before I add my hashtags, my ID selectors clear fix

38
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:11,350
and there you have one property clear both, which means clear floats on both sides, left and right which

39
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,570
are the two values you can assign here.

40
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:21,100
This means any elements coming after this element or an element with that class will not respect previous

41
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,130
floats.

42
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:27,850
So with that if we save that and reload, you'll see we're back to the old layout and every element stays

43
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,080
in position.

44
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,380
Now this is a hacky way of doing that,

45
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,570
we get better ways

46
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:39,970
nowadays, we can use different things like flex box which make positioning so much easier and cleaner

47
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:48,280
and we will dive into that as I said but be aware that float is available, that it's great for positioning

48
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:54,670
something like images and text where you want the content to float around or to flow around

49
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,660
but if you want to use it for positioning elements on your page layout, try to avoid it.

50
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,690
If you do it,

51
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:09,960
be aware of that clear fix which actually clears the float to keep the elements in their place.

52
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:12,070
Now with that, we added the float,

53
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:16,130
now one thing I also want to do is the styling here is wrong,

54
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:19,950
the border should now be removed on the right not on the left.

55
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:24,520
So what I'll actually do is here on the free selector,

56
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:28,060
I'll add border right and set this to to none

57
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:34,600
and instead add border left and set this to the same settings I used up there for package in general,

58
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:42,620
4 pixel solid and that dark green color, that is what I want to add here as my border left.

59
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:47,440
Finally, I also want to move the text to the right with text align right.

60
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:53,130
If we save that and we now reload, the entire plan is pushed to the right,

61
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:58,420
one thing you can see though, the left border does not turn red

62
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:05,230
if we hover over this element. Now do you know why, that is really tricky

63
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,100
and you score bonus points if you know why that's happening.

64
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,770
We'll fix it or we'll talk about it in the next lecture.
