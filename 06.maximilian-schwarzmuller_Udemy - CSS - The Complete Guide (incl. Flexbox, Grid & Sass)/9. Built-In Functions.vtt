We already had a look at a lot of important SASS features until now,

2
00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.080
let's have a look at some built-in functions.

3
00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:15.530
Actually we saw one in the last video, map-get is a function provided by SASS to extract the value from

4
00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:16.560
a map

5
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:17.810
but there are more

6
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:24.640
and you can click that link here to find a list of all the functions SASS ships with.

7
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:31.800
These are a couple of functions you already know from CSS, like RGB but then also new ones like red,

8
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.540
to just get the red component of a color you pass as a value.

9
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.630
Now to be honest, all these color functions as well as opacity functions are really interesting,

10
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.930
so let me show you where you could benefit from using them. Back in our project,

11
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:53.820
there is one line in our code, here where I get a very light purple in the sass-introduction.

12
00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:01.400
Now of course, I can select this manually but the downside again is that if I ever change my main color

13
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.260
here, this brighter version of it might not fit it anymore.

14
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.450
Of course I could define it up here too and always change it when I change this but sometimes you just

15
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:20.110
want to have this color depend on your main color and just create a brighter, a lighter version of your main color.

16
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.030
So what we can do is we can use a function for this,

17
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.480
we can go here

18
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.760
where we use the background and use the lighten function, like this. That is also a function provided

19
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.990
by SASS.

20
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.940
The first argument here is a color, so we can use map-get again to get our main color.

21
00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.850
The second argument is the amount by which you want to lighten it

22
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:54.520
and if you have a look at the official docs here, you'll see that lighten here takes an amount between

23
00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.290
0 and 100%,

24
00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.480
so we can lighten this by let's say 70%.

25
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:09.660
And now if I save this and if I go back to my page here, you'll see the color appears slightly change,

26
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.860
it's a bit too dark.

27
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.300
Let's ramp this up to 80%

28
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.360
and now it's way too light,

29
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:22.590
so maybe the truth is somewhere between 72% maybe. If we do that,

30
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.330
that looks good.

31
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:31.470
Now we can copy that code here and also use it in the second place where we use the lighter color

32
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.950
and now the advantage really is that we're using this color all the time or this function and hence if

33
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.080
we ever change the main color, this will also adjust.

34
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:48.690
For example if we were to decide that our main color should be black, well then the background would

35
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.500
also adjust to a gray, so that is where this really shines and where this really helps us.

36
00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:02.340
Now with that, we saw how we can use built-in functions. As you of course saw on the link

37
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.200
I just showed you, there are way more functions,

38
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.540
so definitely just dive into that function reference here and play around with them to see what you

39
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.430
can do with that,

40
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.700
what can be useful for you and what can speed up your next project creation process.
