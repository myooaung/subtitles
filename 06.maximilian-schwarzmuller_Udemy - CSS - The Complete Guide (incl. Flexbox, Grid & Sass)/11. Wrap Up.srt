1
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:03,070
So that's it,

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:07,930
that was the module on how you can approach the styling of form elements.

3
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:12,650
In the end it's not that different from the way you style other things in your app.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,260
You learned that for styling inputs, you have to watch out that many input elements have default browser

5
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:26,150
styles which you want to overwrite or overwrite them with the inherit special value, to inherit the values

6
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:29,560
you define anywhere else in your web app or a website.

7
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:36,250
You learned about special pseudos selectors, like focus, to provide a good user feedback or checked for the

8
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:42,120
checkbox for example and you learned about the difference between outline and border again.

9
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:48,380
We also had a look at validation and you learned that you can give the user feedback with the valid and invalid

10
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:55,520
pseudo selectors or with manual validation done by adding some invalid class or whatever you want to

11
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,960
name it, to the elements you currently consider to be invalid.

12
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:06,080
And we also had a look at buttons and especially, how we can style the disabled state with the help of

13
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,940
the disabled attribute selector and that's it.

14
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,050
This is hopefully something which helps you in your next projects.

15
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:21,890
Now in the next module, Manuel will take over again and will walk you through how you can style text in

16
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,100
different ways in your application.

17
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:27,920
So let's move on to this module together now.
