1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:08,980
So in the last lecture, we defined all these properties, now let's put them into our shorthand here.

2
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:13,650
Now we already saw how we can add an image or a solid color,

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:21,550
now what about the other properties? We can of course also set the positioning and size here,

4
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:26,110
however both can for example use pixels and the percentage values,

5
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,980
so how do we define what should be what?

6
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:36,130
Well actually, the position comes first and then is separated from the size with a slash.

7
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:43,580
So what you can do is you can write left 10%, bottom 20%, just as we have it here and then

8
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:49,300
slash, forward slash and then your size values,

9
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,440
in this case, cover.

10
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:59,000
If you do that, we should be able to comment out these three properties, save that and if we reload, still

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:07,250
have the same result as before and we do. Now regarding the other properties, we can of course add no repeat,

12
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,280
we got no other property that would have the same value,

13
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:17,060
so that's no problem. Now for background origin and clip, we actually also have the same values

14
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,740
but here simply the order wins,

15
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:26,540
if you only include one value like border box, this will actually be set for both origin and clip,

16
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:33,860
so for our case this would do. You could also define both, like for example border box and padding box because

17
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:37,040
defining two only makes sense if you have differing values.

18
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:42,320
In this case, the first one would set the origin and the second one the clip

19
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,930
but here I will just use one because I want to set the same value

20
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:51,320
and of course you could also add fixed, local or scroll for background attachment.

21
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:57,150
Now with that, I can comment this out, reload my page and still have the same effect as before.

22
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,580
I will now also remove the border which was only there for demo purposes

23
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:08,580
and with that, we got a nicely positioned image here which looks way better than before.

24
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:17,260
Now with this changed and set into place, let's move on and let's find out what else we can do with images.
