1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:07,250
So my idea is to turn this last list item into a call to action button,

2
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:14,430
so this should really stand out from the other links, should be clearly visible. To ensure that we can style

3
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:15,310
it that way,

4
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,080
I'll add an extra class and that's important,

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,790
you can add more than one class to an element.

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:27,820
So here, I'll simply add a whitespace after the first class and then add my second class, here

7
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:35,370
I'll name the class main-nav__item and then --cta, that name might look

8
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:36,850
very ugly and strange,

9
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:44,370
it's again following this BEM way of naming classes, we have main-nav__item still but it has a special

10
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:44,930
state

11
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:51,720
so to say and you, per the BEM specification, separate this with two dashes and then the state name

12
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:56,080
which of course is set by you, here CTA for call to action.

13
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:02,670
So now with that extra class added, I can target either of them to style this link and we do use the first

14
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:08,520
one of course, we always did over the last lectures but now this second class can be used to also style

15
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:14,550
this and since it only is applied to this list item, the other links won't be affected by it. So I'll

16
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:23,450
go back to the main.css file and I'll add a new rule, main-nav__item--cta, to be precise,

17
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:30,450
I want to target the anchor tag inside of there just as we did it for the normal main-nav__item. I'll now have

18
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,520
to overwrite anything that I want to have different than before.

19
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,290
Now here, the order does matter,

20
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:41,170
they have the same specificity because they both have descendant combinator,

21
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,590
they both target the anchor tag,

22
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,570
they both have a class at the beginning,

23
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:50,530
so for this and this rule, it's now really just the order in the file that's important.

24
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:55,380
So now we can overwrite the parts that we want to change for that call to action button.

25
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:01,920
What I want to change is I want to set the text color to white because I'll add a background color of

26
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,850
this the red color we used, this reddish color.

27
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,850
I also want to change the padding,

28
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:17,090
I want to use 8 pixels top and bottom and 16 pixels left and right and I also will give this a border

29
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:20,570
radius of 8 pixels.

30
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:24,640
Now border radius is new, this will round the corners,

31
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:29,030
if we save this, you can see it, save both files including the HTML file.

32
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,400
If you now reload it,

33
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:35,870
this is our call to action button which looks really strange with that white border bottom hover effect

34
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,980
here but this is now our button clearly standing out from the other

35
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:43,260
links and I would agree that with that color below there,

36
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,660
that doesn't look that great,

37
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,820
we'll replace it with an image soon.

38
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:52,410
So now we got that button, the hover effect also needs to change now to make sure it this looks good.

39
00:02:52,850 --> 00:03:02,450
So I'll add another main-nav__item--cta a hover and for active, so main-nav__item --cta a active

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:12,080
and here, I'll set the color of the text to the red color and I'll set the background color to white, so

41
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,470
I'll swap that essentially

42
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:20,890
and I also will remove that border assignment which we have for normal link hover effects so that

43
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:27,130
we don't get that border bottom because again, order matters here, specificity would be the same,

44
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:34,540
so this one resolves the conflict and it simply overwrites all border settings that were made earlier.

45
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,500
With that if we reload again,

46
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,790
now we have a different style and hovering over that

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,820
and now we added that CTA button and that's it for now with the navigation.

48
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:51,580
Now we'll revisit this of course later, a couple of times actually, to make it responsive and to also

49
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:59,170
style it differently or position the elements differently. The next and last thing I want to do is I

50
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:05,770
want to add an image here so that we got less of a harsh contrast.

51
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,590
Let's do this in the next lecture.
