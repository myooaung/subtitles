00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:04.970
So we had a look at what you can do with CSS,
1

2
00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.910
now let's have a brief look at its history,
2

3
00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:09.560
a very brief one I promise.
3

4
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:16.380
CSS was first introduced in 1996, we refer to this as CSS version 1,
4

5
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.360
that was the first time you finally got tools to improve the look of your web page.
5

6
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:28.910
Now only two years later, we got CSS version 2. The latest
6

7
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:29.490
version of CSS actually is CSS version 3,
7

8
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.540
that is the one this course uses and it's still in development.
8

9
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.270
Isn't that strange?
9

10
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.750
Will there ever be a version 4 at some point in time?
10

11
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:47.150
No. We'll never get a CSS version 4 because with CSS version 3, the concept or the approach toward
11

12
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:53.360
CSS, towards the development of CSS, changed. Rather than focusing on different versions, they now
12

13
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.720
split up CSS into a couple of modules which are organized by the feature they cover.
13

14
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:06.530
So things like modules on coloring text, modules which focus on shadows, modules which focus on
14

15
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:13.460
animations. We've got different versions of these modules and new modules and module versions are
15

16
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.400
continuously added in the future,
16

17
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.170
simply to keep up with modern developments and to keep CSS dynamic.
17

18
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.760
Here's an overview of the different working groups and their results, who are working on improving
18

19
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.590
CSS and developing new features.
19

20
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.360
Now please don't read through all of that,
20

21
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.420
we will cover the important features in this course in great depth.
21

22
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.110
The important takeaway for you is that CSS simply keeps evolving,
22

23
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:44.090
it still is under active development and we will see new and improved features in the future too, simply
23

24
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.720
to keep up with the general evolving nature of web development itself.
