00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:08.680
So let's work on the form elements styling; on the dropdown, the inputs here and the checkbox.

2
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.760
Now how does that work?

3
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:19.840
Let's start with the dropdown and the normal inputs. For that, I'll go to my code, to my CSS code here

4
00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:26.620
and before we style the button but after the checkbox styles let's say, it's up to you where you position

5
00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:35.420
it though, I'll add a style where I target signup-form and the inputs in that form, as well as the

6
00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:41.810
select elements because these are the kinds of inputs we're using here on our page and there, I want

7
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.330
to restyle them.

8
00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.120
I'll start with the border, which I'll set to 1 pixel solid and a light grey,

9
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.750
so #ccc is the hex code for a light grey-ish 

10
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:59.680
look. I also want to give them some padding, let's say .2rem to top and bottom and .5rem to left

11
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.610
and right

12
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.880
and if we save that, we can see a slight change, right,

13
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.310
so not for the select element but for these inputs.

14
00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:15.130
Now one thing we can also see if we type in there is that if you watch closely, the font seems to be

15
00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.330
a different one,

16
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.470
it's not the same font as we use on the rest of the page,

17
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.640
also it's too small.

18
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.590
So we want to use the same font of course and we can achieve this by adding font: inherit to tell

19
00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.800
it

20
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.320
it should not use the browser defaults, which we can see if we select it before reloading the page,

21
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:42.250
there we can see that the browser sets various text styles, more about text in the next module

22
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:48.420
by the way but we want to use our defaults for the text and for the font.

23
00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.320
So by setting font: inherit on these elements, if I save that and reload,

24
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.970
now our elements increased a bit in size

25
00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:02.200
and now when we type there, we get the same font family as on the rest of the page, which of course is

26
00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.050
what we want probably.

27
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.820
Now regarding the dropdown, it clearly looks a bit different than the other elements

28
00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.310
and we will change some of the stylings there but you should keep in mind that the dropdown, the select here

29
00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:22.210
of course is a special element where you actually want to use the browser defaults in many cases because

30
00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.550
you want to have these arrows on the right,

31
00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:30.850
you want to have that built-in behavior of getting that dropdown list without needing to write any custom

32
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.210
Javascript code.

33
00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.890
That is why I will stick to the defaults we got here, at the end of this module however, you find an article

34
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:46.360
where you also find various links to resources, where you can dive deeper into restyling even built-in

35
00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:47.460
elements a bit more

36
00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.270
and that being said, we will restyle that checkbox together in this module.

37
00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.090
So we'll leave the select as it is for now,

38
00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.440
we'll leave the inputs here as they are,

39
00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:06.970
however I'm not so happy about that blue border here and this border actually turns out to not be a

40
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.490
border. If we select an input like this one and we click here in the developer tools, on that

41
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.830
:hover thing here, we can trigger a certain pseudo selector

42
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:22.750
and in this case for input element, that's the focus selector. If I trigger this here, you see the focus

43
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.290
style as it appears when you click in there

44
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.750
but now all the time even if your mouse is outside of there.

45
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.860
So this is now our focus style

46
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:38.560
and with that triggered, if we scroll down, we can see that for this being focused, we got an outline

47
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.420
here, a

48
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.610
webkit-focus-ring-color-auto outline.

49
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:44.880
Now what is an outline, is

50
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.820
this the same as a border? An outline is kind of comparable to a border

51
00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.930
but there are some crucial differences,

52
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:59.140
for example the outline always comes after the border, so you can have both, it's added outside of the

53
00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.920
border.

54
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.690
It's not counting towards the box size

55
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.630
and it also is not doing anything on the box shadow,

56
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.620
so if you have a big outline, this won't affect your box shadow for example.

57
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:19.090
So outline is a great tool to mark that this has been focused but I want to change the way we do that

58
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.400
actually still.

59
00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:27.960
So what I'll add after my selectors here is another rule where I target signup-form input

60
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:36.010
and now with :focus, I target the focus state and the same for the select element.

61
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:41.770
Now I want to set a different style when we focus this and I'll actually set the outline to none, though you

62
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:48.400
could of course also use a different color here and I'll change instead the background color of these

63
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:54.100
elements, I'll change to a very light grey which has the hex code

64
00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.990
#d8f3df and I'll change the border color,

65
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.180
we do have a border,

66
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.700
keep that in mind I just want the change of color now,

67
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.710
to the green we're using on our page already.

68
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:15.240
So this green color which we also have in our shared folder in the navigation bar for example as a background,

69
00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.990
this here,

70
00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:18.640
this is the hex code

71
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:24.780
I also want to use here as a border color. With that if we save that and reload it, if I click in there,

72
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:30.570
now we get a different look and actually this is no light grey, excuse me, it's a light green of course,

73
00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.030
should fit the border.

74
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.060
So now we have that look, also for the dropdown

75
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:41.100
whenever we target these elements, fits the rest of our page a bit better and green always looks positive

76
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.450
I guess.

77
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:50.700
So with that, we made some work on restyling these inputs, we ensured that they use our general font and

78
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.060
that we can manipulate their styles,

79
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:56.830
of course you can do to them whatever you want to do.

80
00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:06.690
Now I also want to restyle the checkbox though and for that, if we select the checkbox, we see that actually

81
00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:08.940
it already received some styles,

82
00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:15.280
we already target it with our signup-form input styles and we're setting a border padding and font,

83
00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:22.620
it's just not doing anything because that clickable text box thingy here is something special in our

84
00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.160
browser in the end and we'll work on that.

85
00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:27.600
Now we will work on it in the next lecture.
