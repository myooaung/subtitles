Welcome to this module. In this module, we'll dive into how we can actually transform HTML elements

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,660
with the help of CSS. To be precise,

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:20,200
we'll dive into how we can rotate, move, skew or scale elements and also how we can apply 3D transformations.

00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:27,450
So not just use two dimensions but actually create a 3D effect, all with the help of CSS only.

5
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,460
