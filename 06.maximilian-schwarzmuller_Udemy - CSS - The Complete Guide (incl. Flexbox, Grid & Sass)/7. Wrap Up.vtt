00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:09.090
So that's it for this module. In the next module, we're going to practice these things. In this module,

2
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.500
we had a closer look at CSS class selectors

3
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.210
again, you learned that you can use more than one on the same element.

4
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.870
We had a look at how we can chain selectors by adding them directly after each other

5
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.150
and you learned the class selectors are the most used type of CSS selectors due to their flexibility

6
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.550
and that they're really built for CSS.

7
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:36.610
We had a brief look at important and the core message here, is don't use it unless in very unlikely

8
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.190
edge cases

9
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.060
and we had a look at pseudo selectors and mostly at not here.

10
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.490
You learned about pseudo selectors in the last module already and you should explore other possibilities

11
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.820
with the help of MDN but not can be interesting, though

12
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.650
I did warn you that in general, you should try to write the positive case instead of using not. And last

13
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.470
but not least, don't forget about checking browser support when using a certain feature.
