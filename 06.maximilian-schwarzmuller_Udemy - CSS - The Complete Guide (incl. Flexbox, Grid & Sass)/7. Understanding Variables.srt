00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:03,940
Ok, the last one was a quick one,

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,140
nested properties can be really useful.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,900
Super useful are variables though,

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:15,400
now what are variables? Now variables allow us to define a certain value and reuse it throughout our

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,030
code,

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,920
for example that color here. This color, this exact color is getting used a lot

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,640
as you can see, here

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,340
we use it quite a lot in our code.

9
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:32,930
Now if we define it like this and we ever decide we want to use a different color, we have to go to all

10
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:37,750
these places in our code and manually adjust it, which is not super comfortable.

11
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:44,690
So what we can do typically at the top of the file, we can define a so-called variable, a feature which

12
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:47,670
is also available in next gen

13
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:55,340
CSS, you learned about CSS variables already but which is also available here in SCSS and when using variables

14
00:00:55,340 --> 00:01:02,540
in SCSS, you of course have the great benefit that it will be compiled to code which does not use CSS

15
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,140
variables,

16
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,240
so which will run in all browsers and not just in more recent ones.

17
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:13,600
So this is a great way of using variables without having to support cutting edge browsers only. You define

18
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,920
a variable by adding a dollar sign, that always has to be the first character and then the name of your

19
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:26,720
variable, maybe main color and then you simply add a colon and the value you want to store,

20
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:33,210
in my case the hex code, #521751, that is the color we're using everywhere.

21
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,460
Now with this saved here, we can use that variable in our file.

22
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:41,740
Now by the way, you can in general store as a value here for the variable

23
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:49,500
what you can use as a value in CSS, so you could also store center or something like 1rem, whatever

24
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,640
you plan to do with that variable.

25
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,390
Now in my case here, I want to use a color,

26
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,180
so I will store a color.

27
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:01,930
Now we can grab that variable name, including the dollar sign and replace all the hex code usages here

28
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:06,660
in our SCSS file with that variable name

29
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:12,250
and when this gets compiled, this will simply get replaced with the value of our variable. Again which

30
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,650
whichever value that would be,

31
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,480
of course the value stored should fit to the properties you're using the variable on.

32
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,460
So with that, if we save this and we reload our page, we see the same as before

33
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:30,360
and if we have a look at the compiled code, we also see that the color code is in there which is exactly

34
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,630
what should be the case.

35
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,200
It doesn't use variables in the CSS file,

36
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,000
it uses the real value,

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,530
it just replaces our variables with that value we stored in there.

38
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:45,960
So this can be thought of as a placeholder so to say and that of course is great because it's downward

39
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,490
compatible but actually on our page, we can do more with variables,

40
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:56,860
there are more things we're reusing and you can not just store single values in a variable,

41
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,940
you can also store lists or maps in variables.

42
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,220
So let's have a look at that in the next lecture.
