1
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,160
We're almost done for the module.

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,380
We worked a lot with images in this module,

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:15,340
do you remember? Now one popular form of images or icons is svg for scalable vector graphics.

4
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:20,800
Now svg is a topic for its own, you can dive very deep into it and there are whole courses

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:29,650
diving just into svg graphics. Attached to this video, you find three files for svg graphics we can

6
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:39,210
add to our key features area of our main page. If you go to the main page, I'm talking about these circles

7
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,340
here.

8
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:47,940
Now let's enter the first svg graphic inside of the key feature image container. Simply copy the

9
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,480
svg code into there

10
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:54,670
and yes it's quite a lot but you can use it inline like this, browser support for this

11
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,080
is very decent.

12
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:00,440
Now let's do the same for the two other svgs

13
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,220
you can find attached to this video here.

14
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:08,200
Let's grab the second one and enter into the second key feature image container

15
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:16,760
and let's also do that for the third and depending on your IDE, you can always simply reduce that, so

16
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:25,410
that the content still is there but doesn't occupy your entire HTML file. If you do that and you reload,

17
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:30,340
you see the icons are added but actually they're a little bit too big.

18
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,460
Now you can style svg too,

19
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:36,090
this is exactly what I want to do with you now.

20
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:43,400
However we will not dive into the depths of styling svg because as it turns out, you can even select

21
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:48,180
the svg elements themselves and start styling these.

22
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:54,800
So you could go in there and start styling the colors the svg lines and so on by overwriting that

23
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,600
fill color here,

24
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,350
this is something a bit more advanced and more related to svg than CSS.

25
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:06,270
Therefore what I want to do is I'll go to the main.css file and there

26
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:08,960
let's scroll down to our key feature area.

27
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,720
Now we got that key feature image part here

28
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:20,640
and let's simply add a padding in there of let's say 20 pixels.

29
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:27,160
Now if we do that and we reload, this looks much better. Now to still give you an idea of how you could

30
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:32,590
style svg though, let's use the developer tools and let's select an element here. As you can

31
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:39,860
see, we can select the individual parts of that svg image, for example that orange branch line here.

32
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:44,560
Now as you see, the style here is set with inline styles because I didn't create these svgs on

33
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,180
my own,

34
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:50,290
I got them from an external source and there, they were exported like this.

35
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:56,820
We can still overwrite this, either with the important mark or anyways here in the developer tools

36
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:03,850
and what I want to show you right now is just that we get some extra properties there, most importantly.

37
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:11,650
the fill property which defines how this element is filled but also the stroke property to add an extra

38
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,710
stroke, maybe black.

39
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:19,720
Now you see there's a tiny black stroke around this orange line,

40
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:25,780
you can also add a stroke width property to set it to let's say 10 pixels so that we can clearly see

41
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,620
it here on the left.

42
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:35,140
This is just a brief introduction to how you can styles CSS, fill and stroke are the most important properties

43
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:35,680
there,

44
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:41,960
you could translate them kind of with background color, border color and border width,

45
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:46,960
however if you want to learn more about this, at the end of this module, you'll find an article which

46
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,650
dives a bit deeper into this,

47
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:54,970
again a dedicated svg course is what you should be looking for if you want to dive deeper into styling

48
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:58,050
svgs. For now, this style should do

49
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:02,690
and I have to say I like the look of our page already.

50
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,540
This looks awesome,

51
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:10,210
we greatly enhanced it over the course of this module with all these background styles, with all these

52
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:13,140
images and now also these svgs

53
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:17,950
and with that, I'd say let's just move on and let's keep on improving this project further.
