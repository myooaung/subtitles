1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:08,600
So what can we now do with the viewport height and viewport width? Let's find that out in this lecture

2
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:15,630
but before we do that, let's quickly go once again to the packages.css file because I have to admit

3
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:23,970
I forgot something, I forgot to change the package badge font size because this is still at 12 pixels

4
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:29,010
and this should rather be let's say 0.8 rem,

5
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,010
I think that's the better unit for that.

6
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:38,090
With that change being applied, we can now focus onto the viewport units. For this purpose,

7
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,810
we will go to the shared.css

8
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:47,400
file right here and work on our backdrop again because the viewport height and width units will simply

9
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,750
be placed right here,

10
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:54,010
so the vw viewport width to the width property 

11
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:59,200
and the viewport height will be placed right here at the height property.

12
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,690
Now just adding these letters right here won't help us a lot,

13
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:09,980
we also have to specify the viewport width and let's maybe start with 100 right here and also 100

14
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,420
for the height, like that.

15
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:19,080
If we now comment out our display none decoration right here because the backdrop should not be hidden

16
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:19,730
anymore

17
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,620
and reload the page, we can see that we have our backdrop back on our website,

18
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,960
it behaves as it did before,

19
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,660
you can see it, like this and like that,

20
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,470
so this generally works fine.

21
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:39,560
This is also important to understand before we continue. For the situation we have right here

22
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:47,800
when we added position fixed to our selector right here, then the difference between width 100%

23
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:53,050
or height 100% or adding the viewport units like that is not really there.

24
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,710
As I said in the other video, this is just a different approach to achieve the same result

25
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:04,450
in this case, in a few minutes we'll have a look at another example where we can relate the width and

26
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:10,570
the height of our element to the viewport, although the position property is not set to fixed.

27
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:15,280
So just wanted to make this clear because at the moment, there is no real difference to the previous

28
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,420
solution.

29
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:22,390
However let's have a closer look at that viewport units right here because what happens if I change just

30
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:28,080
now to 80, like that? Well as you might have guessed,

31
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:35,630
now we only have the backdrop covering 80% of the width of our viewport and that's actually what

32
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,910
these numbers basically mean,

33
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,900
it's basically a percentage number.

34
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:44,320
This just indicates that it always refers to the viewport and that's the important difference.

35
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:48,040
We could also apply a height of 50% for example right here

36
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,470
and with that, it would look like that.

37
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,240
So I think the general logic of this viewport unit is clear,

38
00:02:54,260 --> 00:03:01,520
it simply allows us to, as I said, always refer our sizes to the actual viewport no matter which position

39
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,760
property we have right here

40
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:06,500
but there are two more units for this viewport that we can use.

41
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,650
One of these is vmin,

42
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,910
this one right here.

43
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,960
Let's see if this changes a thing,

44
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:17,490
yes we can see now our width became a bit smaller,

45
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,050
what's the reason for that?

46
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:26,320
Well, view min simply takes 80% of the smaller viewport

47
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:32,420
and in our case if we make this bigger, we can see it doesn't increase the width because in our case, the

48
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:40,010
smaller viewport is of course the height, so the height is smaller than our width right here.

49
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:45,560
Now what does this mean? I can increase the width as far as I want because it will always take 80%

50
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:54,040
of the smaller viewport but it's not always 80% of the height because if I reduce that, at a

51
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,820
certain point and that's exactly the point

52
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,100
where the height and the width are equal

53
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:08,410
and now the width right here, the width of the viewport becomes smaller than the height and because of

54
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:08,820
that,

55
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:13,660
now it jumps to taking 80% of the viewport width.

56
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:14,960
Let me repeat that,

57
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:21,370
now we have 80% of the viewport width because the viewport width is smaller,

58
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:26,450
so this viewport is smaller than the height.

59
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:35,200
As soon as the height becomes smaller than the width which is right now, can you see it, at this point,

60
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:41,530
the backdrop doesn't increase anymore because it now takes 80% of the smaller distance which

61
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:44,040
in that case is the height.

62
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:51,040
Now in addition to view min, we also have view max which as you can imagine simply works the other

63
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,540
way around,

64
00:04:51,550 --> 00:05:00,680
so if I reload, we can see that the width increase because now we take 80% of the larger distance

65
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,470
between the width and height of the viewport.

66
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:10,590
So right here, it keeps increasing because our width is a lot bigger than the height

67
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:16,760
but as soon as the height becomes bigger then the width, as you can see, it doesn't move anymore because

68
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,620
the height is now a constant value,

69
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:25,310
we don't change it so it always takes 80% of the height without any adjustment of the backdrop

70
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:26,940
and that's it actually

71
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:36,710
regarding this shared.css file, I will change this back to 100 viewport width and 100 viewport height

72
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:39,410
because this is actually what we need right here.

73
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:46,280
As you can see right here, it looks fine but with viewport height, viewport width and especially with

74
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:54,530
view min and view max, you can easily create such overlaying elements basically and stick them to the viewport.

75
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,040
Now talking about stitching them to the viewport,

76
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:02,880
let me quickly comment this in again and reload the page

77
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,870
and let's now stop working on the backdrop,

78
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:12,440
let's now have a quick look at our picture right here because if we go to our main.css file now,

79
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:19,100
we can see that we defined the height of this image with 528 pixels,

80
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,040
so this height right here.

81
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:31,790
Now as we are not the biggest fans of such values and the image actually always can refer to the viewport,

82
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,810
I don't think that's a big problem,

83
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:38,190
why don't we just change the pixel value to a viewport unit? 

84
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:42,130
The only question is, which one should we take?

85
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:49,260
Well I would say we use vh, so the viewport height but which number should we add?

86
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:57,430
Well as we saw, the image has 528 pixels height and our HTML elements, so every everything we see right here,

87
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,170
here has 1600 pixels height,

88
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:08,040
well I would say that maybe 33% of the viewport height might be a good value for that.

89
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:10,220
Let's see what this looks like.

90
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:15,850
We can see that our image is now smaller and to be honest, I prefer this look,

91
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:20,530
the problem though is that it's a little bit well far down now, so

92
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,490
I would like to see a bit more of the top of the image,

93
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:28,430
so let's quickly jump back and work on the background image,

94
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,270
let's change bottom to maybe 60%,

95
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,330
let's see what this looks like.

96
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:33,730
Yes

97
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:39,080
almost, not totally happy, let's say 70% maybe even because I would like to see this woman a bit

98
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,540
more,

99
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,540
yes I think this looks cool,

100
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:45,080
this has this kind of freedom-like look that we want to have,

101
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:53,690
so this definitely improved our website and actually, we could also change the width to 100vw, like

102
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:58,520
that because why shouldn't we do it the same, right here? If we do that,

103
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,510
nothing changes

104
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:04,340
but now both units refer to the viewport, like that

105
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,230
and I think this looks pretty cool now.

106
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:12,980
What we also saw is that although the position property of this background image was position relative

107
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:20,900
and as you learned, position relative, so the units of these elements do not refer to the viewport, just

108
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:26,860
by adding vw and vh, we were able to simply change this behavior

109
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,620
and because of that, easily adjust our image according to the viewport.

110
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:36,260
With that, we could actually conclude vh and vw

111
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,380
but unfortunately there is one

112
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:42,340
little downside regarding this unit.

113
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:49,760
If we go again to caniuse.com and look for example for vh, we can see that browser support

114
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,010
is generally pretty good

115
00:08:52,250 --> 00:09:00,500
but for the Internet Explorer 11 right here, there is only a partial support. The partial support

116
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:05,800
luckily only refers to the vmax unit which is not supported,

117
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:10,840
so the vh, vw and vmin units are supported,

118
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:18,680
therefore the issue is not the biggest one but having a look at caniuse.com before using a

119
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,490
specific unit is definitely a good idea

120
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:28,490
and let's keep in mind that using position fixed for example in combination with percentage values for

121
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:31,730
width and height is always a good alternative.

122
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:38,360
The problem now is though that you might still be confused and you might not be sure which unit

123
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,300
to use in connection with which property

124
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:45,820
and I think this is something we should have a closer look at in the next lecture.
