00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:09.730
So let's start with the most important question first, what is CSS? CSS stands for
1

2
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:10.420
Cascading Style Sheets
2

3
00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.080
and I'll come back to this name and why it's called 'Cascading'
3

4
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.620
later in the course; once we know a bit more about it from a technical perspective.
4

5
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.690
But the core idea behind CSS is that it makes your web page look good.
5

6
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.650
Your web page typically consists of
6

7
00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:27.360
HTML,
7

8
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:32.320
this is how you structure your web page, this is how you add content and show content on your web page.
8

9
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.070
HTML is absolutely required,
9

10
00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:42.820
there are no web pages without HTML. CSS on the other hand is optional, because CSS allows you to
10

11
00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.100
style that HTML content.
11

12
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:52.100
It allows you to add colours, shadows, all kinds of visual effects, position elements differently,
12

13
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:59.700
so basically it allows you to turn your boring HTML page into an exciting and good looking website.
13

14
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.110
Let's have a look at this and let's see exactly what CSS can do for us.
14

15
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.260
Attached to this video,
15

16
00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.860
you'll find a zip file which contains a HTML file, a CSS file and an image.
16

17
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.700
If you double-click that HTML file, simply double-click it, it will open up in a browser and you will
17

18
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.860
see this.
18

19
00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.240
Now this is a fully-functional web page,
19

20
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.010
it simply contains just HTML, but all the content is there and 
20

21
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.270
if we were a user, even though it doesn't look good, we could still use it, we could work with
21

22
00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.160
it and we understand what the website is trying to tell us.
22

23
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.830
However, we want it to look better and that is where the CSS file comes into play. In your HTML code,
23

24
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.250
and here I opened it with Visual Studio Code which is the IDE I will use in this course. You can open it
24

25
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.040
with any text editor on your operating system,
25

26
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.700
just make sure you open it as plain text but you may also use any favorite IDE you have.
26

27
00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.050
So if you open that file, this is the HTML code you'll see,
27

28
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.410
now let's add some CSS to it and
28

29
00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:02.710
conveniently, I've already provided you with that CSS file in the code.css file which also is
29

30
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.210
part of the zip file.
30

31
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.310
There you'll see a bunch of things you probably don't know yet and we'll walk through all these things
31

32
00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.260
in detail throughout the course.
32

33
00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:18.010
Now let's include that file by simply copying all the content in there, going back into the HTML file
33

34
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.310
and in the head section, right before it's closed,
34

35
00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.650
you add the style element, so simply opening and closing style tag.
35

36
00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:33.280
Now between these two tags, copy in the content from the other CSS file, save the HTML file, go
36

37
00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.800
back to your browser and reload. This is exactly what CSS all about,
37

38
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.850
doesn't this look much better?
38

39
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:41.650
It does
39

40
00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.740
and this is exactly why you use CSS. This now does not only contains the content but it's also
40

41
00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.280
way more pleasant to the eye.
41

42
00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.300
So we'll learn all about this throughout the course
42

43
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.430
and with that, let's learn a bit more about what exactly CSS is and where it's coming from.
