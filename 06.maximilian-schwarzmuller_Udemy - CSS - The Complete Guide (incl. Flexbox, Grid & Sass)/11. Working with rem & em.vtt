00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:05.310
So let's understand em and for now,

2
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.120
em and rem are units which are calculated based on the font size.

3
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.360
Now what does this mean?

4
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:19.310
Well back on our customers page, we already learned that if we go to our settings right here, that the

5
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:26.840
user can change the font size, for example to very large, like that. If we go back to our page, we saw that

6
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.370
the nav bar font size increases but the text right here stays the same.

7
00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:38.720
This is simply due to the fact that our testimonial class, this one right here, has a font size applied,

8
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.840
a font size property by us of 20 pixels.

9
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.910
This means, let me change it back again to the

10
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.640
recommended one, the default value, the default font size that the nav bar gets smaller again

11
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.810
but right here, our class doesn't change because we have this font size applied.

12
00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:04.680
That's the first issue we have actually because I said that already in one of the earlier lectures, if our user,

13
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.310
our website visitor wants to increase the font size, well we should allow him to do this,

14
00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.580
therefore definitely something we have to improve.

15
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.650
However, let's dive a bit deeper into this class now

16
00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:24.170
because inside this class we have the image container but that's not really a font size topic right now

17
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:32.020
but this testimonial info class right here, this one, this one also has a font size probably, as we

18
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.350
can see it inherits the font size from the testimonial class,

19
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.760
so basically the font size also is 20 pixels right here.

20
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.690
We talked about inheritance in general,

21
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.850
so this is probably clear.

22
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:51.490
However if I look at the different elements inside our class here, these are not equally sized to be honest

23
00:01:51.880 --> 00:02:02.430
because if we select this h1 element right here, we can see that the inheritance didn't work,

24
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.520
we can see it right there,

25
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.860
it was overridden but there was a font size of 2em applied.

26
00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.740
This was applied by the browser because it's an h1 element, a special element and therefore the Chrome

27
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.940
browser added this 2em font size to it.

28
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.460
Now what is 2em in pixels now?

29
00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.970
Let's go to the computed tab,

30
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:30.850
here we can untick that show all tab and if we then go down, we can see something really interesting here

31
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:39.620
because the font size applied for this h1 element is 40 pixels and this is, sorry for that,

32
00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.700
and this is based on the 20 pixels initially that we define from the testimonial class

33
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.070
but this is stroke through here because the 2em is applied. Now

34
00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.800
but if I take 20 pixels times 2, then I got 40 pixels,

35
00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.890
so there seems to be some kind of calculation related to these em units.

36
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.230
So let's keep that in mind and let's have a look at another element,

37
00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.680
the h2 elements right here because there in general, it would be the same behavior.

38
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:16.270
We also have this 1.5em but we also define a font size of 18 pixels,

39
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.780
therefore this is the value that is applied 

40
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:25.790
but if I unselect this value now, then you can see that 1.5em gets active

41
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:32.690
and if we again go to computed right here, you can see that now we have 30 pixels

42
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.770
and interestingly, it's again 20 pixels times 1.5,

43
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.370
well this results in 30.

44
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:49.000
So again, we see that em is calculated based on the actual size of our element which is inherited from

45
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.900
the parent and then multiplied by this factor right here,

46
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.970
so we are diving deeper and deeper into em now. Let's have a look at the paragraph, at the last

47
00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.790
element inside our testimonial info class right here.

48
00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.140
This paragraph doesn't have any font sizing applied,

49
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:13.110
it simply inherits the font size of 20 pixels of our testimonial class.

50
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:21.480
So we have a nice mixture of a fixed font size for our container here, for our testimonial class,

51
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:25.660
then we have testimonial info is which also inherits 20 pixels

52
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.110
and then we have these em values for h1 and h2

53
00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.660
and we have p where we define a font size, for h2

54
00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.120
we also define the font size,

55
00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.010
sorry for that.

56
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:39.720
So how can we now make this font size a bit more dynamic?

57
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.020
Because let me first reload the page.

58
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:48.850
We still have the problem that if we changed the font size right here as we did before, we don't have

59
00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.850
any impact though on to our text right here

60
00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.740
and this should definitely change.

61
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.400
Now for that, we have different ways to approach this issue.

62
00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:03.730
The easiest one would be to simply say ok, why don't we just change the font size right here,

63
00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.770
this 20 pixels, to this em we just saw

64
00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:13.010
because em apparently multiplies a value and by that, seems to be more dynamic.

65
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.880
So let's do that by going to the customers.css file

66
00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:25.480
and now change the font size of 20 pixels to let's say 1.2em because we saw that 1em is apparently equal

67
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:34.600
to 16 pixels, so 1.2 seems to be a nice approximation. Let's do that, like this and reload the page. As you

68
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:41.390
can see, it's slightly smaller but if I inspect that class right now and so the testimonial class and go to

69
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:46.900
computed, we can see that we have a font size of a 19.2 pixels,

70
00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.710
this is basically 16 pixels times 1.2

71
00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:56.760
and as the 16 pixels is actually specified by our browser settings, right here

72
00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:03.480
and if we go to very large with that, we can see that the font size also increases because now we have

73
00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:09.660
28.8 pixels which is 24 pixels times 1.2.

74
00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:15.390
Now with that, things got a bit more dynamic, let's change it back to the initial value though,

75
00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:23.100
like that. The problem still is that we don't have the entire control of all our elements,

76
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:28.790
the h1 element for example still has the font size applied by the browser.

77
00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:35.800
So let's also change that by going to the testimonial name class which we have right here and now apply

78
00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:40.150
such a font size of 2em right here.

79
00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:47.230
If we do that and reload the page, nothing changes but now we are the ones who define that 2em should

80
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:47.970
be applied,

81
00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:53.520
so it's not depending on the browser anymore but we are the ones who specify this code. For the h2

82
00:06:53.620 --> 00:07:00.910
class, we have this font size of 18 pixels and that's not what we want right because we want to

83
00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:02.670
make things dynamic,

84
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:07.780
this means if we keep it the way it is right now and we increase the font size to large again in the

85
00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:16.010
browser, we can see that the founder of techanalysis.com text remains at 18 pixels, so not

86
00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:17.160
the best thing to do,

87
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:24.000
so let's also change that to medium like that and work on the testimonial subtitle class,

88
00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:26.750
this is the class right here

89
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:33.470
and let's change this font size to 1.1em maybe because we saw 1em if we have the default browser

90
00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:37.920
size of 16 pixels is close to 18 pixels.

91
00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:41.230
If we reload that, we see it's slightly bigger,

92
00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:42.890
let's see why.

93
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:44.960
Now what's that issue?

94
00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:52.610
This is strange right because I actually said that it's 1.1em, so the normal size times 1.1 but now it's

95
00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:53.440
too big.

96
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:57.730
Well that's basically the problem of em, as we can see right here

97
00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:04.370
em inherits the previous sizes and by that multiplies the em with the previous em.

98
00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:05.880
Now what do I mean by that?

99
00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:09.220
We have the 16 pixels defined in the browser,

100
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:14.200
in our testimonial class, we specified 1.2em,

101
00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:19.800
this means we already have a font size of 19.2 pixels.

102
00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:26.360
Now this value then also gets inherited by our testimonial-subtitle class

103
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:35.270
and then again multiplied by 1.1 which leads to our 21.12 pixels, the 1.5 right here are not taken

104
00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:39.640
into account because as we can see, h2 and h1 are neighbors,

105
00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:45.480
so the inheritance takes place between h1 and this div with the class, testimonial info

106
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:51.230
and because of that, you can quickly get into trouble by having lots and lots of ems and all that inheritance

107
00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.210
and multiplications

108
00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:57.070
and to make it short, this can quickly become a mess.

109
00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.530
This doesn't mean that you shouldn't use em at all,

110
00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:07.550
it can be helpful if you have a specific use case but you want to define the font size of specific parts

111
00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:10.130
of your website with these em units,

112
00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.770
so I don't want to tell you never use em,

113
00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:20.990
I just want to tell you be careful right here because there is another approach which helps us to avoid

114
00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:23.270
exactly these issues

115
00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:33.060
and this is the rem units because if we now simply go back to our code and change 1.1em to 1.1rem and reload

116
00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:41.420
the page, then you can see that the font size right here of our h2 class looks a lot better

117
00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:46.890
and the reason for that is simply that now we have a font size of 17.6 pixels.

118
00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:47.990
Why is this happening?

119
00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:53.870
Well because the only calculation that is done right now is the code is told to do the following,

120
00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.390
just take the font size that is set by the browser settings,

121
00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:07.650
so 16 pixels in our case and multiply it with 1.1 because rem, the r in rem stands for root.

122
00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:14.680
So we always go back to the root element of our website which is the HTML element and with that, the browser

123
00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.770
default which defines the size for that root element,

124
00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:22.400
in all cases where you don't change this default behavior, I showed you how this works

125
00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:29.440
and as the font size always depends on this browser settings, the user has the full control of the

126
00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.860
size he wants to have on his website

127
00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:39.410
and we can simply specify all our sizes, our font sizes for example based on this rem value.

128
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:46.520
This means we can also go back now and change the 2em for the testimonial name to 2rem,

129
00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:50.350
this means two times the size of the element,

130
00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:57.950
so 16 pixels in our case and also change it right here for the font size of the testimonial class to

131
00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:58.800
1.2rem.

132
00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:04.860
If we now reload, we can see the page looks basically the same way it did before

133
00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:13.740
and if we now change our font size right here, like that, you can see that all elements inside our testimonial

134
00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:14.190
class

135
00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:19.340
now change the font size depending on the settings of the user.

136
00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:23.540
And that's actually the cool thing about rem,

137
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:28.090
you can easily specify the font size or also other sizes of course,

138
00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:30.590
it's not restricted to fonts only,

139
00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:36.450
the important thing to keep in mind though is that rem and em always refer to the font size,

140
00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:39.950
that's the basic size value that they take into account 

141
00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:43.690
but you can also use rem for margins for example,

142
00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:44.990
we'll see how this works.

143
00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:51.930
But with that rem approach, you really got a powerful tool to make your fonts more flexible and make

144
00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:58.110
it easier for the user to display the website the way he prefers it to be displayed.

145
00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:04.440
There used to be one downside of rem though, as rem is a rather new approach,

146
00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:12.830
the browser support wasn't the best but if we go to caniuse.com again, right here and now enter rem,

147
00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:21.450
well you can see that browser support in the more recent versions of all modern browsers is pretty decent,

148
00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:29.730
therefore rem is a really nice unit to use if you want to change your font size and also other properties,

149
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.570
I'll dive into that in the next lectures

150
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:40.080
and with that, we could actually use that new knowledge we gained now and apply it to our customers page

151
00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:43.440
because we have more than these few font sizes

152
00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:45.010
we changed up here now.
