1
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:10,170
So with the new code added, the first thing I want to do is I want to turn this text here into a text

2
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,210
which looks exactly like choose your plan.

3
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:14,990
Now you know how to do that, don't you?

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,180
So definitely try it on your own,

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,960
here's your chance to pause the video and then we'll do that together.

6
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,850
So were you successful? In the end,

7
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,780
we got everything prepared already.

8
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:33,830
If we scroll up to our plans section here, we see that there we have that section title class on the

9
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,290
first h1 element.

10
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:40,090
So we can just copy that class assignment and add it to this h1 tag too,

11
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,780
that's the power of classes,

12
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:45,590
we can reuse them. If we now reload the page,

13
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:50,430
we get the same look as for the other section title for this one too.

14
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:56,950
Now the plan is to turn this boring bullet point list into a way more appealing

15
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,910
layout and for that, I

16
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:07,410
first of all want to have a strong background color for my section here. So to achieve that, what we can

17
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:10,560
do is we can assign an ID to that section,

18
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,860
that ID could now be any ID of your choice,

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,120
I will name it the key-features because I'm highlighting the key features of the app here.

20
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:28,740
We can now use that selector in our CSS file below the button here maybe, use it with a hashtag

21
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,340
because it's an ID that we need the ID selector

22
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:41,710
and there, I'll assign a background color which is this reddish color we used before, a strong red color.

23
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:46,150
If we save that and reload,

24
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:48,050
now we got this look.

25
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:51,430
The green probably doesn't fit as well anymore,

26
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,940
so we need to change that color a bit

27
00:01:54,100 --> 00:02:00,160
and for that let's now use that hashtag selector again, key-features and let's target the section titled

28
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,570
class with that descendant combinator,

29
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:09,580
you could also use to direct child combinator as a side note because the element with the second class

30
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:17,590
is a direct child but I'll use the descendant here and I'll set the color to white then. I also will add a

31
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:25,600
little bit more margin here, maybe 32 pixels and I want to add a little bit more margin to the top, to

32
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,960
my key features here,

33
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:36,130
so margin top could be something like maybe 80 pixels, so really a lot of space to the plan section above

34
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:40,750
it and some internal padding, maybe 16 pixels.

35
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:47,920
If we save that and we reload, we got a very different look and I like that look, we have more space to

36
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,950
the plans which looks nice in my opinion

37
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:56,050
and then we also have more space to the section title which also emphasizes the strong color here and

38
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,280
really draws the attention towards this

39
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:01,400
once you reach that point of the page.

40
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:07,560
Now one thing I of course still need to change are these list items here,

41
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:10,760
they're looking super boring and bad.

42
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,830
So let's work on that list in the next lecture

43
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:16,350
and already go ahead and try it on your own.

44
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:23,460
Try turning this boring list into a list where these elements actually sit next to each other rather than

45
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:29,000
below each other and where maybe you already pimped the text a little bit,

46
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,200
make it white, bold,

47
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,260
anything like that.

48
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:36,530
We'll then apply some styles together in the next lecture.
