00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.470
Enough about backgrounds, gradients and images, let's talk about filters.

2
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:07.900
What is a filter?

3
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:13.860
Here is a div element, doesn't have any content but let's say it has some styles that turn it into a

4
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.830
box we can see, by adding a background color,

5
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:17.600
brown maybe

6
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.520
and also width and height, left out here

7
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.140
but let's say it has this, then we would see a box which looks like that.

8
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.690
Now we can add a filter with the filter property and use one of the pre-defined filter functions to change

9
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.600
the look of that element and its content,

10
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.970
for example the blur filter would take a pixel value and would blur the box.

11
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.670
That is what filters are,

12
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.450
they allow us to change the visual appearance of an element by applying a filter, like blurring, grayscale

13
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.720
or changing the contrast. A list of all available filters can be found in the last lecture of this module

14
00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.770
but for now, let's simply see a filter in action. Here I'm on the MDN page for the filter property and

15
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.480
there, you actually see all the available filter functions and how to configure them.

16
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.850
You can easily add shadows, change the brightness or invert the colors, change the opacity with filters,

17
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.690
so therefore filters are a quick and easy way of changing the visuals of something and you can

18
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.640
also apply more than one filter as you can see.

19
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.370
Now let's simply see this in action and let's apply a filter,

20
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:33.060
I want to do this on our packages page, there if you go to our app, packages, we got a background

21
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.070
image already,

22
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.610
now that background image could receive a tiny filter. To see that filter however, I'll

23
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:48.860
first of all change the positioning to center/cover so that we can see more of the image,

24
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.340
Now we see it's actually a quite colorful image with that green plant.

25
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.790
now let's remove some of that color and let's add a tiny grayscale.

26
00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.440
You could of course also blur it

27
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.040
but that might be hard to your eyes in the end.

28
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:10.380
So let's add a tiny grayscale and for that, in the packages.css file on the background class selector,

29
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.800
I'll add the filter property

30
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.060
and here I'll use the built-in grayscale function.

31
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.480
Again you can see a list of all available function in that resource attached to the next lecture or

32
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.900
you find in the next lecture. The grayscale function takes a percentage, defining how much we want to

33
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.320
turn it to grey,

34
00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.480
100% is the maximum.

35
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.310
If we enter that and we reload, we got a fully grayscale image as a background.

36
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.890
We can do that but I don't want to go as far, so maybe 40% looks good here.

37
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:50.870
So if we take 40% and we reload, now we still got some color but it's a little bit more grayish

38
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:57.030
and of course feel free to play around with that and possibly add more filters to other parts of this

39
00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.630
app if you want to.

40
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:05.760
This is how easy you can use the filter property, as you can see, really not that difficult to use.

41
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.220
Now one important word about compatibility,

42
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.950
if you scroll down to the end of that MDN article about the filter where you see plenty of examples

43
00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:21.740
by the way, if you do scroll down to the very bottom, you'll see the browser compatibility and there, you

44
00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:27.210
see that basic support for filters is missing in Internet Explorer,

45
00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.220
it's available in Edge but not in the Internet Explorer.

46
00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.820
So if you still have to support that, you might not be able to use filter

47
00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:43.490
or you have to use a polyfill or implement some other fallback or only use filter in cases where

48
00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:49.040
it doesn't matter if it doesn't get applied, where it just enhances the look but doesn't do something

49
00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.360
it absolutely depends on.

50
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:57.740
So this is the filter property, browser compatibility is something to keep in mind but other than that,

51
00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:58.780
it's awesome.
