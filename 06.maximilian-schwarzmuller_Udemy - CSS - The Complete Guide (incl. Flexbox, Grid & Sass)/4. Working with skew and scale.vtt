00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:07.520
We had a look at rotate and translate thus far to rotate or move the element,

2
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:14.690
we also get two other ways of transforming an element, for that, let's go to the customers page. There

3
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.920
we got our nice customer images and I want to transform these images too.

4
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.990
For that, I'll go into my customers file and in this customers.css file,

5
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:33.590
I want to transform the image container, which should transform the image together with itself.

6
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.320
So here, to the testimonial image container, I'll also add the transform property.

7
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.030
Now we saw that we can use the rotate and translate functions

8
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.170
but now I actually want to skew it,

9
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:50.390
so let's use to skew function for that. The skew function also allows you to skew an element on the

10
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.330
x or y-axis

11
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:58.280
but here if you just use the skew function like this and you only enter one value, you're effectively also

12
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.960
just skewing on the x-axis, so it's the same as skewX.

13
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.530
Now what does this mean to begin with?

14
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.540
Now let's start by entering both and see how it affects the container,

15
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.680
let's just start with skewX and save that and reload

16
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.390
and now you see that our image is skewed to the left,

17
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.190
so it's like someone pulled our corners and pulled them to the left.

18
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.000
This is the case for the image container and the image itself.

19
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.460
If we now also specify skewY,

20
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.960
let's say also 20 degrees here and please note you enter degrees here as a value, not pixel or something

21
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:36.490
like that,

22
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:37.980
it's degrees

23
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.710
and now you reload,

24
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.860
now it's also skewed too on the y-axis.

25
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.010
This becomes even clearer if I temporarily remove skewX here,

26
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.020
now you can see what happened,

27
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.830
it's as if someone pulled the corners up a bit,

28
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.390
so the top left corner got pulled up a bit and the bottom left corner got pulled up a bit.

29
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.810
So for skewX, someone pulled it to the left so to say, for skewY, someone pulls it up

30
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.480
and if you enter negative values, it would be pulled would to the right or pulled down

31
00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.920
and please note, only one corner gets pulled down

32
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:10.810
so to say,

33
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.480
so the element transforms itself into a diamond form, into a rumbus.

34
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.510
Now I don't want to use skewY here,

35
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.040
I want to use skewX and

36
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.320
we can also use just skew here,

37
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.170
if we only enter one value, that'll be the X value, you could enter a Y value here too

38
00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.370
but I just want to have this horizontal skewness.

39
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.380
So now, this is effectively the effect I want to have,

40
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.460
however the image looks really strange if it's skewed like this.

41
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:46.350
It would be great if the container gets skewed but the image actually stays the way it is. Now

42
00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.820
to do that, we can go to the testimonial image selector, which targets the image itself

43
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:59.670
and there, we can also enter transform and enter skew -20 degree,

44
00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:07.310
so with that, we're basically offsetting the skewness of the container. If we do that and we reload, now we

45
00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:13.070
can see the image does not get skewed or basically it does get skewed but we skew it in the opposite

46
00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.920
direction and hence we reset the skewness applied by the container

47
00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:23.360
but of course this is not the final look we want to have. To get that final look,

48
00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.750
we need to do at least two more things;

49
00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.520
first of all, not related to transformation but often used along with it, let's use overflow

50
00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.980
hidden again on the testimonial image container.

51
00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:41.770
This is applied to ensure that the parts where the image goes outside of the container now are cropped.

52
00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.500
So if I reload, it looks better

53
00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.560
but we have this whitespace in a bottom right corner

54
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.120
and for the bottom image, we've got a whitespace on both corners actually,

55
00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.750
it's the same for the top image, I guess.

56
00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.590
So what we can do here is we can increase the size of the image.

57
00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:05.850
So let's go back to our image transformation function where we have skewness of -20 degree

58
00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.100
and let's dive into the last transformation function we have. 

59
00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.360
We saw rotate, translate and skew,

60
00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:19.720
now let's have a look at scale. Scale again allows you to scale the image on three axis,

61
00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:28.130
we'll dive into Z in the 3D transformations part. X allows you to basically increase the width of

62
00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.770
the image and Y allows you to increase the height.

63
00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.210
So here, we enter a normal integer value,

64
00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:37.650
so something like 2,

65
00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.020
this means it is twice the normal size.

66
00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:49.040
So if we save that and we reload, now it's strongly distorted because we stretch it on the x-axis, this    

67
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:55.020
is what scale effectively does, it doesn't keep the aspect ratio. So therefore, we should also set scale

68
00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.510
Y and we can set both

69
00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:03.040
if we just enter scale. Scale with just one value scales it on both axis,

70
00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.110
so on the x and on the y-axis.

71
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.430
So if we enter scale too, like this,

72
00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.020
now this looks better,

73
00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.250
it's a bit too big though,

74
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:16.940
so let's maybe just use 1.2 as a factor, 1 of course would be the default so we don't see the effect

75
00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:17.450
there

76
00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.240
and we can also shrink it with .5 and so on

77
00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.710
but let's use 1.2 here as a scale factor

78
00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.020
and now this looks almost good,

79
00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.020
just a tiny bit to go,

80
00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.110
so maybe 1.4 is what we're looking for

81
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.900
and now, this looks good in my opinion.

82
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:42.540
Now we can see that our images look good and they are now in their newly shaped diamond form.

83
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:47.660
Now one other thing I want to do is I want to change the width of this container,

84
00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:54.790
I want to change it from the 100% we have here to just 60% let's say.

85
00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:01.970
Now if we reload, on mobile view, we can see that new shape a bit nicer, a bit easier,

86
00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.350
it looks nicer now in my opinion.

87
00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:10.850
And with that, we applied our transformations to the images on the customers page too

88
00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:15.960
and now with that more importantly, we also learned about skew and scale.
