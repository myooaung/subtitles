00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:04.390
So the navigation is taking shape,

2
00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.150
let's now work on our brand, doesn't really stand out,

3
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.010
does it?

4
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.780
So back to our code,

5
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.250
I want to change its appearance. For that,

6
00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:20.020
it makes sense to give this anchor tag which holds our brand text a new class and this class could

7
00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:26.590
be main-header__brand or just brand, whatever you want to call it.

8
00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.610
So it's my main header brand

9
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.090
and with that class added, we can of course use the class in the CSS file to give it some extra styling.

10
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.280
Now from a position perspective, I'll add it after this child combinator rule here because that is where

11
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:45.190
I am working with that div that contains the brand and now in there the question just is, how do we style

12
00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.340
that brand?

13
00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.780
Well, let's say we want to remove that underlining we have there by default,

14
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.440
let's say we want to change the color and maybe also the font weight,

15
00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.650
the boldness, turn this to bold text here, that this is bold.

16
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.200
We can do all these things

17
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.730
and let's start with the color. For the color,

18
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:16.040
I prepared another darker green which is #0e4f1f as a hex code,

19
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.630
if we save that, we got this green color. Now the text decoration is still is ugly,

20
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:28.080
so this underlining and we can remove it by adding the text minus decoration property and setting it

21
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.610
to none.

22
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.340
By that, we clear that default style which is set by the browser by the way in case you're wondering,

23
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.710
you can always check that here, text decoration underline is a browser default.

24
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.090
If you now reload this, it's gone because we overwrite it with our own rule

25
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.870
and now let's make this a bit bolder

26
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.470
and for that, I'll add a font weight of bold.

27
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:59.820
Now since we use our default font here which is Monserrat and we're importing a bold version of that

28
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.380
font here, we can use that and bold will work.

29
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:12.210
So with that if we go back and reload, now we got a bold font. This also increase the size of it, so our

30
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.630
other items jump into a new line,

31
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.050
so since we have that hacky approach right now, let's quickly fix that.

32
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.640
We're finding out the width of that, it only increased by a little bit,

33
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:31.900
so we should be fine if we deduct 55 from 100% for main-nav and we are

34
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.900
and now with that, we got our nicer looking brand.

35
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.130
Maybe we also increase the font size which will require us to adjust this again

36
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.230
but let's first of all increase it,

37
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:49.440
let's set the font size maybe to 22 pixels or something like that.

38
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.320
If we reload again, jumps into a new line,

39
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.610
so if we again inspect that, it's now 69 roughly,

40
00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:04.830
so deducting 74, you can always add like 5 to the value you see on the page, should do the trick

41
00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.070
and it does.

42
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.410
So now we got this brand set up here.

43
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:16.820
Now one thing you might notice is that this is not aligned in the middle perfectly anymore.

44
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:23.820
The brand actually looks good because this font size, this height of the brand actually sets the height

45
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.260
of the entire header so to say

46
00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:32.310
but the other text here on the right which is smaller because we don't use font size 22 pixels there,

47
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.620
actually is now aligned to the bottom of the first word, of the brand.

48
00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.100
This can be the behavior you want but here, it actually isn't.

49
00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:49.610
There is another property we can use, we can add it on our nav inline block element,

50
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.170
so the element which sits next to our div holding the brand.

51
00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.150
Let's add it inline here so that we can immediately see the effect,

52
00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.570
it's called vertical align and we can set it to middle.

53
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.920
Now we need to set it on both elements that should be aligned though, not just on the nav but also on

54
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:08.800
the div.

55
00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.940
If we also set middle there,

56
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:17.960
now the div here and the nav should be aligned to each other in their middles.

57
00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.370
Now of course we don't want to do that just in the browser,

58
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:22.240
we want to do that in our code,

59
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.860
so let's target this div and let's say set vertical align middle here,

60
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.180
so that's the div holding our brand

61
00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.940
and let's do the same for main nav of course,

62
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.480
so for main nav, I'll also set vertical align to middle. With these two changes in place,

63
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:40.670
if we now reload,

64
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.990
now this is aligned in the middle again,

65
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.560
cool.

66
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.880
So now we can continue working on these links on the right

67
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.420
and this is another challenge for you.

68
00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.470
Let's dive into it in the next video.
