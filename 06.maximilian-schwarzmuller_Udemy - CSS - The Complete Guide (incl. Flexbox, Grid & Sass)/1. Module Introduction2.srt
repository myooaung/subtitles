Welcome to this module,

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:10,840
so let's dive right into it and let's get started with the basics of CSS. To be precise in this module,

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:18,400
you will learn how you can add CSS to HTML, to really ensure that your page looks good and which

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,230
different options you have when it comes to that.

5
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:25,120
We'll then dive into how you may set up CSS rules,

6
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:32,020
so after you learned how to add CSS, how you actually write CSS code to change something on your

7
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:32,960
page.

8
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:39,010
We'll then dive deeper into selectors, properties and values because these things turn out to be important

9
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,290
when it comes to writing CSS rules

10
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:46,840
and finally, besides a couple of other things that are related to the previous topics, we'll also have

11
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,950
a look at how we can actually resolve conflicting styles.

12
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,400
So a lot to cover, 

13
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,540
let's get started.
