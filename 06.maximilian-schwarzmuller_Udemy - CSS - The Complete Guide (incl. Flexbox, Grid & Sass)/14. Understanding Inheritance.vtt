00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.700
Now that we learned how we can improve our code with the easier media queries,

2
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.500
let's have a look at the inheritance and what this actually means.

3
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.250
Inheritance means that if you got a certain ruleset for a given selector which you also want to

4
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.940
use on a different selector, then you can simply inherit from this selector.

5
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.860
Let me show you how this works.

6
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.090
If you have a look at sass-introduction and sass-details, they're very similar.

7
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.580
Both have a border, border default,

8
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.820
both have this background color,

9
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.660
both have this padding,

10
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.820
both have text align center,

11
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:47.300
both have the width and the box sizing, only the box shadow on the sass-introduction is the difference

12
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.500
and on sass-details, we got that margin.

13
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.680
So what we could do is, we could create a new class of course

14
00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:03.430
which we simply name sass-section where we group all the shared features,

15
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.980
so the text alignment and so on

16
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:14.800
and then the width and the box sizing and also the media query which is the same, like this.

17
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:22.800
Now sass-introduction is just a box shadow, sass-details also can get rid of the first four properties,

18
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.020
we'll leave the margin but we can get rid of the rest.

19
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.700
For this to work correctly, we now just need to ensure that we also add sass-section to the places where

20
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.580
we use sass-introduction and sass-details.

21
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:42.980
So let's go back to the index.html file and let's actually add sass-section to the section class or

22
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:48.900
the section with the class sass-details and to the one with sass-introduction. If we save all files and we

23
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.000
reload the page, we should get the same result as before,

24
00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:00.330
however this now meant that we had to add both classes here. This is a bit error-prone since we can forget

25
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.350
this,

26
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.500
so let's remove this actually

27
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:11.430
and let's go back to main.scss, so an easier way we can use when using SASS is we can inherit

28
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.440
from this sass-section class.

29
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.740
This is done by using the @extend directive as it's called,

30
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.390
this is not a normal CSS feature but a SASS-only feature

31
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.160
and here, we simply define a class from which we want to inherit,

32
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:37.740
in our case, sass-section like this. We do the same in sass-details and if you save this and reload, you

33
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.180
again get the same result as before,

34
00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.920
even though keep in mind, we removed the sass-section here.

35
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:51.220
The reason is that inheritance is the default for us. It created this new ruleset where sass-section,

36
00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:58.840
sass-introduction and sass-details share the same set of common rules and then we got our more specialized

37
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.530
sets of rules for sass-introduction and sass-details.

38
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.390
Now you can do more with inheritance and you can read all about that by clicking on that inheritance

39
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.650
link here

40
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:16.450
but this is of course a very cool feature that ensures that you can easily set up shared styles and

41
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:23.820
use or add them to any other classes you get without manually having to take care that you implement that

42
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.450
shared class in your HTML code,

43
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.400
Instead you keep your specialized classes and simply let SASS do the rest.
