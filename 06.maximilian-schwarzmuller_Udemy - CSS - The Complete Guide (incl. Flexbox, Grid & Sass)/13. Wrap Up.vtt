00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.030
So that's it for the module.

2
00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:09.990
We had a look at CSS animations and you learned that keyframes are an important part of CSS

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.140
animations.

4
00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:17.740
You learned that you can define all animation steps with keyframes, either with from and to or with detailed

5
00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.690
percentage values.

6
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:25.330
I also mentioned that you can animate as many properties and values as you want and also important

7
00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.370
to know, these properties can also differ between the different steps, you can animate whatever you

8
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:31.180
want.

9
00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.930
Some properties won't be animatable though but there, they will just snap to the next value.

10
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:43.210
If you define a timing function on the animation, this timing function will affect how the values

11
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:49.930
are transition between the keyframes defined by you. Nnow that already leads us to the animation property,

12
00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.740
there you defined which keyframe set should be played and over which duration it should be played.

13
00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:02.000
You can optionally add a delay and you can define how often the animation should be repeated,

14
00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.030
if you don't set an iteration count, it will be played only once.

15
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.980
If you've got multiple iterations, you can also define if they should alternate or always start at the

16
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.230
beginning again. With animation fill mode,

17
00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.880
you can also decide if the properties of the last keyframe should be kept after the animation or if the

18
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.260
properties of the first frame should be applied before the animation starts already.

19
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.530
And finally, you also saw that you can listen to animation events with the help of Javascript.
