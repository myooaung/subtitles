00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:07,460
To build a simple grid, attached to this video, you'll find this very simple starting project.

2
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:11,430
Now why am I not working in our main course project?

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,640
We will work on that later in this module again

4
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:22,250
but the CSS grid has so many different properties and features, it would really be forced to put

5
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:28,440
it all into the context of the course project and we would have many distracting side effects.

6
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:33,950
That is why we will work with this simple layout here, where we have a wrapping div and then some child

7
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:38,530
elements which we can use to learn about all the features the grid offers

8
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,600
and then again, we will apply some of these concepts to our course project

9
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:49,340
so that you also see it in action. Now in that main.css file which we're importing, I right now only

10
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:56,300
define a margin on the container to put it a little bit further into the page and have it not sit directly

11
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,910
on the edges of the page

12
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:05,120
and each element, each child element has a distinct background color, so that we can quickly tell them

13
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,620
apart. If we have a look at this page,

14
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,040
this is what it looks like

15
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:17,690
and here I actually opened it in Firefox because Firefox has a very decent CSS grid debugging utilities

16
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:21,580
which make it easier for me to explain it and to show some concepts.

17
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:28,490
So you can of course also use it in Chrome, Chrome supports the CSS grid but Firefox makes learning it and

18
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:32,790
diving into what happens behind the scenes a bit easier.

19
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:35,990
Now that I mention it, Chrome supports the grid,

20
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,930
let's check the general grid support. If we check

21
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:43,840
caniuse.com, we see that modern browsers support the grid pretty well.

22
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:48,660
We do have problems in the Internet Explorer, especially in older version

23
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:54,320
and that's something you have to keep in mind, if you work with the CSS grid, you can't support

24
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,940
older Internet Explorer versions.

25
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:03,880
So if that is something your page needs to support, the CSS grid might not be your first choice, if you

26
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,850
support more modern browsers,

27
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,390
you're definitely free to use it though.

28
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:15,440
With that out of the way, let's dive into our demo project here and let's start turning this into a grid

29
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,130
and then I'll also show you how we can debug it with these

30
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,480
Firefox developer tools.
