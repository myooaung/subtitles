1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:09,540
Let's start with transitions. Transitions are a kind of built-in animation you could say. Transitions are

2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:16,010
added by adding one property, transition and specifying which other property,

3
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,510
like the opacity or the position

4
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,810
of an element should be watched and should be animated

5
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:22,940
if it changes.

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:29,730
So here's an example; we got a box and we actually want to move that towards us with transform and translate

7
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:37,200
set let's say, then we could animate that change. We tell the transition property, and we'll apply it in

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,500
practice in a second,

9
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,650
which properties to change, if there should be a delay,

10
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,030
how should animate it, so

11
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:47,410
over which time and how fast it should move through that time.

12
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:51,750
So should we start fast and end slow, start slow and end fast,

13
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,760
these are all things we can define.

14
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,220
Now that's of course just the theory,

15
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,880
let's dive into this in a concrete example.

16
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:03,090
In our main.css file, we got that modal selector,

17
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,550
now this is obviously responsible for that modal we got on our page.

18
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:12,210
Right now, we're always using display none to not show it,

19
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:19,540
let's actually change this and let's make sure we don't show it by adding opacity zero instead, opacity

20
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,430
zero simply makes it invisible, the difference is

21
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:26,750
it's now still part of the document flow and opacity,

22
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:34,000
unlike display, is a property we can watch with a so-called transition, a list with properties you can

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,310
watch can be found in the last lecture of this module by the way.

24
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:40,910
So opacity zero is how I now want to hide the modal,

25
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:49,120
let's also add a transformation and let's use translateY to move it on the y-axis with -3rem

26
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:49,970
as a value,

27
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:53,140
so this will move the element up by 3rem.

28
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,000
Now you might ask, why am I doing this,

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,720
we're not seeing it anyways?

30
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,900
Well you'll see why

31
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:02,740
and of course you could always move the element up with top but transform is what you should use if

32
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,760
you plan on animating that movement

33
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:08,900
because it is watchable with transition and it's hard where accelerated,

34
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:12,790
it's awesome for animations or for transitions to be precise,

35
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,130
so let's add these two properties to modal.

36
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:20,890
Now the idea is that we change these two properties with Javascript.

37
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:27,040
You remember, earlier in this course, we added code to show the modal when we click on select a plan

38
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,680
by simply adding that open class.

39
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:37,390
Now in that open class if we have a look at this again, we can find it in the shared.css file,

40
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,970
we set display block to important.

41
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:45,370
Now this doesn't really matter anymore because right now for the modal at least, we don't use the display

42
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:48,140
value anymore but we can also still leave it.

43
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:54,550
More importantly, what I want to do here is, I want to set the opacity to one here and use transform

44
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,660
with translateY and set it to zero.

45
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:04,480
Now this simply sets it back to its original position as defined in the document flow.

46
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,280
So when we open the modal, it should be moved to that place.

47
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:13,780
Now just as with block, we need to add important to all of these to overwrite the defaults though.

48
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,190
So let's save all of that,

49
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:21,210
let's go back to our project and reload and now if I click choose plan, we see the modal again. Just as before,

50
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:24,090
there is no animation or anything like that at all

51
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:27,670
but now, we can set up a so-called transition.

52
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:33,760
For this, we go to the main.css file and we add a new property, anywhere in that list of properties

53
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:41,800
as always, which is named transition. Now the transition property is able to take a couple of values, to

54
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,840
be precise,

55
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,310
you can define up to four values here, a list of four values.

56
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:52,350
The first one is absolutely required and that is, which property do you want to watch?

57
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:55,060
You can watch all with the all keyword,

58
00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:00,180
then the transition will be played whenever a transitionable property changes

59
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:09,240
but here, I could also enter opacity and transform as values, so two values separated with a comma

60
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,130
in this case,

61
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:17,120
if you have more than one value, you need to separate them with a comma. You then also define the duration

62
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:23,030
over which you want to play an animation when one of these properties changes or when a property changes

63
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:28,280
and you define that duration directly after the property you're watching,

64
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:36,070
so let's say .5 seconds after opacity. By the way, instead of .5s for seconds,

65
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,890
you could also write 500ms,

66
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,280
this is all supported.

67
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,140
So you can use s for seconds or ms for milliseconds

68
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:50,260
and let's also transform this over let's say 500ms too, maybe it becomes visible faster though,

69
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,420
maybe 200ms.

70
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:58,100
So please note that you set different durations for the different properties you're transitioning over.

71
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:04,250
Of course if you just want to animate one, you would just animate one by simply removing the second one,

72
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:08,300
if you animate more than one, you need to separate the lists with commas though.

73
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:15,680
So this is now defining what we animate and over which time we want to animate or transition to that

74
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,590
new value and CSS will automatically interpolate the value you're coming from,

75
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:26,330
so opacity zero translate -3rem to the value you're going to,

76
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:30,500
so opacity 1, translateY is 0.

77
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:36,790
With that, we can already save this and now reload our page and now if I click 'choose plan',

78
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:42,290
you actually see there's some nice animation and there also is the animation if I close it because it

79
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:48,920
automatically reverses this or plays it in the other directions so to say. In the end, what it does is it simply

80
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:53,270
transitions smoothly from your starting value to your end value

81
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,370
and this is a very easy way of adding a nice looking animation.

82
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:01,340
Now you can add more than just a what and over which duration,

83
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:07,040
you can also add a timing function which allows you how fast it should go through that duration.

84
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:13,290
It'll always take 200ms but you can tell it to start fast and end slow with ease out,

85
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:16,150
now it will become slower towards the end

86
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:20,700
or with ease in for example, it'll start faster.

87
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:27,260
I'll dive deeper into timing functions in a second by the way. So let's use ease out here for the opacity

88
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:34,350
and also for the transformation, so for translate in the end, though this will animate anything you transforme

89
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:38,240
by the way, you can't really filter for just translations here.

90
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:46,530
So now with that, if we reload and I choose plan, not sure if you see it but actually it's now ending slower

91
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:50,830
than it starts. Now last one but not least, you can also set a delay,

92
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,930
you simply add a fourth value like one second,

93
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,730
this would mean it will start one second before it starts with that transition.

94
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,070
So now if I click the button,

95
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,970
nothing happens for one second

96
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:05,620
and then it plays this animation, for some use cases,

97
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,920
this can also be helpful, in this case

98
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:08,780
here, it isn't

99
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,360
so let's get rid of it.

100
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:16,850
This is how you use transitions, you define what you want to watch, over which duration you want to animate

101
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,620
to that new value and how that duration should be used.
