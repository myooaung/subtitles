1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:06,090
So we have generic families and we have font families,

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:07,210
what's the difference?

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:14,390
Well a generic family is something like this, serif or sans-serif.

4
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:20,940
Well as you can imagine, the difference is that serif has a font style which is including serifs and

5
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:21,670
sans-serif,

6
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,500
well it doesn't have sans-serifs but we have more of these generic families,

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,200
we also have cursive.

8
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:32,700
Well I think the name tells you already what that could stand for or why it's called cursive.

9
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,510
We also have Monospace and we have Fantasy,

10
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:44,340
I made Fantasy a bit gray because it's not the most usual generic family you could use, we'll still have

11
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,220
a look at it though

12
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:51,750
but the thing is that these generic families are a kind of a headline which therefore define a specific

13
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:56,310
attribute of the fonts that are inside this generic family.

14
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:05,370
For example, the cursive generic family includes fonts which are cursive and by saying include,

15
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:11,370
this brings us to the font families because that's actually more specific

16
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:17,640
and these are actually the different fonts we have inside our generic family. For serif for example, this

17
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,220
could be Times New Roman or Georgia,

18
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,840
so both are part of this generic family,

19
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:24,890
the serif family

20
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:31,060
and as you can see in the different font families, Times New Roman and Georgia both have these serifs

21
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,350
in them but they look different though.

22
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:37,910
We also have other font families which are part of the sans-serif generic family,

23
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,350
this could be Helvetica

24
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,660
or Verdana, these are of course all just examples,

25
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:46,500
we have a lot more font families for all our generic families.

26
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,220
The thing is that for these fonts, both don't have any serifs.

27
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:57,810
Again as the generic family indicates and that's this general attribute or characteristic these font

28
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:03,510
families which are part of a specific generic family are sharing. For cursive, as we can imagine,

29
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,100
we have this cursive style,

30
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:10,730
well probably not the most beautiful one but still, this is for example Brush Script and Mistral

31
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:16,340
and we have Monospace, so we have Courier New and Lucida Bright and for Fantasy,

32
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:22,720
I didn't get any font families, as I said, it's a pretty uncommon generic family as I would say.

33
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:26,250
Nevertheless, we'll also cover that throughout this module.

34
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,490
So that's the general theoretical background that we need.

35
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:36,120
We have generic families which kind of define a specific core attribute and inside these generic families,

36
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:44,340
we have multiple font families which share this common attribute of course but nevertheless, look different.

37
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:47,360
So that's the first theoretical introduction,

38
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:54,620
let's now go to our browser and see if we can find such generic families and font families in there.
