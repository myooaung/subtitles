00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:07.410
So with the plans looking nice, it's now time to continue right here,

2
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:15.280
so in this red part right here with our key features and the cool thing is that this will become your

3
00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:22.040
challenge because your goal is to change the way these key features are displayed.

4
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.220
The desktop version is fine actually,

5
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.730
so everything should actually remain the way it is.

6
00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.580
The problem starts right here in the mobile version because right there, I don't want to have these images

7
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.750
and the corresponding text being displayed next to each other but below each other.

8
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.150
So we will start with this image and this text, then we'll have this image and that text

9
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.110
and the last one, that's the pattern.

10
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.170
So it basically should follow the logic we had for our plans,

11
00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:57.670
so one after each other. For that, you actually only need media queries of course and you need to change

12
00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.320
the key feature class right here,

13
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.600
this one and the key feature list class, that's everything.

14
00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:07.150
So try it on your own,

15
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.930
I can tell you that you won't need any properties or any features we didn't use so far throughout the course,

16
00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.050
so you should be able to solve it.

17
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:21.700
So try it and you can now pause the video and after this break and after you tried it, I will show

18
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.370
you one way how to solve this issue,

19
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.260
good luck.

20
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.490
So how was it,

21
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.260
could you solve the challenge?

22
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.180
Let me show you my solution.

23
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.140
As I said, we have to work on the key feature list and on the key feature classes

24
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.060
and the problem is that these items are displayed horizontally and they should be displayed vertically.

25
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.840
Now if we go to our code, to the key feature class right here, we see the issue for that, 

26
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:56.630
it's basically display inline block, the same problem we had when we wanted to have our plans to be

27
00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.120
displayed like that.

28
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.350
So let me quickly comment that out now because we will need the code later for the

29
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.460
desktop version

30
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:10.390
and with that if we go back, we can see that our elements are now displayed vertically already.

31
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.680
So this is already looking good

32
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.630
but the problem still is that these elements are not centered now

33
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.520
but we can quickly solve this because the only thing we have to do right now is we have to get rid

34
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.920
of this 30% width.

35
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.970
Let me comment that out because we will need it later also for the

36
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.290
desktop version.

37
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.640
And with that, if we reload the page,

38
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.420
this works perfectly for all our mobile sizes now,

39
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:37.530
so this looks good.

40
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.220
The problem is that this is only the mobile part

41
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.410
now of course, in the desktop version,

42
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.080
we have the same look and we don't want that,

43
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:52.540
we want to have our initial desktop look back. For that, we know how this works

44
00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.050
in the meanwhile, we only have to add a media query and let's add it maybe again right here.

45
00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:07.840
So we write @media, open the bracket and define our well-known min width of 30rem, like that and open

46
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.470
the curly braces.

47
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:16.810
Now the thing we have to change right now for the desktop version is of course our key feature right

48
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:17.100
here,

49
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.390
so let's copy the enter code, right here and paste it.

50
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.460
We don't need to change vertical align,

51
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.800
that's totally fine, that can be kept like that

52
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:31.150
or more specifically, we can actually delete it right here because vertical align top is not

53
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.950
required right here

54
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:40.750
if we have a look at it in the mobile view because we only have this one line and if it jumps to two lines,

55
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:41.850
it's not an issue. 

56
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:48.810
We only had this vertical align top declaration to make sure that when you are in the desktop view, in

57
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.130
this bigger one, that each text is aligned to the top when it's placed next to each other,

58
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.740
not an issue we have right now.

59
00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.150
That's why we can delete the vertical align top declaration but we have to add it right here and now we

60
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.270
can simply comment in the display

61
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.760
inline block and width 30% declarations

62
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.620
and of course, delete the entire key feature rule right here.

63
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:19.210
So if we now reload the page, we can see that our desktop view works fine again and the same thing

64
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:25.670
is true for our mobile view because it simply behaves just as block level elements do

65
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:34.270
and as we can see, if we increase our size, the 30% are working because the 30% that we

66
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.000
added for the width are referring to this key feature,

67
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.540
so basically to the width of that container right here

68
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.050
but it might make sense to also add a max width right here.

69
00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.130
We learned how this works,

70
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.610
so let's add the max width property right here.

71
00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:54.680
So a nice value would be this one, so that it's kind of aligned with the plans we have right here.

72
00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:03.550
So if we go back to our media query and have a look at the plan, we defined a max width of 25rem.

73
00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.270
So let's maybe simply copy that entire code and overwrite it right here,

74
00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.570
like that

75
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:18.070
and if we do that and reload the page, we can see that our elements keep increasing, so the gap increases

76
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.380
but as soon as we hit our max width, it won't increase anymore.

77
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.390
So this looks really nice

78
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:25.640
actually now.

79
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.960
With that, we finished our starting page,

80
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.510
it's now really responsive and looks really nice as I would say. There are two more issues though which are

81
00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:38.410
related to the starting page and also affect all the other pages.

82
00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.350
This is the nav bar as we can see up here,

83
00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:42.470
it doesn't look good

84
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:48.300
and also the footer does not behave exactly the way I would like it to behave.

85
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:53.980
So as you now know all the basics about how to apply media queries and how they work,

86
00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:58.050
I think the best thing that follows this challenge is an assignment.

87
00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:04.020
So let's have a look at your assignment for the responsive design module in the next lecture.
