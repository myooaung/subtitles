WEBVTT
1
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:09.600
So let's now understand how we can add and use such media queries in our project. Before we do that,

2
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:16.890
let me quickly copy our meta viewport tag right here and make sure that we also have it in all the

3
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.400
other index.html files 

4
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.950
because of course, we want to make sure that our entire website is responsive and not just the starting

5
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:26.470
page.

6
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.260
So let's see in the customers folder right here,

7
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.860
we have the meta tag already,

8
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:32.590
so no need to add it right here

9
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.480
but I think in the packages folder,

10
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.200
yes right here, we have to add it,

11
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.280
so let's maybe add it right here as the third meta tag we have.

12
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:47.520
So with the viewport meta tag being added to our pages, we can now focus on to our responsive design

13
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.830
by using media queries.

14
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.800
For that, I will focus onto the starting page, so we will need the main.css file, this one right

15
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.570
here. On our website,

16
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.740
we will leave the mobile view right here because as we now added this viewport meta tag, we can also

17
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:11.280
play around with this developer tool right here to change the width of our page and to make sure that

18
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:18.660
we kind of simulate our look on a mobile device and you can always do this by having a look at

19
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.020
the pixels right here that indicates the width that we have in pixels.

20
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.770
We will dive deeper into how you can think about these limits and which limits you want to have different

21
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:29.800
styles for

22
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:36.030
but for the moment, I will just say that we will define a style which looks maybe good, right here for

23
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.170
350 pixels up to, let's say round about 40rem,

24
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.450
this would be 640 pixels,

25
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.620
so right there.

26
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:46.520
So that's the goal,

27
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.530
basically I want to have a design which looks good from let's say here,

28
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:58.320
this will be a really small device, let's maybe say 250 pixels width like that, up to 640

29
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.720
pixels right here.

30
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.840
So up to here, we want to have a design that looks nice and then we want to change our design,

31
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:12.090
for example increase the font size right here, because we say that starting from 640 pixels, we have a bigger

32
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.990
device, a tablet or actually, a desktop device

33
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.480
even, so we can use the space we have.

34
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.950
And what do we want to change?

35
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.460
Well of course we want to change the nav bar up here because it doesn't look good but we will change

36
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.390
that later

37
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.050
but right now on the main page, we have to change our image because I would like to make sure that the

38
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:38.330
height of our image increases once we hit that 640 pixels border right here.

39
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.800
Then I want to change the font size, so the font size of the slogan, this is always equal

40
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.980
and this should increase once we hit that 640 pixels limit

41
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.700
and of course the plans right here, because these are not organized quite nicely at the moment.

42
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:59.040
So we should make sure that once we are below the 640 pixels, that the plans are not displayed next to

43
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.230
each other but below each other.

44
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.890
Additionally, I would also like to change the style of the footer down here because maybe the footer should

45
00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.550
be displayed above each other on the smaller design

46
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.510
and once we are in our bigger design, it should be displayed the way it is right now.

47
00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.370
Now again, this sounds kind of abstract at the moment,

48
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:24.180
so let's have a look at that step-by-step, add a media query and see how it works and then dive deeper

49
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:32.040
step-by-step. And for that, we need a starting point and the starting point now is, as I said in the last

50
00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.970
lecture, the mobile first design.

51
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.170
This means all our code right here,

52
00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:44.190
so all the code we have in our main.css file is now supposed to work in a way that it looks nice on

53
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.830
our mobile view or what we define as the mobile view.

54
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:55.590
In our case, the mobile view, so the starting point, is everything below 640 pixels

55
00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.540
and this is how we will approach it.

56
00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.180
I will now style the website in a way that it looks good,

57
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.500
for example right here and right there,

58
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.830
so for different widths, this should look good on all these sizes and then we will add a media query

59
00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:14.760
which will then change the design to make sure it looks also nice or even different on devices which

60
00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:21.250
are equal or bigger to a width of 640 pixels, 40rem.

61
00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:27.200
Now let's start with the slogan right here because I said that I would like to change the font size

62
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:33.170
of the slogan because on smaller devices, I think that the slogan should be a bit bigger.

63
00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.890
So for that, we can go back to our code right here,

64
00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:43.670
so as I said I'm in the main.css file and maybe first cut out this section title right here and add it

65
00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.460
below the product overview h1 selector.

66
00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.200
That's not necessary actually,

67
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.910
I just want to make sure that we have the product overview ID selector,

68
00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:59.530
so this is basically this one right here which contains the image and the slogan and the product

69
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.520
overview h1 selector which contains the slogan below each other.

70
00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:09.690
However, I would like to change the font size of our slogan, so let's add the font size property, right

71
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:10.270
here 

72
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.520
and let's set it to maybe 1.6rem.

73
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:20.970
Let's see if this looks good, like that and let's reload the page now, did you see it?

74
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.740
It's now slightly bigger,

75
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:23.840
we know how this works,

76
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:33.030
if we inspect that now, we can see that slogan now has a font size of 1.6rem. So we now change the font

77
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:33.700
size but

78
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.270
it stays the same right,

79
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:42.540
no matter how big our device is, the width doesn't have an impact on this slogan right here and that's where

80
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.990
the media queries come into play

81
00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:55.230
because if we go back to our own code and simply add the following code to it, add media, this simply initializes

82
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:59.850
the media query and tells the code that this is a media query,

83
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.090
then we have to specify an if statement  

84
00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.430
basically, that's how you can imagine that.

85
00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:12.330
This simply tells you if this condition is met, then please apply the following code and our condition

86
00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:21.560
right here will be a min width right, of 40rem. Have a note at the way 

87
00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:27.470
I wrote this code, so you write the condition you want to have, so min width, then the colon and then

88
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.210
the width that you want to specify.

89
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:38.450
This simply means as soon as the width of our device in software in CSS pixels, is equal or larger

90
00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:42.920
than 40rem, then this media query should kick in

91
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.330
and what does kicking in mean?

92
00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:48.750
Well, we simply have to write normal CSS code now,

93
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:55.070
this means we need a selector and then we can specify the properties that should change as soon as this

94
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:56.440
condition is met,

95
00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:04.010
for example we want to change the font size of our product overview h1 ID selector right here because

96
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:08.550
on larger devices, I would like to increase the font size a bit more.

97
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:13.910
So what we can do now is we can copy our ID selector, now write

98
00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:16.640
again the normal CSS code, that's important.

99
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.660
You can see the curly braces right here of the media query

100
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:26.570
and inside this curly braces, I now simply add a normal CSS rule. So we can now say that we want to have

101
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:32.910
a font size of let's say maybe 3rem, not 4, 3rem right here, like that.

102
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:39.040
If I do this now and reload the page, you can see that our font size increased.

103
00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:40.520
Why did it increase?

104
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:47.510
Well because the width of our website was equal or in that case, above to 640 pixels.

105
00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:56.090
If I now decrease the window, can you see it? As soon as we are below 640 pixels, the font size jumps back

106
00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:59.890
to our initial code and the initial code is this one

107
00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:07.310
right here, the code that we specified and that's actually the core idea of such a media query. We will

108
00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:10.420
dive deeper into what we can change right here

109
00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:15.090
and if we can also add other rules right there basically,

110
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:22.460
so other if statements, we can do that of course but that's actually the media query type we will use throughout

111
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:25.540
this course and also the one you would normally use

112
00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:29.550
and that's important, if you follow this mobile first approach

113
00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:35.390
I was talking about because that's the idea behind it. You simply start by creating your code in

114
00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:40.330
a look that is equal to the one we want to have for your mobile users

115
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:44.890
and as soon as this looks nice, you'll simply add such a media query right here,

116
00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:46.820
define a limit,

117
00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:53.150
so whenever you say OK, as soon as the width is equal or bigger than a specific limit, I'm no longer on

118
00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:54.590
a mobile device

119
00:08:54.680 --> 00:09:01.430
and then you just add the selectors and the properties you want to change for your desktop devices

120
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:07.580
for example. We will also see that we can have multiple of these definitions right here, so we can not

121
00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:14.600
only have the mobile or desktop device, we could add a lot of different rules basically and a lot of

122
00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:21.090
different limits or borders we have right here which specify different properties for different device

123
00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:21.940
widths.

124
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:26.020
But as I said, we will have a look at all that in the next lecture,

125
00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:33.470
let's focus on to this media query now and add a bit more code because of course, we are not limited to the

126
00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:34.960
font size right here,

127
00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:41.870
we can basically change any property in such media queries. For our slogan right here,

128
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:43.380
this is not required though

129
00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:51.200
but we can also add another selector because we could also say we add our product overview selector right

130
00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:51.590
here,

131
00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:54.660
this ID selector which basically targets the image

132
00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:56.830
and we could place it above right here

133
00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:03.790
and now also change some properties for this image. Which properties could this be?

134
00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:09.950
Well if we have look at the image right here on the bigger devices, we could say well we have more space

135
00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:18.530
available, so why don't we also increase the size or the height of the image and maybe also change the

136
00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:19.630
position of it a bit,

137
00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.940
this could be two things that we can simply change.

138
00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:30.810
So let's for example add the height property right here, like that, because we initially have a height

139
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:35.030
of our image of 33vh,

140
00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:38.060
so 33% of the viewport.

141
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:41.820
Why don't we change that height a bit and increase it to 40vh,

142
00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:44.780
like that? If we do that

143
00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:47.030
and let me decrease the size right here

144
00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:49.530
or let's maybe keep it the way it is.

145
00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:55.530
If we reload the page now, you can see that the height of the image now also changed.

146
00:10:55.530 --> 00:11:01.390
If we inspect that right here, you can see that the image height is now 40vh.

147
00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:10.520
If we decrease the size, can you see it? Both the font size and the image decrease, because we are below our

148
00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:13.470
media query limit that we specified

149
00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:17.860
and therefore, the height again is 33vh.

150
00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:21.640
That's basically how it works and we can also add another property,

151
00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:24.640
as I said we are not limited to one single property,

152
00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:30.520
we could also add the background position property right here,

153
00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:37.520
like that and we have left 10% and bottom 70% right here,

154
00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:45.250
why don't we just change that to let's say 50% and 25% for example? You can of course choose

155
00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:51.580
any value you want. But the important thing is that if we now increase the size and reload the page, we can see

156
00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:55.070
that the position of the image changed now and important,

157
00:11:55.120 --> 00:12:03.760
this is also only true if we are, as you can see it, above or equal to our 640 pixels

158
00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:06.810
or 40rem limit that we specified.

159
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:14.140
And with that, you actually already understood the basic concept behind such media queries. A media query

160
00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:20.890
simply allows you to define a specific condition, an if condition as you can imagine it

161
00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:28.790
and once this condition is true, you can change one or multiple properties of the selector of your choice.

162
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:35.440
And as you can imagine, this is a really powerful tool which allows you to easily create responsive

163
00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.730
websites.

164
00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:43.450
However before we dive deeper and apply more and more media queries, I would like to take a closer look

165
00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.960
at the media query itself,

166
00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:50.320
so let's have a look at the media queries and how they work and what they do in the next lecture.
