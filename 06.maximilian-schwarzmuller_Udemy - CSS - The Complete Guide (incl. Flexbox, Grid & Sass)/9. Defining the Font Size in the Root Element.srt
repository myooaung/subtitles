00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:10,600
Time for a quick tip because we already talked about the fact that we can change the font size in the

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:17,410
browser settings, right here if I change it to very large, that and go back to my website, we can see that

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:25,030
all the font sizes which were not specified by us, like this text right here where we defined the font

4
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:30,670
size of 20 pixels, all the other font sizes changed because of that browser settings.

5
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,450
That's the normal behavior, probably

6
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,760
there's no reason to change that.

7
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,310
There can be cases though

8
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:43,930
where you say that you want to change the font size for the entire HTML element from the beginning, depending

9
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:45,670
on the browser settings.

10
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:53,620
You can do this if you go to our shared.css file for example, add an HTML selector like this and now say

11
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:57,850
font size should be not 100%.

12
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:03,610
You could do that but this doesn't add a lot of value because it will simply overtake the browser

13
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:07,060
settings which is the behavior we already have

14
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:14,140
but you could say you would like to change the font size to 75% of the browser settings by default.

15
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:22,460
If you do that, you can see that the font size for this navigation items decreases to 75% of the default value

16
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:28,410
and with that, you have a direct impact onto the default settings by default.

17
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:35,770
Nevertheless, we will not follow this approach because we will define the font size specifically for

18
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,710
the different parts on our website.

19
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,870
I just wanted to show you that this is possible

20
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:45,230
and by the way, we can also change back the font size to medium, I think this looks better.

21
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,100
So as I said, I just wanted to show you that this is possible, that you can do that

22
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:55,020
and if you have a specific case where you want to do it, you can do it like this with the percentage

23
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,680
value

24
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,130
but normally you can keep it like that

25
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:05,500
and with that, we can now continue with the next video where we will have a look at the percentage value

26
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,220
once again,

27
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,600
one last time actually

28
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:13,540
and also see how we can use it in combination with the min and max width property.

29
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,390
Let's find out how this works in the next lecture.
