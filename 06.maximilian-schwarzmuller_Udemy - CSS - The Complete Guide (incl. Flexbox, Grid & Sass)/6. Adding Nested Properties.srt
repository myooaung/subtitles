00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:07,360
I actually gave you a brief overview over the most important feature here in all these links.

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,210
We had a look at nested rules or selectors in the last video,

3
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,430
now let's have a look at nested properties.

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,140
Now what are nested properties?

5
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:21,020
Let's go up a bit, here in the container class,

6
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:23,980
I'm still in the main.scss file by the way.

7
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,350
There you see,

8
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:32,680
we got two properties from the flex namespace; flex direction and flex wrap.

9
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:38,920
Obviously we're not dying if we have to write this manually but what we actually can do now is we can type

10
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:51,190
flex, like this and now add curly braces and now add direction column and wrap, no wrap like this. This

11
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,470
allow us to remove these two lines here

12
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:58,870
and behind the scenes if we save this and we have a look at the created file and we scroll up to the

13
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:03,580
container, you'll see it still generated the code we had there before.

14
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,360
These are nested properties.

15
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,400
If they're from the same namespace,

16
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:13,130
so if they start with the same part here, flex-, font- and so on,

17
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:20,590
you can just use that namespace without the dash and then nest all the nested properties in there.

18
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:25,450
So this is a quick and nice way of also keeping your properties together.
