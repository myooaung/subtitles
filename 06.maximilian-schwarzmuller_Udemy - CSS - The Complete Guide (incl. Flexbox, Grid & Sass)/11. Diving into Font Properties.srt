1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:09,570
So let's dive into some font properties now that we have applied them and see which impact they have onto

2
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:11,510
our fonts. For that,

3
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:17,060
I will now go to the customers page maybe, right here, so that we can see the font on a different page

4
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:22,440
now and let's have a look at this class right here,

5
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,790
so the testimonial text class.

6
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:30,320
Let's find this class also in our customers file right here

7
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:37,890
and let's now scroll down a bit, right here and let me know show you some of the font properties

8
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:41,760
I just talked about. The first one is of course font size,

9
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:45,470
I think I don't have to talk about the details regarding the units,

10
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:51,350
we had an entire module about that, so we could for example say we use 40 pixels right here

11
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,120
and if I reload the page, you can see that the font size increases.

12
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,600
I think that's pretty clear for you now.

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,230
Another property that has a direct impact onto the way our text is displayed

14
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,800
is this one, font variant.

15
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:13,640
If I use this one, this small caps value, then the following will happen, if we reload the page,

16
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:21,110
you can see that basically the height of our font did not change but all our small characters that

17
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:24,280
we had before were now changed to capital ones.

18
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:31,310
So that's also just a property that basically impacts the style or the look of the font we have right

19
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,440
here.

20
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:37,920
Another property we have is font stretch, this one right here.

21
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:44,420
There you can see that you can select different stretch levels, so which define the way our font is

22
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,300
displayed

23
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:51,920
and if I would now apply ultra condensed for example right here and reload our page, you can see that

24
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,490
the font looks exactly the same way it looked before.

25
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:03,780
The problem with that font stretch property is that it is supported by browsers nowadays, so that's not

26
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:04,530
the problem

27
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,010
but each stretching level has to be part of a separate font face

28
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:15,380
and as this is not true for a lot of fonts, at least at the time when I'm recording this video,

29
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:21,030
I will not dive deeper into this property, in case you want to find out more about it,

30
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,470
just have a look at the MDN for example right here, here

31
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,550
you can also see what it would impact

32
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:29,210
and you can find all the values you have

33
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:33,580
and as I said, what would happen if you have a font where it can be applied.

34
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,650
But as I said, the browser support is good as we can see it also also down here

35
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,330
but the problem is that the font availability is not the best.

36
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:48,820
Therefore, I will not dive deeper into font stretch right now.

37
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:55,510
So these are the properties that basically affect the general style of the letters you have

38
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:02,090
but there are also other properties which have an impact onto the letter spacing for example and on

39
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,380
to the line height,

40
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,620
what that is, how they work and what they do,

41
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,930
let's find out that in the next lecture.
