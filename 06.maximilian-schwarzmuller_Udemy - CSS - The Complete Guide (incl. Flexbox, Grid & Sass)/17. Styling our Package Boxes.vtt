00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:07.730
So with the links styled, let's continue styling our package boxes here,

2
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:14.950
let's style the title, the subtitle and the description and for that, I'll use classes again to not use combinators

3
00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:15.970
only

4
00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:22.680
and I'll add a class of package title to the h1 tag,

5
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:32.850
I'll add a class of package subtitle to my h2 tag here and a class to that paragraph,

6
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.410
maybe package info,

7
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.100
the names of course as always are up to you

8
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:45.500
and we should add these classes to all our packages or plans here,

9
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:52.690
so let's do that for all the elements in all the plans.

10
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.230
Now with that set up, we got all we need to target the different elements and apply some styling.

11
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.880
So back in the packages.css file,

12
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:02.980
let's start with the subtitle,

13
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.610
I'll leave the title for now.

14
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:17.440
So subtitle, package subtitle, that class will receive a color of let's say a grey color, maybe a little

15
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.810
bit darker than that,

16
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.780
let's go down a little bit,

17
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.370
somewhere around that and I'll turn this to a hex code again,

18
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.140
so #979797. If we save that and we reload the page,

19
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:35.840
now we got that dark grey look for the subtitle which looks good in my opinion and for the info,

20
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.070
let's also target that with package info,

21
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.150
so that's the description text.

22
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:52.210
Let's set a padding of let's say 16 pixels and a border of one pixel solid and then that dark green

23
00:01:52.990 --> 00:02:01.410
and a font size of 20 pixels maybe and then a text color of the dark green too. If we save that, it's pushed

24
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.960
in a little and it's in that border so that's nice,

25
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:11.140
so the text pushed it inside of that border I should say. One other thing I want to do is I want to add

26
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:18.030
different backgrounds to the different plans and each plan should have its own background and for that,

27
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:24.220
I'll assign IDs to the plans because if I need to select every plan differently, then IDs are the

28
00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.730
best way of doing that.

29
00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.970
So the first plan will get an ID of plus because it's a plus plan,

30
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.670
the second one is the free plan so this will get an ID of free and the third one, this third section

31
00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.830
will get the ID premium

32
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:46.120
and of course you could name this premium plan, free plan, plus plan, whatever you like. With these plan IDs

33
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:54.670
added, we can target the plus plan for example and give it a background color of let's say a light green

34
00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:02.200
which actually also is slightly transparent. So let's add the rgba function here to be able to create

35
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.970
a slightly transparent color and the color I prepared for this

36
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:17.950
but of course you are free to choose a different one, has values 213, 255 and 220 and then 0.95 as

37
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.420
value for the transparency, so this is almost not transparent,

38
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.880
one would be fully opaque, zero would be fully transparent,

39
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.740
this only has a slight transparency.

40
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:37.240
Now I'll assign a style for the free plan and the free plan will get a background color with the rgba

41
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.940
function with a slightly different green. There

42
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:52.680
I prepared 234, 252, 237 and then again 0.95 for the transparency and the premium plan,

43
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:58.810
that plan will actually receive a color of a darker green,

44
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:11.960
so rgba again but here it's 14, 79, 31 and then 0.95. With that if we now save that, we get that green

45
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:18.260
color, we get these green colors, we see we'll need to adjust the text colors of the last plan because

46
00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.200
it's dark, it's dark on purpose,

47
00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:25.280
we want to kind of emphasize our premium plan, it should look premium

48
00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:31.460
and one other thing I want to do is I want to give these descriptions a white background so that they

49
00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.610
stand out from the rest.

50
00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:41.200
So for that back in our code on package info, I'll assign a background of white to assign a white color,

51
00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.620
so now this looks like that.

52
00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:44.930
So this is all looking good

53
00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.460
but as I said, the premium plan needs to get different text colors.

54
00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:57.110
So at the bottom, I'll add my premium selector and then use a combinator, the descendant combinator again,

55
00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:02.230
as you see this is a combinator you use a lot, to select my package title,

56
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:08.720
so we defined that class, haven't used it before but here we need it and give this a white color maybe

57
00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:15.430
and also select my package subtitle here and there,

58
00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:24.930
I will stick to a grey but to a different grey, not as dark as the previous one, here I will use #bbb. With

59
00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.870
that if we now save this and reload,

60
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.400
that's easier to read

61
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:34.710
and now I like the look of these plans. This is actually what I wanted you to do,

62
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:40.160
one thing missing though, I want to have a hover effect if we hover over such a plan.

63
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:46.630
So if we go up to our package here, for the entire package not just for the link,

64
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:52.500
actually both is the same because package A, so the anchor tag has display block so it fills the entire

65
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.940
package but the package also includes that border.

66
00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:03.030
Therefore for that package, I want to add a hover effect and an active effect

67
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:07.110
and add a box-shadow and there,

68
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:15.440
I'll add 2 pixels, 2 pixels, 2 pixels or maybe 4 pixels as a blur factor and no spread and then I'll

69
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.100
add this transparent grey

70
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:20.160
I already used earlier, so

71
00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.280
like this.

72
00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:30.800
Now finally I want to add a border color here and that border color will be #ff5454.

73
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:37.990
If we save that and we reload, we see this is looking pretty good,

74
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:39.610
I like that style.

75
00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.050
So that's looking good,

76
00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:44.420
we got our different plans now highlighted

77
00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.990
and that is the state

78
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.570
I wanted you to reach. Now

79
00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:53.810
chances are you used different colors or maybe you found a different solution for some of the stylings

80
00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.290
applied here.

81
00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:00.960
Definitely compare your solution to mine and feel free to share yours with your fellow students, discuss

82
00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:07.960
them with your fellow students and let's together now add one more thing because I want to ensure that

83
00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:13.020
this middle plan, the free one actually is positioned on the right of our page.
