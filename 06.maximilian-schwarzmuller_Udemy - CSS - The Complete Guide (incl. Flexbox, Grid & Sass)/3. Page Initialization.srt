1
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,440
Let's actually start with the title here

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:11,140
before we dive into the different inputs and for the title, if we go to the start hosting folder and there

3
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:17,520
into the index.html file, we see that here we get that signup title class assigned to it.

4
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:25,370
So let's now add a start-hosting.css file in the start hosting folder and make sure you

5
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:26,350
are importing it,

6
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:27,400
it should be there,

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:33,520
the import should already be there though because we added it to the code you copied into that page and

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:40,330
in that start-hosting.css file, we can select that signup title class element and there for example,

9
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:48,730
align the text in the center, give it let's say a font size of 1.8rem so that it's looking good

10
00:00:48,730 --> 00:01:01,840
and a bit bigger than normal text and maybe also add a color which could be #ff5454, that's

11
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,110
a reddish color.

12
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:06,340
Now if we reload, this looks better.

13
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,590
Now maybe some distance would be nice,

14
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:15,690
so let's add a class to the selector for the main element and there, let's add a padding top of 

15
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:16,310
2rem,

16
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:22,630
also as we did it on the other pages, we have different paddings, maybe 2rem is too much, let's add

17
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:23,340
1rem

18
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:28,510
but just so that we have some space between our content and the header.

19
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:30,790
Now with that, we worked on the title,

20
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:35,020
now obviously we are here to work on the form and the input elements.

21
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:40,060
Now for that, let's go back to the index.html file and let's have a look at what we got here.

22
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:44,810
We have a form element, here with the class signup-form

23
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:51,340
and in there, we always have combinations of labels and then input elements, like this, select element

24
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:57,390
or a bunch of normal inputs or also our terms and conditions and

25
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:05,260
there, we have some special setup where the label actually wraps our link here to the terms and conditions

26
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:09,210
but is then also positioned next to a checkbox input,

27
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,740
the difference to the other labels is that it's coming after the input because we want to have that look of

28
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:19,080
having the label after the checkbox instead of in front of it.

29
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:26,630
That's a general look we have here. Now there is no single correct way of styling form inputs and elements,

30
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:35,020
you can find dozens of solutions, for example one thing you see in some solutions is that you wrap your

31
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:44,500
labels and inputs into divs, so you would put each pair of label and input into a div and then you

32
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:51,540
could also give that div some class, like input group or form group or whatever you want and give that

33
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:58,870
some style where you essentially maybe set a margin to the bottom or margin to the next element that's

34
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,320
coming after it.

35
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,670
This is one way of styling this, you could absolutely do that, here

36
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,310
I will follow a different approach though and I will not style it like this,

37
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:16,540
instead I will target labels and the different inputs individually because I need to do this anyway

38
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,850
as I also plan on applying different stylings to these elements.

39
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,580
Let's start with some basic stylings.

40
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,820
In the start-hosting.css file,

41
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:31,150
let's start by selecting our labels, inputs and select elements,

42
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:36,900
so basically all types of elements we have in our form except for the button

43
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,520
and let's turn them into block level elements.

44
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,260
Now why do I want to do that?

45
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:45,340
Because normally, they're all inline elements, as you can clearly see here,

46
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,150
they're all in one line.

47
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,370
This is actually something you might want,

48
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,190
maybe you want to position some of them next to each other

49
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:58,300
but here, I want to position them below each other and therefore I need to change their default behavior

50
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,230
and turn them to block level elements.

51
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:07,990
For that, we could simply select label, input and select elements with their tag selectors,

52
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:13,740
however I will combine that with the signup-form class and use the descendant combinator,

53
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:20,680
so signup-form and then some whitespace, just to ensure that only elements which are inside of

54
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,780
that form receive that style.

55
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:29,650
Now on our page, this is technically not required but if we would have some scenario where we get some

56
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:36,060
other input on the page, let's say a search bar in the header for example, then we might not want to style it

57
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,680
in the same way as we style our form,

58
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:46,150
hence the combinator approach here. The style I want to apply here is that I want to set display to block,

59
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:53,350
as I said and then I also want to add a margin top of let's say 1rem, to add some distance between all

60
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,410
these elements.

61
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,490
If we do that and we reload, we can already see a difference,

62
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,840
now all the elements are beneath each other.

63
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,580
Now it's not looking perfect,

64
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,830
we'll work on that but it's better.

65
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:12,040
We can also see one thing though, even though they're all block level elements and we can inspect them

66
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:16,490
here, to see that they indeed do take up the full width,

67
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:25,240
we see that the majority of the available width is occupied with nothing, with a margin. For form inputs,

68
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,220
like select or input,

69
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:36,260
we actually also need to set the width to 100 to force them to expand over the full available width.

70
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:44,290
Now clearly, this is not looking super beautiful here but we'll work on that and we'll change the

71
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:47,230
width of the overall form soon enough.

72
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:49,180
Now this is the first step

73
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:57,940
I wanted to take, now one problem we have is the styling of the checkbox. This actually, if we inspect

74
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,650
our HTML code, is also a normal input element, here

75
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:07,080
but in this case, I don't want to set it to block,

76
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:15,190
it should stay an inline element because I actually want to ensure that this checkbox is positioned

77
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:22,060
next to its label and therefore, this current approach of just setting it to be a block level element

78
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,370
does not work, we'll have to change that

79
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:33,010
and actually we will change this and learn about attributes selectors and use them in the next lecture.
