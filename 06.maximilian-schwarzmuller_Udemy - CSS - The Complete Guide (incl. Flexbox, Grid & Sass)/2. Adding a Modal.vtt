00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:07.720
So back in the course project, I want to start by taking advantage of that backdrop

2
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.580
you added in the last course module.

3
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:17.930
I want to make sure that we can click these choose plan buttons and of course we could directly redirect

4
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.580
the user to some other page

5
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:26.060
but here, I really want to open a modal which is like a pop-up in the page you could say. You know it from

6
00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.070
a lot of pages,

7
00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.400
it's an overlay over the other content of your page

8
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.370
so to say.

9
00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.250
Now you already added this backdrop with Manuel, here

10
00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.600
this backdrop div which you added to your HTML files,

11
00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.620
this will be one piece of the modal, it will be the background of the modal

12
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:45.850
so that we can click

13
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.590
any other content on the page.

14
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.260
The other part is the modal itself,

15
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:59.720
so the content we want to overlay and attached to this video, you find the HTML code for that modal.

16
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:08.390
So copy that code and add it right after or in front of your backdrop here, like this.

17
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.110
Now this code here simply is just a div with a h1 tag where we say do you want to continue

18
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:21.410
and then a class modal actions where we essentially render two different buttons, one of them is a link

19
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:27.500
styled as a button which says yes and the other one is a normal button which says no which should just

20
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.700
close the modal.

21
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.270
Now here, we navigate to start hosting index.html,

22
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.750
that's the last missing page of our project,

23
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.400
we'll add it later but for now, it's nice to have that button already

24
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:47.150
and of course you see we've got a bunch of CSS classes added to our modal elements here and to take advantage

25
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.330
of these classes and style this modal in a nice way,

26
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:56.810
we need CSS code. Attached to this video, you also find a CSS file with the styles for this modal,

27
00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:04.250
so simply open that file and copy the styles you find in there into your main.css file, maybe just towards

28
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.820
the end of that file. In there you'll find things you already learn about, position fixed, set index, top,

29
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:20.990
left, width, background color, box shadow and borders, some alignment, stylings here, also maybe new this cursor

30
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:27.050
pointer which just makes sure that when we hover over the button that we get this pointer cursor, so

31
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:33.500
which turns our mouse cursor into a cursor that looks like a clickable element or that we are over a

32
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.780
clickable element and some pseudo classes to change the styling when we hover over the different buttons

33
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:39.450
and so on.

34
00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.680
That's really all that our modal requires.

35
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:49.550
Now please keep in mind, this set index here of the modal has to be higher than the set index of our

36
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:55.490
backdrop because the backdrop which has a set index of 100 should be in front of the other content we

37
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.960
got

38
00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.990
but the modal itself then again should be in front of the backdrop.

39
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:07.850
So if we add all that and we save that, we can reload our page and we don't actually see anything.

40
00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:14.410
The reason for that is that for the modal just as with the backdrop, we got a display style of none.

41
00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.860
Now we can comment this out, so let's comment it out,

42
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:23.870
so to essentially show our modal and let's also comment out the display style of the backdrop so that

43
00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.690
both are not none

44
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.970
and if we reload the page now, this is how our modal will look in the end,

45
00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.460
this is the modal we added and which I want to show when we click such a button.

46
00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:40.550
Of course it shouldn't be always shown as it is now though, it should only show up once we did

47
00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:47.330
click a button and it should disappear once we click the backdrop or the no button or the yes button

48
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.840
but there, we simply navigate to a different page which we haven't added yet anyways. So what I'll do

49
00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:00.140
is, I'll set this back to display none, both for the backdrop and the modal and in the next lecture, we'll start

50
00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:07.850
adding some Javascript to essentially change this display property whenever we want to show or hide

51
00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.410
the modal and the backdrop.

52
00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.450
So let's do that in the next lecture.
