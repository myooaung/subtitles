00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:09,120
So in this module, we learned a lot about how we can change styles with the style property or by adding

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,540
classes or manipulating classes,

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:20,520
now let me console dir element, like the backdrop for example again and let's dive into the style property

4
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,120
for a second

5
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,170
again. If we reload and go to the console, here we see the backdrop.

6
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:29,440
Now let's go down to style and you might have noticed it before,

7
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,830
if you watch closely, we didn't recognize it for display because it's only one word

8
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:42,300
but for other things like background image and a lot of other multi-word properties, they are written

9
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:50,170
in a different way than you use it when writing CSS code in CSS files or in HTML files.

10
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:55,880
You don't have a dash between background and image and image then starts with a capital I,

11
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:03,960
the reason for this is that property names, you can call these variables and object so to say, are invalid

12
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,700
if they contain a dash, that is why the notation differs slightly.

13
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:14,820
Essentially, whenever you have a CSS property that consists of multiple words, like border radius

14
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:21,930
and you want to change this directly from within Javascript, you would change it to one word where the dash

15
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,710
is omitted and the word after the dash starts with a capital character,

16
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:32,460
so borderRadius in this case here. This is simply something you have to keep in mind,

17
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:40,820
you have to change the syntax without a dash but with a capital character after the dash. You've got

18
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,310
an alternative though, in the shared.js file,

19
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:49,720
if I access style background image I just showed you, this will work, 

20
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,650
if we reload,

21
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,330
we just see nothing because no value is assigned

22
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,160
but you do see an empty line so it did execute.

23
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:05,600
You can also access it in a different notation by using square brackets right after style,

24
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:13,730
no dot in between and then passing a string to the square brackets and in there, you now use the normal CSS

25
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:17,880
property name, like background-image. Here

26
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,600
since it's a string, the dash is allowed

27
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,940
and if you want to use the normal names as you know them, this is an alternative syntax you can use.

28
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:28,580
If you now save this and you reload,

29
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:33,190
you again see an empty line and no error which means it worked.

30
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,240
So that's important,

31
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:41,140
by default use that so-called camel case notation without a dash but with a capital character for the

32
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:49,520
separate words or use this way of accessing the property names. If you're attaching and removing classes

33
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:56,510
as we do here, you of course don't change the way you style or write your styles in your CSS file, that's

34
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,720
not affected by Javascript at all,

35
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:05,480
this is really just needed if you directly access a style property from within your Javascript code.

36
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:08,310
So that's something important which I wanted to highlight,

37
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,550
now with that, let's wrap up this module.
