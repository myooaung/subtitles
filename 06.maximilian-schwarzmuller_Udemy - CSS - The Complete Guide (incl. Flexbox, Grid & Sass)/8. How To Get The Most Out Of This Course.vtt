00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:05.040
So, how do you get the most out of this course?
1

2
00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:10.900
Well, the first thing is watching the videos and although this is quite obvious, it's really important
2

3
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:17.650
to state again because, in the videos, we will explain everything we do and especially why we are
3

4
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.320
doing and applying certain concepts.
4

5
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.820
So really make sure to watch the videos, depending on the track you are entering of course,
5

6
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.860
I talked about this in the course outline, but watching that, that is the first step to really get the
6

7
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:36.040
most out of this course. In addition to just watching, the more important thing is to code
7

8
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:42.880
along. Take the chance and code together with us and create this nice website, because by watching the
8

9
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:49.150
videos, you'll see the basic concepts, but by really applying them and coding along, you'll see where you might have
9

10
00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:55.390
some knowledge gaps and where you might have to revisit a video, for example. In addition to that, also
10

11
00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:01.670
make sure to do the exercises. This course comes with a ton of assignments, quizzes and challenges
11

12
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.480
and the best thing you can do is to actually do them, try your best to solve them.
12

13
00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.480
We offer all the solutions to make sure you know how it works in the end,
13

14
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:16.790
but practicing is really key in CSS and actually, in web development in general.
14

15
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.180
Now in addition to that, also debug your errors, because although you'll code along with us, there
15

16
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:28.540
might be cases where your code is not working at all and for that, you can find the source code attached
16

17
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.030
to the last lecture of each module.
17

18
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.420
So take this code and compare it to yours and try to see where you may have made some little mistakes
18

19
00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.650
for example.
19

20
00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:44.410
That's also important because with that, you take a closer look at your code and with that, this again helps
20

21
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:51.130
you to understand and memorize certain concepts. In case you tried your best, you tried to debug your code
21

22
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.390
and it doesn't work,
22

23
00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.810
then of course feel free to ask in the Q&A section of this course.
23

24
00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.950
We try our best to answer all your questions, to make sure that all the things that are unclear become
24

25
00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:03.810
clear.
25

26
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:10.810
Even better than just asking is to try and answer questions in the Q&A section, because asking is
26

27
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:11.410
easy,
27

28
00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:17.650
we know that, and answering is quite challenging. But by answering questions, you think about the concepts
28

29
00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:18.940
you've learned so far again and
29

30
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.250
and the best thing is, in the end, you help others. Don't worry about giving wrong
30

31
00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.060
answers,
31

32
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.670
that doesn't play a role because in the end, once the correct answer gets posted, you will again learn
32

33
00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:31.940
and learning
33

34
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.690
is the goal of this course right here.
34

35
00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.510
Now with that, you've learned how to get the most out of this course. There is only one thing we should have
35

36
00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.520
a look at before we finally dive into CSS because what are the tools we are using in this course?
36

37
00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.310
Let's have a look.
