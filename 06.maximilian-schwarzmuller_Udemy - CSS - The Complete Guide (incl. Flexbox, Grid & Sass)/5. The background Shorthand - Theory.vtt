00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:09.420
We had a first look at the background property, we used it with colors and we use it with our images

2
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.150
and the background property is a shorthand property as you learned.

3
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.590
Now behind the scenes, we can split it up into several subproperties and we saw some of them. We get the

4
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.720
background, image, color, position and size and repeat

5
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.570
but there also is background origin, clip and attachment.

6
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.370
Now let's find out what all of these properties do.

7
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.300
Well, background image unsurprisingly allows us to set one or important,

8
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.050
we didn't do that yet but we'll do so soon,

9
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:44.160
multiple background images. Background color can be used to surprisingly set a solid color as a background.

10
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.880
Background position allows us to set the initial position relative to the background position layer, 

11
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.750
now that will become important in a second,

12
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.910
this will refer to the background origin here and it only applies to the background image because

13
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.850
if you have a solid color, it will fill the entire container,

14
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:03.330
that's it,

15
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.410
you can't position that. Background size sets the size of the background image,

16
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.750
also only refers to the background image therefore. Background repeat defines how a background images

17
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.130
are repeated,

18
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.260
also referring to background image therefore and background origin allows us to set a background

19
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.970
positioning area.

20
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.240
Now we'll dive into what this means in the next lecture,

21
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.960
it also is only relevant for background images. Background clip allows us to define whether the background

22
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.290
extends underneath a potential border or not,

23
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.710
so if it ends before the border or goes beneath it,

24
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:48.270
important for dotted or dashed borders where you can actually see content below the border and background

25
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:54.210
attachment defines how the scrolling will behave inside of that image,

26
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.310
so this also only refers to images.

27
00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.120
Here's an overview, everything that's orange-ish

28
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.530
refers to background image only.

29
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.400
So now let's dive into that and let's see that in action and let's find out how this actually can be

30
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.140
applied to our background.
