1
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:05,530
So in the last lecture, we worked with height and width.

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:06,560
Well that's all nice,

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,700
we change the height and width of the box unsurprisingly

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,780
but what exactly did we change? When we set the height and the width, did we set the height and width

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:26,780
of the content, of the content plus the padding, of the content, the padding and the border or of the content

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,740
the padding, the border and the margin,

7
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,240
well let's take a look. Let's take a look

8
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:40,310
by inspecting that section where we did set width and height. There if we scroll down to our box model,

9
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:49,150
what we can see is that in there, we set the width and height of our box here

10
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:55,050
I'd say. The width is calculated dynamically as we increase and decrease the page width because it's

11
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:59,390
set to 100% and the height is the 522 pixels

12
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:05,850
we added in our code but let's now quickly add some padding back to the party.

13
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:14,540
Let's maybe add a padding of 10 pixels, a border of 5 pixels solid and black and a margin of 10 pixels.

14
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:20,440
If we now save this and we reload the page, we can already see one strange thing,

15
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,570
it shifted a little bit to the right,

16
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:29,410
the 100% width leads to our red element to go out of the right side of our page

17
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:36,020
and that doesn't change if we decrease and increase the page width because it's already set to 100%.

18
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,650
So something seems to be wrong with the width.

19
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:43,820
If we scroll down to our box model again, we now see something strange,

20
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:52,990
the height really is 528 pixels for the content, the width is 100% of our content

21
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:59,430
too but now the padding, border and margin add up to that.

22
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:05,830
So what we actually now got is a total width and height that's bigger than what we specified

23
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:12,400
and we can see the total values if we simply hover over it, we can see that the actual width of our

24
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:19,420
element is 937 and that the actual height is 558.

25
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:27,220
Now if we go back to our box model here in the developer tools, the height was 558, well if we add up,

26
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,570
that's 528 plus 10 plus 10,

27
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,350
so 548 plus 5 plus 5.

28
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:44,230
So we set the height and width of the content and padding and border is not included into our calculation

29
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:51,160
or is not part of what width and height target, it is what the browser in the end adds up to it though

30
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:55,190
which leads to our element being positioned incorrectly.

31
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:03,670
This happens because all elements by default happen to have a certain way of calculating width and height

32
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,250
which is called content box,

33
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:15,120
we can set this behavior by adding the box-sizing property to the element where we want to change it

34
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,730
and as I said, the default here is content box.

35
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:23,970
This means if we set a width and height, we set width and height of the content, not of the entire box

36
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:29,640
including padding and border. We can set it to border box though,

37
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:36,030
now width and height include padding and border, they don't include the margin and we can't make it to

38
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:36,850
include that.

39
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:43,780
With that set however if we save the file and reload, we still see that the element goes out of the page

40
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,860
because the margin is not included in the calculation

41
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:54,820
but if we go down, we see that actually it now only has a height of 498 because now if we add 10

42
00:03:54,820 --> 00:04:02,230
times 2 for the padding and 5 times 2 for the border, now we end up with the 528 which is our height

43
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:06,420
which now again targets content plus padding plus border

44
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,400
and that often is the setting you want to use.

45
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:15,930
It's actually so common that you often overwrite the styling for all your elements to

46
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:22,360
always use box sizing border box because it's more convenient to think of the height and width referring

47
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,310
to the entire box without margin than to just the content.

48
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,730
Now as I said, margin is never included,

49
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:35,290
so to avoid that effect where your element is moved to the left, you simply have to remove the margin, 

50
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,470
which I guess makes sense. If you want your element to sit right on the edge,

51
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,670
don't add a margin after your element,

52
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:46,290
it makes sense that this is not part of the width and height.

53
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,640
So box sizing border box, really really useful

54
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:58,430
and as I said, so important and useful that it's often used as a default style for all elements anyways

55
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,710
and this is also what I want to do here.

56
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,860
So we could add it to body

57
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:12,410
and if we do that and save and reload the page and go back to the box model, we see we're back

58
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,420
in content box world.

59
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:19,250
The reason for this is that we're now inheriting the box sizing set up

60
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:26,080
but actually, we don't see it here as a browser default style but because it's a block level element,

61
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:30,670
here by default, this is overwritten automatically.

62
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:39,070
So actually, our nice inheritance doesn't take effect because the browser sets its own box sizing because

63
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:42,160
section is a block level element.

64
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:49,000
Therefore what we have to do is, we have to use the universal selector and that is one of the rare cases

65
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:56,320
where you really use it if you want to reset all elements to have a certain behavior, like using box

66
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,140
sizing border box,

67
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:03,570
then you use the star, the universal selector because this is now not using inheritance,

68
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:07,330
it's not using the same mechanism as setting some body had,

69
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:14,080
it's really targeting every element on its own, hence overwriting inheritance and also overwriting browser

70
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,630
defaults and sets the box sizing to border box.

71
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:23,680
And I will leave this for the entire course project because I always want to target content padding

72
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,520
and border when setting width and height.

73
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:34,240
So with that added, if we now reload and go back, we see we're back in the world where our content is only width

74
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,430
and height without padding and border so that if we set width or height, we actually include padding

75
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,070
and border in the calculation.
