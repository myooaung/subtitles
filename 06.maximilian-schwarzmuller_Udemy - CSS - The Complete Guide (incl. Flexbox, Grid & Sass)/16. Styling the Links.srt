1
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:06,530
So let's start working on that plans page now.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,000
Now the first thing I want to have is I want to have some spacing to my navigation bar.

3
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:17,390
We could add a margin top to that first section but we can actually just add one to that main element

4
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:23,780
here and here we can also use the elements selector, we could add a class of course but we will not have

5
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,150
a second main element on this page,

6
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:30,570
so using the main selector is fine. So in the packages.css file,

7
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:38,840
I'll select the main element here and I will add a padding top to have some spacing between the topmost section

8
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,370
and the header of let's say 32 pixels.

9
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:48,610
If we now save this and reload, this is pushed down a little bit more and the links are not blue anymore

10
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,840
because I accidentally clicked on one.

11
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,020
So this is the first part I wanted to add,

12
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,720
now the next thing is about the individual packages we have,

13
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:02,090
so a package really is just one of these sections.

14
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:08,990
So if we go to our index.html file on the packages folder, we can add a package class to each section.

15
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,360
Of course you can name that class whatever you want,

16
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,780
the idea is that we can assign some general styling.

17
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:18,030
So let's now select package here

18
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,710
and for example ensure that they don't take the entire width of the page,

19
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:26,570
let's maybe limit the width to 80% let's say.

20
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:29,740
Additionally, there should be some spacing between the packages,

21
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:35,930
so I'll add a margin to top and bottom of 16 pixels but 0 to left and right because I want to position them

22
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,210
on the edge of the page.

23
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:46,360
Additionally, maybe some border works nice there too, maybe like 4 pixels solid

24
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:59,150
and in this dark green which was #0e4f1f and if we save that then, this looks like this.

25
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:04,440
Now from the visual perspective, we can probably still improve that,

26
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:08,150
for example we could get rid of that left border.

27
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:15,690
Now for that we can target border left and set it to none, the other borders will be kept because we also

28
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:16,810
defined here

29
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:20,840
but then we overwrite the border left. So with that if we reload,

30
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,030
looks a little bit nicer,

31
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:26,810
looks like the plans are coming out of the left edge which is a lookalike a lot.

32
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,860
Now of course the text looks awful,

33
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,540
so we definitely need to work on that too.

34
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:37,370
For this, I'll use my package and select the anchor tag inside of it

35
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,090
and of course you could also assign a class to that

36
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:50,110
but here I'll just use the combinator. I'll set the text decoration to none and the color actually to inherit,

37
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:59,900
to use my page default. I'll then set display to block to ensure that the anchor tag takes the full available width

38
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:09,130
of the surrounding section and add a padding of let's say 32 pixels. If we now save that, our boxes look like

39
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,030
this,

40
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,150
so we're getting there,

41
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:16,840
style is improving and these still are links even though they don't look like them anymore but you see

42
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,920
we still got that hand

43
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,820
icon if we hover over that.

44
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:25,690
Now one thing you can also see is that I can even click that top right corner of that plan and it's

45
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:32,980
still a link because we set that anchor tag to be a display block element and hence it takes the full

46
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:37,290
available space inside of that surrounding section.

47
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,790
So here you see that's my anchor tag,

48
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,100
it really fills the entire section box.

49
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,130
So with that, we got the link styled,

50
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,500
now I want to style the content inside of that of course,

51
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,130
so inside of that box.

52
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,260
So this is what we'll work on in the next lecture.
