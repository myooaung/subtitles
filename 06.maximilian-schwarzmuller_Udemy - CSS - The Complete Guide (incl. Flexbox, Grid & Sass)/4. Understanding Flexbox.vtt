00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.480
So what is flexbox actually?

2
00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:12.260
Well as I said, flexbox allows us to change the way our elements are displayed and using flexbox is

3
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:20.480
actually quite simple because to use flexbox, we simply have to add a specific property to our element,

4
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.780
to which element? We'll dive into that in a few seconds.

5
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:29.340
This property we need is the display property, we talked about that property throughout the course already,

6
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.280
it's that display block inline or inline block thing

7
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:38.870
where we can change the behavior of our elements and if we now use the display property in connection

8
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.920
with this value right here, the flex value,

9
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:48.380
then we create the following: we create a flex container and that's the first important thing we

10
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:54.950
have to understand. If we apply display flex to an element, this element will be turned into a so-called

11
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.820
flex container.

12
00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.500
Now as the name indicates, a container has to contain things and that's exactly what happens right

13
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:10.760
here because inside our flex container, we should have other nested elements and these elements are the

14
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.420
so-called children and these children are also named flex items.

15
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.330
So that's the first thing we have to keep in mind,

16
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:19.650
we have an element,

17
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:26.150
normally a parent element with the display flex declaration, this parent will become the so-called flex

18
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:33.170
container after we applied this declaration and all elements inside this container are children of

19
00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.460
the parent of course

20
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.540
and at the same time, flex items.

21
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.140
Now that's the first step,

22
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.890
the second step is that once we turned our elements into such a flexbox construct as I would call it,

23
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:53.000
we can apply different properties to both, our parent, our flex container and our children, our flex items.

24
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.250
For the parent,

25
00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:02.000
we can apply the flex flow property, the justify content property, the align content property and the align

26
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.660
items property, we'll of course dive into all these properties throughout this module.

27
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:13.790
The same thing is true for our flex items, for these, we can also apply properties. The properties right

28
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.110
here we have are order, flex and align self,

29
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.280
we'll also dive into these throughout the course.

30
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.300
The problem now is that this is a very abstract construct now for you

31
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.460
and at the moment, it's probably not clear how we can use the combination of this flex container and

32
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.320
these flex items and these properties to change the way our elements are displayed.

33
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:43.510
Therefore, we will forget about the flex items for the first part of this module and really focus onto

34
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.130
the actual flex container and the corresponding properties because with that, you will quickly understand

35
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.000
the core concept of flexbox

36
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:57.370
and then we will be able to dive deeper into the flex items. And how can we dive into these concepts?

37
00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.340
Well, we will of course also apply flexbox to our project

38
00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:08.360
but actually, I think that understanding all these things in a theoretical and leaner project is the

39
00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.570
better approach.

40
00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.590
Therefore, let's have a look at our theory project and do our first steps with flexbox in there in the

41
00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:16.270
next lecture.
