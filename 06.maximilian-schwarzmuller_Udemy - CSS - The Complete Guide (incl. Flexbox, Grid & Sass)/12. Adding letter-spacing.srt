1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:05,130
So let's have a look at some other properties.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:13,970
For that, I will delete our font stretch and now add the letter spacing property, this one. For the letter

3
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:15,080
spacing property,

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:24,590
we have to use lengths as a value, so this can be either pixels or rem, I will use pixels now because

5
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,410
I think it's easier to see like that,

6
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,150
so let's say we use 5 pixels as letter spacing.

7
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:38,330
If we do that and we load, we can see that the space between our letters, between each letter increased

8
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:41,630
or we could set it also to 10 pixels

9
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:47,690
if you really want to have a big space between your letters. And as you can see, this is basically what

10
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:48,950
letter spacing does,

11
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:55,220
as the name already indicates, it increases the space between each of the letters that you have in your

12
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,880
text right here but

13
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,760
we don't need that so we can delete it right here.

14
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:04,310
A more interesting property is the next one,

15
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:06,660
this is whitespace,

16
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:14,910
this one right here. For whitespace, we have no lengths but we have properties like normal, like that.

17
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,290
If we apply normal,

18
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:23,740
well as you can imagine, this will show us the text in its initial status but with this whitespace,

19
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:31,900
we can now impact the way whitespace is treated inside our element and if we think about the whitespace

20
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:37,510
we have right here for our testimonial text class right here,

21
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:41,240
so this one, uHost helped me right,

22
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:46,880
then we can see that you of course have whitespaces in here. So this is a whitespace,

23
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,810
this is the whitespace and so on.

24
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,380
So at the moment, if we go back to our customers.css file, we have this whitespace normal,

25
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:59,150
we see the behavior that we can observe right here, as soon as the element has enough space,

26
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:07,100
the whitespace will jump up a bit and always start a new line where we have the whitespaces and where it doesn't

27
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,700
fit into the element.

28
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:17,490
Now if we change this from normal to no wrap, like that, then we can see as the name already indicates, that

29
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,580
no wrapping takes place.

30
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:26,400
This means the entire text in our element will be displayed in one line and the width of our window

31
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,590
doesn't have any impact on that, as the name says,

32
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,970
this is no wrap.

33
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:37,450
If we change this to pre, like that, then we cannot see a difference right here

34
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:41,610
but if we go back to our code, to the index.html file

35
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:46,860
and now let's say we add a new paragraph but not with the p

36
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:50,830
but just by hitting it like that on the keyboard, after project,

37
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,560
keep that in mind. If we now go back and reload the page,

38
00:02:54,910 --> 00:03:01,900
you can see that after project, we have this paragraph and we see this indention that we have right here.

39
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,300
This is all automatically created by that value,

40
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:12,420
we also have another one which would be pre-wrap, this one right here.

41
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:18,040
If we use this one and we load the page, then you can see that we have a line break right here but that's

42
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,040
simply due to the reason that the space is not enough right here

43
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:28,050
but as soon as we increase the size again, we can see that we have our project in one line and after

44
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:32,830
our project where we added a paragraph, we start in a new line and then the next break of course is right

45
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:38,260
here because these words right here don't fit into one line.

46
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,730
The last value would have is pre-line,

47
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,850
let's have a look at what happens right then.

48
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:47,950
If we use pre-line right here, like this and we load the page, 

49
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:53,430
now you can see that the lines are filled whenever possible because before, we saw that this line right

50
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,380
here was empty

51
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:58,870
but now we keep our line break right here because you said that after project, there should be a line

52
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,690
break, so it has to put project into a separate line

53
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:07,010
but then we have the next one starting and all the lines are filled whenever possible.

54
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,510
So that's what you can do basically with whitespace.

55
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:16,930
I think this is a nice property because it can help you really changing the way your text is displayed.

56
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,050
However, we can now go back right here

57
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:26,540
and put that new line back up again to avoid that whitespace,

58
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,370
I think it's better like that.

59
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,540
So back to our customers file now, to the CSS

60
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:37,980
file and back to another property, the line height property.

61
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,210
Let's have a look at this one in the next lecture.
