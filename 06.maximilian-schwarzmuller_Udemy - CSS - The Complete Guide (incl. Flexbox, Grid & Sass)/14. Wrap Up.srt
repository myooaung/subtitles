00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:04,040
So that's it for this module,

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,570
here's what you learned.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:11,140
You learn that CSS works with rules which you look like this, you have a selector, a property and a value

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,280
for the property.

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:18,620
You learned that there are different types of selectors, element selectors like h1, class selectors

6
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:24,380
with custom created classes, attributes selectors which we haven't used yet but which we at least touched

7
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:25,160
on,

8
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:31,350
ID selectors with custom IDs and the universal star selector.

9
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:36,220
You learned that there are many properties and values, that you can find a complete list on the

10
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:42,260
Mozilla Developer Network, MDN and there are different types of values and we will explore way more

11
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,960
properties and values throughout the course.

12
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:51,140
We had a look at selectors and combinators, so that you can combine multiple selectors to be more precise

13
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,200
about which element you want to select,

14
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:59,720
you learned about these four and you learned very important about inheritance and specificity. You

15
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:04,220
learned that parents styles are generally inherited, though there are exceptions.

16
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:09,290
You learned that multiple rules can apply to one and the same element and that specificity is used to

17
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:13,500
resolve conflicts arising from this multiple rules thing.

18
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:20,420
You also learned that the inheritance defaults can be changed by using that inherit keyword, that inherit

19
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,300
value.

20
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:27,980
You remember when we set font family to a value of inherit? Then we overwrite the general behavior that

21
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,400
we would not inherit because of specificity

22
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:33,580
and we did inherit, so that is something which can be changed.

23
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,400
This is what we learned thus far,

24
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:42,430
now we'll dive way deeper into all of that and we'll continue working on our web page which still doesn't

25
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,740
look super amazing

26
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:50,410
I'll have to admit but these were very important foundations on which we can now build up to dive deeper

27
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:59,090
into the internals of CSS and see how it works and then also to continue working on our web page.

28
00:01:59,110 --> 00:01:59,770
So let's continue.
