00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:08.570
Now with the question about CSS selectors and when to use them, the answer is basically almost always

2
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:09.880
out of the way.

3
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.250
Let's have a look at the important annotation,

4
00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.050
now what is that?

5
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.110
Here is a CSS example.

6
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.520
We got some rule and we added important at the end of it,

7
00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:23.870
so before the semi-colon but after the value.

8
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.890
Now what does this do? It overwrites specificity and all other selectors,

9
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:31.640
that's super important.

10
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:38.950
It overwrites all these things and therefore, this specific declaration would always be applied.

11
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:46.760
Therefore you shouldn't really use important. In most cases, it's not a good idea to use it because

12
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.610
you're overwriting something that's baked into CSS, it quickly leads to bad code and you'll find yourself

13
00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.870
using important all over the place, you're messing up your CSS code

14
00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.260
therefore. There are some edge cases in which using it can be fine

15
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.730
and you'll actually see one later in the course

16
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.230
but in general, don't use important, this is really important.

17
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.380
Now let's have a look at a quick example though to see how it would work.

18
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:19.160
Back in our code, remember that highlighted class thing on the first section? It overwrites main section

19
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.540
simply because it comes later in the file,

20
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.720
so it's simply an order thing leading with a higher specificity of this rule.

21
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:32.510
Now let's say we want to enforce this border, we could do so by adding !important at

22
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.060
the end of this rule here,

23
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:40.590
of this declaration to be precise. Now it will only apply to this declaration, not to height, not to padding,

24
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:46.340
so if we overwrite any of these, let's say the height is set to 200 pixels, then that would not get overwritten

25
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.060
by important

26
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.220
but the border will, let's see. If I now reload the page,

27
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.510
the orange border is gone and the height also got changed.

28
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.360
Now the height got changed because I just set that height on highlighted

29
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:04.180
but you see the border is getting overwritten, even though in the developer tools, we can still see that

30
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:12.350
normally this would have a higher priority or specificity but actually, this border setting is taken because

31
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.680
of that important annotation.

32
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:22.650
If we remove that, maybe in the browser tools only for now, then you can see we're back to the orange

33
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.090
border because of course that would be the normal specificity.

34
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.910
That's also why it's bad to write this, your code becomes hard to understand

35
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.960
and if you then want to overwrite it

36
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:39.930
once again, you need to use important again because if you got important twice or more than twice, then

37
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.130
the normal specificity will kick in again and you're in a land of madness.

38
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.960
So don't use it unless in very rare edge cases which you'll notice if you meet them.

39
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.510
Most of the time, we're talking about some Javascript driven logic where you temporarily need to change

40
00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:04.650
your style or if you're using some third-party styling package which is written in a bad way and uses

41
00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.860
some styles that you need to overwrite and can't change otherwise.

42
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.980
But again, these are edge cases,

43
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.170
normally you shouldn't need to use important.
