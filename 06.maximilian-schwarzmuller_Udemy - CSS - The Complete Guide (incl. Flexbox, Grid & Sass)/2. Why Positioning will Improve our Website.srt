1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:09,400
No matter if you just joined at this stage of the project or if you followed along, this is the status

2
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:13,120
we will start with, you can of course find the code attached to this video

3
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:16,430
and we actually achieved a lot so far.

4
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:20,450
We created this navigation bar right here on top of our starting page,

5
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:25,120
we have this background image with this slogan, get the freedom you deserve,

6
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:30,650
we also created and styled the different plans, so the free plan, the recommended plan and the premium

7
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:31,620
plan,

8
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:38,340
we also have the reasons why uHost is a really important hosting provider and we created that photo

9
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,250
right here.

10
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:46,460
Additionally, we build the second page, this packages page and by saying we build, actually you

11
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,630
build it, right?

12
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:52,730
So on this page, we can find more information about the different plans we have

13
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:58,270
and of course we also have our photo down here. Now where could we add the position property now?

14
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:03,680
As I said, a property that allows us to change the position of some elements.

15
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,270
Well actually we could change the position of our navigation bar right here.

16
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:10,200
Now you might say what's wrong with it,

17
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:14,160
it's a fine navigation bar and I would agree partially

18
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,590
but if we scroll down, we see that the navigation bar disappears.

19
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:24,080
So I don't think that's the best user experience because if you want to change to the packages page now,

20
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,500
the navigation bar is kind of gone.

21
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:31,720
So adding a fixed navigation bar definitely is something we should change or we should add right here.

22
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,770
Additionally, the background image

23
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,610
or more specifically, the slogan right here

24
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,410
is not presented the best way.

25
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:42,720
Generally, we should change the position inside this image.

26
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,760
That's what I want to change on the starting page,

27
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:52,690
if we go to the packages page now, I would like to change the fact that we don't have a background image,

28
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,720
this is also something we will add using the position property

29
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:03,320
and finally I'm not happy with our plus plan because the plus plan is our recommended plan and therefore

30
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,320
the most important plan actually

31
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:09,440
and so far, this doesn't really become clear as I think.

32
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:16,220
So why don't we just add a badge maybe right here in the right upper part of this plan to really ensure

33
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,960
that our users see that this is the recommended plan.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,390
So this is what we want to achieve in this module

35
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:30,530
and before we can apply that in practice and we will do that, no worries, I think it's theory time now.
