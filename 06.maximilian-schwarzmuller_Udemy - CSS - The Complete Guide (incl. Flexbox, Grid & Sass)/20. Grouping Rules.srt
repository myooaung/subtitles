1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:09,000
So now with that little dive into pseudo classes and pseudo elements, let's dive into something else.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,700
Do you know these two rules? They're exactly equal if we leave out the selector which of course

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:15,600
differs.

4
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:22,500
If you got a case like this, you can group them into one rule because repeating code like this is not

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,010
good

6
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,220
and if you ever change the color, you have to change it in two places.

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,510
So what we can do is we can group the two rules by adding a comma after the first one and then in the

8
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,170
same one in the next line,

9
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:40,290
I always add in the next line because it's easier to read, we add the next selector we want to add to

10
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,010
the group and you can add as many as you want.

11
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:44,850
Important,

12
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:50,170
this is not a combinator, these two rules, these two selectors are not related at all,

13
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,920
they just share the same declaration set.

14
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,740
So now we can remove that active rule and still get the same effect because now it's simply grouped

15
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:07,820
into one rule, into one assignment. So if we reload the page, we still got the hover and hold effect.

16
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:09,590
So this still works,

17
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,470
it's now just in one group, in one rule.
