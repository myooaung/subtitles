00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.560
I'm still on the not page but I won't talk about not in this lecture,

2
00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.180
instead this is an extremely important lecture,

3
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.470
do not skip it,

4
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.010
we're talking about browser support.

5
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:22.490
Whenever you use a certain feature in CSS, be that a certain type of selector or more relevant, a certain

6
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:31.250
property, a certain style, you have to check if the browsers of your target audience supports that feature,

7
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.600
otherwise you can't use it, though at the end of this course,

8
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.330
I also will share some ideas on how you can implement certain features which might not be supported

9
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.490
in all browsers in a way that they still work in most browsers.

10
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.770
Sounds fancy but we'll get there.

11
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.290
But checking the browser support still is important because sometimes, you just can't use a certain feature

12
00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.630
because the browser which you need to support doesn't know that feature. On MDN, you can find browser

13
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:08.600
support at the end of every page, so if you're on the page of a certain CSS property or a certain CSS selector,

14
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.990
at the bottom you'll find this table. There you see a split for desktop and mobile browsers and you see

15
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.800
the major browsers and how well they support a certain feature. For some features,

16
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:26.290
you also see some split between the basic support and then extended versions of that feature for example.

17
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:33.410
You also see which specification works on that feature and you can see what's recommended,

18
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.520
that is what most browsers typically already implement and what might be coming in the future

19
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.540
but back to the table. There you see if it's supported

20
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.800
and since version is supported

21
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.710
and this is really important to check, especially for the more advanced features we'll dive into later

22
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.450
in the course because it ensures that you are not building your page with something which most of

23
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.720
your users can't use, because unfortunately from a web developer perspective, not everyone is using Chrome

24
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.460
or Firefox.

25
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.800
Now you can also use another page,

26
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.910
caniuse.com.

27
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.690
caniuse.com allows you to search for a certain feature,

28
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.050
let's say background and then you will see all kinds of matches it finds.

29
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.050
Now this also includes Javascript features by the way,

30
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.270
for example you can scroll down and you'll see some things which might become important later in

31
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.030
the course,

32
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.800
so some general CSS properties for example, background color and there, you see that that is supported

33
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.130
in all browsers. For some features, you get a detail table like this one for background attachment,

34
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.220
something I will dive into in the images and backgrounds section of this course and there, you can also

35
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.970
see how well it's supported in browsers, you can hover over the browsers to see more details,

36
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.640
for example here, partial support,

37
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:49.630
what does this mean,

38
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.480
what is supported, what isn't

39
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:59.950
and on the top right, you also see how much of the market you reach when using that feature

40
00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.430
and that includes the strong support and the partial support as you can see.

41
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.910
And you can check the partial support to decide if that then is enough for you

42
00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:15.020
or if some crucial feature is missing and hence only the strong support number counts for you.

43
00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:21.350
So the cool thing here really is the market share feature, because we can tell using that is probably relatively

44
00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.960
safe because we reach almost 94% of the total market.

45
00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.360
So these two pages, MDN at the bottom of each page

46
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:36.710
and caniuse are great resources when it comes to deciding whether you can use a certain feature or

47
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:37.490
not.

48
00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.680
Now this is the complete guide to CSS,

49
00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:46.790
so we're also going to teach you cutting edge features but checking these resources is always a good idea

50
00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.340
when you're building a real web project.
