00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.350
And if you now look at our nav bar, this looks actually totally fine.

2
00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:12.230
We didn't change the look at all but we simply made the code smaller and more efficient with flexbox.

3
00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:13.240
That's really cool

4
00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.680
but if I now look at the mobile view, because actually we work mobile first,

5
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:19.510
right

6
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.670
and click onto this hamburger, then

7
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.920
I don't like this look right here, because wouldn't it be better if these three buttons would be

8
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.260
centered right here?

9
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.960
I think it would

10
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:38.250
and if we look at the classes for that, we have this class right here, the mobile nav open class,

11
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:44.300
then we have an unordered list and inside this list, we have three list items,

12
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.710
well the structure right here is actually pretty common to us right now

13
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.090
and this brings us to your challenge now.

14
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:58.530
Turn the mobile nav items class into a flex container and add the properties in a way that the flex

15
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.930
items right here are displayed below each other, like that

16
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:09.330
but in the center of the page. Important, if you look at the code, you need to change or add the properties

17
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.100
right here to the mobile nav items,

18
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.840
so this class right here should become the flex container.

19
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:22.290
Additionally, have a look at the margins because you might have to change this slightly to really change

20
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.550
the elements inside this flex container.

21
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.930
This is now your challenge,

22
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:33.330
you can now pause the video and try to turn the mobile nav items into a flex container and then we'll

23
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.490
have a look at the solution together.

24
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.400
So how did it work,

25
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:43.670
were you successful?

26
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.950
Well, let's start now together

27
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:53.530
and the first thing you have to do of course is we have to add display flex right here and we can also

28
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.450
get rid of the text align declaration,

29
00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.660
we don't need that anymore.

30
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:03.550
So with display flex being added, let's see and reload the page, yes

31
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:14.910
this looks let's say interesting. But if we now first say that our flex direction should not be the default

32
00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:21.450
value but column because that's what we want to have right here, the buttons should be displayed below

33
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.290
each other,

34
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.280
let's reload and open it,

35
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.490
then it looks better.

36
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.610
Now keep in mind, we change the flex direction to column,

37
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.840
this means the main axis goes from top to bottom,

38
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.850
so we need to add justify content center,

39
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.820
right,

40
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.610
to make sure that the elements are displayed right here.

41
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.360
Let's see if this works fine,

42
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.360
yes it does, almost,

43
00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.040
we'll dive into the details about the almost in a few seconds.

44
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:59.630
And if we now add align items to align the items along the cross axis which is from left to right

45
00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.480
in our case because we have flex direction column,

46
00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:09.950
so if we reload that and click into the menu, this looks pretty good actually as I would say.

47
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.840
Now I said you, before we started the challenge, that you might have to change the margins a bit, 

48
00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.070
so if we inspect that now, we see that the margins are not perfect

49
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.000
to be honest

50
00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:27.060
but we can simply change that by changing the top and bottom margin to zero because I don't think we

51
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.920
need it anymore.

52
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.480
So let's see, if I now reload the page, open the hamburger,

53
00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:32.310
yes,

54
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.620
now it looks good and we can still close it, open it,

55
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.120
this works totally fine actually.

56
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:45.320
With that, we added flexbox to our navigation bar, the mobile navigation bar and the desktop navigation bar and I

57
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.520
hope you saw already that flexbox

58
00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:55.500
is kind of nice to use and can help you to change the way your elements are displayed in quite

59
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.010
an easy manner.

60
00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.600
Now talking about easier ways to position the elements,

61
00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.900
let's also work on the footer now maybe because the footer down here is working,

62
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.060
that's not the question

63
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.480
but it's of course not using flexbox right here.

64
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.930
Now let's see how we can use flexbox for this footer also in the next lecture.
