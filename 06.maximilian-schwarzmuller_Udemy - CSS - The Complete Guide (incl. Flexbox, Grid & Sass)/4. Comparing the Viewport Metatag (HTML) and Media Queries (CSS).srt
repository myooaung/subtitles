1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,150
So which tools do we have to add a responsive design?

2
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:09,580
Well, we just saw that we have this viewport meta tag,

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,330
this is created or added in HTML

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:19,840
and we have media queries. We'll dive into these later in this module and media queries are of course

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:26,320
created in CSS because that is what this course is all about, right? Now let me show you the differences

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:33,720
between these two concepts and especially why we need both to create our responsive website. The viewport

7
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:40,430
meta tag is required to be able to adjust our site to the device viewport,

8
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,030
we just saw that. If we only take into account the actual pixels,

9
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:52,330
we will not be able to display our websites correctly or in a convenient and appropriate way on mobile

10
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:53,490
devices.

11
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:59,570
Therefore in addition to the actual pixels, we need to take into account the device width

12
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:07,150
and with that, automatically apply a specific pixel ratio which will then allow us to translate the hardware

13
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,990
pixels into these software, the CSS pixels,

14
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,550
we just did that.

15
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:17,440
The important thing is though that we cannot apply any design changes,

16
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:23,110
so in case you want to say if I am in a mobile version, I would like to change the entire structure of

17
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:24,070
my website,

18
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:28,150
I would like to add some things or maybe make some things disappear,

19
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:29,940
this is not possible.

20
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:35,260
The only thing it does, it translates the pixels according to the pixel ratio and therefore adjust the

21
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:43,000
way our website is displayed. In contrast to that, we have the media queries. The media queries allow us to

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,210
change the design depending on the actual size and that's the important difference,

23
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:56,620
media queries really allow us to specify the way our website is displayed depending on the size and

24
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:04,240
size doesn't mean a single size, we are able to define specific rules based on the width for example

25
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:08,670
where specific properties of our website should change

26
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,290
and I'm referring to properties.

27
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:16,330
So I'm not only talking about the width of our elements, you could change basically anything you want with

28
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,540
such media queries,

29
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,570
you could also change colors for example, so we will dive into these options

30
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:28,030
and as you will see, media queries are really cool and allow you to really adjust the look of your website

31
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:31,170
depending on different device sizes.

32
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:38,050
The important thing with that is of course that these changes are defined by us. With the viewport, the

33
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:42,210
impact we have is limited because the viewport will just translate the pixels

34
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,450
as I said and that's it

35
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:50,500
but with the media queries, we can really dive into the design and specify a unique design for the different

36
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,220
devices

37
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:55,710
we have. Now as this still sounds kind of abstract probably,

38
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:01,880
we will now dive deeper into the first concept, the viewport and after that, have a closer look at media

39
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:02,370
queries.
