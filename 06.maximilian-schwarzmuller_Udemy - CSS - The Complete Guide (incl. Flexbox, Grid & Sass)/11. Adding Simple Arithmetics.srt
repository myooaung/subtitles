1
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:05,470
So we already had a look at quite a lot of SASS functionalities,

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:10,360
We worked a lot with variables and there's one thing which might have come to your head, to your

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,510
mind.

4
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:17,860
We got our size default and size tiny which we use quite a bit but we also got cases where we have 3rem,

5
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:25,250
2rem, so multiples of our sizes you would say. Of course we could define separate variables for

6
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:30,610
these and if we were to reuse these values a lot, that would make sense but if we just have some usages,

7
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:36,140
what we could do and what is supported by SASS is simple arithmetic.

8
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:43,350
We could use size default here which is 1rem and simply multiply it by 3.

9
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:49,000
If we now save this and we have a look at the created main.css file, you'll see that we still

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,350
get 3rem here because SASS is able to do simple math like this; multiplication, division, subtraction

11
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,980
and addition. You can do it with variables,

12
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:06,240
you can also do it with other values, details about this can be found in the official SASS documentation.

13
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:11,350
The cool thing is now this padding also depends on our default size,

14
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,950
even though it's not the same value but it's a multiple of it,

15
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,680
the same for this padding.

16
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:24,340
There we could also use size default times two, for the box shadow here for example, we could use size

17
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:28,780
tiny divided by two, since we used half of it

18
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:31,090
and so on.

19
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:38,650
This is what you can do in your code in general, here for that margin, size default times two for example,

20
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:44,850
here for border bottom, we could use size tiny divided by four,

21
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:54,500
since we used a fourth of our tiny size which is .2. With that in place, we can save

22
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:57,530
and now again in the main.css file,

23
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,050
you will see the same values as before and if you reload the page, you see the same as before

24
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:08,770
but if you go back to main.scss and you ever change your default size to two, you will see that

25
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:14,620
your entire page adjust now because we in general increased all these multiples too.

26
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:22,480
So that now takes it one step further to a really reusable and flexible page with the help of SASS.
