00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:07.070
So we had to look at gradients and I did mention that we can use multiple backgrounds,

2
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:14.350
so how does this look like? For the background shorthand or also with multiple background image and color

3
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:15.220
assignments,

4
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:21.430
we can set multiple backgrounds for one and the same element. This of course only make sense if the backgrounds

5
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:28.180
have some form of transparency to them, be that images with the transparent parts or gradients with transparent

6
00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:28.890
colors,

7
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:35.020
otherwise you will only see the topmost background but you can add multiple backgrounds.

8
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:42.290
Important though, only one solid color can be used and it will always be the bottommost background.

9
00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:48.250
You can now use how many background images you want to use though, you are not limited regarding that, you

10
00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.760
can add multiple background images and keep in mind, gradients count as images.

11
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.980
So let's see this in action in our project. Back there on the starting page,

12
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:03.700
I'll get rid of the ugly radial gradient and I'll reintroduce the shorthand with the image.

13
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.560
Now I will use a background color of grey, as a fallback

14
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.720
or maybe our red color actually which we had before.

15
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.940
So that's a fallback in case the image can't be loaded

16
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.040
and I also want to add a linear gradient.

17
00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:26.530
Now we can add a linear gradient with the linear gradient function here and it will be stacked on top

18
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.630
of that image because I write it prior to that image,

19
00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.440
so you read it left to right basically.

20
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:39.760
Now one important thing though, your different background images have to be seperated with commas and so

21
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:46.060
you do have to do for the background color and that even shouldn't come here because after the color

22
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.590
here,

23
00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:53.080
we get a couple of important properties which position that image and they would refer to that background

24
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.270
color right now,

25
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.340
actually this would be a syntax error,

26
00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:03.290
so what do we have to do is remove that solid color and add a comma after our other shorthand properties

27
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.650
because you separate your different layers with commas and the solid color is no exception from that

28
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:09.310
rule

29
00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:16.160
and then you can set the other shorthand properties for that given background. So you can set

30
00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.940
and you would have to set different background properties for the linear gradient because these ones

31
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.760
here only apply to that image,

32
00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.380
so every comma separated list has its own set of background properties so to say.

33
00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.420
Now for the first background, I only want to have the gradient

34
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.910
though so this doesn't matter

35
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.510
but that is why the positioning is important and why the commas are important.

36
00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.420
Back to that gradient, for this gradient,

37
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:49.960
I want to transition to the top, so I want to start at the bottom and I want to go from light transparent grey

38
00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.800
to a fully transparent look.

39
00:02:53.110 --> 00:03:02.770
So I will start with rgba and then I will use 80, 68, 18, that will be a brownish greyish color which

40
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.890
fits the general color theme of the image,

41
00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:14.060
to a fully transparent look but here I also add 60% opacity only so that we have some transparency

42
00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:20.290
and then again, I go to full transparency. Now I'll also add a color stop,

43
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:28.000
so before the comma, after my rgba function, I'll add 10%, so that I don't have an even transition

44
00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.150
but that I leave my color here relatively early.

45
00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:39.890
With that if we save that and we reload, we actually see that the bottom now also has this light golden

46
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.330
brownish look. To make this even clearer,

47
00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:50.200
let me temporarily set this to zero to have a fully transparent element here.

48
00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:56.320
Now we're back to the original black here for the bottom and now let's revert this to .6,

49
00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.530
now if I reload,

50
00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.500
you see we have that golden touch here at the bottom too and that's the look I wanted

51
00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:08.240
and here you see both a linear gradient in action as well as the stacking of backgrounds in action.

52
00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:14.350
Again this only makes sense as either a fallback, as here for our solid color

53
00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:22.090
or if your top most backgrounds have some transparent elements, otherwise you won't see the background

54
00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.910
beneath them and that's it for the backgrounds.

55
00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:33.310
We had a detailed look at gradients and now also at that very important stacking where the syntax matters

56
00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:39.560
if you use the shorthand, use the commas, don't forget them and assign the properties to the background

57
00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:46.280
you want to assign them to, each background has its own set of background properties. And if you don't

58
00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.110
set them, the defaults will be used.
