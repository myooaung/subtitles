1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,880
Now that we had a closer look at images,

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:11,100
let's move onwards to linear gradients and for that, I'll go back to my main.css file and

3
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:14,230
that background image we have on the starting page.

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,540
Let's say we want to add a linear gradient instead of that image,

5
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,390
later we'll also combine it with the image

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,900
but for now, let's use just the linear gradient.

7
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:29,760
The first important thing you've got to know is that gradients, both linear and radial ones are treated

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,630
as images.

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:39,120
So if you were to use the subproperties and not the shorthand, you would add a gradient by targeting background

10
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,590
image with it

11
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:47,700
and then the part which I'll teach you in a second or in the shorthand version, you simply add it instead

12
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:53,670
or additional to images because we can have multiple background images, not just one but more about

13
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,020
multiple backgrounds also at a later part.

14
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:04,170
For now, let's simply overwrite the background we set here with a linear gradient.

15
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:11,700
We add one by using the linear gradient function CSS ships with. Now the linear gradient function consists

16
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,370
of two parts in the end,

17
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:19,080
you can add more than two arguments but that simply is because you can define multiple colors across

18
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,010
which you want to transition

19
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:25,830
but the first argument always is the direction of the gradient.

20
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,420
You can omit it, in which case the first argument would be a color,

21
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:34,130
so the simplest possible gradient is red blue for example

22
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:40,310
and if you save that, you get a gradient from red to blue, as you see the default is vertically,

23
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:46,950
so by default, it simply is a perfect line from top to bottom and it transitions from red smoothly to

24
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:47,720
blue.

25
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:55,680
Now I just mentioned, the first argument can be a color but normally it's the direction. You can for example

26
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,080
specify it like this,

27
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:05,890
to bottom. This looks strange at first but this is a syntax understood by CSS,

28
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:12,310
it simply means that from top to bottom, so you can save this and reload and you get the same result as

29
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,460
before.

30
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:20,730
You can also say to left button and now it will be a diagonal,

31
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:25,290
now you see it starts in the top right and goes to the left bottom,

32
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:32,370
that's the transition. Of course as you might guess, you could say to left top, to right top and so on

33
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:36,960
and this simply defines where your colors start and where they go to.

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:45,580
Now you can also define an angle with degrees, so you could say 30 degrees and now your transition or

35
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,110
your gradient would have a 30 degree angle.

36
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:57,130
Now if you set it to zero degrees and you reload, you start at the bottom actually.

37
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:04,690
So unlike the folder you start at the top, zero degrees simply means a perfect line coming from the bottom,

38
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,860
therefore 180 degrees would be your default where you start at the top and you can of course define any

39
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:15,940
angle you want or use that to left bottom notation.

40
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:20,850
Now besides that, you could also define multiple colors, as many as you want basically.

41
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:25,780
So you could now also add green, yellow and orange here,

42
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,090
of course you cannot just use color names,

43
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,360
you can also use hex codes, for example for orange,

44
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:37,320
you could also use that hex code here and the same is true for rgb or hsl functions,

45
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,040
you could use these too.

46
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,340
So with that if you now reload, we got a really colorful gradient.

47
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,250
Now I don't know if you need that on your next website but it's nice to know that you can build that.

48
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:54,420
A special gradient or a special way of using gradients is to also implement transparency,

49
00:03:54,430 --> 00:04:03,000
for example you could transition from red to transparent and if you do that, well then you actually see

50
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,800
we fadeout

51
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:09,390
to transparent, so we see whatever the background behind the gradient is. This is very useful for cases

52
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:12,400
where you do have multiple backgrounds on top of each other,

53
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,160
more on that later.

54
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:21,080
You can of course also transition to rgba color for example, like this with some transparency inside

55
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:21,580
of it.

56
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,840
Now we would transition from red

57
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:31,580
to this transparent black grey color. This is how you can use linear gradients, you can do even more

58
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:38,510
than that though. Besides specifying multiple colors, you can also define where these colors should start

59
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:39,290
and stop,

60
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,780
so let's add another color, let's say blue

61
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:47,000
and if you reload right now, you'll see each color gets one third of the gradient.

62
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,850
It's not that good to see because we go to that transparent grey

63
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:59,300
but actually the red color ends after one third or put in other words, after one third or after 30%

64
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,240
to be precise,

65
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,920
we got a perfect blue

66
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:09,470
and then after further 30%, that ends and we transition into the black part.

67
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,530
Now you can split this up,

68
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:17,940
you could for example say red should stay until 70%.

69
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:21,630
Now if you reload, 70% of the gradient is red,

70
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,250
a perfect red I should say

71
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,610
and then it transitions into blue and then the other color.

72
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,200
Of course you can also define stops here too, you could say 80% blue,

73
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:38,370
this simply now means that after 80% of the gradient, the blue will already be done. If you

74
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,650
enter a value smaller than the 70% of the red here

75
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:47,040
and you then reload, you'll see you got simply a hard edge because there's no room for transition

76
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,140
because when the blue part enters,

77
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,870
it's already too late to put it like this.

78
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,030
It should have started at 60%,

79
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:59,260
it can only start after 70 but therefore, there is no smooth transition.

80
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:05,790
So this is how you can play around with the colors and how you can control when which color transitions

81
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,500
into what. This is the linear gradient,

82
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,770
we also got the radial gradient.

83
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,550
Let's take a closer look at that in the next lecture.
