00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:05,770
Welcome to this course,

2
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:07,030
it's great to have you onboard.

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:08,750
My name is Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:14,830
and I'll be your instructor in this course. Now in this course, you will learn everything about CSS,

5
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:15,780
Cascading Style Sheets.

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,060
We'll have a closer look at what CSS is in the next video,

7
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:24,880
but you will learn it in this course from the ground up and not just in theory, we'll build an entire

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:30,660
course project with CSS. We'll start with the basics and gradually enhance it with more and more

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,530
CSS features.

10
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:37,620
Now I'm working as a freelance web-developer and therefore, I work with CSS day-to-day.

11
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:43,630
I can tell you that getting started with it is easy but it also offers a lot of features which can be complex,

12
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,550
but which also allow you to build powerful websites.

13
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,810
Now I'm not teaching the course alone though.

14
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:54,670
Who am I? I'm Manuel, I'm also a web developer and together with Max,

15
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:59,450
we are Academind and our goal is to teach you how to become a web developer.

16
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,500
For that, you will dive into the practical side of CSS

17
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:06,940
throughout this course. As Max told you, we will create a real-world project but

18
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:12,520
in addition to this, you will also have assignments, quizzes and a lot more to really understand

19
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:18,550
the theoretical concepts behind CSS; because applying it is one thing, but you also have to understand

20
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:25,110
the 'why'. With that approach, you will be able to confidently apply CSS in your own projects

21
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,310
after finishing this course. You don't need to be a designer,

22
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,390
you don't need to understand CSS or JavaScript,

23
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:36,940
the only thing you'll need is some basic HTML knowledge. With that, let's jump into the course right

24
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:37,420
now.
