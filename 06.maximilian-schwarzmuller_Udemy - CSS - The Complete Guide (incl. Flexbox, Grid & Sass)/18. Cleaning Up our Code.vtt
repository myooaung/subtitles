00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:09.060
So we learned a lot of new units in this module and we actually applied a lot of them in our project.

2
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:17.650
So in this lecture, I just want to add one additional of this new units because I saw that in the packages

3
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:18.280
file,

4
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:23.440
we still use width 100% and height 100%.

5
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.720
We use position fixed so it's not a big problem but I would like to change the background on our packages

6
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:37.930
side also to 100 viewport width and 100 viewport height, vh, not wh like that.

7
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:44.830
So if I go back and go to the packages page, we can see that the image still is positioned as it

8
00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:53.680
was before but now we also have these units aligned with the image we have right here on our main side

9
00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.800
where we also have the viewport units.

10
00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:56.740
That's it,

11
00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.160
that was our code cleaning up, was quite easy actually.

12
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.390
So let me now summarize what we learned in the next video.
