1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:09,000
Now we saw how we can use grid column start end and grid row start and end to target different line numbers

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,630
and are accurate to define where the elements should go.

3
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:17,740
Now working with the line numbers of course is an option but not the only one we got,

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:26,760
it would also be nice to give our columns and rows names or to give our column and row lines names to

5
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,870
be precise and we can do that.

6
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:36,290
Let's start with the rows because we repeat the columns and there is something special about that,

7
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,210
I'll come back to that,

8
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:38,910
so let's start with the rows.

9
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,330
If we want to name line number one,

10
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:50,990
so this first horizontal line, then we have to add the name in front of the value for the first row, so

11
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,690
of the height of the first row

12
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,810
and we add the name in square brackets, that's important,

13
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:56,900
this is required

14
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,090
and then any name of your choice, you're totally free.

15
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,970
You shouldn't take span though because it's a reserved word

16
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,490
but other than that, you're totally free.

17
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:09,000
So for example here, we could name this row-1-start,

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,330
however again, the name is up to you,

19
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,760
so row-1-start. After this first row,

20
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,460
we name the line that comes thereafter,

21
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,510
so line number two, the second horizontal line. We add square brackets again

22
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:31,420
and now we can name this row-1-end. You could argue that it maybe also should be named row-2-start

23
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:38,410
though because the second the line here actually is both the ending of the first row and the start of

24
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:40,120
the second one.

25
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,500
Good thing is if you want,

26
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:47,710
you can assign multiple names, simply by staying in the square brackets, adding a whitespace and adding

27
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,640
the second name which of course is totally up to you.

28
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:51,850
This is not required,

29
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:52,990
you can do that,

30
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:57,800
you can of course also use one name. This will refer to the same line, that's important,

31
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:01,300
so you can use the two names interchangeably now.

32
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:06,850
And now we can simply add another name after this additional row here,

33
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:13,470
so maybe we can name this row-2-end and we could also name it row-3-start if we wanted to,

34
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:20,500
so we could add row-3-start as a second name and then we can name the last line number which is

35
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:21,020
row-3-end

36
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,010
for example. If you save that and you reload,

37
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,030
you don't see the names here

38
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:34,220
in the inspector, that's not displayed. We can just check if it works because we can now reference

39
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,370
these names instead.

40
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:43,220
So in places where we refer to the row numbers, like here grid row start, we refer to line number

41
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,070
two,

42
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:49,240
now a name for line number two is either row-1-end or row-2-start.

43
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,310
Let's maybe pick 2-start

44
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,260
because here we are defining something which should start there,

45
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:59,530
so we set this to row-2-start, without square brackets.

46
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:05,840
Now grid row end doesn't take a line number here because here we use the span syntax but for example

47
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,400
down there on element three, we get a grid row end of three,

48
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:14,700
now line number three has that row-2-end

49
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,450
name for example, we could also use row-3-start.

50
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:25,490
But let's take a row-2-end and let's replace grid row end, the value three to be precise with

51
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:29,700
row-2-end, again without square brackets here and grid row

52
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:38,450
start of course could be row-1-start as a name, like that. With all that added, if we save everything and

53
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,610
we reload,

54
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:45,530
we shouldn't see any changes which is a good sign because that means it works because we target the

55
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:51,410
same lines as before but this time, with our named lines here.
