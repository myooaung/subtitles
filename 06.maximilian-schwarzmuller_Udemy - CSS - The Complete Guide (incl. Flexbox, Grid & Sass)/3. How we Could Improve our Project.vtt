00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:04.730
So that's our website basically

2
00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:06.430
and we have a nice design,

3
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.670
we have a responsive design and that's implemented for all our pages right here.

4
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.750
So you could say this is fine,

5
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.400
why would we change that?

6
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:23.240
The reason is that if we go to our code and right here into the shared.css file for example, we have

7
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:30.500
code in there which is not perfect as I would say or which can be improved because if we go to our main

8
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.090
header for example, right here, then specifically have a look at this

9
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.620
display inline block part,

10
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:42.290
this is something we could change with flexbox because inline block is a nice way to change the

11
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.580
position of elements but flexbox can make things like that easier.

12
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.410
Now you could say why would I change that,

13
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:55.160
this looks fine and I would agree but if we go down to the navigation for example, right here to our

14
00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.470
main navigation right there, where we have our calculation right here with the pixels in it,

15
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.740
well I'm not sure if that's the best way to create your website because wouldn't it be great to make

16
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.740
sure our navigation items, so these items right here, are aligned the way they are right now

17
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.870
but without having this strange calculation right there which is not nice to change and which definitely

18
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.280
is not the best way to write our code right here.

19
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.930
The same thing is true for the main.css and the customers.css file.

20
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.240
For example, if we scroll down here to testimonial info, we have the display inline block repeated right

21
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.300
here and right there

22
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.500
and that's also part of the code that I would like to get rid of. We will not even look at the start

23
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.710
hosting file, this CSS file because Max will show you how to change this with the so-called grid

24
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.910
in the next module,

25
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.340
so this is not something we'll focus on to now.

26
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.860
So our goal basically is to make the code right here leaner or better in the shared.css file,

27
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.240
for example this one

28
00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.640
and also get rid of all our display

29
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:06.050
inline block declarations or properties, like this one right here, that we have.

30
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.400
So that's the current situation of our website basically,

31
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:15.900
we also have for example right here some minor issues where we can see that the free plans are aligned

32
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.490
vertically, that's working

33
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:23.360
but as you can see this right premium plan, right here, is a little bit smaller than the free plan,

34
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.350
so I would also like to have these plans on the same level.

35
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.280
So these are all the small things I would like to change,

36
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.370
I would like to get rid of the display inline block declaration,

37
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.030
I would like to make sure that small issues like these are changed and therefore, I would like to show

38
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:45.540
you what flexbox is, how it works and how we can use it to make our code leaner and more efficient

39
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.270
in the end and better to read and interpret. Therefore, what we have to do right now is we have to understand

40
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.440
what flexbox actually is.

41
00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.680
Now let's have a look at that in the next lecture.
