00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:07.960
So now that we learned the basics about how we can work with Javascript and CSS, I want to prepare

2
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:16.540
our project to become real responsive by adding a side navigation, essentially a side navigation bar that

3
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:22.930
should open when we click a to be added button here in our main toolbar at the top that should open

4
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:29.380
whenever we click this button to allow us to navigate to packages, customers and so on from there. Because

5
00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:36.640
later in the course, in the next module actually, we'll start turning our page into a responsive web page,

6
00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.410
so that it looks good on mobile devices too.

7
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.810
Right now, if we decrease the size, it starts to look ugly and we definitely need to change that.

8
00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:51.290
Therefore having such a side navigation is already a great first step and that's why we'll add it now.

9
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.480
For this, again you'll find some code attached to this video,

10
00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:07.170
the first code snippet is HTML code which you should add below your main nav header here in your index.html

11
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.990
file in the root project folder,

12
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:17.040
so between the closing of header and in front of the main section, add the HTML code you find attached

13
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.000
to this video,

14
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.140
this nav element.

15
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:28.140
Now here, you actually see we got a nav HTML element with a bunch of classes on the nested elements

16
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.330
and then our links to packages, customers and start hosting

17
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.100
which you don't really have yet but which we'll add soon. You also need some CSS code for this

18
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.810
to work and you'll find that code attached to this video too,

19
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.200
that should be added to shared.css file, add it anywhere in that file, I'll add it below my other 

20
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.720
CSS code, my other navigation code, excuse me, in front of the buttons though.

21
00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:01.080
Here are a bunch of mobile nav CSS classes which essentially give this mobile navigation a nice look,

22
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:09.390
you see here we also use just fixed, set index with height of 100vh to ensure that it always takes the

23
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.870
full page height without the 100% cascading trick

24
00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.550
and yes essentially that's it.

25
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:25.280
Now what do we also need to do for that to work correctly is we need to add some selectors to our other

26
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.780
class selectors we got in the shared.css file,

27
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:36.470
let's start with the main nav item anchor tag selector here.

28
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:45.300
Now this link style also should be applied to our .mobile-nav__item

29
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:52.230
anchor tag so that the links in our mobile navigation also look good.

30
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.030
Next up, we got our CTA style here,

31
00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.070
our call to action button.

32
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.960
Here I'll also add another style with a comma

33
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.340
separated again,

34
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:12.090
mobile-nav__item--cta anchor tag should also receive that style and now last but

35
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.670
not least, here our main nav CTA hovered active styles,

36
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:26.070
here I'll also add mobile-nav__item--cta anchor hover and then the

37
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.960
same just for the active style, like this.

38
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.540
With that if we save all of that and we reload,

39
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.410
we don't actually see anything because if we go back to the shared file,

40
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:45.520
you will see that the mobile nav by default has a display of none. Let's remove that temporarily and

41
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.790
let's reload

42
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.400
and this is what it will look like,

43
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.520
not super pretty because it's way too big,

44
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.150
it will look good on smaller devices later.

45
00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.760
This is what we'll actually work on though, we'll change the styling then to ensure that it looks good,

46
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:09.890
we want to ensure that on small devices, like maybe here this iPhone, it looks nice. It doesn't right now,

47
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.890
we'll work on this in the next module,

48
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.130
we can already work on showing this upon the click of a button though.

49
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:25.330
So let's add display none again and let's add a button which allows us to show that side navigation

50
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.060
when we click on it as a next step.

51
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:34.030
Now that button which I want to add also is added by adding some HTML code which you find attached to

52
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.510
this video and you should add that code in the main navigation now,

53
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:47.260
here right in front of our uHost brand inside the div but outside of the anchor tag, next to the

54
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.690
anchor tag, this button code should be added.

55
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.670
If you reload, you should see this strange button,

56
00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:02.360
now it'll also need some styling to look good and that styling can also be found attached to this video.

57
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.690
Now you can add it anywhere you want, since it is placed next to the brand,

58
00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.840
I will also add the styling next to the brand,

59
00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.200
maybe here

60
00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.840
and it should be this toggle button class

61
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.160
and then the two other toggle button related classes.

62
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.360
Now what is this doing here?

63
00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:26.680
This is just creating a button which has a fixed width with a background which should be transparent,

64
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:35.410
no padding top and bottom but aligning in the middle to its neighbor elements and here,

65
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:44.420
I also want to have a width 100% for the bars inside the button. If you inspect the HTML code again,

66
00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:50.110
you see we can get three spans inside of the button which have this toggle button bar class.

67
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.170
Now this class is targeted with this selector

68
00:05:53.170 --> 00:06:01.210
and there, we give them the width of the button, a height, then a background color of black and then also

69
00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:06.210
a margin to the top and bottom, so that the bars are separated from each other,

70
00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.160
they also are display block.

71
00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:12.970
If we save that and we reload, we get this hamburger menu icon here.

72
00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:19.750
Now this looks strange here for the single reason that we guy gave this button a width of 3rem but for

73
00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:25.580
our navigation here where we calculate its width, we're deducting,

74
00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:32.640
well not enough, this anyways is code that definitely needs to improve and we will improve it.

75
00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:39.580
For now, let's simply increase that, now 3rem would be 48 pixels by default,

76
00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.090
so let's change this to 122 pixels and reload,

77
00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:45.980
now it's back inline and yes this is bad code,

78
00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.470
we will improve this.

79
00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:51.300
Now one thing I also need to improve is I need to add vertical align

80
00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:56.920
middle to the main header brand element here. With that if we reload,

81
00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.540
this is now centered in the middle next to the button.

82
00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:02.540
Now this button here should be clickable and when we

83
00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.500
click it, that side navigation should open. With it all prepared

84
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:11.920
now, let's work on that opening part for which we will use Javascript in the next lecture.
