00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:08,600
Welcome to another module. Let's dive deeper into CSS and if we were to give this module a lot different

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,270
title, it would probably be working with boxes

3
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:19,410
and after this module, you'll also know why. Specifically we'll dive into the box model,

4
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:25,610
a core part of CSS, really easy to understand thankfully but really important to know too, so that

5
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:26,890
is what we'll start with.

6
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:32,060
We'll then have a look at how we can actually change the height and width of elements,

7
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:38,300
we'll have a look at the display property which helps us with layouting our page and positioning elements

8
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:45,650
next to each other for example and we'll also dive into properties worth to remember. I mentioned that

9
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:51,170
there is this complete reference of properties and CSS features which you can always consult if

10
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:56,770
you want to dive deeper but there is a common set of properties you work with a lot,

11
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,660
so I want to share some of the properties I personally find to be the most important ones.

12
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:08,420
And finally, we'll have a look at these pseudo classes and elements I already mentioned in the last

13
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,440
core section,

14
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:13,490
now we'll learn what they are and what you can do with them.

15
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:17,630
So with that, let's just get started and let's continue working on our webpage.
