00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:04.520
So welcome back to another module with me,

2
00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:11.640
CSS and Javascript. This course of course is about CSS and we'll focus on CSS,

3
00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:19.020
this won't become a Javascript course but still, you can interact with CSS with Javascript.

4
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:26.060
You can change styles after the page was loaded and there are cases where you actually need to do this,

5
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.160
in our project too.

6
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:35.660
You will see that we've got two cases, two things we can introduce, we can add to features, we can add

7
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.540
to our project by taking advantage of Javascript's capabilities.

8
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.070
So in this module, we'll learn how we may manipulate styles with Javascript,

9
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:53.360
so how we can change the styling of an element after our page has been loaded and you will also learn

10
00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:00.610
how you can, in cases where you don't want to directly manipulate styles, how you can add or remove CSS

11
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.900
classes with Javascript.

12
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:09.550
These are two core features that all of a sudden allow you to change styles during runtime.

13
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.040
So let's dive right into this

14
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.080
and let's add some examples to our course project.
