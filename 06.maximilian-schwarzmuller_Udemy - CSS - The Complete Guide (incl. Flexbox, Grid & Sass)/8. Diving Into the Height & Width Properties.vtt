00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.270
Enough about the shorthands, let's go back to code.

2
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.880
I will remove the margin border

3
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.700
and for now also the padding of the product overview.

4
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.140
So if we save this and reload, we're back to where we were, well with one difference,

5
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:24.100
we no longer have the margin implied by the body, that whitespace to the top is coming from the h1 element.

6
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.950
Now we can also set something different,

7
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:34.540
we can set a width and a height. So on that product overview, we can set the width to 100% for example,

8
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.490
to tell it to take the full entire width of this page.

9
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:45.370
Now if we reload, we don't really see a change because that was its default behavior anyways because

10
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:53.110
sections like divs or like h1 elements are block level elements. Now this is some HTML feature not related

11
00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.650
to CSS but it's important to keep in mind,

12
00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:03.850
block level elements unlike inline elements like anchor tags for example, block level elements always

13
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.560
take the full available width by default.

14
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.870
So width 100% actually doesn't do anything,

15
00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:16.000
if we set it something different than 100% though, let's say to 50, then we can see that if we reload,

16
00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:23.290
this shrinks our box to 50% of the width of the surrounding container.

17
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:29.080
Here it looks like 50% of the page width and it is the case but that's simply happening because

18
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.700
the surrounding container is a main element, which also is a block level element, which therefore has

19
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.760
a width of 100%. So 50% of the surrounding container which has 100% of the page width

20
00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:47.590
yields 50% of the page width here too but if the main element had a lower width too, then the section would

21
00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.430
only get half of that.

22
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:57.490
So width can be used either with percentages or of course with absolute values, like 300 pixels.

23
00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.020
This is also possible

24
00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.590
and this shrinks the box,

25
00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.230
if I increase that to let's say 700,

26
00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.620
you'll see it gets bigger, like that.

27
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.070
So this is the width we can set and this will become important throughout the course because we don't want

28
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.280
all elements to be 100% of the page width,

29
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.000
we can also set the height of course. Now for the height,

30
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.310
it's tricky, if you set height 100% and you expect it to now get the height of the full page, well

31
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.980
you're going to be sad, as you can see, it now only got a little bit bigger,

32
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.800
the only thing it now does is it includes the height of the margin, of the h1 element.

33
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:48.380
The reason for that is that 100% refers to the available height given by the parent container.

34
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:54.230
Now if you hover over the main container, you could see the blue area is much bigger than the tiny

35
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.020
bit on a red box grow by

36
00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:04.480
but that area, that height of the main element is calculated dynamically by the content it holds,

37
00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.160
so it's only as big as its content requires it to be.

38
00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.790
Now that of course creates kind of an infinite loop, if we say a part of the content should be 100%

39
00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:20.240
of the size of the main area and the main area says I'm only as big as I need to be, then the 100%

40
00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.360
basically has no effect.

41
00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:28.650
If you wanted it to have an effect, you would need to change the height of the main area too.

42
00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.260
So if I do this here in the developer tools which only will change it temporarily until we refresh

43
00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:40.050
the page, I could set the height of the main area to let's say 500 pixels

44
00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:47.900
and if we do that, you can inspect the section here and you will see on the top left you can see it,

45
00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.270
that it now has a height of 500 pixels,

46
00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.890
exactly the height we set on the main area.

47
00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:01.400
So if we give this an explicit height, then the child, if we use percentages, we'll again refer to that

48
00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:09.220
just as it's the case with the width. If we set the height of the main area to 100%, we're now referring

49
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.270
to its parent which is the body

50
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.680
and that again is only as big as it needs to be,

51
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.730
so we got the same situation as before.

52
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:23.170
So only if we set the body to height 100% too and we do the same for HTML which is the parent

53
00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.960
of the body, which is only as big as it needs to be,

54
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:34.060
so now if we set this to 100% on HTML too, now we finally get a red area that is just as

55
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:41.590
big as our page because now starting at the HTML element which now refers to the overall window

56
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:49.380
if we set height to 100%, we pass the relative height of 100% down to that section.

57
00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:56.980
So if you ever want to style the height of an element relative to the height of your page, you need to

58
00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:04.830
create such a chain where you pass the page height down. In the dimensions and units section later in the course,

59
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:12.190
we'll also learn about a different more modern unit which allows you to achieve this a bit easier, with

60
00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.120
worse browser support though

61
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:20.500
but for now, this is a cool trick to keep in mind, how you can set the height to 100%.

62
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:26.990
Now this is not necessarily what I want to do here though, I can simply set this to an absolute value,

63
00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:35.920
for example we could set this to a value of let's say 528 pixels, if we now reload, this is the size

64
00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:41.090
our red area has. I'll also set the width back to 100%,

65
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.200
though I could omit this because that's the default anyways

66
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.570
but for now, I'll leave it here so that we have that for reference.

67
00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:54.550
So that is how width and height work in general, we can use them with percentages or pixels or other

68
00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:56.760
units which we'll cover later

69
00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:03.540
but there's actually a bit more to width and height especially if we consider the box model.

70
00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.470
Let's dive into that in the next lecture.
