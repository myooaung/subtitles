There's one last thing with fliping effects like this one, where we're effectively flipping a box. Right

2
00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.100
now, we see the back of the box like this.

3
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:23.280
We can change that behavior by going to the element, for example box one, the red box and adding backface

4
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.040
visibility here,

5
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.240
now we can hide the backface with hidden. If we do that

6
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.170
and we now reload,

7
00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.830
you see it's gone, it's gone because we're telling it 

8
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.240
'hey if you're flipping and you're seeing your back, please don't show anything'.

9
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.840
We can also set backface visibility to visible,

10
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.380
that's the alternative.

11
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.000
Now that's the default also, so we don't need to set this, it's just something I want to bring to your

12
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.300
attention, if you want to hide in the back of an element whilst it's flipping, use backface visibility

13
00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.940
hidden.

14
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.680
Now all these properties do have a different level of browser support,

15
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.610
so definitely check the last lecture of this module to find out if your favorite feature is supported

16
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.690
in the browsers

17
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:13.590
you need to support.
