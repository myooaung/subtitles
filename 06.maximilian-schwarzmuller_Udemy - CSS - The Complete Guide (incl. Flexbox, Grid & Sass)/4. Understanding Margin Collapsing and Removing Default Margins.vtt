00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:08.960
We had a look at the box model basics with padding, a border and a margin and all these things are of

2
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:09.790
course optional.

3
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.340
You can get a padding and a margin without a border,

4
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.970
you can have a border without a padding and margin, so that's all totally optional

5
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.750
and it leads to that result.

6
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.980
Now I mentioned there would be a couple of special things,

7
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.900
now let's dive into these special things step-by-step.

8
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.780
The first special thing can be seen if you inspect the section.

9
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:36.620
There is some whitespace to the left and to the right, so after the orange margin, this is coming from

10
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:37.810
the body actually.

11
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.650
If you hover over the body, you can see the body also has a default margin, here

12
00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:44.960
the 8 pixels,

13
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.120
that is simply coming from the browser defaults here.

14
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:56.270
So what we can do to help prevent this and to make sure that our elements go directly into the edges

15
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.540
of our page,

16
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.960
we can set that margin to zero with that margin zero command.

17
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.420
If we do that and we reload the page, you see now the body has no longer a margin

18
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:13.290
and therefore if we inspect the section, you indeed see the orange area around it,

19
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:19.430
so its margin directly connects to the edges of the page which means there is no additional space in

20
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:20.170
between.

21
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:27.920
So that was the first special thing, that the body has a margin. Another special thing can be seen if we inspect

22
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.480
the h1 tag in our second section, in the plans section.

23
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:38.720
You see, this has a margin to the top and bottom, the default margin every h1 element has, we can

24
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.580
see here, it's orange.

25
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.750
Now the interesting thing is if we also inspect the section above it,

26
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.860
so the product overview section,

27
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.770
do you see that orange margin at the bottom of it?

28
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.270
Keep in mind where it was.

29
00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.760
If I go back to the h1 tag, it overlaps with that section from the product overview container.

30
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.540
This behavior is called margin collapsing,

31
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.320
it simply means the following,

32
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:12.160
if you got two elements block element with its box model, the margin is the orange part here,

33
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:19.100
if you got two elements next to each other, then margins between them are actually collapsed to one margin,

34
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.930
the bigger margin wins.

35
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.340
This is not a bug,

36
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.770
this is on purpose.

37
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:32.940
This is there or this is enforced by CSS to ensure that you don't get two big distances between the

38
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:33.880
elements.

39
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.570
Now you could argue, hey leave that up to me,

40
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:37.790
I'll take care of that

41
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.980
but that's simply not how CSS works,

42
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.390
so it is something to be aware of. To work around this, 

43
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:49.980
it's a good practice to use either margin top or margin bottom unless you don't worry about this

44
00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.180
collapsing occurring which of course also can be the case.

45
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.660
So in our case, we got some collapsing, it's not really a problem because we've got a fine distance

46
00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.230
between the elements,

47
00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.270
I just want to highlight it here so that you don't wonder what's going on here.
