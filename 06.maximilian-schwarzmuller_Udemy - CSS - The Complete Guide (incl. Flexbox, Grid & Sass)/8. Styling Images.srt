00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:05,560
In the last lectures, we worked a lot with background images

2
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:12,150
and for a good reason because positioning background images really gives you a lot of flexibility.

3
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:15,940
It's actually harder to style normal images as you will see,

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:20,160
so let's dive into that because it's harder but of course not impossible.

5
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,460
Let's start with a logo for our page.

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,200
Right now, we only have text here,

7
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,620
why don't we use an image instead?

8
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,860
For that, I'll go to my index.html file

9
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:38,530
first of all and here where I have uHost in my anchor tag, I'll actually add an image element. Now

10
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:43,400
we can enter any alt text we want, doesn't really matter for our styling here,

11
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:43,930
so I'll name it

12
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:48,280
uHost, your favorite hosting company

13
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:53,160
and now for the source, we need an image. Now attached to this video,

14
00:00:53,300 --> 00:01:01,550
you'll find the uHost icon which I'll put into the images folder here and I will also move my freedom

15
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,510
image in there by the way

16
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:10,970
and with that added, I first of all will quickly adjust the link here to freedom, to images/freedom

17
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,420
but more importantly in the index.html file,

18
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:21,650
I'll now also link to my newly added icon here, so I'll add

19
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:26,210
images/uhost icon.png. If we save all files and we reload,

20
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:32,810
yes it's a relatively big icon I'd say, at least we can clearly see it but it might be a little bit

21
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:35,460
too big for our page here.

22
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,730
So we definitely need to style that

23
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:43,580
and that's exactly what I want to do in this video. I'll style it in the shared.css file because it's

24
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:50,540
part of our shared header and now there, we can have a look at our brand styling.

25
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,650
If we scroll through our existing styles,

26
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:58,090
here is the main header, brand.

27
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:04,920
Now we set a text color, a text decoration and also font weight and size.

28
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:13,710
Now actually, we can leave that in case the alt text is shown but I want to change the way my image

29
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,620
is displayed.

30
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:23,710
Now one thing you could think is that we simply want to give it a let's say a height of 22 pixels to

31
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,990
be inline with our font size,

32
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:36,810
if we do that and we reload our page, yes didn't have too much effect, did it? The reason is and that's

33
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:44,010
important that by setting a height on a container and keep in mind, main header brand is just the container,

34
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,200
not the image element itself.

35
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,510
By setting a height on the container, the image will not be affected because the default behavior and

36
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,620
that's really important now,

37
00:02:52,610 --> 00:03:00,210
the default behavior is if you enter an image tag and you point to an image, then the default height

38
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:05,490
and width of the original image will be used and will be entered into your document, no matter which

39
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:08,370
width and height you set for the surrounding element.

40
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:15,690
So in our case here if we have a look at our image, you'll see it it has dimensions of 186 x 190.

41
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:21,750
If we hover over the anchor tag, we actually can see on the left that the blue area is much smaller

42
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:26,690
than that but the image doesn't care. To make the image care,

43
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:29,580
we can of course follow two routes.

44
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,230
First of all, we need to select it,

45
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,590
that's always the case.

46
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:35,400
So let's use our main header brand class here

47
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,270
and then let's select the image.

48
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,310
You could of course also add a class to the image, here

49
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:46,150
I will simply use the descendant selector to select any images in main header brand,

50
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:50,680
now in there, we could of course also set a height of 22 pixels.

51
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,420
If we do that and we reload,

52
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:55,800
now we see the image is much smaller.

53
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:02,680
Now besides doing that, what we could do is of course set 100%, this would mean it should take the

54
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:08,670
height of the surrounding container, which happens to be our brand that sets the height of 22 pixels.

55
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,780
However, this does not work.

56
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,220
Height

57
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:20,500
100% on the image will again lead it to use its original height, not the height defined by the container,

58
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:20,820
that's

59
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,530
important to understand,

60
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:27,220
so we should really set the final value we want to have on the image here.

61
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,530
Now let's find out if that's also the case for the width, in case we're not setting the height

62
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:35,280
but let's say we're setting a width of 20 pixels on the surrounding container.

63
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:38,650
If we set nothing on the image, nothing changes,

64
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:44,750
if we go to the image and we set width to 100% and then we reload, also nothing changes.

65
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:51,090
So percentage values on the image don't help us here because they don't respect the surrounding container.

66
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:56,990
Now actually the reason for that simply is that our surrounding container is an inline element itself,

67
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,700
it's just an anchor tag.

68
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:04,020
If we set it to inline block instead and now we reload,

69
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,190
now the image does respect this container style,

70
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:13,080
so it was not the image but the fact that the anchor tag was not a block or inline block element.

71
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,820
As soon as it is, we can use 100%

72
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:21,380
and of course not just on the width but also on the height.

73
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:26,960
So this is important to understand, with using images it depends on whether you use it nested in an

74
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:33,680
inline element, in which case 100% will simply use the default dimension, the default or height

75
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:34,610
of the image

76
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:39,380
or if you use it inside a block level element where it will use the container width or height.

77
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:46,250
So now with that back, we now can set 100% as a height and it will use the height of our

78
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,610
container here.

79
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:57,270
So with that, we style the image and this is about all we can do regarding styling already. All the fancy

80
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:03,840
things we could do for background images, with the different positioning modes and sizing modes, with cover

81
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,090
and so on, are not really possible with normal images.

82
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:13,980
You can always find some hacky solutions with negative paddings or margins to position an image in

83
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,200
a certain way,

84
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:25,140
for example here, we could go to our image here and give it a margin top of let's say -5 pixels

85
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:31,330
and if we do that, then you see it was actually moved up a tiny bit but that really is about it

86
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:34,790
and it's as I said, also a bit hacky.

87
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:41,670
Now therefore if you want to do some more complex styling on an image, I recommend using background

88
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:42,300
image.

89
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:47,740
The downside of background image just is as it's not part of your normal document flow,

90
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:52,440
it doesn't have its own HTML elements that clearly signals that it's an image,

91
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,580
it's worse for accessibility.

92
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,880
So background images should really just be used as such,

93
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:03,420
backgrounds. If you got an image in your normal document flow, you should go with the normal image but

94
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:06,750
then you often don't have to set more than the width or the height.

95
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,290
Of course you can still set anything else like borders and so on,

96
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:14,910
I'm just talking about the positioning and sizing where you are limited, regarding all the other things,

97
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,580
you can of course set everything you want.

98
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:22,310
So that was just a tiny exercise though, that was just our brand

99
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:29,610
icon. We got that customers page and there, I actually want to have bigger images. So let's add this page

100
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,870
in the next lecture.
