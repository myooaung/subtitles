00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,580
We had a look at that box model in theory,

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:12,530
let's now work with it and let's work with it by going to our product overview selector here,

3
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:20,060
the ID selector where we have the background and let's add a padding of 20 pixels for example.

4
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,930
So pixels is a unit you can use in CSS,

5
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:27,490
there are other units like percentages and font related units too

6
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,180
but for now let's stick to pixels since they're very easy to understand.

7
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:36,050
So if we add this and save that file, we can reload the page

8
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:39,750
and now we see that there is some spacing around the text.

9
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:47,000
If we now inspect that section again, we can already see it on the left if we hover over it, that there

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,790
are different boxes now

11
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:56,210
and if we now scroll down, we indeed see there is a padding and this time, the padding is even around

12
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:02,440
the margin of the h1 tag which can look strange at first since this wasn't considered previously,

13
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:09,500
it's just that if you add a padding, then the content of the element is to be considered the content

14
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:16,370
plus any margins it might have because padding and margins shouldn't overlap hence the padding is added

15
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:18,910
after the margin of child elements.

16
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,460
So here, we got our padding added, we can hover over it in the box model to see highlighted in the top

17
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,460
left

18
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,070
and of course we can also add a border now.

19
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:35,650
So let's add a border, let's add five pixels black and solid.

20
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:41,570
Now this value might look strange at first, this way of writing a value, we have more than one value,

21
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:43,070
this is called a shorthand,

22
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,120
I'll also dive into this in a second.

23
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:48,300
This is just a shorter way of writing

24
00:01:48,440 --> 00:02:01,410
border style solid, border color black, border width 5 pixels but you could use this notation too. If you

25
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:06,360
add this and reload the page, you'll see a black border around the element

26
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:11,360
and if you again scroll down to your box model, you'll see the 5 pixels here

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,360
and if we hover over it, the border gets highlighted in the top left,

28
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,530
so in the loaded page

29
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,420
too. Now finally, let's add a margin to complete the box model,

30
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:27,930
if we add a margin here, let's say 20 pixels and we save that and then we reload the page one more time,

31
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,230
again if we scroll down, we can see that margin here

32
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:36,470
and if we hover over it, we see that orange margin around our box.

33
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:42,820
We still see some whitespace to the left and right and that is something I'll revisit very soon too

34
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,710
but with that, we see all layers of the box model in action.

35
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:54,780
Now there are a couple of special things you also got to know about the box model and default styles of the

36
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,560
webpage.

37
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,300
So let's dive into these things step-by-step

38
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,400
over the next lectures.
