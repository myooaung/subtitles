00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:09.110
Now that we had a detailed look at 2D transformations, which to be honest are the transformations you'll

2
00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.360
probably use the most often,

3
00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:16.640
let's have a look at 3D transformations now. For this, attached to this video,

4
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:23.540
you'll find a very simple, prepared, demo theory project where we just got a red box in a container with

5
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:24.660
a black border,

6
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.260
this is the markup code for it.

7
00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.920
Now I want you transform this box in a three dimensional way

8
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.300
and for that, we still use the transform property

9
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.600
but now, let's for example look into rotating this again

10
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.680
but now not around the z-axis

11
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.430
but actually around the different axis because the axis will become important here.

12
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:56.180
If we have a look at the three axes we have, we got X, Y and Z, how can we then rotate elements around

13
00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:04.060
these? We can rotate an element around the x-axis with rotateX and now the important part here is the

14
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.650
axis will be in the center of this element,

15
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:13.810
at least if transform origin and is set to center and it spins itself around this x-axis.

16
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:22.490
So here, this will actually rotate the element towards or away from you so to say. For Y, it also rotates

17
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.160
around the y-axis, so it spins around that y-axis,

18
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.670
this is how you can think about that.

19
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.590
And for Z, it spins around the z-axis

20
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.690
but the z-axis kind of pierces the element coming from the back and going through the middle of

21
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:36.180
it,

22
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.020
this is why this leads to a 2D transformation even though you might think that for Z, it should

23
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.660
be highly three dimensional because that z-axis is that third dimension

24
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.430
but if you keep in mind that that axis kind of pierces the element and the element spins around that axis,

25
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.830
then it makes way more sense.

26
00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:03.710
So rotateY and X are actually the two functions that we can use to create 3D rotations. For other functions,

27
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.460
it's different but for rotate, this is how it is,

28
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.300
so let's use them. Back in our project,

29
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:16.160
let's use rotateX for example on the box and let's enter 30 degrees here.

30
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.430
If we save that, let's reload our page,

31
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.300
now it looks like as if the box simply shrank

32
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.700
but what's actually happening here is it's becoming smaller because it's rotating towards you.

33
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:38.510
Now this becomes even clearer if we enter a value, like animate, some text into that box.

34
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:46.640
Let's give that text a white color, font family sans-serif simply because it doesn't look as ugly and

35
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.570
let's align it in the center, at least horizontally.

36
00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.300
Now if we reload, we got animate here as a text,

37
00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:01.330
now this becomes even clearer if we actually increase the rotation to let's say 80 degree.

38
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.360
Now this is almost invisible

39
00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:10.370
and if we increase this to 90 degree, it's totally invisible simply because it's now right at the point

40
00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.800
where it's about to flip on that x-axis.

41
00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:20.700
So if we enter 100 degrees here, then it just flipped which is the reason why animate is now at the bottom,

42
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.100
it flipped around the axis now.

43
00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.410
This should prove that we're talking about a 3D transformation here.

44
00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.380
So now with that, we get a basic 3D transformation,

45
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:36.440
let's now also add rotateY and let's set this to 30 degrees for example.

46
00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:43.140
Now we're also rotating around the y-axis, which is the reason why if you reload, it looks like that,

47
00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.060
now it's rotating towards you and around the y-axis.

48
00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:55.070
Now this effect becomes clearer if we reset rotateX to 0 degrees for now, so that we get no X rotation.

49
00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.700
Now you can see, it's again looking a bit squeezed here,

50
00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.090
if we increase rotateY to 80 degrees,

51
00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.420
so right before it flips,

52
00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:11.890
now you see it's almost impossible to read because now it's almost rotated around the y-axis.

53
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.710
Now right now, we're always looking at this from the same distance,

54
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.240
you can actually change this.
