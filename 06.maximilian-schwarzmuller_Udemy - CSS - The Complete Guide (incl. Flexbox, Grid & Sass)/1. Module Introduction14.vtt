Welcome back to another module with me, Max. In this module, we'll dive into the CSS grid, a technology

2
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.690
which allows us to create highly customizable, more complex page layouts.

3
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:24.330
Now in the last module, Manuel walked you through CSS flexbox which also is related to laying things

4
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.180
out and positioning things and therefore in this module, we will not only learn CSS grid but of course,

5
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.710
I'll also dive into how it relates to flexbox

6
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:41.820
and when you may use which. To be precise, in this module, we'll first of all dive into what CSS grid is

7
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:42.820
in detail,

8
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:49.290
then we'll have a look at the different properties and values that are connected to the CSS grid concept

9
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.140
and there are a lot as you will learn, so we'll learn a lot in this module

10
00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.660
and as I just mentioned, I'll also clarify when you should use grid and when you may use flexbox and how the two

11
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.850
relate. And with that, let's dive right into it and let's get started with understanding what the CSS

12
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.860
grid really is and how it helps us.
