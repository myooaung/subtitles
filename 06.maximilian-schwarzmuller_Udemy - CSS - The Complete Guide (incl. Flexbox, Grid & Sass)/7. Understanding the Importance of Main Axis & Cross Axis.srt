1
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:09,720
So what happened here, what did we do by applying flex direction to our parent element, to our flex container

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,610
and what does this have to do with the main axis and the cross axis?

3
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,010
Well this is our starting point, right,

4
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:24,570
we had our flex container and we applied the flex direction property with a value of row.

5
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:31,310
Now what happened then is, basically this is the default value as I said, is that our starting point for

6
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:38,930
the main axis is the left top corner of our element basically or of our website.

7
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:45,290
Now if the main axis goes from the top left to the top right, well then the cross axis which, that's

8
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:52,670
important, always has the same starting point as the main axis goes from the top left to the bottom left

9
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:53,980
corner of course.

10
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:59,720
So that's basically the default behavior, how our flex items are displayed then. They are displayed in

11
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,260
a row,

12
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:09,740
so along the main axis and from left to right. Now in addition to row, we also applied another value,

13
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,270
we applied flex direction row

14
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,930
reverse and if we think about the way row behaves,

15
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:22,460
so from the top left to the top right for the main axis, then row reverse simply behaves the other way

16
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,230
round.

17
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:29,120
It starts in the right top corner and goes to the left top corner and the cross axis starts also in

18
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,320
the right top corner,

19
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:36,030
as I said, they always have the same starting point and goes to the right bottom corner.

20
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:40,960
That's actually the first thing we have to understand about these two axis,

21
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:48,830
we have a main axis and a cross axis and depending on the value we apply to the flex direction property,

22
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:54,250
the starting point and the finishing point of these two axis changes.

23
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:58,850
Now let's go back to the code and play around with that a bit to really get a better feeling for it

24
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:05,150
because right here, we have our flex direction which is still row and the flex wrap is set to wrap which

25
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,650
is totally fine.

26
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:13,410
Now in our code, if we increase the size and reload it,

27
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:19,110
so what we can see right here is that the first flex item, so this one right here, starts in the top

28
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,150
left corner.

29
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:24,930
You will see in a few seconds why this is the top left corner and the flex direction is row, so

30
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,340
it goes from the left to the right

31
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,200
right here.

32
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,350
So this is the main axis now

33
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:38,390
and if we now reduce the size so that the wrap takes place, it simply wraps along the cross axis,

34
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,410
so from the top to the bottom

35
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:47,160
but as we can see, the first flex item is still on the top and still part of the top left corner right

36
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,060
here.

37
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:56,390
Now let's increase the width and let's now change the flex direction from row to row reverse. With

38
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:03,420
that if we go back and reload the page, we can see that the behavior changed because the way our main

39
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:10,350
axis and cross axis are defined also changed because now the starting point for both axis is the

40
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:14,280
top right corner of our flex container

41
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:21,330
but if I now reduce the width, as you can see it right here, the first flex item stays on top because keep

42
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:27,270
in mind, the starting point is still the top right corner but all the other elements are then aligned

43
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:29,070
along the cross axis,

44
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,350
so from top to bottom right there.

45
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:36,690
So that's what we have to understand now basically, with this flex direction, we can have an impact onto

46
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:43,010
this main and cross axis and this is only flex direction row and row reverse

47
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:47,070
but we also had flex direction column and column reverse.

48
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:52,650
Now let's go back to the slide and have a look at the theoretical concept behind these now because what

49
00:03:52,650 --> 00:04:00,180
happened now if we again take our flex container and now apply flex direction column? Well then and that's

50
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,720
also another important thing,

51
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:07,350
the starting point is exactly the same that we had before for flex direction row,

52
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,420
it's still the top left corner

53
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:19,320
but now the main axis as you can see goes from top to bottom and the cross axis goes from left to right

54
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:25,830
and that's really crucial to understand because we will need that concept throughout this module. The flex direction

55
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:30,610
basically defines if our main axis is the row,

56
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:38,100
so from left to right or right to left with row reverse or if the main axis is from top to bottom or,

57
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:43,800
that's the second thing we can see right now, if we add flex direction column reverse or from bottom

58
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,180
to top, starting from the left lower corner.

59
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:54,810
So that's the tricky thing right here maybe but it's actually quite easy to remember. If the flex direction

60
00:04:54,930 --> 00:05:01,920
is row, then the starting point is the top left corner and the row defines the main axis. With

61
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:07,890
row reverse, the starting point is the right top corner and the main axis is of course the row. If the flex

62
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:12,620
direction is column, then the starting point is again the top left corner

63
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:17,640
but the main axis now goes as the direction indicates, along the column

64
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:23,340
and if we have column reverse, then the starting point is the bottom left corner and the main axis is

65
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,080
again the column.

66
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:31,380
Now let's also have a look at that in our practical example now because right here, if we go to

67
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:40,020
our flex container and now change the flex direction from row reverse to column like that and reload our

68
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,920
page right here, you can see exactly what we just saw on the slide.

69
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:52,300
The main axis now starts in the top left corner and the items are aligned along the main axis.

70
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,580
Now that's important,

71
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,540
the main axis now goes from top to bottom.

72
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:05,970
If I would go back now and change it to column reverse like that and reload the page again, then the starting

73
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:08,520
point is the bottom left corner right here

74
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:14,980
and as we can see, the items are again aligned along our main axis which is

75
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,690
now this one right here.

76
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:21,160
So with that, we saw the core concept behind flex direction,

77
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:25,530
it allows you to define the way our elements are displayed

78
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:34,140
and really important, to also specify the main and the cross axis and the main and cross axis is a really

79
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:40,230
important concept that we need to understand now because it has an impact onto other properties we

80
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:47,790
can use. If we for example go back right here and change our flex direction to row again, like that and

81
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:55,020
now go back and reload the page, we could already see that if I increase the width, that the elements, so the height

82
00:06:55,050 --> 00:07:00,920
of the elements, simply adjust to the largest elements, so the one with the largest height you could say

83
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:04,830
and well so far, we simply accepted this behavior

84
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:10,680
but the thing is that we can change this behavior, so also the height and default behavior our elements

85
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,640
have right here.

86
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:18,470
For that, we need additional properties and we need to understand the concept of main versus cross axis.

87
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:24,270
Well the latter one is something we understood now but now it's time to have a look at these other properties

88
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:25,450
we could apply now.
