00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:07,190
Enough off cross-browser problems, unsupported features,

2
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:08,990
let's think about our code,

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,680
how should we actually name our class names? As you saw in this course,

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:19,980
the class selector is probably the selector you used the most often because it allows you to create reusable

5
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:26,640
styles and even if you only apply a class to one element, you can give it a really expressive name which

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,630
makes it far easier to understand your CSS code.

7
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,350
Here are some dos and donts when it comes to class names. Dos;

8
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,090
use kebab case,

9
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:42,550
so this is class name style where you use lowercase characters and separate words with dashes.

10
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,080
It's important because CSS is case insensitive,

11
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:52,140
so if you use snake case for example, where you have one word and separate the words with uppercase characters,

12
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,910
this is not something CSS understands,

13
00:00:54,990 --> 00:01:00,720
for CSS, snake case with a capital C is the same as snake case with a lowercase c.

14
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:06,600
So if you got two classes with the same name and you think they are different, they aren't and this can

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,490
lead to strange behaviors.

16
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:15,480
Additionally since you can't use this snake case version, you would have to use really long words without

17
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,740
any separators which are hard to read,

18
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,300
so use kebab case,

19
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:23,390
it's easy to read, easy to understand and the browser understands it too.

20
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,050
Another important hint,

21
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:30,520
name your classes by feature, for example page title.

22
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:33,660
It's very clear what this style will do,

23
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,540
we don't know which element your page title is,

24
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,650
if it's h1, h2 or a div

25
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,190
but this doesn't matter,

26
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:44,090
we know that this probably will refer to the page title.

27
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:47,850
Don't name your classes by the style they're going to apply,

28
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:50,360
for example title blue is a really bad name.

29
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:57,910
Yes, we can guess that this probably will color the title with a blue color but we can see that by the

30
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:01,630
properties and values you then use in that rule anyways

31
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:07,130
and if you ever change the color of your text to be red, then you probably have to rename your class.

32
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,390
So this is a really bad class name,

33
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,290
name them by feature instead.

34
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,690
In this course,

35
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:21,620
I actually try to follow a convention which is called Block Element Modifier styles, BEM.

36
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:28,570
This is a convention which makes sure that we name our classes in a uniform and consistent way across

37
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:36,160
our project and that we also prevent clashes because as you can imagine, the bigger your project gets,

38
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:43,840
the higher the chance of you reusing some class name unintentionally and all of a sudden, you might overwrite

39
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,750
the style somewhere else in your page without you noticing it at first.

40
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:54,900
Therefore BEM enforces a certain way of naming are classes which should minimize this risk.

41
00:02:54,910 --> 00:03:01,510
You obviously start with a dot in the selector but then you have the block portion of the name, two underscores,

42
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,610
the element portion,

43
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:07,090
maybe two dashes and then an optional modifier.

44
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,590
Here is an example,

45
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:18,650
here we got a selector which selects the menu main item which is big or which has a big size.

46
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:24,550
The block here is our main menu, hence menu main, you could of course also name this main menu,

47
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:31,580
we select a single item in that main menu and we select an item which is very big, which should receive

48
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,560
some special style because it's big.

49
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:41,090
The last part, the modifier kind of goes against this rule of not naming classes by style but in the

50
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:41,240
end,

51
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,770
this is not the entire class name,

52
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,500
the whole thing here is the entire class name.

53
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,110
Here's another example,

54
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:55,670
we got a selector which selects a button which has no special element, so all buttons but which also

55
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,800
has the success modifier.

56
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:04,730
Now mastering this is something which is very hard obviously and you can probably flame me for some

57
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:10,460
of the class names used here but if you follow this pattern in general, you already gain a lot.

58
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:14,700
If we have a look at our source code here, you'll see I try to follow this,

59
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,600
we got a main header here,

60
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:24,500
we got the toggle button and then we got a sub-element in the toggle button, so these horizontal bars

61
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,690
in the hamburger button.

62
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:32,900
We got the brand in the main header and so on, so this is the idea, here we got a call to action modifier

63
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,300
on the main nav item.

64
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:40,770
These classes look a bit ugly but they really help you prevent clashes of class names

65
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:48,140
and once you get into the idea of these class names, they also help you understand what a certain class

66
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,570
selector is probably referring to.
