00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,320
So, what is this course all about?
1

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:10,570
Let's have a look at the outline now, because the course offers you three different tracks right here:
2

3
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:14,130
the basic track, the advanced track and the expert track.
3

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,900
Now what's the reason for that? With these different tracks,
4

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:21,220
we offer different entry points depending on your CSS skills.
5

6
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:21,940
Now no worries.
6

7
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,090
You can start the course right here,
7

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,620
it builds up on the knowledge step-by-step
8

9
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:32,560
but in case you already have some advanced or expert knowledge, you can jump in later to really dive
9

10
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,980
into the topics of your interest.
10

11
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:37,910
Now with that, let's have a look at the basic track now
11

12
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:43,570
because at the moment, we are almost done with getting started. After that, Max will have a look at the
12

13
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:48,250
basics of CSS and after that, dive even deeper into these basics.
13

14
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,100
So we will talk about core concepts like selectors or the box model, for example.
14

15
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:59,470
After that, in the next module, we will round up this basic knowledge by answering some common questions
15

16
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:02,810
like, "Should I use an ID or a class selector?"
16

17
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,980
With that, it's time to practice what we applied so far, we've worked on the project up to this point,
17

18
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:08,890
no worries
18

19
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:14,460
but now we will apply all the knowledge we gained so far and make sure to give all the different pages
19

20
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,550
on our website
20

21
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,660
a nice styling. After that,
21

22
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:24,190
I will take over and have a look at positioning. Positioning simply means that we are able to change
22

23
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:27,770
the position of our elements on the website.
23

24
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:33,820
Now with that, the basic track is done. Now we can continue right here with the next module; backgrounds
24

25
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:34,630
and images
25

26
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:40,740
or if you are an advanced user, you can jump in right here into the course. In the backgrounds and
26

27
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,720
images module, we'll have a look at
27

28
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,560
the style of backgrounds and images;
28

29
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,980
so these two different concepts,
29

30
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:49,260
how we can add them, how we can style them?
30

31
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:53,720
After that, I will have a look at dimensions, sizes and units together with you.
31

32
00:01:53,910 --> 00:02:01,790
Following that, Max will have a look at the way JavaScript can manipulate the CSS styles applied
32

33
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:05,140
to a website. Following that JavaScript part,
33

34
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:08,620
we are almost done with the core structure of our website.
34

35
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:16,750
Therefore, it's then time to dive into responsive design, because up to this point, we will have created a desktop
35

36
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:23,110
website and although this is awesome, we also want to make sure that users who use a smartphone for example,
36

37
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:28,250
to visit our website also experience a very beautiful styling.
37

38
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:33,970
Now with the responsive design implemented, we'll have a look at forms; so we will learn how to add a
38

39
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:38,470
form to a website and also how to add some cool styling to it.
39

40
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:44,110
Finally in the last module of the advanced track, we will have a look at text and fonts, because using the
40

41
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:47,750
default fonts is OK but we don't want OK, we want
41

42
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:48,580
awesome!
42

43
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:54,790
So with the advanced track being finished, we will continue with the expert track and this track will
43

44
00:02:54,790 --> 00:03:03,070
begin with Flexbox; an awesome tool or concept that allows us to dynamically change the way our elements
44

45
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:06,820
are positioned and displayed on our website.
45

46
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:14,080
After that, we'll have a look at the CSS Grid; a rather new CSS feature and very important, not the
46

47
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:20,710
same thing as Flexbox but we will have a look at the way CSS Grid works and also look at the differences
47

48
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,030
between Flexbox and the Grid.
48

49
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:28,960
After the grid, it's time to have a look at transformations, because by adding transformations to
49

50
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:35,050
our website, which allow us to, for example, rotate our elements, is also a really nice
50

51
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:35,570
feature
51

52
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,950
we should definitely learn about. Now with the transformations,
52

53
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:44,490
we'll also have a look at transitions and animations in the next module, because these are the features
53

54
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:51,340
that increase user feedback and therefore make browsing our website an even better experience.
54

55
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,210
Now with that, we are almost done with the course,
55

56
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,790
there are only two modules left. In the next module,
56

57
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:04,900
we'll have a look at writing future-proof CSS code, because we learned already that CSS is constantly
57

58
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,720
evolving,
58

59
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:13,690
therefore we want to make sure to stay updated and to write future-proof CSS code already today.
59

60
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:21,890
The last thing we'll have a look at is SASS. SASS kind of enhances CSS and makes working with it a bit easier.
60

61
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,100
So, we'll have a look at that
61

62
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:29,890
in this last module. With that, we will have finished this complete guide and now the question is, what does
62

63
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:32,830
it take for you to succeed in this course?
