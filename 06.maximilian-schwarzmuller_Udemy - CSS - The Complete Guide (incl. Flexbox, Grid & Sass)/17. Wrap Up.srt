00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:08,580
So now that we are real text and font experts, let me quickly summarize what we have to keep in mind.

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:14,800
The first thing we have to keep in mind is that we have generic and font families. A generic family

3
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:23,230
is actually a fallback in case a font family is not available and a font family allows us to define the

4
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,540
exact font that we want to use.

5
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:30,040
We saw it at the beginning of this module when we had a look at the syntax for example, where we had the

6
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:36,130
font family first and then the generic family as a fallback where the specific font family will then be

7
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:38,760
chosen by the settings in the browser.

8
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:45,970
We also had a look at the way how to import font families onto our website or into our code.

9
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:51,940
The important thing is that we need to make sure that we have the font families that we use for our

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,860
website in the code also available for our website users.

11
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:02,770
If we rely on to locally installed font families which could be installed on our computer but maybe

12
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:09,190
not on the machine of our website user, this can cause problems. We can avoid these problems by using

13
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:10,770
embedded font families with

14
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:11,890
@font-face,

15
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:19,570
we talked a lot about that, also about the disadvantages this approach might come with or we can import

16
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:24,490
font families from third-party providers like Google with Google fonts,

17
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:30,670
this is the approach we will follow throughout this course. Another thing we had a look at are the font

18
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:31,910
properties.

19
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:36,170
I will not dive into each property again but we saw all of that,

20
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:42,280
we saw the font size, the font style which allowed us to create an Italian style for example.

21
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,470
We had a look at the weight and about the importance of adding different font faces for our weight.

22
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:55,630
We saw font stretch which is very well-supported by browsers but not that perfect from a font family

23
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,150
availability perspective

24
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:04,670
and we saw font variant which allowed us to add this small character style to our website.

25
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:10,870
We also saw letter spacing, whitespace and the line height which allowed us to define the height of our

26
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,460
content box basically.

27
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:19,600
And we worked with text decoration and text shadow to add underlines or overlines to our text or

28
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,360
to also add some nice shadow behind it.

29
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:25,120
Then we had to look at font display,

30
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:32,920
this defines the loading behavior of our customly created fonts with @font-face and we saw that we

31
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:39,250
have different values available which can be distinguished by their block period and their so-called

32
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:46,990
swap period. The default value is auto which simply means that the browser will choose a value of his

33
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:49,600
choice which is usually block.

34
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:56,440
And to summarize kind of what we learned, the font shorthand takes into account a lot of the properties

35
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,450
we talked about

36
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,620
but it cannot only be used as a shorthand,

37
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:07,590
it also allows us to refer to system font families, so font families applied for different parts on our

38
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,730
operating system,

39
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:16,610
for example for message boxes and therefore, also has these two purposes which we had a look at. And with

40
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:21,140
that, we actually finished all the core concepts of

41
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:29,150
CSS with this module because in the next module, it's time to dive into a more advanced concept.

42
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,910
We will have a look at flexbox,

43
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:38,420
so we will see how we can use this tool or this concept to change the way our elements behave really

44
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,240
easily.

45
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:45,800
So really looking forward to this module, let's have a look at flexbox then as the next step in this course.
