00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:06.280
So that's it for the module, what did we learn?

2
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.590
We had a look at the box model,

3
00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:16.660
a core concept of CSS, every element is treated as a box, no matter if it's an inline or a block level

4
00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.120
element, it's treated as a box.

5
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:24.440
The difference just is for inline elements, margin top and bottom don't have an effect,

6
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.550
they are applied but you don't see it

7
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.860
but besides that, everything is a box

8
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:34.590
and understanding that you can set content, padding, border and a margin is crucial.

9
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:41.230
You also learn about the width and height, that you can use pixels or percentage units, more units will

10
00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:48.040
also be covered in this course and that you can also change what the width and height refer to by

11
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:54.520
changing the box sizing attribute, the default is content box and with that setting, you only style

12
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.180
the content of the box

13
00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:02.210
but you can set it to border box to actually target content, padding and border with your width

14
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.250
and height assignments.

15
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:10.070
We then also had a look at the display property, somewhat connected to the box model

16
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:16.120
but then again not really. With it though, you can change the behavior of block level elements or inline

17
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.950
elements,

18
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.600
you can set a block level element to behave like an inline one or the other way around or use the

19
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.590
combination with inline block.

20
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:32.500
We used it to position elements next to each other and also don't forget, you can use display none to remove

21
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.860
an element from the document flow, not from the DOM,

22
00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.880
it's still included there as you saw in the developer tools,

23
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.500
it's only removed from the document flow and from the page you see.

24
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:50.920
And finally, we also covered pseudo classes and elements, another core feature. With pseudo classes, you

25
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.940
can style different states of elements or target different types of elements like the first list

26
00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.720
item in a list of list items

27
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:07.510
and with pseudo elements, you can actually target content or parts of elements, like the first letter

28
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:14.020
or some additional content which you define that should be added after an element and which you then

29
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.800
also can style.

30
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.800
This is what we covered and definitely practice these things, go back to this module

31
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:27.600
if you later encounter something which is not clear or which you feel like you want to go through again

32
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.480
but with that, let's move on.
