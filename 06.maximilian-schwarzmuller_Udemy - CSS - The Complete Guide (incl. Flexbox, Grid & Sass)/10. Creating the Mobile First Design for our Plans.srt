1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:09,850
So with the core logic being set, it's now time to get our hands dirty and dive into the responsive design

2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,520
on our website.

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,720
Now before we do that though, we have two issues;

4
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:20,530
the first issue is that we should get rid of that second media query right here.

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,980
We can apply that, it's not a problem but for our project, I will like to stick to this 40rem limit

6
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:31,230
right here for all our media queries, just to keep things simple.

7
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:38,270
However, there is an additional problem and the problem is this background image because right here, we can

8
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,440
see that our woman right here

9
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,820
kind of gets her head stuck in the nav bar and I don't think that's a good look.

10
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:52,310
So let's quickly improve that by simply changing our left 10% and bottom 10% to center,

11
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,550
that's the simplest solution for that.

12
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,690
Max already told you about the details, how to format your background images,

13
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:06,200
so with that if we reload the page, you can see that the head is now going not into the nav bar

14
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:11,760
because the image is always centered and I think this looks quite nice actually now.

15
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:19,700
So with that, we can now continue with the responsive design of our plans because what I would like to

16
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:25,820
achieve is that as soon as we are below our 640 pixels,

17
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:31,260
so right here, this 40rem, the plans should be displayed below each other,

18
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:37,090
so they should just simply be three containers basically displaying all the information.

19
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:46,340
For that, we need to work on the plans ID maybe and especially inside this ID, we have the plan list

20
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:52,880
class right here and then the plan, the highlighted plan and the premium plan, so free, highlighted, premium.

21
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,380
So we might have to work on these classes,

22
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:03,860
therefore if we go back to our code, we can start our work right here maybe with the plan class because

23
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:11,420
the first thing I want to change is, I want to change this display style right here because I don't

24
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:16,470
want to have inline block elements which then kind of show the behavior we have right here,

25
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,210
I would like to have simple block elements.

26
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,510
Therefore what we can do

27
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,630
and keep in mind, this is the mobile first design,

28
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:27,530
we can simply delete display inline block. What will happen then is

29
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:33,140
if I reload the page, you can see the plans are now displayed below each other.

30
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,220
Why is this happening?

31
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,940
Well because as you can see it right here,

32
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:40,310
each plan now again is a simple div

33
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:47,950
and we talked about the general behavior of a div, a div is a block level element and therefore, occupies the

34
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:51,620
entire space of where it is positioned.

35
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:57,530
Now with that, we did our first step. By the way, of course the desktop design is now less but we work

36
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,390
on that in our media query of course

37
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:03,380
but for now, let's stick to our mobile design right here.

38
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,830
So the general order is fine,

39
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:11,950
we have a different way to display our plans but the width should be different.

40
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:18,380
For that, we can go back and get rid of that empty line maybe and now simply change the width right here

41
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,090
to 100%, like that.

42
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:22,810
Let's see what happens

43
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,950
now if we do that, yes it looks better,

44
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,540
now the plans are basically occupying

45
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,950
almost 100%.

46
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:33,350
Let's see why this is not working.

47
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:37,930
Well, this should be due to the plan list class right here,

48
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,340
yes.

49
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:44,360
Well as we can see, the plan list class right here has a margin to the left and to the right

50
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:50,620
and we can also see why this is happening because we have a width of 80% only and this margin

51
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,380
auto.

52
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:57,080
So if we just change that to 100% and then actually get rid of the margin

53
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:57,460
auto

54
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,390
because there should not be any margin left,

55
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,190
let's se,

56
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:00,920
yes,

57
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:07,840
then we can see that we have our elements now displayed below each other still and we got rid of the

58
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,390
margin,

59
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:12,410
so that's getting closer to the look that I would like to have.

60
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:19,000
What we can also see is that our website is not really formatted perfectly yet, you can see this little gap

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,900
right here between the image and the right border

62
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:25,750
and we can also go to the left and to the right of our plans

63
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,060
and if we inspect the plan, we can see that we have a margin around it,

64
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,800
we can see this down here.

65
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,960
So let's maybe get rid of the left and right margin,

66
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:40,830
so I'm in the plan selector class selector again and the margin top and bottom is fine but I think

67
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,870
to the left and to the right, we should have a zero margin.

68
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:48,820
If I reload the page now, we should see that yes, now it works fine.

69
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:54,380
Now we don't have this gap between the image and the right limit of the developer tools of the website

70
00:04:54,460 --> 00:05:00,370
right here and we can see that we can scroll perfectly through our different plans and we don't have

71
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:03,120
any margins to the left and to the right,

72
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,400
so this looks nice actually.

73
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,800
We can then also clean our code a bit and actually get rid of the vertical alignment now because we

74
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,380
should actually be able,

75
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:20,680
yes as you can see, as the elements are basically using the entire space, the vertical alignment is not

76
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,650
required anymore.

77
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,240
So we also made sure our code is a bit leaner now.

78
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:32,050
I will also comment out the plan list right here for the moment because we don't need that wrapping

79
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:32,800
container,

80
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:36,120
so this container right here, for the mobile view,

81
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:41,720
this is working totally fine without it but it might be the case that we need it later,

82
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:43,240
so I will keep it like that,

83
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,640
let's see if we have to add it in our media query.

84
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:56,330
Another thing that I would like to change is that we should get rid of this shadow we have around our

85
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:03,930
recommended plan right here because the highlighted plan, this one as you can see has this box shadow around

86
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:09,210
it and although it looks great in the desktop version, I don't think it's nice right here because it

87
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,420
looks kind of like an error, 

88
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:15,360
so we should also get rid of the box shadow right here.

89
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,020
Let me also comment this out for the moment because we might need it later in the media query

90
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:23,580
because there, the shadow looked actually quite nice.

91
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:28,550
So with that, we also improve the look again and yes it looks better as I think.

92
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:35,730
And with that, we are actually, well at least for the moment, done with the responsive design of our plans.
