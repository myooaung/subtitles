00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:04.430
So that's our website right here.

2
00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:11.840
I'm on the customers page that we created in the last module and if we look at the code right here,

3
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.370
for example for this image, then we can see, 

4
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.750
let me drag this up a bit,

5
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.140
then we can see that we applied a width of 100% to this image.

6
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.070
Now we could argue it's not occupying 100% of this space,

7
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.860
that's true

8
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.670
and you probably know why this is the case, because this image is part of this container right here and

9
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.470
this container has a width of 65%

10
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:44.710
and apparently this width, the 65%, refers to this div right here, as we can see, this div

11
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.380
seems to have a width of 100%, we can see it right there

12
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.580
and because of that, our image only has 65% of width.

13
00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:00.070
So if I drag it around, we can see the image increases and decreases, the image size.

14
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:06.290
However as you can see already, this was a lot of guessing of probably and it should refer to this and

15
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.480
that element

16
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.660
and as you can imagine, CSS 

17
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.520
is not about

18
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.290
it should do something like that, in this course,

19
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.410
we want to understand why things are behaving the way they behave and how we can change this behavior,

20
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.770
because of that, we have to take a closer look at this percentage behavior in this module and we have

21
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:31.640
to understand what is actually the element that this percentage relates to.

22
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.740
So that's the first thing I wanted to show you, we have this percentage applied

23
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.620
and because of that, our website is a bit more dynamic.

24
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.520
However if you look at the font size, for example right here, you help me set her up, 

25
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.410
you can see this size doesn't change if I increase the width.

26
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.090
Why should it?

27
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.390
It's still readable.

28
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:57.920
However if I zoom in into our website, like that, you can see that the font size increases significantly.

29
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.170
Now you could say this is clear because if somebody cannot read the text, he can increase the size

30
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.050
and I would totally agree

31
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:14.510
but I will also say that with this behavior, we totally give the browser the chance to decide how our

32
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.180
side should be zoomed and how the different elements on our side should be zoomed.

33
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.230
And I don't think that's a good idea because although we want to allow our users to increase the font

34
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.780
size for example, we want to make sure that the general look, so that the proportions between the different

35
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:37.440
font sizes for example are still met. Therefore working like this, with the pixels like we did it so far,

36
00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:44.010
if we inspect that, we only have pixels right here, if I scroll down, you can see we have a font size of

37
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.250
20 pixels.

38
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:53.410
So using a fixed font size of pixels and letting the browser zoom do the work is not the best idea.

39
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.380
Let's maybe also change the default font size,

40
00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:04.140
we found that menu already in one of the earlier modules of this course, so if we go right here to Chrome

41
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:11.970
and preferences, then we have here in this appearance menu the option to change the default font size.

42
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.180
At the moment,

43
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.480
this is medium, the recommended one.

44
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.120
Now if I change this to very large for example, you can see this already increases the font size on this

45
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.150
side right here

46
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:30.550
but on our website, well this only affects parts of the fonts. As you can see the font size here in the

47
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.060
nav bar increased, the same thing is true for our footer right here

48
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.250
but this text right here didn't change at all

49
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:44.330
and this makes sense because as you just saw, we defined a font size of 20 pixels for this text.

50
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:51.090
So how should it increase? For the elements in the nav bar and in the footer for example right here,

51
00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.410
we didn't define any font size.

52
00:03:53.670 --> 00:04:00.690
So what happens right here is that as soon as the visitor of our website increases the font size, the

53
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.110
default font size will also be increased based on these default settings.

54
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.410
And now you could argue, well then everything is all right,

55
00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.470
we don't have to apply any font sizing because it's all done by the browser settings.

56
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:19.440
And again that's probably not the behavior you want to have because we're going to have different font

57
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:26.610
sizes on our website and at the same time, we want to allow the visitor to display the website with

58
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.250
the default font size of his choice though.

59
00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:35.400
So as we can see, with fixed pixels, this wasn't possible, with not applying any font size, it's also not

60
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.410
possible because each font will have the same size then.

61
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:46.860
So let's maybe go back to the settings and change it back to medium as a first step, like that, now it looks

62
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.140
better again

63
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:54.510
and let's then find out if we have more units available which might allow us to be a little bit more

64
00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:01.530
flexible and this flexibility refers to font size but also to the general sizing of our elements.

65
00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:07.450
But because as we already saw, we applied the percentage, the value already to size our image for example

66
00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:13.490
but we didn't totally understand what drives this percentage value and what it refers to.

67
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.810
Additionally, there might be alternatives to percentages

68
00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:19.140
so it might make sense to also have a look at these.
