1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:08,750
So with our box shadow removed, our website looks actually quite nice in the mobile view right here.

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,040
So now it's time to add a media query because we want to make sure that the page doesn't look

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,400
like that on the desktop devices because I don't think that's a good look.

4
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,430
So let's go back to the code

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:29,760
and as we learned it in the last lecture, we will add the media query right here below our actual part of

6
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:30,740
the website.

7
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,600
That's not the way we should do it in the end or we will do it in the end,

8
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:39,100
as I said, we will add all the media queries below the code at the end of this course

9
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:48,690
but for now, let's add the media query, we will use the same width we had before, so our 40rem and let's

10
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,290
now start with our plan right here,

11
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:58,200
so the plan class and let's see what we have to change right here.

12
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:05,670
As we said for the mobile view, we now defined these rules and while these rules in general are fine,

13
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,280
there is one really important thing that we have to change.

14
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:15,410
That's of course we need to change the way our elements are displayed because right now, we have changed

15
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,740
them to block level elements

16
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,900
but we want to make sure that these are displayed as inline block elements again.

17
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:25,700
So let's let display inline block right here,

18
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:33,170
like that and with that if we reload the page, you can see

19
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,050
nothing changes.

20
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,530
What's the reason for that?

21
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:43,860
Well if we go back to our code and go back to the plan, we can see that we applied a width of 100%

22
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:49,140
and that's of course not what we want for the desktop view. For the desktop view, we should go back to

23
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,860
our initial value which was at 30% width,

24
00:01:52,980 --> 00:02:01,350
so let's add width 30% right here like that and with that change in place, we can see that our

25
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,160
plans look better again.

26
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:08,020
We still have some issues but we will fix these in the next minutes.

27
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:13,460
A first fix would be to again apply the vertical align because we got rid of that

28
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,840
but for the desktop version, this should definitely be right here and improve the look already,

29
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,220
let's see what happens.

30
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:26,530
Yes as we can see, now these two plans are more in line with the recommended plan again,

31
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:30,220
so that was definitely an improvement that was required.

32
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:39,370
What we need though is we need to add back our plan list code right here, this one and we can actually

33
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:45,480
take the entire code because we don't get it up here but we need the code in our media query.

34
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:54,610
So let's maybe add it at the beginning directly, like that and with that, we have our wrapping container

35
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,300
added back,

36
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:01,260
so this container should take place in case the media query is applied

37
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:08,140
and if we are reload that, we can see that our text or our boxes are central again because remember, we

38
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,930
just added this container back, so the code for this container here

39
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:19,390
and because of that, we basically got our style back that we had before in our desktop version and the

40
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:26,830
cool thing now is of course that once we are below our 640 pixels right here, we can see some issues

41
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:29,420
though, as you can see right here, the box is too small,

42
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,470
we'll fix that. Then you can see the website jumps from the mobile to desktop version

43
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:40,480
and that's pretty cool actually as I think. Now let's go back to the code and let's see if we have to

44
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,400
add some more properties to our media query.

45
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:47,200
Do you remember one thing we deleted?

46
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:52,180
Because if we scroll up, we also commented out our highlighted plan,

47
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,610
so the box shadow for our highlighted plan

48
00:03:54,850 --> 00:04:00,220
and while we didn't want to have it right here in the mobile version, I think it makes sense to add it

49
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,970
back in the desktop version.

50
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:07,520
So let's add our plan highlighted class right here,

51
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:17,020
plan highlighted, this one and let's add this declaration back in, like that

52
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:24,430
and if we now go back and reload the page, we can see that the box shadow is visible in the desktop

53
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,100
view

54
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:31,650
but in the mobile view, it's of course not there because always keep in mind, these declarations or

55
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:40,240
these rules will only be applied if we have this media query applied and this is only true if this if condition

56
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:40,810
is met,

57
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:47,920
so if the min width is equal or larger than this 40rem. With that, there is only one issue that I just

58
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:55,750
saw, that we should also fix because if I decrease the size, we can see that the box is a bit too small,

59
00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:03,520
so the recommended is outside of the box and if I increase the width again, well the boxes get bigger

60
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,210
and bigger and I don't think that this is a nice look

61
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:15,280
and if you remember back the units module, we learned that we have these min width and max width properties.

62
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:22,200
Now wouldn't it be a good idea to apply these right here and to specify a min width for our plans right

63
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,870
here, maybe round about here for example

64
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:31,530
and also a max width so that we can say we don't want our plans or the boxes for our plans to become

65
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:35,270
wider than a specific width that we define.

66
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,980
So what would be a minimum width that we want to have for our plans right here?

67
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:49,380
Well let's maybe have a look at our highlighted plan for example and if we now go to computed, we know

68
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,090
that already

69
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:53,860
and scroll down, then we can find the width right here.

70
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:56,710
If we now decrease the width right there,

71
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:01,660
now the formatting changed, so now we can find it down here.

72
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:08,680
So we have 300, increase that, we have 336 pixels

73
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:18,980
and if we decrease it, yes maybe it shouldn't get smaller than this, maybe a bit, maybe like that,

74
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:19,920
something like that.

75
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:23,660
So round about 210, 205 pixels,

76
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:27,880
so let's maybe use a min width then, right here for our plan,

77
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,740
the min width which should be equal to 13rem.

78
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:36,560
So 13rem, 13 times 16 is 208,

79
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:37,730
so this is fine,

80
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,930
let's add a space right here.

81
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:44,640
If we do that and reload the page, we can now see that our box,

82
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:51,160
can you see it, doesn't become smaller than these 208 pixels that we defined

83
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,630
and if we decrease it further, it looks nice all the time

84
00:06:54,630 --> 00:07:00,370
actually. There is a certain point, so below 200 pixels where it still doesn't look perfect

85
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:05,970
but to be honest, if you remember back when we had a look at the different device widths that we have,

86
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:12,110
having a smartphone with width below 200 pixels is pretty uncommon,

87
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,970
so therefore I think we can live with that for the moment,

88
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:15,890
this is fine.

89
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:24,500
What we need to add though is also a max width because as you can see right here, the plans keep increasing.

90
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,790
So let's also do this and for the max width,

91
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:33,740
let's also have a look at the recommended plan and the highlighted plan and let's see what we computed right here,

92
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,540
496 pixels,

93
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,100
I think that's way too big.

94
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,000
I think around about here,

95
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,560
what's that now?

96
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:47,060
Yes maybe round about 400 pixels which would be 25rem.

97
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,770
So let's maybe add a max width right here

98
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,100
of 25rem like that

99
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:05,010
and if we reload the page again, we should see that the boxes don't become bigger than the 25rem we defined

100
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,640
and that's pretty amazing already right,

101
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:15,060
because now we have two really significantly different designs implemented on our website; the mobile design, 

102
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,690
right here and our desktop design which keeps increasing up to certain screen widths

103
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,050
but then is limited

104
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:30,160
once we hit a certain maximum width that we just defined. So with the plans being responsive, it's time to

105
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,970
continue with the next area of our starting page.
