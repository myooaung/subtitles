00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:07.260
So let's add a new page to our project. We could add it next to the index.html file,

2
00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:14.800
we could simply add a new HTML file to make sure that our application stays structured and doesn't

3
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.170
get confusing,

4
00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:23.080
I'll create a subfolder for that page and I'll name it packages because we will show the different packages

5
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:30.280
of our app. Now in there, I'll create a HTML file and you can name that file whatever you want but I'll stick

6
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:35.370
to index.html which is kind of what you use in web development

7
00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.460
it you have like a root file, a root HTML file within the folder.

8
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:49.270
So that's my index.html file and in there, I'll now simply copy the content of the other, of the main

9
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.580
index.html file on the root folder, so the one we worked in all the time.

10
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.820
I copied that because I want to use the same skeleton,

11
00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.700
I want to also import the same fonts there because we used them there in the index.html file in

12
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:09.640
the packages folder and of course, we also want to use the same header and footer.

13
00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.270
So I will just paste that code in here

14
00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.890
but of course get rid of all the content in the main area here.

15
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.170
So this should be empty,

16
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.660
we just have the header and footer.

17
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.930
We also need to adjust the links now in the header,

18
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.580
here for example for packages

19
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.200
we are in the packages folder, so this is just pointing to that index.html

20
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.460
file here, for the other folders

21
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:40.710
though, we need to go up one level with ../ and then into the customers folder or for start

22
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.260
hosting ../start hosting and we don't have these folders yet, we'll add them later

23
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:52.990
and for the main page here on our brand, we also need to go up one level with ../ and then

24
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.920
target this index.html file

25
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.440
you'll find there.

26
00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.230
So this is the adjusted header.

27
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.090
I don't think we need the ant style in here by the way,

28
00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.780
I don't think we'll use it here, so

29
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.110
let's get rid of that import on this index.html file in the packages folder.

30
00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.660
And regarding the CSS file we're importing,

31
00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:21.480
well we should probably split this up over multiple files too because I don't want to import all the

32
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.550
CSS code I use on the starting page into the packages page and the same is true the other way around

33
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.400
because both pages use different styles and they don't care about the styles

34
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:41.020
the other page uses. There are some shared styles, like the header or the footer but that's about it.

35
00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:48.730
So what we should do is we should create a new CSS file next to the main.css file which you

36
00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:58.150
can call whatever you want but I will call it shared.css and into this file, I'll copy my footer

37
00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.350
code as well as my header and navigation code,

38
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:08.680
I'll cut it out of the main.css file and add it to the shared.css file and I'll

39
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.580
also add this button style there which we defined, here

40
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:19.570
all the button related classes and selectors because that also probably is shared across pages,

41
00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.420
so let's also add these declarations to the shared file.

42
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.560
So the main.css file is leaner now, we added content to the shared.css file,

43
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:36.880
we now need to import that shared.css file into our main root folder index.html file,

44
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.060
otherwise our header will not look good.

45
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.690
I can prove this to you if we save all files and reload,

46
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.680
that's not looking good because we extracted the styles into a new file.

47
00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.800
So let's add a new link here,

48
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.690
shared.css

49
00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.790
and let's actually move it above the import of the main.css.

50
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:55.770
Why?

51
00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:01.480
Because in the shared file, we set up some general styles, general button styles

52
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:09.010
for example. We always want to have the chance of overwriting them in our more specific page focused

53
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.340
file, like the main.css

54
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:17.570
file for the root index.html file and to allow this overwriting to take place,

55
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.940
we need to respect the order here because this is imported and parsed first,

56
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.520
this is parsed second,

57
00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:30.430
so if we want to overwrite something from the shared file, we need to import the overwriting file second,

58
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.320
so that it's parsed later because later styles overwrite earlier ones

59
00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.210
if they have the same selector. So this is the import

60
00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:46.620
layout or the import structure in the main index.html file. In the packages folder,

61
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.550
we now also import the shared.css file

62
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.620
and this is actually imported from the root folder, so

63
00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:59.230
let's go up there with ../ and I will add a new file here,

64
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:05.560
the packages.css file, here we will really just add the styles for this packages

65
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.200
index.html file.

66
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.490
Let's add a new link import here and there

67
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:18.220
I will just point to packages.css. Again this is added after the shared file so that

68
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:25.350
we have at least the possibility of overwriting any styles we set up in the shared.css file.

69
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:32.130
With all that said, if we save that and we reload our starting page, it should look good again and it does

70
00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.640
and the packages link here should actually work now.

71
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:45.060
Now what we can see here is that fonts are missing and the reason for this is that I forgot to extract

72
00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.450
something in main.css at the very top,

73
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:55.500
this universal selector as well as the body, that should also go into the shared file because that of

74
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.890
course applies to our entire page, to all pages.

75
00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:02.640
So let's move that to the top of the shared.css file and

76
00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.280
now if we reload this packages

77
00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.890
sub-page, let me zoom in a bit,

78
00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:12.610
now it looks exactly as our starting page when it comes to the header and the footer.

79
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:19.980
And with that, we can start working on that packages page and we will add some code to it in the

80
00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.700
next lecture and then started working on the styling.
