Welcome to this optional video.

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:09,490
This video is meant for everybody who just joined this expert track,

3
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:14,300
so in case you will followed along the course so far and watch the previous module,

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,370
you can skip this video. In case you just joined,

5
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:23,200
let me guide you quickly through the current projects that you use and what we achieved so far.

6
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:28,790
Now before we dive into the page, you can of course find the project code attached to this video to get

7
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:30,260
started quickly.

8
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:37,640
However, as you can see right here, we created uHost so far, this is our hosting provider website and

9
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:40,480
we basically build this starting page right here,

10
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:46,840
we added a background image for example, we have a navigation bar and down here, we have our different plans.

11
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:54,020
Then we also got some features down here and we have a footer, the footer and the navigation bar is the

12
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,780
same on all pages.

13
00:00:55,790 --> 00:01:01,640
So we also have a packages page which gives you an overview of the different hosting plans we have available

14
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,510
on our fictional site and down here, we have our footer again.

15
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:11,030
And we also have a customers page we have some nice images and some testimonials

16
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:17,070
in the end and down here, we again have the footer and we also added a form right here if we click onto

17
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:19,220
this start hosting button.

18
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:23,760
The important thing is that our site focuses on to CSS of course,

19
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:29,390
therefore we did not create any back-end and we won't create any back-end because the focus of this course

20
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:34,880
is to learn how to use CSS but we already implemented a mobile design.

21
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:41,420
So if we click right here in the developer tools, we can see, if I increase the zoom a bit like that, that

22
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,070
our page also works in a mobile view,

23
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:47,410
we can for example change or switch to different pages,

24
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:48,910
this is the packages page again,

25
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,520
you can see it works quite nice in the mobile view also

26
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:58,250
and if we click on to our icon right here, we are coming back to our starting page, also in a nice mobile

27
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,590
design.

28
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:02,710
So this is what our website looks like at the moment,

29
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:09,470
let's now also have a quick look at the code we wrote so far because right there, we have a main index.html

30
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:15,470
file which contains of course the navigation bar and the footer and also the content of this starting

31
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:15,970
page,

32
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,140
for example our different plans right here,

33
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,040
choose your plan,

34
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,080
we saw that right here, this part.

35
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,950
Then we have a corresponding CSS file which refers to this index.html

36
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,130
file.

37
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:32,540
Then we have a shared.css file which contains the CSS styles for our header and for the footer,

38
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:38,900
so basically for the elements which are displayed on every website. We also have some shared.js file here,

39
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:44,810
so some Javascript which is required to make sure that our 'Choose Plan' button right here,

40
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,950
this one works and which opens that modal right here

41
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,410
and for the other pages, we have our customers file right here,

42
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:57,410
so this is for this customers page we can see with the corresponding CSS and HTML files. The same thing is

43
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,410
true for packages and for start hosting

44
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:05,330
and then we got this image folder which basically contains the customer images, our background image

45
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:11,590
of the starting page and the background image of our plans right here, on this page

46
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:16,010
and of course also our uHost icon right there and that's it actually.

47
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,880
This is what we achieved so far

48
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,780
and with that, we can now dive into flexbox together.
