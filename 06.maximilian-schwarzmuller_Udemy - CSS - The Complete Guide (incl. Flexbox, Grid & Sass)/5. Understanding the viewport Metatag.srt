1
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:04,690
So let's have a closer look at this

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:12,470
viewport meta tag and see what we added there and what else we might be able to add there. For that,

3
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:16,960
I'll go back to our index.html file, the main index.html

4
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:20,870
file and let's now have a look at it step-by-step.

5
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,610
The first attribute we added was this viewport attribute,

6
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:31,220
this simply allows us to tell this meta tag that it should target the viewport,

7
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:38,390
so actually the area on our device inside our browser that should display our website.

8
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:46,340
The second attribute we added was this content attribute, with that, we are now able to set the width of

9
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,540
our page that we have, so the page on the viewport, the visible part of it

10
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:57,790
basically, this should be equal to the width of the screen of our device and that's the important thing

11
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:05,210
we talked about in the previous lectures. With that, we were able to tell our browser that our device

12
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:13,730
is a smaller device, a mobile device and therefore, it should apply this pixel ratio conversion because

13
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:19,880
otherwise, we would have the problem that we had initially, that our browser simply has a look at the

14
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:25,490
amount of hardware pixels it has and therefore is not aware of the fact that we have a smaller device

15
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:33,770
and with that, simply displays the entire website squeezed into our mobile device screen.

16
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:37,270
Then we have this initial scale information right here,

17
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:45,170
the initial scale simply defines the zoom level that we have. 1.0 simply means that we have the default

18
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:45,800
value,

19
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,080
this means no zoom is applied.

20
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:57,110
If you would change that to 1.5 for example like that and go back to our website, reload it, it's not working

21
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:59,720
that's a little Chrome developer tools bug

22
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:07,370
but if we simply go back to the desktop mode and go back to the mobile mode, you can see that the website

23
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:14,790
as expected is now zoomed in. What is also interesting is that we can also zoom in more if we want to,

24
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:21,350
basically without any limitation as you can see, quite far and we can also zoom out a bit as you can

25
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:29,540
see. Now zooming in and zooming out are the next types of information that we can specify in this meta tag

26
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:38,980
because for example, we could say that our user, let's simply add it right here, user scalable like that,

27
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:44,370
this can be either yes which is the default value or the default behavior,

28
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,220
so as you can see, that's what we have,

29
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,990
we have our initial scale with this slide

30
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:55,730
zoom in now and the user can zoom out or zoom in, as you can see zooming out is basically the same

31
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,530
zoom level we had before,

32
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:04,520
so no zoom applied basically. In case you say you don't want your visitors to be able to zoom, which

33
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:11,810
I will not recommend because normally, we would like to give our users as much freedom as possible so

34
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:15,130
that they can view our website in the most convenient way

35
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:21,310
but let's say you want to restrict the zoom and not allow your users to zoom right here,

36
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,340
then you can simply set user scalable to no

37
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:31,920
and if we do that, reload and go back right here, then I'm not able to zoom in or out anymore.

38
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,370
I can scroll around of course, that's not the problem

39
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:37,030
but zooming is not possible anymore

40
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:41,100
but as I said, this is probably not the behavior you would like to have,

41
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:47,330
so you could either set this to yes then or as yes is the default value, you could simply delete that

42
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,740
entirely.

43
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:55,280
Now there are two more interesting types of information that we can add to our content attribute right

44
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,030
here;

45
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:00,550
the first one is the maximum scale, right here.

46
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:08,250
If you think about the initial scale which set the default zoom level when the user enters our website,

47
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:15,420
the maximum scale simply restricts the maximum zoom level that is available.

48
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,190
So let's set this to 2.0 for example

49
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:24,430
and if we do that and go back like this, we can see that this is the default value,

50
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:29,720
we can zoom out, that's not a problem but zooming in is now restricted.

51
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:34,300
Without that maximum scale, let me quickly cut it out right here,

52
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:42,070
reload the page and go back, we can see that zooming out is not a problem but zooming in was possible a lot more

53
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,080
up to this level.

54
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:52,650
Now if we put it back in, as you can see it, this allows us to limit that zoom level that's possible like

55
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,390
this and like that.

56
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:57,370
Now the last thing we could add is we have a maximum scale,

57
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:05,670
we can also add a minimum scale of course. The minimum scale simply restricts the amount of zooming out

58
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:08,920
level that our user is allowed to apply.

59
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:14,560
So let's set this to 1.2 for example, like that

60
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:20,480
and if we now go back and reload the page once again and do our little trick right here, then you can

61
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:25,260
see that now I'm not able to zoom out entirely like we had it before.

62
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:32,690
If I set this to 1.0 which would be able to the value of not having a zoom at all, then we can again

63
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,320
reload it, go back

64
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:41,030
and as you can see, now we have the website back in the initial form where we didn't apply any kind

65
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:41,810
of zoom

66
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,550
and these are actually the main functionalities of this viewport

67
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,170
meta tag that we should know right here.

68
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:55,370
The important thing that you have to keep in mind is that without adding this meta tag, we are not

69
00:05:55,370 --> 00:06:01,580
really able to implement a mobile design to our website but this also means that in case you didn't

70
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:05,870
create a mobile first website, we'll dive into that in the next lectures

71
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:10,170
and by that, maybe you don't have a mobile design at all,

72
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:17,720
not adding the meta tag might also be an option because imagine, this is your final website and you only

73
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:23,750
have this desktop website which looks actually quite nice but you don't create this mobile site for

74
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,590
whatever reason, then you don't want to show your user the website

75
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:36,710
in this version, then the better but definitely not recommended approach would be to leave out this meta

76
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:41,000
tag and by that, present your website like this.

77
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,960
But we of course want to create a responsive website and also a website which looks awesome on mobile

78
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,330
devices, so we need this meta tag

79
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:59,300
and with that, we will now get rid of the scaling options because we don't need this to be honest,

80
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,810
we only need 1.0 as initial scale,

81
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:08,360
so no zoom at all, as you can see, this looks fine like that, not fine, we'll improve it but this looks okay like

82
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,140
that

83
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:13,090
and I already mentioned this mobile first approach

84
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,540
a few seconds ago.

85
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:20,480
Now let's dive into media queries and this mobile first design in the next lectures.
