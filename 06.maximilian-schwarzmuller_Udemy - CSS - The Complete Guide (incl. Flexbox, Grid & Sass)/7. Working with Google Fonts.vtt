1
00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:04.440
So let's have a look at web fonts.

2
00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.420
As I said, we use these already right here on our website

3
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:14.720
but I think it makes sense to have a look at it step-by-step now. How can we first find such a web font?

4
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.650
Well, one good source is Google fonts. For that,

5
00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.980
you can simply for, well Google fonts right here

6
00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:31.150
and if you then click onto the link, you can find a huge list of a lot of different font families available

7
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.080
right here.

8
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:38.860
The good thing is that you can also customize these because as you can see, you have 854 font families

9
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.260
in total, maybe a bit too much.

10
00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:49.450
So right here in the categories tab right here, we could for example say we only want to see maybe sans-serif

11
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.880
font families

12
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.330
and with that, we only got 239 left.

13
00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.940
Still a lot but I think a bit of a smaller list.

14
00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:06.140
However, let's say we want to pick a specific font family and add it as a web font to our website. There,

15
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.440
we could for example use

16
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:14.080
maybe the first one, this Roboto right here. As you can see, you have the Roboto name right here, that's

17
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.420
the

18
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.590
font family

19
00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.920
and then you can have a look at the font family, for example what it looks like as a sentence, a paragraph

20
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.850
or alphabetically or just by numerals or you could also say custom right here and type some text, like

21
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.590
hello, this is nice,

22
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.840
with that you can get an impression of the way,

23
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:40.150
well this font family would look like. Here, you can play around with the font size but this is also a property

24
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.860
you already know, so you can change the font size in CSS,

25
00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:44.860
this is what we know

26
00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.680
but we have one really interesting option right here

27
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:55.360
and this is that one, because as you can see, we are still in the Roboto font family but there are

28
00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:56.990
lots of different,

29
00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.570
well what are these?

30
00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:04.900
I will tell you in a few seconds, things to choose and these things to choose right here are so-called font

31
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.000
faces.

32
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:12.540
That's really an important concept that we have to understand because we have our generic family,

33
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:20.110
this is sans-serif right here. Inside this generic family, we have our font family, now an example Roboto

34
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.960
and this font family Roboto now has different font faces.

35
00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.570
This light 300 is the so-called font weight,

36
00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.360
we'll have a look at that in the next lecture.

37
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.820
The italic part right here is the font style,

38
00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.730
also something we'll delve deeper into in the next lecture.

39
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:46.660
The important thing now is that we have to specify a font face that we want to use,

40
00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.880
for example regular 400 right here, another one medium 500 as you can see

41
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.820
would be thicker or fatter

42
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.220
but we will stick to the regular 400 one.

43
00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:03.040
Now with that, if you choose your font family and your font face, you'll simply press the plus right here

44
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:12.790
and down here in this menu, you can now find the code you need to import your font family into our code.

45
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.060
The first option we have is the standard import option,

46
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:22.720
this one, with that we would have to use this link right here and add it now into our code, right here

47
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:29.740
into the main index.html file and that would be wrong because remember, we want to play around now on

48
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:30.680
the packages side,

49
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.900
so this side right here. Now until now, we didn't have a problem because we added our Monserrat link,

50
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:43.750
so this one right here into all our index.html files, so into this one at the customers page,

51
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:49.240
as you can see Monserrat here and also into the packages page, right here, this Monserrat.

52
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.620
That's why showing you all the things so far in the index.html

53
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:54.130
and the

54
00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.340
shared.css file was not a problem.

55
00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:03.430
But right now things are changing because now I want to import a new font family

56
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.550
and the problem is if I would do that right here in our main index.html file,

57
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:14.950
well this main index.html file of course is not related or connected to our packages index.html

58
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.100
file and therefore, this font would not be available right there.

59
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:26.390
So what we would have to do right now is we would have to go back to our Google fonts page right here,

60
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.060
now take this link and copy it

61
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.870
and now add it, that's important, in the index.html

62
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.870
file of our packages folder,

63
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:42.900
so right here. With that, we imported our Roboto font family to our index.html file in the packages

64
00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:43.650
folder

65
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:51.070
and if we now go to our packages.css file, we can simply go down here to our package info class, right

66
00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:59.920
there and now simply say we want to use the font family Roboto, as I told you before, we can write it

67
00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:05.590
with single quotation marks or in that case, with normal quotation marks and let's add sans-serif as our

68
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:13.050
fallback. If we do that now and go back to our website and reload the page right here,

69
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:21.730
you can see that the font family changed and the really cool thing now is that if we go to our settings

70
00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:29.080
right here again in Chrome and have a look at the font families available, you can see that Roboto

71
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:31.950
right here is not available

72
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:39.070
and this shows us that we were now able to import a totally new font family from Google fonts and

73
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.630
with the way we did it right here,

74
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.050
this would also work for other users.

75
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:48.190
It doesn't depend on the browser you're using or on the fonts you have installed on your machine,

76
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:53.470
it simply depends on the availability of these fonts at Google fonts.

77
00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:59.520
So this is one way, how we can import web fonts to our website

78
00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.870
but the problem with that way is, and that's what we just saw, we have to add it to each HTML

79
00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:11.220
file that we have because otherwise, the font is not available on the page we want to have it

80
00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.380
and this can definitely cause errors,

81
00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.340
so there might be a better alternative, how to add such web fonts.

82
00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:24.760
The good thing is if we go back to Google fonts right here, we can see that the alternative we have is

83
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:33.990
the @import method right here. This allows us to import the font in the CSS file right here by using

84
00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:35.490
this command right here,

85
00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.550
so basically the @import function.

86
00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.560
Let's try that out,

87
00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.320
so let's copy that and go back to our code

88
00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.690
and now I will add the code right here in our shared.css

89
00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:44.930
file

90
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:52.230
because we know that each index.html file as we can see it right here refers to the

91
00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:53.290
shared.css file,

92
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.470
so this one, the one in the packages folder

93
00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:00.860
and of course, also the start hosting index.html file

94
00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.660
and our main index.html file.

95
00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:10.350
So if we add the web font import in our shared.css file, this should work

96
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:15.160
and let's maybe add the import right here

97
00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.550
on top of our page, like that.

98
00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.070
So that's the import we made, let's save this

99
00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:26.090
and let's now delete that part right here we added,

100
00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.340
so this link in the HTML file right here

101
00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:34.140
and if we did everything correctly, then well we shouldn't see a change.

102
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:42.330
So let's reload and as you can see, it's still working and that's why I personally prefer this import

103
00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:46.530
method because it helps us to avoid mistakes

104
00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:51.810
and I think it's easier to understand because we can quickly see that we have our shared.css file

105
00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:55.210
and here we have all our web fonts that we use.

106
00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:59.510
Now as we don't have one single web font but multiple web fonts,

107
00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:00.920
we should also add these.

108
00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:07.140
For that, we will simply copy this @import statement once and twice and keep the distance

109
00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:13.860
and now we only have to see which other web fonts we have so far because right here, we have the family

110
00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.490
Anton, this one,

111
00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:26.660
so let's copy it right here and replace Roboto with Anton, like that and then let's also use Monserrat

112
00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:28.790
including these numbers,

113
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:30.370
these are the font weights,

114
00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:33.100
we'll dive deeper into these in the next lecture

115
00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:42.590
and let's add these also right here as the third import that we make. Now with that, we can get rid of

116
00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:44.160
the links we have right here,

117
00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:55.230
this one in the main index.html file, then the link we have in the customers file and in the packages

118
00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:57.150
file

119
00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:03.670
and finally in the start hosting index.html file, like that.

120
00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:04.900
Now we should save all that,

121
00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:13.140
so saving this, that one and the last one and also the shared.css file,

122
00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:14.350
so a lot of saving

123
00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:20.380
and if we did everything correctly, we should be able to reload the page, yes this looks fine actually,

124
00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:26.850
let's also have a look at the starting page, yes I think this looks also good and customers,

125
00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:27.520
yes

126
00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:32.910
also still our font and on the start hosting page, it still seems to work.

127
00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:38.530
So this is awesome because with that, we made our code a lot leaner as I would say

128
00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:45.010
and we can immediately see in our shared.css file which web fonts we are using

129
00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:49.260
and that's actually the core idea behind these web fonts.

130
00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:55.900
You simply choose the font of your choice right here on Google font page for example, then simply

131
00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:57.010
use @import,

132
00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:02.680
that's at least my preferred method, to import the font to your code and then you simply apply the font

133
00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:05.740
of your choice to the elements of your choice.

134
00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:11.650
That's the core concept but there is one thing we didn't have a look at so far

135
00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:18.700
and if I close that right here and go back to Roboto, then we had this options right here, these different

136
00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:24.760
font faces I had talked about at the beginning of this lecture and I think we should dive deeper into

137
00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.640
these in the next video.
