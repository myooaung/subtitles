1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:06,410
Pixels, percentages and more, what do I mean by that?

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,980
Well so far we worked with two units basically,

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:15,720
we worked with the pixels, with the unit of px and we work with percentages,

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:22,910
so with the percentage sign basically. Now in addition to that, we got more units available in CSS,

5
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:31,890
for example we have the root em and the root em is written with a unit of rem. Root em or rem is a unit

6
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,490
that refers to the font size,

7
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,790
we'll see how this works throughout this module. In connection with rem,

8
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,860
we also have em written just like that,

9
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:49,920
em from a unit perspective. Em and rem both refer to the font size but there is also one important

10
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,070
difference between these two units,

11
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:58,560
we'll also find out what this difference is of course. In addition to that, we also have the viewport height,

12
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:03,870
written as vh and we have the viewport width, written as vw,

13
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:09,400
also two more units we didn't use so far but we'll dive deeper into these two.

14
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:16,440
The problem now is, well you probably have this question mark in your head now because we basically understood

15
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:20,130
pixel so far but we are not even sure about the percentages

16
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,260
and what they actually refer to

17
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,790
and then I come over with new units and with rem and em and so on,

18
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:34,650
so this is maybe a bit too much. But actually, we can break down these units and the issues arising in connection

19
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,710
with that to three core questions,

20
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:45,030
the first question probably is this one, which properties can I use in connection with these units? Because

21
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,350
we have all these units

22
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,270
but just applying a unit alone

23
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,220
won't help us a lot.

24
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:56,580
So we have to find out if there are properties which are really made or basically made to apply some

25
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,570
of these units, maybe all of them or a specific unit, we'll find out that

26
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,490
but the first question really is, what can I do with these units?

27
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,450
We'll of course answer this question.

28
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,990
The second question is how is the size calculated?

29
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,860
I talked about that already a bit

30
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:17,020
regarding the percentages because we always need something like a reference point.

31
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:23,310
We'll have a look at the percentages and I said that rem and em are kind of connected to the font size and

32
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,030
for vh and vw,

33
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,920
well it's called viewport height, viewport width.

34
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:30,760
This might be the viewport and you're right by the way

35
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:35,320
but we have to find out how exactly this calculation works.

36
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:40,860
And then after we understood this, the last question probably is, what's the right unit to choose right

37
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,470
now? Because we know that we have different properties, 

38
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:50,140
we know how it's calculated but which unit should I apply for which properties, are there any best practices

39
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,070
or can you give me some advice?

40
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,000
The good news is, I think I can give you some advice but this will happen at the end of this module of

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,440
course

42
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,940
but why don't we just dive directly into the first question,

43
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:08,310
which properties can I use or where units matter? So here, you can find the question again.

44
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:13,100
Because basically we have our box model, Max already explained that to you,

45
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:19,080
so you're probably an expert in the meanwhile. In your box model, you have the content right here

46
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:24,900
and if we think about this content and we have the background color, for the background color we don't

47
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,410
need units but the font size,

48
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:33,810
I think this is probably a property where a unit, for example pixels as we did it so far,

49
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:38,980
definitely makes sense but maybe there is more than pixels that we can use for the font size.

50
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:44,640
If we then come back to our box model and think about the next step, this normally is the padding

51
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:50,700
and if we think about the padding which specifies the distance between the content and the border, well

52
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:57,180
then the padding itself would be a really good property to apply a specific unit that defines the size

53
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,220
of this padding.

54
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,650
The same thing is true for the border actually,

55
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,080
the border is also a property 

56
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,920
where applying a specific unit

57
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,240
definitely makes sense

58
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:12,440
and if we follow our box model, then this is of course also true for our margin right here.

59
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:18,770
Now with that, we see that we have already four properties where units definitely matter.

60
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,550
Now let's continue, what else do we have in our box model?

61
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:31,180
Well we have this right here, the width and we have this right here, height because height and width are also

62
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:38,040
properties where we have to specify a unit, this can be a pixel or a percentage as we saw it so far but

63
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:43,740
maybe there are more units we can apply also and maybe there is also a unit which makes more or less

64
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,400
sense,

65
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,320
this is also something we have to find out.

66
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:54,030
By the way, at the moment I indicated the width and height with box sizing being set to border box,

67
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,370
just to remind you of that

68
00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:01,530
but that's also something you know already by heart hopefully. However, with height and width, there are

69
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:09,360
only well basically four more properties where units actually matter. This one right here, the top and bottom

70
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,160
properties,

71
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:16,110
so properties that can be used after we be applied the position property, I showed you how this works

72
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,120
two modules go,

73
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:20,980
so you should also know about these properties and with top and bottom,

74
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,060
we also have this one right here, left and right.

75
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:30,290
So definitely, also properties where applying units makes a lot of sense. With that,

76
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:36,480
we now understood two things, that we have different units that we can use and that we have different

77
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:41,810
properties where applying the units make sense. The connection between the properties and the units

78
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,870
is not perfect yet,

79
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,960
we'll change that in this module

80
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,170
but with that, the first question,

81
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,890
so which properties can I use,

82
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,180
I think this one is answered.

83
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:56,360
And with that, we can now move on to the second question we had on the last slide,

84
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,600
how is the size now actually calculated for the different units?
