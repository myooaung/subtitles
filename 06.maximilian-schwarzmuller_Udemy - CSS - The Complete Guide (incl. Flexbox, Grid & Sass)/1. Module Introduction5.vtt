00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:08.990
Over the last modules, we had a detailed look at the core basics that you have to know when you're working

2
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.750
with CSS.

3
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.170
Now I want to practice these basics together with you.

4
00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.660
We'll start together though you'll always get a chance to pause the video and try something on your own

5
00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:26.420
and then I get a bigger building block, an entire new page which we add to our project which I want you

6
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.880
to fill on your own.

7
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.540
But no worries, you can do it,

8
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.200
you'll learn everything you need for that

9
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.520
and as I said, we'll start together.

10
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.510
So let's dive right into this module then.
