00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.300
Hi,

00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:00.870
everyone.

00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:03.650
And welcome back to another video of these cores.

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:04.800
In these video,

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.100
we're going to be designing our second noble together,

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.640
which is for an imaginary brand called Clock Without Ferrari.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:13.100
Do.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.560
Let's get started.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.540
First of all,

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.440
I'm going to insert a rectangle,

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.750
and I'm gonna hold shift in order to create a square.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.040
Pre denies.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.230
Let's set it to 200 by 200 like this.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.940
Then I'm going to increase the corner radius off three corners.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:31.500
Okay,

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:39.170
so I need to change the top left corner to 100 the top right corner to 100 as well.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.100
And the bottom left corner to 100 like this.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.980
And after that,

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.120
I'm going to set the color code to double zero.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:54.420
The 179 like this Let Mizzou mean and now I need to insert a circle here.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.440
I'm gonna hold shift pretty nice,

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.340
and then I'm going to use a Grady in for that.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.690
The linear one.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.290
Let's set the first color to the same color as behalf for our main square.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.840
Okay?

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.410
And the second color is going to be a little bit dark here,

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:21.240
so let's right 0 38 750 And I'm gonna increase the capacity to 100 like this.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.740
Then that's changed the direction to get something like this.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.720
Pretty nice,

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.340
isn't it?

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.870
Now I'm going to scale it a little bit.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.050
So let's click on this Move tools.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.320
And here I'm gonna choose scale.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:41.100
You could also press k on your keyword and I'm gonna hold shift and let's scale it pretty

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.820
nice.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.710
Let's set it to 176 by 176 and the patterns are going to be 12.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.180
As you can see that I'm going to click on these Arc Syrah,

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.650
Kal,

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.320
and I'm gonna hold shift like this pretty nice.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.520
Now I'm gonna rotated by 90 degrees.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.240
And as you can see,

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.520
I got something like this.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.160
However,

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.850
I need to change the direction off my Grady int.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.780
So let's use these handle controllers to get something like this.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.530
Can you see that I just created a clock here.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.670
It's pretty awesome,

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:14.300
isn't it?

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.790
Then I'm going to add a text on the font is Roboto.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.160
So let's write clock and it's going to be 80 points.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.370
I'm going to change the color to the same green.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.850
That's align it.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:28.640
It's left.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.680
Padding is going to be 16 peaks cells like this.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.340
And now I'm going to group them.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.710
Let's call it clock and that's all.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.960
Did you see how easy it is to use simple shapes for creating?

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.790
Amazing logos are right,

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:43.170
guys,

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.740
that's all for these video.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.020
I hope you enjoyed it,

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.350
and I will see you in the next video.
