00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.290
Hello,

00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:00.830
everyone.

00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:03.570
And welcome back to another video of these course.

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:04.640
In this video,

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.000
we're going to add our body text are topography style.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.230
So without further I do.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.890
Let's get it started by duplicating the last group.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:14.550
Okay,

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.550
I'm gonna put it here,

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.540
and it's right by the one pretty good,

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.180
and I'm going to select all those techs on.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.820
Let's change the font size to 14 points.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:27.730
Fantastic.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.880
Now let's select the 1st 1 and I'm going to create the textile.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:40.790
So let's right by the one left and the next one is going to be by the yuan center and the

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.160
last one is going to be body one,

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.990
right?

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.110
Pretty good.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.260
Now let's rename our groups.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.250
It's going to be body one,

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.980
this one as well,

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.800
then that's duplicated.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.320
And that's changed the title to body,

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:56.990
too.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.270
And we need to detach these text layers from their style.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.020
OK,

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.830
now let's select all of them,

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.430
but I'm going to change the font size to 13 points.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:08.100
However,

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.680
I'm not going to create the textiles because I'm going to do that for you and you can

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.430
download the finals time guy from the resource is lecture of thes sections and once again

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.560
that's renamed these groups body to body to as well.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.310
And I'm going to duplicate it for the last time.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.180
Let's rename into Body three,

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.630
and I'm going to select all these texts on Let's change the font size,

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:33.250
too.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.890
11 points are right.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.900
Guys we successfully created are typography style guide together.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.050
So now let's go ahead and check it out.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.740
I'm going to create a text that's right title and from the textiles,

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.740
I can choose whatever I want.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:49.220
For now,

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.580
we have only three options because we didn't create it.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.990
The textiles for all those texts.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.580
However,

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.960
if you download the final style guide,

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.730
you have access to all those textiles.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:01.690
So for now,

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.820
let's choose H one left and there we go.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.800
And if I just try to edit thes H one left.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.330
So let's go ahead and modify this,

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.310
for example,

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.040
from bold to regular,

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.530
you can see that my title changed as well are right guys,

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.090
that's all for these video.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.690
