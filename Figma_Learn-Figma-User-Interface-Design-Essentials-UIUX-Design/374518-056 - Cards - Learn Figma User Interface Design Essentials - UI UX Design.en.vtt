00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.620
Hey,

00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:01.130
everyone,

00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:02.250
these video,

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.350
we're gonna be talking about cards in user interface design cars are containers that

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.920
display content and actions on a single subject.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.730
They must be easy to scan,

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.940
and elements such as images or texts should be placed on them in a way that certainly

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.550
indicates the hierarchy.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.320
When you're designing cards,

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.150
make sure to pay attention to the following things.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.130
Number one individual.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.690
A card cannot be divided into multiple cards.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:37.270
You should not marriage a card with another one number to independence.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.250
A card doesn't need to rely on its surrounding elements.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.510
It can stand alone and last but not least,

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:45.730
components.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:51.180
A card can optionally have reach media such as images or videos,

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.070
Tex Barton's icons and film nails.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.010
Nowadays,

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.820
most designers use cards in there.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:59.810
You I design,

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.170
so if you want to use them as well,

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.010
make sure to use them carefully
