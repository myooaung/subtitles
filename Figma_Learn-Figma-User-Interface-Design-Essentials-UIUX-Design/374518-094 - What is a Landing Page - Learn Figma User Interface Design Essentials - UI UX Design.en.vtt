00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.860
Hey, welcome back.

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.000
In this video,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.625
we're going to talk about landing pages.

00:00:05.625 --> 00:00:09.480
We will learn what a landing page is and how it should be structured.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.715
Well, what's a landing page?

00:00:11.715 --> 00:00:15.900
Landing page is a webpage designed for marketing purposes.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.060
It's the page the visitors land on after they click on a link in a Google ad,

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.715
YouTube, Facebook, et cetera.

00:00:23.715 --> 00:00:27.555
Webpages are typically designed for a variety of goals.

00:00:27.555 --> 00:00:32.055
A landing page is a specifically designed for marketing campaigns,

00:00:32.055 --> 00:00:35.790
or let's say, converting visitors to customers.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.100
What is the difference between a homepage and a landing page?

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.715
Well, on the homepage,

00:00:40.715 --> 00:00:45.815
you can find so many distractions such as links, images, et cetera.

00:00:45.815 --> 00:00:46.910
And the other hand,

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.745
the landing page is super focused because

00:00:49.745 --> 00:00:53.285
fewer distractions equal a higher conversion rate.

00:00:53.285 --> 00:00:56.105
What are the essential elements of a landing page?

00:00:56.105 --> 00:01:00.500
The most important part of a landing page is the hero section.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.155
A hero section includes a headline,

00:01:03.155 --> 00:01:08.510
a supporting headline, a call to action or CTA for short, et cetera.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.750
Since this is the most important part of your landing page,

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.090
you should make sure to design a perfectly,

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.804
then we can have the benefit treatment features.

00:01:16.804 --> 00:01:20.540
This is the section that we present the most important features,

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.670
product or the service.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.500
After that, we can have social proof or social testimonials.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.740
And finally, we can have a closing argument.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.620
This is a good place for another CTA.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.475
You can have different sections based on the type of your landing page.

00:01:37.475 --> 00:01:42.365
Let's take a look at a well-designed landing page on dribble and analyze it.

00:01:42.365 --> 00:01:45.560
These landing pages designed by Martin Strabo,

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.839
I hope I pronounce his name correctly.

00:01:47.839 --> 00:01:50.330
As you can see, it starts with a hero section.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.075
Here we have a large and clear headline.

00:01:53.075 --> 00:01:58.265
By the way, you should always use the H1 tag style for our main headline.

00:01:58.265 --> 00:01:59.930
We will talk about it later.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.960
Then we have a call to action or CTA,

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.970
start with your risk advisor.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.050
We also have a navigation bar at the top and we have an image here.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.060
If you scroll down a little bit,

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.270
we will have the three most important benefits of

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.200
this product and allies predict the side,

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.815
then we will have some solutions, how it works,

00:02:21.815 --> 00:02:25.490
some testimonials, another call to action,

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.515
and finally, a footer.

00:02:27.515 --> 00:02:31.550
So this is how a typical landing pages is structured, are right guys.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.595
I hope you have a better understanding of landing pages now,

00:02:34.595 --> 00:02:35.720
hope you enjoyed it,

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.250
and I will see you in the next video.
