00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.330
Hello,

00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:00.800
everyone.

00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.440
And welcome back to another video off these section.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.610
In this video,

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:08.950
we're going to start designing our 1st 3 D seen together.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:10.230
So what's a three D?

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.120
Seen as you may guess,

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.320
a three d scene is a scene which consist off different three D objects.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.950
Okay,

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:18.770
so,

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:19.560
for instance,

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.580
here we have a scene because we have at least two elements here.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:25.200
However,

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.420
we're going to create a more interesting scene together.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:29.740
So first of all,

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.950
let's remove these two objects pretty good.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.900
I'm going to keep Shadow Plane are right,

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.690
and I don't need the camera anymore.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.130
So let's remove that.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.190
And after that,

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.270
I'm going to create a text.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.590
So let's click on three D text over there pretty good.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.290
And then I'm going to change it to you.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.930
I like this and let's set this color,

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:54.850
too.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.650
B 7 42 and double F like this pretty awesome.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.440
And then I'm going to duplicate it and let's change its position.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.930
And let's change it to you.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.570
X like this.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.560
And after that I'm going to change the color to 36 46 on double.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.790
If that's pretty awesome,

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:24.350
that Mizzou mean and then I'm going to rotate it by 90 degrees like this.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.740
Pretty awesome.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.770
And let me move it.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:28.710
Toe wars,

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.720
The u I text like this,

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.980
and once again,

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.200
I'm going to rotate it like this.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.850
It looks like that the U X is lying on top of you are OK,

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:41.680
all right.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.930
And then I'm going to decrease the size of UX K by this cube like this on.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.780
Let's move it to the left side.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.180
Pretty awesome.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.730
And let's move thes you.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.070
I takes a little bit up because we need to get that shadow.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.170
If you remember,

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.620
when you're using a shadow plane,

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.270
we need to put are objects above it in order to get a shadow.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.090
All right,

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.300
Fantastic.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.260
Then that's shoes you x here and movie to the left side like this.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.600
That's fantastic.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.560
However,

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.430
I'm gonna make you x a little bit smaller.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.250
I think now it's better.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.480
Pretty good.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.270
And the next thing I'm gonna do is adding a wall behind this.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.870
Okay,

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.110
so let's go to library and then go to zigzag shapes by victory.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.500
And here we have a corner wrong.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.560
So let's click on that Pretty awesome.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.310
I'm going to zoom out because we need to enlarge this wall.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.640
So here,

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.120
make sure that the wall is selected and used this cube to enlarge it.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.460
And this Cuba as well.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:51.930
Pretty awesome.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.210
Then what I'm going to do is changing its color.

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:00.030
So let's change its color to something like this.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.430
That's pretty great.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.940
I'm gonna zoom mean and then I'm gonna go to library.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.920
And this time I'm gonna open up environments like this.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.970
And here we have different kinds of environments.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:13.900
So,

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:14.900
for instance,

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.250
we can try this one.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:23.020
You can drag and drop it like this and let's render are seen to see how it looks.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.880
That's great.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:24.730
However,

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.840
I'm going to change it to something else like this one.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.820
Remember that the environment that you choose is going to have faked the reflections and

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:33.770
also shadows.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:34.350
OK,

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.350
so make sure to choose the best environment possible.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.430
Let's try this one as well.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.560
I think it's great.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.330
Then that's add some three D assets to our scene.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:52.450
So let's go to Asset Section and here look for books and I'm gonna choose this one pretty

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:53.230
awesome.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.060
Let's enlarge it fantastic.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.280
And I'm gonna look for something else for instance,

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.680
a cup of drink like this.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.240
Let's make a smaller movie to the right side.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.450
Fantastic.

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.960
And we can also add a doughnut.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.550
So let's look for Don't not.

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.200
We can add,

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.140
for instance,

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.980
this fun.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.580
It's a locally doughnut.

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.990
I'm gonna make it smaller and put it next to our cup of drink.

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.650
Okay,

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:23.640
All right.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.430
As you can see,

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.270
they have a rectangle light.

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.100
However,

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.860
I'm gonna add another light are seen.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.450
So let's look for directional light pretty good.

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:35.890
I'm gonna zoom out.

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.360
Let's move it to the right side.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.060
Rotated a little bit.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.250
I think now it's better.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.810
We can also add different objects are seen in order to make it look more professional and

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.410
also more complex.

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:50.200
However,

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.850
for the sake of thes course,

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.390
I'm going to keep it simple.

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.980
Or Ryan.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.830
Let's render are seen to see how it looks.

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.170
It's pretty great,

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.820
isn't it?

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:05.250
You can also go ahead and add some objects from collections.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:06.230
For instance,

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.680
we can go ahead and open up organic shapes,

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:15.040
and here we have different objects like this one that scale it down.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.630
Or you could use another objects,

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:18.370
for instance,

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.260
around the shapes like this one.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.750
It depends on you and the project you're working on.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:30.470
So make sure to choose great objects in order to create the best combination possible.

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:30.750
All right,

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:31.090
guys,

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.250
thank you so much for watching this video.

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:34.620
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.080
And in the next video,

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.000
we will talk about rendering and exporting.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.080
So see you then.
