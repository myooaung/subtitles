00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.650
Hi.

00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.710
Welcome back to another section of the scores in this video.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.430
We're gonna be talking about the color Stein.

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.040
What's the color style?

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.490
As a matter of fact,

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.040
every brand has a set of colors that they stick to.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:14.350
So,

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:15.280
for instance,

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.970
when you think of Tweeter,

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.250
I'm pretty sure you think blue.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:20.650
So in the section,

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.770
we're going to create our own color style or,

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:24.370
let's say,

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:29.080
our own style guide to help us during our design process.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.150
So I will see you in the next video.
