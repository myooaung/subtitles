00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.350
Hi,

00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:00.980
everyone.

00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:05.090
And welcome back to another video off these course in this video,

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.780
we're gonna be talking about the effects section.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:08.770
As a matter of fact,

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:10.140
the use defect section.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.600
So many times when we were designing a user interface,

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.790
for instance,

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.470
there are times that you want to add some shadows to your object or even to your text.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.190
Or probably you want to add a Blair effect,

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.450
your object or two.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:25.150
You're bankrupt.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.690
In these cases,

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.560
we can use the effects section so we don't find I do.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.740
Let's get it started.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.010
As you can see here,

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.600
I have created a scene for the square and I change its color to these hex collar coat.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.260
Okay,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.830
double 0 38 double.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.450
If now I'm gonna add some drop shadow to eat.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.000
OK,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.890
so let's go to Effect section and I'm gonna click on these plus button.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.970
And here you have a drop menu.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.840
You have inner shadow.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:55.650
And as you can see,

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.860
this option will add some shadows inside of your object.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.850
If you want to modify your shadow,

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.520
you can click and the sun icon and here you have the advanced options.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.950
You have the Blair amount.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.430
Now it's set to four.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.100
I'm going to change it to 100 as you can see,

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.020
changes apply immediately.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:21.090
You could also change the X access that set it to 20 on this 1 to 10.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.520
Of course,

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.420
you cannot see the changes here because it's actually inside our object.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.010
However,

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.160
we will try these options for drop shadows as well.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.070
The next option you have is the color of your shadow.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.210
You can easily change it to any calorie want,

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.630
and your capacity is set to 25% by default.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.910
If you want to change it,

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:41.290
you could,

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.730
of course,

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.870
increase it or decrease it.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.330
Life this You have also the mod menus here.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.250
Pretty awesome.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.150
Let's change the type of shadow to drop shadow,

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.740
Okay?

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.310
And most of the time we use drop shadow when we're designing a user interface.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.580
So now let's go and change this collar to black,

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.650
and I'm gonna set it to 25% pretty awesome.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:12.600
And then let's change the Blair to 40 and the X 20 and of wine 2 20 If you want to get a

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.120
very good drop shadow,

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.950
you can calculate your numbers like me.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:17.840
For instance,

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.790
if you said that Blair to 40 you could divide it by two and set that number as the Via

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:25.990
Mount like here.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.600
And then I'm gonna change the opacity to 20% like this.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.630
Pretty nice,

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:32.280
isn't it?

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.490
As you can see,

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:34.760
it looks pretty good.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.850
However,

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.120
I'm going to suggest you something in order to make your shadow more realistic.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:47.570
It's a good idea to choose the same color for your shadow as your objects color like this.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:48.160
OK,

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.960
and then decreased capacity to,

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.130
for instance,

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.650
15% or even 10%.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.390
It's totally up to you.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.950
However,

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.060
it makes more sense because actually,

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.340
colorful objects don't have black shadows.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.910
OK,

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.440
so if I duplicate thes square and I changed his color to,

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.170
for example,

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.020
something like this Okay,

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:21.800
I can change the shadow to the same color and increase it to 10% or 15% like this.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.230
Can you see the slide difference here?

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.880
It makes it more realistic,

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.770
are right.

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:32.470
So now let's go ahead and talk about other options as well as you can see here you have

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.530
layer blur and bank Rambler.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.440
So if I choose Layer Blair As you can see,

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.420
it blares my selected layer,

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.970
okay?

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.460
And I can change the amount here like this.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:44.780
Pretty awesome.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.480
I'm gonna set it to 10.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.260
And you have the background,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.080
Blair as well.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.980
But as you can see,

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.700
when I choose that nothing happens because I don't have anything behind these shape.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.130
So if I want to see the effect off the background,

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.680
Blair,

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.280
I need to have something behind it.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:07.350
So let's go ahead and choose thes square and I'm gonna place an imaging that so let's

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.190
choose this one pretty good.

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.750
Then I'm gonna put this square on top off my image like this.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:14.350
And here,

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:15.180
As you can see,

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.450
the bag around Blair is selected,

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.340
but you can not see anything,

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.960
because when you're using the banker on Blair,

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:26.320
you need to decrease the A pass ity off your field in order to see the changes,

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.050
not the capacity of your layer.

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.120
If I change it to 50 we can see that nothing happens.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:38.150
But if I change the opacity off my color to 50% you can see the effect.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:45.570
And now I'm going to change the color as well to something else like this and let's

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.310
decreasing to 30% and I'm going to change that.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.980
Blair amount to 20% and that is fantastic.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.560
So let me remove this layer and then add a circle here like this,

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.000
make it black and then add background,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.960
blurted it on.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.210
Let's decrease the opacity to 30% on.

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.350
I'm going to set the Blair amount to 50 and now you can clear the seed effect.

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.850
You can also add the thanks to the text layers.

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.130
So if I creates a text layer here,

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.980
that's right.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:16.580
Hello.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.750
You can see that I can add a drop shadow,

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.180
the inner shadow,

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.530
the layer Blair and also the bank around Blair as well.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:25.780
Like this are right,

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:26.140
guys.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:27.710
That's all for this video.

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.050
I hope you enjoyed it and I will see you in the next video.
