00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.880
Hi,

00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:01.410
everyone.

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:02.820
In this video,

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.070
we're gonna be talking about layouts in design.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.090
When it comes to you are UX design.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.550
The way we show the information in a nap or website is so important.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.340
As a matter of fact,

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.920
there is not a specific right way to create your own composition,

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.460
so you can easily create a layout based on your own need,

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.990
as long as it is consistent and understandable to users.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.950
As you can see in the pictures on the right,

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.050
both screens are well designed.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.720
Although the spacing is different,

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.440
the composition is absolutely clear and consistent.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.610
You need to pay attention to consistency a lot.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.060
While you're designing a user interface,

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.880
no matter what kind of platforms you're designing for the same rules,

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.190
apply to all of them.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.260
All right.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:02.650
Now let's check these pictures out as it can see in the Left picture that the senses are

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.500
quite consistent.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.410
For instance,

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:11.030
if you look at the distance between the profile image and the top of the screen,

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:17.760
you can realize that the value is 50 pixels and also the D since between the same profile

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.190
image and the text field right under that is again.

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.390
50 pixels.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.230
As you can see,

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.810
the layout of this design is quite clear.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.140
And the reason of that is because of the consistency of spacing.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.930
In the next lectures,

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.230
we will also talk about spacing and the importance of that in design.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.920
Now,

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.950
if you look at the right picture,

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.690
you can realize that the design is also clear.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:45.840
In that layout,

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.890
However,

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.820
the only difference is the colors and the spacing.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.590
But as you may have noticed,

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.620
the spacing is again consistent.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:56.230
All right.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.400
Thank you so much for watching this video.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.350
I will see you in the next video.
