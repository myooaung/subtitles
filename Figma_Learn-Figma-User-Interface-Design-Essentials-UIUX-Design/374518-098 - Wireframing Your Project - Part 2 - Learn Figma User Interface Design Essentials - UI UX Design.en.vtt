00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.309
Haider, after the hero section,

00:00:02.309 --> 00:00:04.425
I'm going to create the feature section.

00:00:04.425 --> 00:00:05.880
So for these service,

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.835
which is an online banking application,

00:00:08.835 --> 00:00:11.595
we're going to create three features sections.

00:00:11.595 --> 00:00:13.305
Okay, what's the feature section?

00:00:13.305 --> 00:00:15.495
A feature section, as you may guess,

00:00:15.495 --> 00:00:18.360
is a section that provides the user with

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.905
the features of that particular service or that particular product,

00:00:22.905 --> 00:00:25.109
which in our case is the application.

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.510
Okay, so for each feature section,

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.340
we are going to need a title,

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.480
a description, and on the right side we need to have an image.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.970
So I'm gonna go ahead and select these title and this description.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.955
I'm going to hold down the Shift key to select both of them.

00:00:40.955 --> 00:00:44.195
Hit command C or control C on your keyboard,

00:00:44.195 --> 00:00:50.090
and then hit Command V or control V on your keyboard and move it down like this.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.020
Pretty good.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.005
Let me align them to the left side here as well.

00:00:54.005 --> 00:00:57.710
And as you can see, our description here is not reliable enough.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.000
So what I'm gonna do,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.315
I'm gonna go ahead and select these wireframe art board and change its background color.

00:01:05.315 --> 00:01:06.620
As you can see by default,

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.510
it's set to white,

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.015
but I'm gonna change it to our neutral color.

00:01:11.015 --> 00:01:17.210
Let me scroll down and now we can change the color description to something else.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.805
For example, secondary light.

00:01:19.805 --> 00:01:21.455
And for these title,

00:01:21.455 --> 00:01:24.905
you could change it to secondary dark fantastic.

00:01:24.905 --> 00:01:28.475
Now on the right side we need an image and we can copy and paste it.

00:01:28.475 --> 00:01:32.030
Can you see how simple it is to create a low fidelity wireframe?

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.044
So I'm gonna copy and paste it, move it down,

00:01:35.044 --> 00:01:39.335
but I'm gonna make it smaller a little bit like this.

00:01:39.335 --> 00:01:41.060
Pretty good are right?

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.875
Actually in this section,

00:01:42.875 --> 00:01:46.190
we're going to present a credit card on the right side.

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.760
Okay?

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.555
So this is why I made it look like a credit card.

00:01:50.555 --> 00:01:53.195
The aspect ratio illustrates its purpose.

00:01:53.195 --> 00:01:56.720
Okay, and now we need another feature section.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.215
I'm going to select all these three elements and hit

00:02:00.215 --> 00:02:04.130
Command Z or Control D on your keyboard to duplicate them,

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.115
move them down a little bit like this.

00:02:07.115 --> 00:02:11.795
But this time I'm going to change the place of our title and description with our image.

00:02:11.795 --> 00:02:12.890
So what I'm gonna do,

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.305
I'm gonna select both of them, grouped them,

00:02:15.305 --> 00:02:20.180
move them to the right side and select our image and move it to the left side.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.115
Okay, so in this section,

00:02:22.115 --> 00:02:26.375
we're going to have some statistics and for example, a charge.

00:02:26.375 --> 00:02:27.680
So what I'm gonna do,

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.125
I'm gonna make it a little bit smaller.

00:02:30.125 --> 00:02:33.995
So this rectangle is going to hold our chart.

00:02:33.995 --> 00:02:35.495
I'm going to duplicate it.

00:02:35.495 --> 00:02:37.910
Command your control, the end, my keyword,

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.140
move it up and make it a little bit smaller like this.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.395
And once again duplicate it will be down,

00:02:45.395 --> 00:02:49.235
which is right next to our previous rectangle, like this.

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:50.270
All right, pretty good.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:51.605
Let me select all of them,

00:02:51.605 --> 00:02:53.435
group them and movie down.

00:02:53.435 --> 00:02:55.700
But for these feature I'm gonna need a button.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.500
Okay, uh, Learn More button.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.115
So what I'm gonna do is move this text group

00:03:01.115 --> 00:03:04.865
up a little bit and make some place for our button.

00:03:04.865 --> 00:03:07.550
So let's go ahead and copy this button.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.325
And I'm gonna hit Command C or control C.

00:03:10.325 --> 00:03:12.200
And here I'm going to heat.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.555
Man V or control V.

00:03:14.555 --> 00:03:15.335
There we go.

00:03:15.335 --> 00:03:20.660
Alright, now we need to create one more feature section for our landing page.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.180
Okay? Alright, so for these features section,

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.030
I'm going to need again heading a description and

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.154
also some small images right below the description.

00:03:30.154 --> 00:03:32.450
Alright, so let me copy and paste it,

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.130
command C and Command V.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.065
I'm gonna move it down here.

00:03:36.065 --> 00:03:39.275
Right under that, I need some circular images.

00:03:39.275 --> 00:03:41.780
Okay, so let me create a circle.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.025
I'm going to choose the ellipse,

00:03:43.025 --> 00:03:46.385
hold down the Shift key and click and drag pretty good like this.

00:03:46.385 --> 00:03:50.105
And I'm gonna change the color of it to secondary light.

00:03:50.105 --> 00:03:53.975
Okay, then let me duplicate it to the right side.

00:03:53.975 --> 00:03:56.030
Duplicate it again and again.

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.875
Okay, so these are going to be our image placeholders, pretty good.

00:04:00.875 --> 00:04:03.485
And on the right side I'm gonna have some images.

00:04:03.485 --> 00:04:08.630
Okay, so what I'm gonna do is select one of these rectangles here.

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.160
I'm going to double-click on that.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.270
Let me copy it.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.150
Command C, Command V, like this.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.805
And I'm going to make it a little bit smaller.

00:04:16.805 --> 00:04:21.440
Okay, this section is going to represent the support feature of these platform.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.700
So on the right side,

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.250
I'm gonna need some chat bubbles.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.380
Okay, let me duplicated Command Z or Control D movie down once again,

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.960
duplicate it, pretty good, right?

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.225
Our feature section is done.

00:04:35.225 --> 00:04:37.460
Now we can move on to the next part,

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.110
which is our membership plans.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.960
Okay, so let me zoom in here in the middle,

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.200
we're going to have a title and right under that,

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.645
we're going to have a very short description.

00:04:47.645 --> 00:04:52.550
Okay, so let me hold down the command key on my keyboard or control key and

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.680
click on one of these rectangles like this to select only this one.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.655
And I'm going to copy it command C and paste it command we

00:05:01.655 --> 00:05:06.005
gonna move it down and let me align it to the center horizontally.

00:05:06.005 --> 00:05:07.760
And also I'm gonna make it larger,

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:08.915
but not like this.

00:05:08.915 --> 00:05:12.110
Actually, I'm going to hold down the option key or all key on

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:17.000
my keyboard and then try to enlarge it from both sides.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.070
This is exactly what you want.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.440
Let me duplicate it, moving down,

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.285
since this is a description,

00:05:23.285 --> 00:05:26.555
I'm going to make it a little bit smaller like this.

00:05:26.555 --> 00:05:29.990
And let me change it's color to secondary light.

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.715
And finally, I'm going to make it a little bit smaller like this.

00:05:34.715 --> 00:05:37.220
Fantastic. Okay, so we have our title,

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:38.660
we have our subtitle,

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.990
and here we need to have two different plans,

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.570
the free plan and the premium plan, okay?

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.700
Each plan should have the price,

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:47.900
a call to action,

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.810
and also an image at the user can choose

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:55.084
the design of their debit cards or their credit cards.

00:05:55.084 --> 00:05:59.135
And finally, some short features of that particular plan.

00:05:59.135 --> 00:06:01.655
Okay, so let me select the Rectangle tool.

00:06:01.655 --> 00:06:04.489
I'm going to click and drag like this.

00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:05.450
Fantastic.

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:12.890
I'm gonna make it round it and let me change it's color to our secondary light like this.

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:14.900
Alright, so as I told you before,

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.575
for this plan, we need to have some information such as a title.

00:06:18.575 --> 00:06:21.455
I'm going to select this rectangle, hit Command C,

00:06:21.455 --> 00:06:24.485
Command we to pace it like this.

00:06:24.485 --> 00:06:25.190
Fantastic.

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.185
So this is going to be our tidal.

00:06:27.185 --> 00:06:29.929
I'm gonna duplicate it and move it down.

00:06:29.929 --> 00:06:31.745
Let me enlarge it a little bit.

00:06:31.745 --> 00:06:33.830
This is going to be our pricing.

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.150
We need to have a button.

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.915
Ok, so I'm gonna go up, select this button,

00:06:38.915 --> 00:06:44.134
Command C, Command V and move it down like this.

00:06:44.134 --> 00:06:45.575
But in the layers list,

00:06:45.575 --> 00:06:47.465
we need to move it up,

00:06:47.465 --> 00:06:49.640
ok, here, pretty good.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.970
Here we have the button and then we need to have an image.

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:54.680
So let's create one.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.230
I'm going to select the Rectangle tool,

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:02.810
click and drag this little going to be our credit card or debit card placeholder,

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:04.055
make it around it,

00:07:04.055 --> 00:07:07.655
and let's change the color to secondary dark.

00:07:07.655 --> 00:07:09.785
Then we need to have some texts.

00:07:09.785 --> 00:07:11.885
Okay, so let's select this title,

00:07:11.885 --> 00:07:13.145
copy and paste it.

00:07:13.145 --> 00:07:15.800
Command C, Command V or control C,

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.815
control V, and make it a little bit smaller.

00:07:18.815 --> 00:07:22.490
And let's make it a little bit wider. Fantastic.

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:27.425
And finally, let's change the color to neutron k that we duplicated.

00:07:27.425 --> 00:07:29.555
Move it down, duplicated,

00:07:29.555 --> 00:07:33.230
ok. We have successfully created our first plan.

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:36.155
I'm going to select all these elements and group them.

00:07:36.155 --> 00:07:39.230
Click and drag to select them like this,

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:43.070
and hit Command Z or Control G to group them.

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:45.515
Then let's call it Plan,

00:07:45.515 --> 00:07:47.000
and I'm gonna duplicate it.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.810
A MAN D or control the hand moves to the right side, okay,

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:53.090
then select both of them, group them,

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:56.750
Command Z or Control G and call it plans.

00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:00.245
And finally, I'm going to align it to the center horizontally.

00:08:00.245 --> 00:08:01.535
It looks so nice.

00:08:01.535 --> 00:08:05.390
Alright, the next section is going to be a Q and a section.

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:07.355
So for this Q and a section,

00:08:07.355 --> 00:08:09.980
again, we need a title, a description.

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:12.020
So I'm gonna select both of them.

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:16.025
Command C, Command V or control C, control V.

00:08:16.025 --> 00:08:18.440
Ok, move it down like this.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:22.399
And here we need to have some rectangles to hold our questions.

00:08:22.399 --> 00:08:25.160
Okay, so let me create a rectangle.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:29.329
We can drag like this and let me make it rounded.

00:08:29.329 --> 00:08:33.515
And finally, I'm gonna change its color to our secondary light.

00:08:33.515 --> 00:08:37.145
All right, and this place holder is going to have a text layer.

00:08:37.145 --> 00:08:39.410
So let me select this title Command Z,

00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:41.315
Command V and we down,

00:08:41.315 --> 00:08:44.390
and I'm gonna move it up in the layers list here.

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:45.315
Predict good.

00:08:45.315 --> 00:08:47.480
Let me make it a little bit smaller,

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.785
moving to the left side.

00:08:48.785 --> 00:08:50.465
So this is going to be our question.

00:08:50.465 --> 00:08:51.575
And on the right side,

00:08:51.575 --> 00:08:54.110
we're going to need an icon, which is an image.

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:54.470
Okay?

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:58.010
So I'm gonna create a circle like this,

00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:02.795
will be to the right side and change its color to neutron. Pretty good.

00:09:02.795 --> 00:09:04.460
Then let's select all of them,

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:07.804
grouped them, and let's name it question.

00:09:07.804 --> 00:09:13.580
Okay, and finally, you can duplicate it and move it down for our second question, again,

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:17.750
duplicated to get five questions like this are right,

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:19.280
we are almost done.

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:23.120
The last thing we need for our landing page is a Footer.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.760
Footer is a section that includes

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:30.530
all the important links of your website and also the copyright disclaimer.

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:32.675
I'm gonna select the Rectangle tool,

00:09:32.675 --> 00:09:34.625
click and drag like this,

00:09:34.625 --> 00:09:38.495
and then change its color to secondary dark.

00:09:38.495 --> 00:09:41.555
Okay, and here we need to have a logo,

00:09:41.555 --> 00:09:43.340
then the copyright disclaimer,

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:45.590
and then three columns of links.

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:47.750
All right, so let's create a logo.

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:50.555
So simple, we need a rectangle.

00:09:50.555 --> 00:09:53.270
Hold down the Shift key to create a square.

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:54.140
There we go.

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:58.565
I'm gonna make it round it and let me choose secondary light for it.

00:09:58.565 --> 00:10:00.050
Okay, so this is our logo.

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:04.070
Then we need to have the copyright disclaimer right under that.

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:08.315
So let's create some description like this.

00:10:08.315 --> 00:10:09.680
I'm gonna make it round it.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.355
And again, I'm going to choose secondary light like this,

00:10:13.355 --> 00:10:15.455
duplicate it and move it down.

00:10:15.455 --> 00:10:16.490
Fantastic.

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:19.535
So the left side of our footer is ready.

00:10:19.535 --> 00:10:21.380
I'm going to select these two layers,

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:24.875
group them and also let me select this logo and this group.

00:10:24.875 --> 00:10:29.225
And once again group them and I'm going to move them down the right side.

00:10:29.225 --> 00:10:30.545
As I mentioned before,

00:10:30.545 --> 00:10:33.395
we need to have three columns of links.

00:10:33.395 --> 00:10:35.390
So let me create a rectangle,

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:37.790
but small one and make it round it.

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:41.555
And let's change the color to this primary one pay.

00:10:41.555 --> 00:10:42.620
We never used it,

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.825
since these are gonna be links,

00:10:44.825 --> 00:10:49.940
it's better to choose another color and duplicate it, move it down.

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:52.415
Once again, duplicate it like this.

00:10:52.415 --> 00:10:55.475
Each column is going to have three links.

00:10:55.475 --> 00:11:00.170
Now I'm going to hold down the Shift key on my keyboard and select all three links,

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:03.125
group them, hit Command Z or Control Z,

00:11:03.125 --> 00:11:05.420
and I'm going to name it links.

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:07.625
Okay, then in the Inspector,

00:11:07.625 --> 00:11:10.310
I can change the spacing between them easily.

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:10.985
Like this.

00:11:10.985 --> 00:11:12.350
I'm going to set it to 70.

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:13.640
I think it's pretty good.

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.185
And while it's selected,

00:11:15.185 --> 00:11:18.350
let's duplicated Command Z or Control D,

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:21.815
and moving to the right side and once again duplicated.

00:11:21.815 --> 00:11:22.940
And there we go.

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:25.745
All our three columns are ready.

00:11:25.745 --> 00:11:27.710
So I'm gonna move it to the left side.

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:31.685
Alright guys, let's check our wireframe and see if we need to make some changes.

00:11:31.685 --> 00:11:36.230
So here, let me select all these questions and move them up a little bit.

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:37.415
I'm going to zoom out.

00:11:37.415 --> 00:11:40.340
And there we go. Our wireframe is ready.

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:45.800
So I'm going to select this wireframe art bore and click on this play icon to preview it.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:46.970
Alright, so as you can see,

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:51.530
we have a hero section with navbar and all the necessary elements.

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:54.200
I'm going to move down and we have feature one,

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:58.805
feature two, feature three, pretty good.

00:11:58.805 --> 00:12:00.815
And a Q and a section.

00:12:00.815 --> 00:12:05.420
And the footer, did you see how easy it is to create these low-fidelity wireframe?

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:06.485
In the next video,

00:12:06.485 --> 00:12:08.945
we will start designing our project together.

00:12:08.945 --> 00:12:12.900
I hope you enjoyed this video and see you in the next one.
