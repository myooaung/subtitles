00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.980
Hey, welcome back.

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.245
Now that are landing pages ready,

00:00:04.245 --> 00:00:08.640
we're going to create a fully functional prototype for our website.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.775
So without further ado, let's get started.

00:00:11.775 --> 00:00:14.295
Alright, let's take a look at our landing page.

00:00:14.295 --> 00:00:19.350
As a matter of fact, we are going to add interactivity to some of our elements.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.315
So if you head over to the plans,

00:00:21.315 --> 00:00:22.650
pay, I'm gonna zoom in.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.570
First of all, I think it's a good idea to add the hover state to this button,

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.370
okay, to this Get Started button.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.339
So when the user hovers over this button,

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:33.525
it will be changed.

00:00:33.525 --> 00:00:38.810
Okay, the next thing we need to add is the Lite version of these credit card.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.505
Ok, so as you can see here,

00:00:40.505 --> 00:00:42.275
we added two different themes.

00:00:42.275 --> 00:00:45.110
And when the user clicks on the light theme,

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.239
this credit card should be changed.

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.310
Okay, and last but not least,

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.820
we're going to add interactivity to our Q&A cards.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.710
Okay, so as you can see here,

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.010
we want to create an accordion effect, okay,

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.640
so when the user clicks on one of these cards,

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.970
the height of these cars should expand and it takes

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.450
related to that specific card should be displayed. Okay?

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:09.980
Alright, and that's all.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:15.380
So in order to add these three interactions are to our landing page.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.260
First of all, we need to select our landing page.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.805
We need to duplicate it,

00:01:19.805 --> 00:01:24.560
mandy or Control D. So basically here we have a copy of our landing page.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.590
Okay, and now I'm going to zoom in like this.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.020
Make sure to select the ghetto started group.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.345
Then head over to the inspector and go to the prototype tab at the top.

00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:37.790
And as you can see, if you zoom in,

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.610
a circle appears on your elements,

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.565
okay, like this with a plus icon inside.

00:01:43.565 --> 00:01:49.580
What I want you to do is click and drag to create these airline and

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:56.450
connect that element to your second landing page that we just copied, okay, like that.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.800
And now these two landing pages are connected together. Okay?

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.405
So the left one,

00:02:02.405 --> 00:02:04.175
which is the first landing page,

00:02:04.175 --> 00:02:06.829
is the beginning of the animation.

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:11.570
Ok, so it works as a trigger when the user clicks on this button,

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:17.269
the animation starts and the second landing page is the ending of that animation.

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.660
Okay, so the last stage and whatever happens

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.140
in between is handled automatically by sigma.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.845
So you don't need to worry about creating a specific animation.

00:02:27.845 --> 00:02:29.825
Everything is handled by fema.

00:02:29.825 --> 00:02:33.440
Alright, now I'm gonna close this interaction details pop up.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.820
I'm going to zoom in. And here we are going to change our button.

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.505
So I'm going to select that double-click on it,

00:02:40.505 --> 00:02:43.655
are right, and I'm going to select the rectangle.

00:02:43.655 --> 00:02:46.250
Okay, let's go to the design tab and I'm going to

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.220
remove the stroke and add a feeling instead.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.295
And I'm going to choose the same color, secondary dark,

00:02:52.295 --> 00:02:58.700
and make sure to change the color of your text layer from secondary dark to white.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:59.900
Okay, pretty good.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.990
And now let's go to prototype and I'm going

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.140
to select my first button in the first landing page.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.370
And as you can see here,

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.040
we have the interactions section.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.180
If you click here,

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.620
this window pops up,

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.380
ok. And here you can specify the settings of your interaction and animation.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.300
Okay, so for the trigger,

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.680
which is the first part.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.555
I'm going to open up these drop menu.

00:03:23.555 --> 00:03:25.939
By default, it's set to onclick.

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:27.425
You have different options,

00:03:27.425 --> 00:03:29.180
such as on drag, wind,

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.745
hovering, point, pressing, et cetera.

00:03:31.745 --> 00:03:34.369
I'm gonna go with wild hovering.

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:36.859
Okay, and in the animation section,

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:41.000
you can open up this drop menu and you have different options as well.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.950
Here we can go with instance,

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.480
you can go with dissolve,

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.160
you can go with the smart animate.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.670
I would suggest that you should use the smart animate, okay,

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.135
and then you can specify the type of animation,

00:03:53.135 --> 00:03:55.730
like easing, ease out, easy in and out.

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.905
It doesn't matter for now, okay?

00:03:57.905 --> 00:04:01.234
And also you can specify the duration of the animation,

00:04:01.234 --> 00:04:03.245
and I'm going to leave it as 0s.

00:04:03.245 --> 00:04:04.610
Let me close this window.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.725
And basically that's all.

00:04:06.725 --> 00:04:09.680
Let's preview our prototype are right.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.970
I'm going to scroll down.

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.970
So when the user hovers over this button,

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.945
you can see that it's appearance changes immediately, like this.

00:04:17.945 --> 00:04:19.580
It's pretty good, isn't it?

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.710
But it doesn't work with the other button.

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:24.020
You can go ahead and add it if you wish.

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.670
But for this tutorial,

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:30.260
I just want to show you how the interactions work, okay? All right.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.865
Now let's go ahead and trying to animate our credit card section.

00:04:34.865 --> 00:04:36.170
I'm going to zoom in here.

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:37.340
So what do we have?

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.420
As you can see, our initial stage is this darker, okay?

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.709
We need to add the interaction to this light circle.

00:04:45.709 --> 00:04:50.120
Alright, now we need to go ahead and select our initial landing page,

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.965
which is our main landing page.

00:04:51.965 --> 00:04:54.020
Once again, duplicated.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.910
Command your control D.

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.975
Pretty good. And then I'm going to zoom in here, OK,

00:04:59.975 --> 00:05:03.890
and we need to double-click on this live circle and try to

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:08.420
connect this Seroquel to a landing page that we just duplicated,

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.775
okay, like this, perfect.

00:05:10.775 --> 00:05:12.155
And for this interaction,

00:05:12.155 --> 00:05:16.265
I'm gonna set it to unclick and a smart animate.

00:05:16.265 --> 00:05:17.270
That's all.

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.150
Alright, so what should we change here?

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.550
We need to change two things.

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:27.725
First, the appearance of the credit card because it should be lined.

00:05:27.725 --> 00:05:31.115
Second of all, we should move this stroke,

00:05:31.115 --> 00:05:32.720
okay, to the right side.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.880
So let's start with this stroke.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.390
I'm going to select that will be to the right side and

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:42.050
make sure that it's aligned with your inner circle.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.010
Perfect.

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.090
And then I'm going to modify the appearance of these credit card.

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:50.165
So let's go to the Design tab first things first,

00:05:50.165 --> 00:05:53.000
let's start with this dark color.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.500
Okay, I'm gonna select star three like this.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:02.255
And let me change it's color to secondary light, okay?

00:06:02.255 --> 00:06:05.510
And then I'm gonna select star four, okay?

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.194
And I'm gonna change this accent to neutral.

00:06:08.194 --> 00:06:09.035
Pretty good.

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:12.080
And then I'm gonna select my Text layers and change

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.145
their color to secondary dark like this.

00:06:16.145 --> 00:06:17.540
Okay, and we are done.

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.105
So let's go ahead and give it a try.

00:06:20.105 --> 00:06:24.274
I'm going to select my initial landing page and that's previewed.

00:06:24.274 --> 00:06:26.105
Let's scroll down.

00:06:26.105 --> 00:06:27.290
Get Started.

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.195
Button works perfectly.

00:06:29.195 --> 00:06:32.600
And then I'm going to click on this line circle.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.545
There we go.

00:06:33.545 --> 00:06:35.495
Did you see that beautiful animation?

00:06:35.495 --> 00:06:41.450
However, we cannot go back to the first state because we didn't add that interaction yet.

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.880
So let's go ahead and add that.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:49.775
What we need to achieve here is that if the user clicks on this dark theme,

00:06:49.775 --> 00:06:52.160
everything we changed should be reversed.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.865
Okay, so we need to connect this circle, this dark circle.

00:06:55.865 --> 00:06:57.320
It's go to prototype.

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:02.479
We need to connect it to our initial landing page like this.

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:04.580
And we are good to go.

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.785
Let's preview it once again.

00:07:06.785 --> 00:07:10.145
I'm going to scroll down our right.

00:07:10.145 --> 00:07:11.240
Let's give it a try.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.045
I'm going to click on this light circle.

00:07:14.045 --> 00:07:15.155
There we go.

00:07:15.155 --> 00:07:16.490
And arc.

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:21.815
Can you see how beautiful and easy it is to create these kind of interactions?

00:07:21.815 --> 00:07:24.035
That's amazing. Alright guys,

00:07:24.035 --> 00:07:29.345
the last thing we need to do is add interaction to our Q&A cars,

00:07:29.345 --> 00:07:32.975
okay, I'm going to add the interaction to the first card only.

00:07:32.975 --> 00:07:35.030
However, for the final product,

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:38.825
you can go ahead and add the interaction to all of them if you wish.

00:07:38.825 --> 00:07:42.260
But for now I'm going to add the interaction to the first card only.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:43.670
So what do we need?

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:49.130
First of all, we need to select our initial landing page and we need to duplicate it.

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:51.575
The command, your control D, Pretty good.

00:07:51.575 --> 00:07:58.190
And now I'm gonna go ahead and select our first card in our first landing page.

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:01.865
Okay, and while we are in the prototype tab,

00:08:01.865 --> 00:08:05.600
I'm going to select this card and connected to

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.620
our last landing page that we just duplicated like this.

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:11.870
And for the interaction and we're going to choose

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:15.440
unclick and animation should be smart animate.

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.315
So we don't need to change anything.

00:08:17.315 --> 00:08:22.655
Then I'm going to zoom in and try to modify our last landing page.

00:08:22.655 --> 00:08:24.515
So what should we change here?

00:08:24.515 --> 00:08:28.310
First of all, we need to modify the height of this card.

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:33.080
Okay, so I'm gonna go to the design tab and I'm going to select these card.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.230
Ok, you can hold down the Command key or control key

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:39.545
on your keyboard and click on this car to select it.

00:08:39.545 --> 00:08:44.555
Alternatively, you can go ahead and try to select it in the layers list,

00:08:44.555 --> 00:08:46.070
okay, it's totally up to you.

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:50.450
And then I'm going to increase the height of this car to 200 pixels.

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:55.385
Ok, finally, I'm going to select all the other questions and move them down

00:08:55.385 --> 00:09:00.815
and make sure to maintain the 20 pixel padding between them like this.

00:09:00.815 --> 00:09:02.390
And last but not least,

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:07.205
we need to maintain the 160 pixels top margin for this footer.

00:09:07.205 --> 00:09:09.185
Okay, so as you can see now,

00:09:09.185 --> 00:09:11.539
I got 56 pixels.

00:09:11.539 --> 00:09:14.000
So how can I fix that? It's so simple.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.905
We should select our landing page.

00:09:15.905 --> 00:09:17.510
And here for the hide,

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:19.040
I'm going to write plus,

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:23.780
since I have 56 pixels and I need to get 160,

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:27.470
I'm going to write 104 like this.

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:31.910
And finally you select your footer and move it down. And there we go.

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:34.955
We've got 160 pixels.

00:09:34.955 --> 00:09:35.825
Perfect.

00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:37.760
What else should be changed here?

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.800
When this card is open,

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:43.760
this plus icon should be replaced with a minus icon.

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:47.540
Okay, so I'm gonna go ahead and select this line,

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:49.955
this vertical line, and remove it.

00:09:49.955 --> 00:09:51.425
And last but not least,

00:09:51.425 --> 00:09:54.065
we need to add our text line here.

00:09:54.065 --> 00:09:59.060
So here we have a question and then we need to add the answer for that specific question.

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:04.130
For now I'm going to add a lorem ipsum text layer because the answer doesn't matter.

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:06.785
But if you're working on a real world project,

00:10:06.785 --> 00:10:09.544
made sure to add real answers.

00:10:09.544 --> 00:10:14.150
Alright, so I'm going to press T on my keyboard and click to create a text layer.

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:17.270
And then I'm going to paste the tanks from my clipboard.

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:18.845
And for these takes layer,

00:10:18.845 --> 00:10:20.570
I'm gonna use body main.

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:26.134
Okay, and finally, let me change the color Stein to secondary light.

00:10:26.134 --> 00:10:27.095
Pretty good.

00:10:27.095 --> 00:10:30.440
Let me decrease the width of this text layer.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:34.055
Okay, I'm going to zoom mean like this.

00:10:34.055 --> 00:10:35.315
Let me move it up.

00:10:35.315 --> 00:10:39.110
Make sure to put these takes layer inside this card group.

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:41.735
Ok, so this is our question card,

00:10:41.735 --> 00:10:45.440
and I'm going to move this text layer and put it inside this group.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.575
So the top padding should be ten pixels,

00:10:48.575 --> 00:10:50.674
left padding should be a 30.

00:10:50.674 --> 00:10:51.740
We are almost done.

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:57.980
The last thing we need to do is connect these card to our initial landing page, okay?

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:02.360
Because when the user clicks on this first card here,

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.785
it's going to be opened.

00:11:03.785 --> 00:11:07.205
However, if he or she wants to close it,

00:11:07.205 --> 00:11:10.130
we need to connect it to our initial landing page as well.

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:12.395
So I'm going to select these question card.

00:11:12.395 --> 00:11:15.785
Make sure to select your group, okay, question group,

00:11:15.785 --> 00:11:19.805
go to the prototype tab and using this circle,

00:11:19.805 --> 00:11:24.245
tried to connect it to your first landing page, and we are done.

00:11:24.245 --> 00:11:28.280
Let's select our first landing page and try to preview it.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.725
Alright, let me scroll down.

00:11:30.725 --> 00:11:32.525
So let's give it a try.

00:11:32.525 --> 00:11:34.505
I'm going to click on the first card.

00:11:34.505 --> 00:11:35.330
There we go.

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:38.150
Did you see how beautiful that interaction was?

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:40.580
And I can close it like this.

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:45.530
So sigma lets you create complex and amazing interactions within minutes.

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:47.585
So you don't need to work with

00:11:47.585 --> 00:11:51.995
complex software in order to create a high fidelity prototype.

00:11:51.995 --> 00:11:54.560
Are right guys, it was a long journey together.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:58.410
I hope you enjoyed this section and I'll see you there.
