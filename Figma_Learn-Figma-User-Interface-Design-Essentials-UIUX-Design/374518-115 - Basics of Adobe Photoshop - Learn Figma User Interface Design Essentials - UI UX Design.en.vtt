00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.290
Hi,

00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:00.970
everyone.

00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:04.880
Welcome back to another video of this course in these video.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.350
We're gonna be talking about the basics of Adobe for the show.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:08.940
Okay,

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.090
As I mentioned in the previous video,

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:12.840
we're going to use different panels.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.360
Another before the shops such as tools,

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.880
panel layers,

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.970
panel colors,

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.180
adjustment,

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:21.190
etcetera.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:22.630
But first thing spares.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.890
We need a canvas or let's say,

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.700
a page for starting our project with.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.860
In order to do that,

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.460
you can either go to file Anchalee,

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.260
can you?

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:38.230
Or you can press command on end on Maxie Stems or Control and N on Windows.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:38.830
And here,

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:39.960
as you can see,

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.850
there is a window that you can choose the dimension of your art words.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:44.550
For instance,

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:54.820
here we can set the with 2 1920 make sure that it's set to peak cells and the high to 10 80

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:54.820
.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.240
And as you can see peak cells and I'm going to change the resolution to 72 because it's

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.520
enough for computer purposes and a Connor mode,

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.510
we need to set it to RGB because we're going to present this project on computer or on

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:09.160
screens.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.690
Okay,

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:10.050
So,

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.680
seeing why K is used for printing purposes.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.130
Okay.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.970
And I can go ahead and click on.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:16.740
OK,

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.620
and there we go.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:18.920
Your art board is ready.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.600
I didn't set a specific name for that,

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.870
but make sure to set your desire name.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.550
And now we're going to talk about the tools panel.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:27.910
As you can see here,

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.350
we have different tools and different sections.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.960
This one is called Move Toe,

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.990
and it's for moving objects or elements on your canvas or your art boards.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.140
And the next one is the selection tool.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.750
Okay.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.490
For instance,

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.800
let me create a new layer here.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.810
If you want to create a new layer,

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.880
you can easily go to layer section and click on this layer icon.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:50.770
As you can see,

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.640
we've just created a new layer.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:59.700
And then I'm gonna use the selection tool in order to select a specific area like this,

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.450
and I can feel it with any color I want.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.580
So if I want to change the color,

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:11.800
I can click on this section and I can choose these flu and let me choose the brush to fill

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.170
it.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.750
And now with this move toe,

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.480
I can easily move this around all right,

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.040
the next tool is called selection to okay.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.890
And every tool here contains some hidden tools.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:26.490
Okay,

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:27.320
As you can see,

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.820
there is a small arrow in the bottom,

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.170

The next tool is called magnetic lasso.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.220
Okay.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.590
And it's for selecting as well.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.750
You can easily select a specific area,

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:47.990
okay?

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:53.680
And you can separate your desire section from that specific image for the selecting.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.910
You can press command and D or control the on windows and here as well,

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.720

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.230
And this is the magic wand.

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.910
Okay,

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.300
It's for selection the habitants sketch as well,

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.580
so it can select a specific area magically.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.760
And the next sel is crop.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.200
It's for cropping your art pores or your image.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.620
And the next one is the eyedropper.

So you can choose a specific color off a photo or an element.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.280
Okay.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.950
And these tools are for retouching.

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:26.750
Okay.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:27.440
As you can see,

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.360
they have spot healing brush,

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.500
healing brush tool,

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.270
Pashtu,

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:32.150
etcetera.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.240
And then we have brushes.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.180
For example,

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.270
I can choose the red color here As you can see,

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.330
I can freely paint here.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.010
And if I right click,

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.590
I can change the size off that and also the hardness off my brush.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:48.710
Okay,

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.730
The next tool is called Clone Stamp to it.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.450
So retouching as well we do not work with that a lot.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.910
And then we have history,

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:57.320
brush,

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:04.300

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:12.020
Then we have Grady int like this and Blair to for blaring an image or specific part of an

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.530

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.190
And this is the Dodge Tool,

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.800
and it's for editing the brightness off a specific area off an image.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.520
Then we have the panto,

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:24.830
which is a very important tool in a door before the shop and with pan tool.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.180
You can select a specific area precisely.

Okay,

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.430

the feeder radius is going to be zero,

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:37.780
and that's click on.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:38.430
OK,

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.220
there we go.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.150
So now if I choose the brush tool,

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.950
I can feel it with red color like this,

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:50.330

Here you have a presentable type,

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.530
vertical time to horizontal type,

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.350
mask tool and verity con type mask tool.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:04.040
Most of the time we use horizontal Type two and its path selection tool.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.360
We're not going to use that a lot.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.660
And then rounded rectangle tool is for creating different shapes.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:11.480
For example,

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.690
I can create around the object like this.

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.860
Then I can make a selection with dry click,

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.690
and now I can feel it with any color I want.

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:21.920
Like this.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.930
The next option is hand tool,

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.750
and it's for panning around.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.880
You can also present it withholding space on your keyboard,

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.210
and then we have the zoom to okay to zoom mean and zoom out.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.650
Alright,

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:34.980
guys.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:39.550
Now let's focus on the layer section to see what we have there.

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:40.130
Okay?

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:41.190
As you can see,

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.930
we just created a new layer.

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.550
And as I mentioned before,

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.770
every time you want a new layer,

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.600
you can easily click on this icon,

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.570
and it creates a new layer for you.

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.030
You can change the layers name by double clicking on its name,

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.160
and you can change it to whether you want that's changing to you,

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.390
I perfect.

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:03.590
And now I'm going to create another shape here with the selection tools.

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:04.430
There we go,

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:05.970
and I can walk around.

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:07.650
If you want to hide a layer,

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:11.090
you can click on this icon like in sketch.

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:16.610
And remember that the order of placing your layers is so important in other before the shop

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.610
.

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:17.160
Okay,

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.120
so here the u is above this rounded rectangle.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.180
So if I move it on top of this rectangle,

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.220
you can see the difference.

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:31.120
So I'm going to change the color to make it clearer like this.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:37.590
You can also change the opacity here from 0 to 100% and the other important thing in at oh

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:37.590
,

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.950
before the shop is the layers time window.

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:43.870
So let's double click on this your layer.

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:44.810
And as you can see,

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.040
a window pops up,

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.130
which is called layers side.

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:52.360
And here you have different options for styling your layer,

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.230
for example.

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:56.400
Here we have blending options default,

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.210
for example,

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:00.910
who can change the opacity and the bland mode.

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:06.000
Here you have these options right in these swing Go as well as you can see,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.530
you have plenty of options here you have stroke for example,

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:15.500
I can change the color to red and increase the size you have.

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:16.630
Inner shadow.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.770
You have inner glow color over lake,

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:22.260
radiant and so much more.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:22.970
Okay,

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:25.350
you have drop shadow as well here.

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:27.130
Like this.

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:28.240
All right,

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:28.640

So see you then.
