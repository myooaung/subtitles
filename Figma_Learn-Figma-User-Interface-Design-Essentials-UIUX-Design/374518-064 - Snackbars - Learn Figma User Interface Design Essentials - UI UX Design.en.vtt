00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.300
Hi,

00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:00.960
everyone.

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.050
In these video,

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:04.950
we're gonna be talking about snack bars.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.800
Snack bars provide concise feedback about an operation through a message at the bottom of

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.550
the screen.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.150
They should contain a single line of text directly related to the operation performed.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.300
They may contain a bottle as well.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.110
When you're designing stacked bars,

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.960
make sure to pay attention to the following points.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:24.880
Number one.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.110
It should be brief.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:32.330
Snack bar should only display brief information about an operation and not detailed

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.050
information.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:39.310
Number two transient snack bars automatically time out from the screen so they should

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.120
disappear quickly and last but not least,

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.930
hierarchy.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.820
If the action is important enough to black the APP usage,

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.110
you can use dialogues instead of snack bars in the snack bars.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.830
Only use one button if it's needed and not more.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.480
As you can see on the right side of screen,

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.600
we have two different examples.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.930
The first group of snack bars are designed perfectly because it doesn't have more than one

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.430
button and the Connors that have been used or great.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:10.030
However,

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.120
on the other hand,

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.030
the second group off our snack bars has two buttons,

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.470
which is not ideal for snack bars,

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.970
and also it used an icon.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.470
In addition to the text
