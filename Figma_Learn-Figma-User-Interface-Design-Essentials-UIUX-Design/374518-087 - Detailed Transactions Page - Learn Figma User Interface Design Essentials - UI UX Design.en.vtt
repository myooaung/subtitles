00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.330
Hi,

00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:00.920
everyone.

00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.920
And welcome back to another video off the section in this video,

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.890
we're going to design our transactions detail screen together.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:09.400
OK,

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.410
so first of all,

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.930
I'm going to go ahead and duplicate these transactions aren't board.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:19.620
Then that's rename me to transactions Dash detail Pretty good.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:25.780
Then what we're going to do is actually sliding thes card down and then president ing some

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.120
details about these transactions.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.650
Okay,

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.120
So what I'm gonna do is first of all,

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.650
grouping thes elements all together.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.160
So let's elect this indicator.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.650
The card itself,

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.780
the search bar and these transactions group group them.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.400
And that's called it card movie to right below our home indicator.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.150
Pretty good.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:55.690
And then let's set the wine to 693 like this and here you're going to place our details.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:56.850
So first in stairs,

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.360
let's go ahead and select these recent transactions takes I'm going to copy that pasted

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.040
here.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.400
Let's move it up and I'm gonna change you to track your expenses.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.530
It stopped.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.960
Fighting is going to be 30 to pick cells like this,

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:15.900
and it's left padding.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.210
Should be 30 pixels.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.710
Okay,

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.080
so let me select this screen press shift and to like this.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.390
And now what else do we need?

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.840
Actually,

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.780
we have four different categories.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:26.290
OK?

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:27.150
Travel,

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.030
shopping,

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.780
sport and medicine.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:30.350
Okay,

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.110
so we need four different cards before different colors in order to sum up these amounts.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:36.650
Okay,

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.250
so let's go ahead and create a rectangle.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.520
Oh,

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.580
I'm going to drag and drop like this.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:48.330
I'm going to set the with 2 153 and the high to 103 pretty good.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:55.140
Then let's increase the corner radius to 25 and also make it smooth like this.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.090
Fantastic.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.030
And lastly,

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.310
we need to change the color.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.880
Okay,

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.030
I'm going to use a linear Grady in for these on that.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.850
Select the first color and change the color Co two double F 87 87 pretty good.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.860
And let's select the 2nd 1 Increase the capacity to 100% and I'm going to change the color

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.870
co two c 16 a six a.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.810
Like this on After that,

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.110
let's change the direction a little bit like this.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.970
Now I think is pretty good.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.540
So what else do we need to including the ISC?

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.240
Aren't we need to text layers.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.850
Okay,

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.220
The name of this card,

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.900
which is going to be travel on the total amount related to this category.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:37.400
Okay,

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.580
so first of all,

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.350
it's inserted,

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.090
takes layer and right travel,

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.890
and I'm gonna make it regular.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.700
And let's decrease the fund size to 18 points like this.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.670
And I'm going to change the color to a 7 31 31 Like this.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:54.430
Pretty good.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.150
It stop heading is going to be 24 pixels,

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.180
and it's left fighting.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.060
Should be 16 pixels like this,

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.160
duplicated,

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.430
moving down.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.780
Let's make it bold.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:05.430
And also,

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.020
let's increase the font size to 24 points.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.920
Fantastic.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:10.420
And here,

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.730
we need to write the total amount off.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.790
All travels transactions.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:15.250
Okay,

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.840
which is $399.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.550
Pretty good.

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.350
And now I'm gonna add more details to this card in order to make it a little bit better.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.120
So,

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.770
first of all,

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.770
let's go ahead and create a soup ill like this.

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.700
I'm going to set the width and height to 112.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:32.190
Okay,

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.370
then that's choose a linear Grady in 40 is I'm going to choose the first color and the

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.670
change you two f 78 c a 10.

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:41.190
See,

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:47.860
Like this carpet is Pacey toward the 2nd 1 However thes time keep the capacity to zero,

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.900
and then I'm gonna change the place of these two colors like this are right.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.130
That's changed the direction of these Connor like this.

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.960
And now we need to use a mask.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:58.490
Okay.

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:59.230
However,

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.770
as I mentioned before,

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.420
when you're using a mask,

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.070
it's better to duplicate thes rectangle.

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.580
Okay,

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:06.170
once.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.450
And I'm gonna move these circle right below our travel.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.030
Okay,

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.230
Choose the duplicated layer ankle.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.570
You can't ask to get something like this.

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:21.250
And then let's go ahead and select this circle and we down a little bit like this.

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.420
And that's pretty good.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:23.040
All right,

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.290
now,

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:24.640
let's group are elements.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.750
So I'm going to choose this mass group,

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.760
this travel and this amount and also our rectangle group them.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.870
Call it travel duplicated,

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.560
moving to the right side.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.720
And it's left padding.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:38.980
Should be nine pixels.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:39.470
Okay.

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:40.140
Like this,

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.770
Then let's select both off them.

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:47.100
Move them to the left side till you get a 30 pixel left padding and right padding.

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.610
Okay.

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:48.340
All right.

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.740
Now,

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.770
let's go ahead and choose this rectangle.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.610
20 and I'm going to change its color to something else that's used the first color.

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.680
I'm going to set it to double FCF and 87 like this.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:06.100
And the 2nd 1 is going to be see a 95 and 47 pretty good.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.770
Now let's choose this circle and change the grade in color here as well.

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.430
I'm going to select the first color,

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.840
and it's going to be F six c five and seven A.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.540
That's competence and pace it for your second color as well.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:21.200
Pretty good.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.690
And last but not least,

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:29.450
you need to select these two tanks and change the color Co 28 27 430.

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:30.280
Pretty good.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.700
Let me change the title to shopping,

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:38.210
and the amount is going to be $375.

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.750
Okay,

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:39.990
on lastly,

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.910
remember to change your name.

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:45.170
I'm going to write shopping pretty good.

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:50.840
So now I'm gonna ask you to pause the video and go ahead and duplicate one of these cars.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.850
Put it down right here,

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:56.170
and I'm gonna ask you to modify it for our sports card.

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.850
Okay?

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:00.820
The amount is going to be 199.80.

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:06.130
So I'm going to give you a hint that how you could choose these Connors It needs to be

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:07.350
something like Blue.

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:08.950
As you can see for this sport,

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:09.520
I can,

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.750
and then I'm going to show you how you could do that.

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:15.080
So let's pause the video right now and do it by yourself.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.370
Are right,

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:16.690
guys.

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:19.230
I'm pretty sure that you could do that for yourself,

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.950
however,

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:21.560
now it's time to do you together.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.040
So now let's go ahead and duplicate thes first card.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.520
I'm gonna move it down.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.090
Its top hiding is going to be nine pick cells.

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.160
Let's elect this rectangle 20.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:31.470
Okay,

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.100
which is our base layer,

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.750
and I'm going to change the radiant.

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.200
So let's use the first color on city,

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:37.790
too.

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:41.400
87 F zero and double left like this.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:47.010
Choose the 2nd 1 and write three a A to B and one pretty good,

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:49.410
and I'm gonna choose this cereal as well.

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:50.930
Let's change the color.

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:58.950
I'm going to select the 1st 1 and let's set it to 73 D C and E b competence and paste it

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.890
for the second color as well.

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:01.790
Pretty good.

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:09.930
And now I'm going to choose our text layers and change the field to 29 86 93 pretty good.

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:12.780
And let's change the title to sport.

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:16.250
So can you see that we have a great contrast here?

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:17.970
Because with the circle,

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:23.320
we created a bright background and you're using a darker color against this background,

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:23.800
OK,

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.450
which is a pretty good way for creating a good contrast ratio.

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:27.930
Okay,

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:35.650
then that's changed the amount to 199.80 and I'm going to rename this group to sports

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:39.590
that's duplicated movie to the right side,

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:42.120
and I'm going to choose this rectangle 20.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.520
That's changed the color.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:48.920
I'm going to choose the 1st 1 Let's write easier 09 f f f k.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.260
And the 2nd 1 is going to be eight,

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.410
a 46 and a be like this.

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:57.520
Let's choose our circle and change it as well.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.350
I'm going to choose the first color.

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:03.360
Let's right the 88 F f f.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:07.120
Let's copy this and pace it for the second color.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.130
Pretty good.

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:09.090
And lastly,

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:17.150
that shoes are text layers and set the color code to 91 37 BC pretty good.

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:24.370
I'm going to change the title to medicine and the amount is going to be 89 points.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:26.080
50 are right.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:26.930
And lastly,

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:28.770
let's rename me to medicine.

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:31.760
Fantastic are right.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.520
We need one more card here,

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.380
which is our credit card repayment card.

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:36.950
Okay,

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:40.510
so let's go ahead and choose thes.

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:42.990
Check your bank accounts card copy.

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:45.640
This pasted here pretty good.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:50.150
And then I'm going to select this rectangle rectangle seven.

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:51.210
Remember that?

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:52.910
And also rectangle seeks,

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:54.020
which is our mask.

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:58.520
And let's change the high to 105 like this.

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:02.670
And also we need to change the corner radius to 25.

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:03.290
Okay,

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:06.440
which is the same amount that we used for these cards.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.340
Then let me zoom in on when I align.

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:11.170
This takes with my rectangle like this.

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:15.130
And also this small arrow is going to be to the center.

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:20.710
Let's use thes two circles and move them up to get something like this.

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:27.960
And that's changed these takes to credit card repayment like this.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.640
Renay me to credit card repayment on.

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:32.790
Let's move it down.

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:34.880
It's gonna have a 16 pixel top,

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:35.790
adding are right,

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:36.130
guys,

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:37.610
that's all for these video.

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:38.930
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:41.090
And I will see you in the next video.

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:41.930
So see you then
