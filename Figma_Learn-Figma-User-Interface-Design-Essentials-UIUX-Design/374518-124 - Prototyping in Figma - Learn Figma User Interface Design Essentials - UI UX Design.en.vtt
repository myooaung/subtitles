00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.270
Hi,

00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:00.860
everyone.

00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.010
And welcome back to another video of thes course in these video,

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:10.280
we're gonna start prototyping our finance a project together in figment,

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.220
and I'm going to show you some useful techniques in order to create a very smooth and great

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:15.930
prototype.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:16.470
Okay,

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.190
so first off,

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:17.550
how?

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.190
Let's go ahead and zoo mean I'm gonna make this screen interactive.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.690
Okay?

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.010
This is our welcome page.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:24.730
And as you can see,

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.820
it consists of two different bottoms.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:27.260
Okay,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:27.920
So first,

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.850
let's select the sign in button.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.970
And then let's click on Prototype in the Inspector like this.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:34.800
And as you can see,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.730
a circular note appears.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:37.210
Okay,

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.200
that's click on that and drag and drop it like this to connect to D.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.280
Sign in the screen.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.770
Okay.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.350
And then on your right side,

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.370
you have different options to modify.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.010
We don't need to change anything in the interaction.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.080
However,

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.660
in the animation section,

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.180
I'm gonna open off this drop menu and then choose smart animate,

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.820
which is a very great feature,

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.500
and you can create micro interactions with it.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.690
Another can see the type of animation is set to easing.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:05.890
It's pretty good.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.630
The duration is 300 milliseconds.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:09.400
it's fine.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:09.950
Are right.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.320
So what does smart,

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.360
animate mean here?

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:12.830
Smart,

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.350
animate will recognize the layers in both screens with the same name.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:19.140
For instance,

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.340
Here we have shapes.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.520
And in this screen,

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.740
in the sign in the screen,

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.160
we have shapes as well.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.120
Okay with the same spelling.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.860
Remember,

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.530
spelling matters a lot.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:30.090
Okay,

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.820
so they need to be identical,

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:32.560
are right.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.740
And when the user clicks on the sign in button because here we have two layers with the

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.240
same name signal will automatically animated for us.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.750
Okay,

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.330
so let's go ahead and click on display.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.060
I can Pretty good.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.950
And I'm gonna click on signing.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.220
There we go.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.510
Did you see how smooth and beautiful death animation Waas It's pretty answer that's trying

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:55.650
to once again,

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.210
it's fantastic.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.240
You can even modify the duration if you want.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.270
For example,

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.740
let's set it to 400 I'm going to give it a try.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.260
Fantastic.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.970
Now,

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:07.730
for instance,

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.750
let's do the same thing for our sign.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.420
A button.

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.020
Okay,

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.810
so I'm going to drag and drop it here.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.820
Let's set it to smart animate,

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:16.820
and that's all.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:17.400
Okay,

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.340
pretty good.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.880
All right.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.480
The next technique I'm gonna show you it's were sliding in and sliding out.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.970
Okay,

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.980
so it's pretty useful when you want to animate your hamburger menu.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:28.550
Okay,

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.460
so here in our home page,

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.210
let's select our hamburger menu icon,

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.800
okay?

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.850
And I'm gonna drag and drop the's arrow to create a connection with our menu screen like

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:40.380
this.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.640
And then here I'm gonna set it to push like this.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.260
However,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.080
the right arrow should be selected like this.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.400
Now let's give you the trying.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.500
But before that,

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:57.430
we need to go ahead and drag and drop this play icon and put it here because it indicates

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.030
that these prototyping should start from these home page.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.580
OK,

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.970
so now let's go ahead and click on this American many Nikon.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.780
There we go are right.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.250
I think it's a good idea to change the duration to 200 milliseconds.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.550
Let's give it a try.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:14.630
It's pretty good,

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:15.200
isn't it?

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.350
Now let's go ahead and select these overlay layer,

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.890
okay,

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:19.860
this dark one,

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.020
and I'm going to create a connection from here to our home page screen.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.220
Let's set it to push,

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.630
and this time the left arrow should be selected with 200 milliseconds duration and I'm

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:32.750
going to select smart,

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.080
animate matching layers.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.540
Okay,

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.540
because in these two screens,

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.450
we have thes profile image,

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.840
so I'm gonna make it animated automatically.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.320
Okay,

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.550
let's give it a try.

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:43.710
There we go.

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:44.870
And if I click here,

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.350
you can see that our profile images animated.

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.810
Okay,

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:48.220
of course,

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.430
you can use simple animations as well.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.260
For instance,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.520
we can go ahead and click on the sign in button.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.050
Okay,

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.250
let's make a connection to our or tippy verification pretty good.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.390
And I'm going to set it to instant like this.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:03.320
And once again,

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.520
remember to move these play icon two D screen.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.490
Let's give it a try like this.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:10.350
It's incident.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.860
You can also change it to dissolve and give it a try.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.420
There we go.

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.150
It facing.

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.050
So as you can see,

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:21.050
creating a great prototype is not that difficult in FEMA.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.460
Alright,

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.840
guys,

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.540
that's all for this video.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.770
I hope you enjoyed it and I will see you in the next video.

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:27.650
So see you there
