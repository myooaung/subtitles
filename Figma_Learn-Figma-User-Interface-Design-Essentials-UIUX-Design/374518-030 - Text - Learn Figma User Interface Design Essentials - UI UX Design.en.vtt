00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.400
Hi,

00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:00.940
everyone.

00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.850
And welcome back to another video off these cores.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.030
In this video,

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.540
we're gonna be talking about texts.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:08.040
We,

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.060
as you're UX designers,

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.060
used texts all the time,

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.630
and we need to know all the secrets behind the textile.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.290
So in order to create a text in fig MMA,

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:24.550
you can easily head over to the toolbar and click on the's text icon.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.180
Or you could press t on your keyboard like this.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:28.850
Awesome.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.910
And you ve clicked once you would create an area,

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:32.610
takes layer,

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.840
or let's say a paragraph takes later.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:35.290
Okay,

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.850
so I'm going to write Hello.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:44.050
We are U I U X designers.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.280
Pretty awesome.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.490
And as you can see,

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:52.610
these kind of text line grows or is entirely when you're typing.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:53.340
Okay,

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.940
of course you can change it.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:55.830
However,

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:56.660
first of all,

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.410
let me show you how you can change the phone size.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.270
If you head over to the tax inspector on your right side,

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.950
you can change the fund.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.710
You can change the phone size can change the weight.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.810
We've been talking about all these properties later.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:12.990
So first of all,

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.460
I'm going to change it to 36.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.880
Pretty awesome.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.650
Now I'm going to select the frame and I'm gonna press chief and to our right.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.250
So as I mentioned before,

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.120
this is an area text line.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.920
So what if you want to make it grow,

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:28.670
were tickly.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:29.890
In order to do that,

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.860
you can click on these dots and here you have plenty of options to change.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.060
But what we need is this re sizing,

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.370
as you can see,

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.440
it set as default to grow or is entirely if you want to make it grow,

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.700
where thickly can change you to grow vertically here.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.150
And if I continue typing from now on,

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.170
it grows.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.850
Basically,

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:58.840
I'm going to write Thank you for your support like this.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.170
You can also create a fixed sized text line,

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.310
or you could change it here like this.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.330
But what if you want to create a fixed sized text line by yourself?

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.290
It's so simple.

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:16.380
First you can choose the text to Then you will click and drag like this.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.190
And in this way you will specify the dimension off your text box like this.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.750
Okay.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:32.650
And before you write anything here like we are talking about thanks and comparing

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:40.480
difference options like this and If you want to modify the dimension of these text marks,

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.840
you can easily hover on top of these blue bounding bikes and your cursor immediately

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.470
changes to the scale icon.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:49.210
Okay?

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.210
And I can modify it like this Pretty good,

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.000
isn't it?

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.210
Let me change the way to regular are right.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.690
Sometimes it may be useful to convert a text line to a vector.

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:03.340
Okay,

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.790
so how can you do that?

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.310
If I right click here,

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.560
I can go ahead and click and flatten.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.540
And there we go.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.980
Now,

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.250
our text is a vector,

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.750
as you can see over there,

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.000
and you can modify each letter separately.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.510
So I'm gonna do mean and let's double click on these H There we go.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.950
Suppose that I'm going to change something here.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:24.820
For instance,

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:30.790
let's select thes notes and I'm gonna increase the corner radius like this.

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.350
And also for these funds,

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.440
isn't it pretty cool?

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.200
So converting your text line to a vector is useful,

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.400
especially if you're designing a logo or award Mark etcetera are right.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.770
Suppose that I'm going to create another text line like this?

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:47.430
That's right,

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:48.220
H.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.250
And I'm going to duplicate that once again.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:59.250
And once again and let's write e And here l and here l And when a duplicate that and oh,

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.470
okay had been moved him a little bit.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.190
So as I mentioned before,

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.610
in order to make your takes line a vector,

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.400
you need to flatten your text night.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.790
But what if you want to keep your layers as they are?

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:12.440
For instance,

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.820
here I have five different layers and I'm gonna make it vector.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:17.790
In this case,

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.050
you can right click.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.900
And instead of choosing flattened,

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.110
you can choose outline stroke.

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.630
OK,

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.570
and now you have all the letters as a vector.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:28.700
That's pretty awesome,

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:29.530
isn't it?

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:30.090
All right,

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.430
guys,

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.200
that's all for these video.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.110
Thank you so much for watching it.

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.450
And I will see you in the next video.
