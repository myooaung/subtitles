00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.450
Hi,

00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.010
everyone.

00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:04.940
And welcome back to another video of thes scores in this video.

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.920
We're going to design our menu screen together.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:08.510
OK,

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:09.520
so basically,

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:15.700
when the user clicks on these hamburger menu icon right at the top of this homepage screen

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:15.700
,

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.070
our menu should slide in from the left side of screen.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.650
OK,

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.150
so first of all,

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.310
I'm gonna go ahead and insert a new art birth year.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.140
So let's press a and that shoes iPhone 11 pro or X?

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.530
Pretty good.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.850
Then I'm gonna rename me to menu like this,

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.890
and after that we need to go ahead and export this screen because we're going to need that

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:40.890
.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:41.720
However,

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:47.850
remember to first hide the status bar and this home indicator.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:48.490
Okay,

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.190
I will tell you why.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.070
So first,

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.110
let's export it from the export section.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.360
You can choose to eggs in order to get a better resolution,

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.000
and the four match should be PNG.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.120
You could choose jpg as well,

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.470
but PNG's fine.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.460
Let's click on this export home page button and in our assets full there,

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.070
I'm gonna go ahead and create a new folder.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.310
So let's right exports and save it here.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.660
Didn't remember toe on hide your status bar and also your home indicator.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:20.540
Pretty good.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.750
And now it's time to place our exported image here.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.970
So let's go ahead and choose that from our assets.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:28.680
Fuller.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.670
There we go.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.780
Exports home page.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.750
I'm going to place it here.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.650
Fantastic.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.660
The reason that I heat this status for and also this home indicator was because now we need

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.120
to move these screen to the right side.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.600
OK?

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.350
And if we didn't hide them,

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.210
their place would be messed up here.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.700
Okay,

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.660
so it doesn't make sense to move the status bar and home indicator to the right side.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:53.120
Okay?

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.150
It's not possible.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.550
All right,

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.050
Now let's move it to the right side a little bit.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.290
I'm gonna set the x 2 266 like this.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.050
Pretty good.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.000
And after that,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.050
I need to place an overlay layer.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.650
Okay,

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.440
in order to make it darker.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.150
So let's go ahead and create a rectangle.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.330
I'm gonna dragon drop like this.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.620
Let's make it larger a little bit,

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.950
set it to black and decrease the capacity to 30% like this.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:23.860
It's pretty good.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.410
Then we need to create our many.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.510
So let's create another rectangle here,

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:29.940
Dragon drop.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.340
Sometimes when you create a new layer,

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.950
it may be placed outside of your art board.

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.770
So as you can see right now,

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.590
it's outside of my many art.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.620
Or so let's move it inside.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:41.560
There we go.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.690
And then let's go ahead and change the with 2 to 181 like this,

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.180
the height should be 812 and I'm gonna make it white pretty good.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.690
Then that's double click on that in order to enter the edit mode.

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.050
And I'm going to select thes two nodes,

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.660
the top right and the bottom,

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.980
right.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.620
Knowns like this.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.380
And let's increase the corner radius to 20.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.200
Pretty good.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.090
However,

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.150
I'm gonna make it smooth.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.320
So let's increase this amount to 60% Pretty nice.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.310
And now we can copy and paste this home indicator like this.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.950
I'm gonna place it to the center and to the bottom.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:20.870
Pretty good.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.790
So what do we need for these men?

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:23.570
You actually,

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.120
we need these profile image,

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.190
so I'm going to copy it and paste it here,

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:35.320
move it to the left side and it's left Padding should be 30 big cells like this pretty good

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.350
that Mizzou mean.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.050
The other thing we need to add is the name of user and a user name.

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.550
Okay,

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.630
so let's inserted text here.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.470
I'm going to write Emma,

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.000
actually like this.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.190
I'm going to change the fund two months.

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.050
Air it pretty good.

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:52.520
Let's set it too bold.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.280
And the fund signs should be 16 points and I'm going to change the text color.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.120
23 a three a and three A pretty good,

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.810
then duplicated moving down and here I'm going to write the user name.

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.950
So let's right at Emma.

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.330
Underline Ashley.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:17.940
And then I can change the way to Regular and also the font size to 14 like this,

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:18.620
the top adding,

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:19.770
should be zero.

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:21.650
And now let's elect both off them,

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.490
group them and align it without profile image.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:25.040
Okay,

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.460
like this and the left fighting should be eight pixels pretty good.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.080
And now it's time to create our sub minions.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.640
Okay,

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:33.600
so first of all,

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.100
let's insert the text.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.630
The first menu is going to be payments like this,

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.140
and the fun size should be 18 points.

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.750
The fund should be Monsour it and the way it should be regular,

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:46.800
However,

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:53.410
I need to change the color to to be 47 FC like this.

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.140
That's moving up a little bit and then we need to place an icon 40.

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:01.970
So let's go ahead and place an image and hearing icons folder.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.680
You have the menu fuller,

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.080
and we have six icons.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.650
Okay,

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:06.620
so for now,

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:07.900
let's use payments.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.000
Place it here pretty good.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.670
Let's select both off them and align them vertically like this.

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:16.090
And the left padding should be eight pixels.

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.280
So group them.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.650
Then I'm going to create a background for this because we're going to have different states

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.650
.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.080
So when this up and you selected its banker and should be a little bit darker,

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.680
So let's create a rectangle here.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:34.030
I'm gonna drag and drop like this and let's set the high to 60.

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.640
I'm going to double click on that.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:43.370
And let's use Thies to note the top right and bottom right and said the corner radius to 14

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.410
like this and remember to make them smooth pretty good.

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.340
And after that I'm going to change the color,

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:50.950
too.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.140
F two,

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:56.040
F four and F AIDS to get something like this.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.260
I'm gonna move this layer down pretty good.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:03.430
Let's align our text with our background vertically are right.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.850
So far,

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:04.380
so good,

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.040
then the next thing we need is a right arrow.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:13.130
So I'm gonna go ahead and place a narrow icons and here we have these small arrow.

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:14.740
Let's place it here.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.250
Then I'm gonna move it up like this.

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:18.100
And finally,

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.650
let's change its color.

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:21.380
So I'm going to select it.

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.900
Make sure that you don't select the frame.

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:24.550
Okay?

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:29.980
You need to select the shape so press and hold command key or control key on your keyboard

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:30.990
and select that.

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.580
Okay,

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:36.510
Now we're selecting the shape that I'm going to choose the eyedropper and let's take the

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.260
same color as our icon.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:38.890
Hey,

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:39.780
After that,

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:44.280
we have to align these small arrow with our background and our text.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.630
So how can we do that?

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:46.370
First?

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.650
Let's aligning to read our tanks.

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:49.200
Okay,

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.200
like this.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.550
And because we already aligned our takes to the center.

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:58.060
So we're sure that this icon is aligned with our background as well.

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:58.620
It's right.

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:02.440
Padding is going to be 30 to pick cells like this.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:03.170
And as you can see,

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:09.980
the top and bottom padding are 24 pixels and the left padding off our icon and text group

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:12.970
should be 34 pixels like this.

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:14.850
And now everything is done.

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:20.620
So the next thing I'm gonna do is selecting this group and also these small arrow once

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:25.090
again group them and I'm going to rename me to payments Really good,

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:26.120
duplicated,

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:31.030
moving down and the distance between the next up and you and the previous up.

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:34.090
And you should be 50 picks owns like this.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:37.430
Now I'm going to change it to transactions.

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:38.370
Fantastic.

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:40.340
And let's change the icon as well.

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:43.250
So I'm gonna place a new icon from the menu.

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:44.030
Fuller.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:45.450
We have transactions.

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:47.120
That's place it here,

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.680
and I'm going to remove this one.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.760
And let's move it down.

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.480
Aligning with your text pretty good.

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:53.990
And also,

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:55.880
we need to align it with our payments.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:56.410
I can't.

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:58.570
So let's select both off them.

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:00.600
If you want to select this one as well,

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.100
hold shift and command together,

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:05.810
or shift and control Click on that.

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:07.650
And there we go there selected,

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:10.820
and I'm gonna align it to the center for incidentally,

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:12.360
like this pretty good.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:15.200
Let's rename this group to transactions.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:19.570
And once again duplicated the top heading should be 50 pixels.

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:26.190
And here I'm going to change you to my cards and that's place another icon.

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:27.150
There we go.

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:30.710
We have my card here that's removed the previous icon.

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:32.190
I'm gonna move it down,

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:35.140
align it with our text vertically.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:41.120
Then I'm going to rename it to my cards once again duplicated.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.750
And now we need to change it to promotions,

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:48.930
and I'm going to remove these icon that's place a new one.

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:51.090
We have the promotions here.

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:52.220
Fantastic.

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:56.730
That's aligning to meet our group and also align it with your previous icon.

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:58.860
So I'm going to select this one,

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.390
the frame and also this fun alignment,

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:02.950
or is entirely pretty good.

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:03.790
And as you can see,

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:06.240
the cycle is outside of thes folders.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.350
So I'm gonna protecting,

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:14.240
signed and let's re name this folder to promotions pretty good duplicated,

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.210
and this is our last stop menu.

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:24.070
So let's kind of savings removed the icon and place and your icon savings a line into the

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:28.660
center and also lets align it with your previous icon like this.

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:33.780
Remember to put it inside this group and renamed the group to savings.

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:37.370
And that's all Did you see how easy it is to create your menu?

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:40.630
The last thing we need to create is a sign out button.

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:41.160
Okay,

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:46.270
So what I'm going to do is finding the sign up button here in our welcome page.

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:47.140
Competence.

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:48.500
Paste it here,

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:49.610
I'm gonna zoom mean.

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:53.850
And let's first change these text to sign out pretty good.

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:59.060
I'm going to remove this icon and let's select this rectangle to not rectangle one.

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:04.350
Remember this rectangle to and make it smaller like this.

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:12.170
I'm going to sit there with 2 221 Fantastic and its place an icon we have leg out,

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:13.270
place it here,

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:18.920
move it down like this and we don't need this mass group so you can remove that and let's

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:21.180
check the padding of these icon as well.

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:21.520
So,

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:22.350
first of all,

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:24.440
I need to align it with my text.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.290
So let's elect both off them,

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:28.340
align it vertically like this.

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:34.170
And the right patting of this icon should be 24 pixels like this pretty good.

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:35.620
And last but not least,

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:39.950
let's rename me to sign out button Pretty good.

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:45.640
And the bottom padding should be 56 pixels like this and that's all are right,

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:45.930
guys.

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:47.490
That's all for this video.

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:48.700
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:50.930
And I will see you in the next video,

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:51.940
so see that?
