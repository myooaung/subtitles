00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.250
Hi,

00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:00.840
everyone.

00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.480
Welcome back to another video of these course in this video,

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.610
we're going to be designing our third local together,

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:08.910
which is for again,

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.680
an imaginary brand called Moon.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.530
It's gonna be so interesting and we're going to create it so quickly.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:16.310
First of all,

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:18.540
I need to insert circle.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.670
I'm gonna hold shift like this.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.460
Then I need to duplicate that and that's movie to the right side A little bit like this.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.440
And after that,

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.380
I'm going to select both off them and I'm gonna use Boolean operations,

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.150
lets you subtract selection and there we go.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.670
We just created our moon.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.730
Now I'm going to rotate it a little bit to the left side like this.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:40.420
However,

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.640
I'm gonna modify it in order to modify that I can get access to some players by opening

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.420
these group.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.170
And there we go.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.970
I'm going to choose the top circle and let's move it to the right side a little bit pretty

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:53.400
Ossa.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.750
Then that's changed the color to black.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.930
And after that I'm going to write Moon.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:59.940
However,

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.610
let's change fund two months,

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.700
Sarit and the way it is going to be regular,

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:11.660
it's going to be 80 points and I'm gonna scale my moon down like this.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.690
Let's set the with 2 130 I'm gonna align them.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:17.720
However,

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.110
as you can see,

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.980
it seems that they are not aligned perfectly.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:28.620
Because sometimes you need to align the manually in order to get a great visual balance.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:29.080
Okay,

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.670
so I'm gonna move the moon takes to the right side a little bit,

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.260
and now I think it's great.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.630
Let's move it up.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.570
Pretty amazing.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.380
I'm gonna group them and I'm gonna call them Are right,

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.750
guys,

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:42.370
that's all.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:43.580
For these video,

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.520
you have learned how you could create your own local simply in fig MMA by using simple

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.170
shapes.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.320
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.550
And I will see you in the next video.
