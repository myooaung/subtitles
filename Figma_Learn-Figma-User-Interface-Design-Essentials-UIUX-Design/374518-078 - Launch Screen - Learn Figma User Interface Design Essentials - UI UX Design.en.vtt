00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.270
Hi,

00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:00.840
everyone.

00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.550
And welcome back to another video of the scores in this video,

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.010
we're going to start designing our finance application,

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.570
which is called money.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:10.620
It's interesting,

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:11.210
isn't it?

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:11.610
So,

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:12.030
without,

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:12.820
for I do.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.540
Let's get it started by inserting a new art board to our canvas.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.850
So I'm gonna press a on my keyboard and from phone section,

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.290
I'm gonna choose iPhone 11 pro or X.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.830
Okay,

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:31.890
then let me rename into lunch screen because this is our first page.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:32.850
And after that,

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.160
we're going to simply place the logo of this application that I already prepared for you.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.440
So if you already downloaded the assets file from the assets lecture,

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.320
you can see that you have four different Fuller's logo illustrations,

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.210
icons,

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.560
an apple iris.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.920
You are.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.880
If you're familiar with sketch,

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.170
you may probably know that you have access to Apple are yours.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.490
You like it in order to use all the elements that Apple uses under operating system.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:01.060
Okay.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.600
However,

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.580
unfortunately,

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.940
there is not an up to date apple IRS,

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.800
you are kid for Fatemeh.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.390
OK,

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.500
but there is nothing to worry about because I already prepared for you all the necessary

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.220
things that you may need during this course.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:15.630
So,

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.270
as you can see,

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.450
we have bars,

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.400
home indicator and status bar,

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.850
and that's all we need.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.180
But for these video,

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.250
we need to open up the local folder.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.520
And here you can see that we have three different files.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.080
We have colorful logo,

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.670
logo,

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.690
white and MasterCard logo.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:33.180
Okay,

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.160
now I'm going to choose colorful logo and let's drag and drop it into my dartboard like

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.690
this.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:40.650
Pretty nice,

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.260
isn't it?

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:47.220
Then the only thing we need to do is to align it both or is entirely and vertically to the

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.710
center like this.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.850
And that's all for our launch screen.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.370
It was so simple,

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:53.040
wasn't it?

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.870
Our right guys,

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.000
Thank you so much for watching this video.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.190
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.550
And I will see you in the next video.
