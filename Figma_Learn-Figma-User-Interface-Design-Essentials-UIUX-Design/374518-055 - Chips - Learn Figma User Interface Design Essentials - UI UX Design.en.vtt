00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.660
Hey,

00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:01.230
everyone,

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:02.540
In this video,

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:04.990
we're gonna be talking about chips.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.500
Chips allow users to make selections,

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.070
trigger actions.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:11.610
Enter information,

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:12.450
etcetera.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.320
Unlike buttons,

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.950
which should be a consistent counteraction,

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:22.450
chips should appear dynamically as a group of multiple interactive elements.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.210
When you're designing a chip,

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.400
make sure to pay attention to the following things Number one states.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.110
Just like bottoms and sliders.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.950
You need to design all states of your chips,

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.910
such as in able disable tapped,

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.730
hover etcetera.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:48.180
Number two relevancy chips should have a helpful relationship with the content or task they

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.120
represent.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:55.850
And the last one compactness chips are compact elements that represent distinct information

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.850
.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.430
If you look at the picture on the right side,

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.600
you can see that we have different chips.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.050
Some of them have icons or even an image.

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.960
On the other hand,

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.300
some of them only have a text,

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.600
so make sure to use them in your urine design carefully.
