00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.320
Hi,

00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:00.910
everyone.

00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:04.540
Welcome back to another video of these course in these video,

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.310
We're going to start designing our first local.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:12.380
So the logo that I chose for these two Tonio is the fig monologue,

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.680
which is quite interesting and at the same time,

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:16.560
quite simple.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.060
Logo.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.650
Okay,

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.250
so first of all,

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:20.480
we need an art board.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.120
So let's press a and I'm going to choose Mac book pro.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:29.210
Then I'm gonna increase the height size off my art board like this.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.310
Pretty good.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.460
I already prepared the assets Find for you that you can download from the assets lecture of

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.250
thes sections.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.930
So first off,

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.130
all I'm going to place the feet Malago,

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.520
As you can see in the assets Fuller,

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.200
there is the feet.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.050
Melo go pretty good.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.920
And then we're going to design the same logo together.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.240
So as you can see,

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.230
these local consists of different simple shapes.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:52.830
For instance,

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.300
here we have a square.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.900
We two rounded corners here as well.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.520
Here we have the same square,

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.170
however,

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.000
with three around the corners.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.950
And here we have a simple circle.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:03.970
So first of all,

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.050
let's in survey rectangle here.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.160
I'm gonna hold shift in order to create square.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.950
And then I'm gonna set the width and height to 200 like this.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:14.930
It's pretty good.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.590
That's movie to the right side.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.060
Now I need to round these two corners.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.570
OK,

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.920
so I'm going to click on independent corners like this.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:29.540
And let's set top left corner radius to 100 bottom left corner radius to 100 as well.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.630
And as you can see,

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.520
we've got the same shape as the famous logo.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.510
Now we need to use the eyedropper in the fuel section in order to choose the same color

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:40.200
pretty good.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.110
Then we need to duplicate it and I'm going to right click on that and let's click and flee

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.050
presentable like this.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.810
I'm going to move it to the right side pretty good.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.550
Then we need to change its color like this Pretty fantastic.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.930
Now let's use our first rectangle.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:57.950
Duplicate it.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.750
I'm gonna move it down pretty awesome.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:01.630
Once again,

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.320
I need to change the color.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.020
Great.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.690
And now we need a circle.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.250
So let's use circle from the shapes menu.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.800
I'm gonna hold shift and let's create a circle,

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.590
however,

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:20.400
with the same with and with the same height so it's gonna be 200 by 200 peak cells like

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.020
this,

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.670
and I'm going to change the color to this blue.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.620
And once again,

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.920
let's duplicate thes rectangle.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.250
I'm going to move it down.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.410
And now I need to change the radius amount off this bottom right corner.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.250
So here in the Inspector,

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.850
I'm going to set it to 100 as well.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.030
And last but not least,

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.460
let's change its color.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.370
Fantastic.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.570
Did you see how easy it is to design a logo in fig MMA?

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.790
And now I'm going to select all layers.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.730
I'm gonna group them on.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.840
Let's call it Fig MMA New.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.260
You can remove this one.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.310
And that's all.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.900
All right,

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:54.240
guys,

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.760
that's all for this video.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.020
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.250
And I will see you in the next video.
