00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.360
Hi,

00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:00.960
everyone.

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.790
Welcome back to another video of the scores in this video,

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.370
we're gonna be talking about Keeper Chore Cuts in Fig MMA.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.500
As a designer,

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.200
it's so important to know the most important short cuts off the platform you're using for

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.940
designing.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.250
Because of the fact that Fig MMA is a cross platform software,

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.150
it's too difficult to cover all those short cuts in one video.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.190
However,

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.610
instead of mentioning and discussing all those short cuts,

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:36.160
I'm going to show you a very great and quick way that you could find out the shore country

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.960
need for your workflow.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:38.450
Okay,

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.150
so whether you're using Macron's or RINOs,

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.200
you could use this fe in both operating systems.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.440
As you can see right at the bottom.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.150
Right,

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.780
there is a question mark icon.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.260
Okay,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.090
it's called Help and Resource is.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.600
So if I click on that,

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.660
you can see there's plenty,

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.780
um,

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:54.800
options here,

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.530
and one of them says keyboard shortcuts.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.050
And this is exactly what we need.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.210
So let's click on that keyboard shortcuts.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.000
There we go.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.820
Now we have access to all those short cuts in one single place,

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:09.970
So as you can see,

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:17.160
it's categorized in different sections such as essential tools view,

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.670
zoom,

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.110
text shape,

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.430
etcetera.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.610
And because I'm using Macal as,

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:25.710
for instance here,

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.750
it shows me command key.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.110
OK,

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.220
but if you're using windows for sure,

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.040
you will see control here.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.820
Or,

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.420
for instance,

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.220
if I go to view here,

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.820
I have command for you.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.070
If you're using Windows,

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.490
its control for sure.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.850
So in these very you can easily find a short cuts you need.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.350
But now I'm gonna mention some of the most important short cuts you may need.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.470
For these course.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.680
Let's start with copy and pasting.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.000
So,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.310
like,

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.030
other suffer for copying and pasting,

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.600
we can easily choose your element like these texts.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.360
And you can use command,

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.800
See?

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.250
And if you want to paste it,

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.320
you can use Command V in Mac OS.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.120
Okay.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.120
However,

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.670
if you're using Windows,

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.040
you can press control C and control we and you could get the same result.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.650
Okay,

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.890
if I want to group these layers together,

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:17.720
for instance,

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.170
this Windows and Mac Os like this,

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.200
I can press command G on my keyboard.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.270
However,

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.180
in vin does,

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.940
you can press control G.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.630
If you want to duplicate something,

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.470
you can select your desire layer and press command D Okay,

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.480
In micro s,

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.290
if you're using windows,

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.510
you can press control the instead for scaring something.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.150
You can either go here and choose the scale tool,

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.090
or you could press k on your keywords.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.760
It doesn't matter whether you're using a Mac OS or Windows because you don't need to use

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.720
command or control keys.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.340
You just need to simply press K on your keyboard.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.430
And as you can see now,

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.090
the scale tool is selected.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.920
And last but not least,

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.410
if you want to check the pad ings and margins,

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:15.050
you can hold option key on your keyboard if you're using Mac Os like this and hover your

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.590
mouse on top of other elements near your selected elements,

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:25.550
so as you can see now I have this number which is indicated with a red text.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.400
And this is the padding between these two elements in windows.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.910
You can hold all key on your keyboard and do the same thing.

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.550
And if you want to zoom out,

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.100
we can hold command key and scroll like this.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:44.830
So militants who mean in windows you can hold control key and do the same thing all right

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:45.170
guys,

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.760
that's all for the CDO.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.050
I hope you enjoyed it and I will see you in the next video.
