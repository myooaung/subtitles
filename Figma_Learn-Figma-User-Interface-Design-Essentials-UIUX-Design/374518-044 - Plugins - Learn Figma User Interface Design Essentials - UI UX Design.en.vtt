00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.220
Hi,

00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:00.790
everyone.

00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.710
And welcome back to another video of these course in this video,

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.640
we're gonna be talking about plug ins in fig MMA.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.060
Actually,

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.170
plug ins are third parties,

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.800
creeps or applications that extends the functionality of another application.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.070
So,

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.610
in order to do something quickly or even magically,

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.850
can use plug ins in your project Now I'm gonna show you how you can find them,

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.550
how you can install him,

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.290
uninstall them and finally,

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:29.610
how you can use them.

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:35.340
So let's go to plug ins right under recent section in your dashboard.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.550
And this window is divided into three different sections.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.920
Featured plug ins,

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.850
popular and installed.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:42.460
Okay.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.550
In the featured plug in section,

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.830
you can find all the featured plug ins by fig MMA.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:48.990
As you can see here,

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.950
we have simply hand off.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.680
We have Victory three D,

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.840
which we will learn about in the three d modeling section of discourse.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.390
We have Master Arrow token document,

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.170
etcetera.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.050
There are countless plug ins out there that you can using your project.

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.200
However,

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.820
now I'm going to show you the most important and the most popular plug ins,

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.160
and we're going to learn how to use them So,

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.380
as you can see in the popular section,

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.830
we have these plug ins.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:18.380
Okay,

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.740
The 1st 1 is called On Splash,

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.180
which is so useful,

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.750
so if I click on that,

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.290
you could see the description.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.280
Here you can insert beautiful images from one splash straight into your designs.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.860
Okay,

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.300
it's a great plugging,

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.040
and also it's a great website.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.330
You could use royalty free images from this Web site,

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.100
so inerting,

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.110
solid plugging.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.830
You could click on this button,

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.560
and that's all it's installed.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.250
And if you want on,

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.150
install a plug in can again click on that,

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.740
and it's not pretty cool.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.320
You could get all the information about this plug in here,

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.700
frankly,

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.410
can see all you can learn about each different version.

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.240
So let's go back to plug ins.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.990
And here,

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.500
as you can see you have on a splash in the installed section,

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.880
then we have content.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:04.200
Riel.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.550
It's another good plugging that gives you randomized data in order for you to design

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.520
everything which really later.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.650
So I'm gonna install it as well.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.060
Then we have charged you can create different charts.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.980
We don't need that.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:18.710
For now,

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:25.340
you have a map maker which is so cool you can easily write your address in these text field

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.340
,

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.670
and it creates you a Google map screen or even a map box screen.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.100
So let's install it as well.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.590
We have isometric.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.990
It's so cool.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.190
I'm gonna install it.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.080
We have rectory three D.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.230
It's installed it as well because we have a complete section about three D modeling in this

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.700
course,

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.770
so you could use three D models in your design.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.830
Then you have rename is a femur.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.650
I'm not gonna install them now.

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.830
Now let's click on browse all plug ins and here I'm gonna look for a plugging calm brand

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:58.380
Fetch.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.070
There we go.

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.790
It's the 2nd 1 I'm gonna insult it as well.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.780
Let's look for palate.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:04.880
Here we go.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.310
And that's all for now.

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.210
As a matter of fact,

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.500
you can go ahead and install all of them.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.050
However,

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.020
in my opinion,

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.680
it's better to go and check your description out.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.390
Get some information that how these plug ins work and then you could decide which one is

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:21.980
suitable for your project.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.250
So now let's create a new file,

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.470
and I'm gonna press a tow,

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:27.140
add an art,

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.580
Bored.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.160
I'm going to choose Micro Crow.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.550
Then let's create a rectangle here.

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.230
I'm gonna increase the corner radius to make it nice.

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.600
Now,

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.630
once my object is selected,

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:44.120
I can head over to the menu section and here I can open up plug ins and I have all my plug

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.170
ins ready here.

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.390
So for now,

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.990
I'm gonna choose on a splash.

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.820
And keep in mind that you can use only one plugging at the time so you cannot use two or

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.490
more plug ins at the same time.

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.570
So now we have on Splash Blufgan opened,

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.400
and you can easily click on Insert random.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.240
And there we go.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.800
You can get a random picture immediately.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.190
It's pretty cool.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.370
You can also choose these presets,

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.100
for example,

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.850
minimal or nature colorful.

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:13.940
That's pretty cool.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:14.390
Of course,

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:15.810
you can search as well.

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:16.570
For example,

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.540
let's right portrayed.

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:19.950
And there we go.

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:20.970
It's pretty awesome,

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:21.570
isn't it?

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.590
So you can easily choose one.

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:24.520
Fantastic.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.400
So can you see how amazing and powerful these plug ins are?

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.060
So now I can create a text that's right name.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:38.140
I'm gonna increase the size to 40 and then let's go to plug in section and I'm going to

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.060
select content.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.330
Really?

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.960
So now,

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.080
as you can see,

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.580
you have different options.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:43.590
In these planking,

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:44.820
for instance,

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.000
you have Tex,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.660
you have Al Attar's.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.330
You have icons.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.090
So first of all,

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.960
let's try out this takes option.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:52.670
As you can see,

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:57.320
I have selected my name takes layer and I'm going to click on this names.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.220
And there we go.

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:59.750
You have a random name.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.540
If I click once again,

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.220
you can see that I can get random names here.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.090
If I click on these darts,

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.780
you can define some settings.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:08.660
For example,

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.830
you can set whether you want a US English name French,

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:13.800
Spanish.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.000
So if I choose French,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.450
we can't.

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:17.500
We can apply.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.410
And there we go.

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:19.910
You can even change the sex.

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:20.770
For example,

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.440
here we have mail or female.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:29.090
You can specify whether you want only first name or last name like this.

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.620
And you could see the preview off your defined settings here.

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:33.540
Pretty awesome.

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.850
Now,

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.630
if you want to get a phone number,

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.020
we could click and phone.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.760
There we go.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.920
If you want to get an address,

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.410
you could get an address.

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.050
And here is your address.

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.010
You could get numbers,

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.910
you could get date and time like this.

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:48.890
Surprisingly,

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:51.870
you can also generate some Laura MIPs.

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:52.060
Um,

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.480
content like this,

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:58.720
you can get email addresses and some murals like this.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:59.130
Now,

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:02.040
let's try the avatar section and icons.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.000
So first we need to create a circle,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.400
and then I'm gonna click on avatars,

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.470
and here I can use male female made on female.

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.120
So I'm gonna choose female.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:14.950
There we go.

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:16.350
It's pretty good,

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.920
isn't it?

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:23.340
So if I duplicate the serial multiple times and I select all of them and technique on main

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:24.140
and female,

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:27.590
you could see that I got the friend pictures for each circle,

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:29.040
which is pretty amazing.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:34.760
And if you want to use icons first you need to download some funds because these are not

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.870
PNG icons.

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:36.220
Okay,

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:37.570
that you could use easily.

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:37.890
First,

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:42.560
you need to download some special funds and then you could use the Lycans are right.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.300
Now let's try the map maker.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:45.700
First,

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.820
I need to make sure whether I install it or not.

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:50.980
It seems that I forgot to insult it.

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:55.500
So let's click on manage plug ins and let's browse all plug ings.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.540
I'm gonna look for map maker.

00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:59.850
Let's install it.

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:02.610
I'm gonna go to plug ins and there we go.

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:03.650
So here,

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:05.270
let's insert an address.

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:05.800
I don't know.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:06.650
Let's right,

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:08.220
Harrison.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:09.980
There we go.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:11.330
You could be more specific.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:12.760
You could add some numbers,

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.290
However,

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:15.250
for the purpose of this tutorial,

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:16.520
I think it's enough.

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:21.880
You could also decide whether you want to get a Google map screen or a map bucks.

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:22.410
Okay,

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:23.420
like this,

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.220
we can also modify some properties here.

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:27.020
For example,

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:32.550
we can change the map type from roadmap to satellite toe hybrid.

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:34.590
You could also change the zoom level.

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:35.380
For example.

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:39.210
I'm going to modify it to 16 like this,

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:41.140
and you can also add a market,

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:42.100
for example,

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:43.770
this one That's pretty awesome.

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:48.340
And the next plugging that we're going to talk about is Brand Fitch.

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:48.780
Okay,

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:52.560
there are times that you may need to get a logo from a website,

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.270
and it's time consuming to go.

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:59.280
Just searched for that logo savings and then inserted two fig MMA instead of that,

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.560
you could use this plug,

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.480
So suppose that we're going to get the apples logo if I just right there,

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:05.500
the main name,

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:08.350
like their website apple dot com,

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:09.950
and I could You can get logo.

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:12.690
You could see the apple logo immediately,

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:16.050
and I can scale it can scale it down.

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:18.990
So let's try and other logo as well.

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:19.950
Brand fetch.

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:20.540
That's right,

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:23.330
Fig Mothers come and there we go.

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:24.560
It's pretty amazing,

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.150
isn't it?

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:29.510
And the next plucking we're going to talk about is the palate.

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:32.370
So if you want to create some great color palette,

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:34.580
but you don't know how to choose your colors,

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:39.120
this plugging lets you create amazing color palettes in a second.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.070
As it can see,

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:44.540
you can change it from standard to user interface like this.

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:45.610
You can refresh it.

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:48.970
You can choose a photo in order to get some colors.

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:49.860
From that,

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:51.280
you can save it,

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.380
and there we go.

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.990
You have your color palettes ready to use,

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:57.870
and you can get the hex color code right over there.

00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:59.260
It's pretty fantastic.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:08:59.760
All right,

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:00.200

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:00.970

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:07.680
projects.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:10.150
