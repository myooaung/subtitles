00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.520
Hi,

00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.140
everyone.

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:02.570
In these video,

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.650
we're gonna be talking about menus in user interface design.

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:11.410
A menu displays at least of choices on a provisional surface.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:17.790
It appears when users interact with a button action or other kinds of controls.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:24.280
Menus allow users to make a selection from multiple options on like selection controls.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.870
Menus are less outstanding and take less space.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:29.600
When you're designing menus,

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.350
make sure to pay attention to the following points.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.620
Number one scannable.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.650
Many options should be easy to scare.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.480
Number two quick menus should be easy to open,

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.660
close and interact with,

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.450
and last but not least,

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.050
placement menus appear in front of all other your elements.
