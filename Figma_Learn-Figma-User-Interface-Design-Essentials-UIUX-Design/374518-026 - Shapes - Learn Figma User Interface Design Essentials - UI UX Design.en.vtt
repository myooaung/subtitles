00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.350
Hi,

00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:00.880
everyone.

00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.750
And welcome back to another video off these course.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.250
I hope you're doing well.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.710
And in this video,

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.310
we're gonna be talking about the shapes.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:09.910
OK,

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:16.360
The shape tool is one of the most important tools when you're designing a user interface.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.140
Because no matter what kind of interface you're designing,

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.250
for sure you will need to use one of these shapes.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:23.870
OK,

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.950
so right at the top in the toolbar,

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.720
you can find the shapes,

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.890
and if you click and that you can see that there are different shapes.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:32.230
Year,

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.330
for instance,

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.520
we have the rectangle okay.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.840
And if I select that,

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.640
I can easily create this shape by dragging and dropping.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.610
As you can see,

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.680
we have created a rectangle and it's called rectangle.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.260
Want.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.830
Each shape has some properties.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:50.700
For instance,

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.330
The's shape has the corner radius property,

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.220
and as you can see,

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.890
it's indicated with these dots.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.190
So if I just click on one of them and drag the mouse a little bit like this,

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.810
I can set the corner radius to 30.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:06.940
Alternatively,

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.260
you can change the amount of corner radius right in the inspector over there,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.280
for example,

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.620
I can set it to 50 life this.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.510
And if you want to change the corner radius for only one of those points or edges,

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:27.090
you can hold option key and then drag and drop like this.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.500
And as you can see now,

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.580
we have different amount of corner radius for each point like this.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:34.540
As a matter of fact,

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.750
you can constant lies your corner radius like this.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.850
If you just click on independent corners and this icon,

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.530
you can see the res corners more thing,

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.230
and I'm going to click on that.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:51.530
And here we have a slider and I'm gonna set it to 60%.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:52.750
And as you can see here,

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.200
it's written on us.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.660
So what does that mean?

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:56.130
Actually,

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.050
in all us,

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.710
apple uses smooth corners.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:00.310
Okay.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.540
And if you're familiar with sketch,

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.600
we use the same term as well.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.090
So as you can see,

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.500
it makes our corners much smoother.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.250
Okay,

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.510
off course you can increase it.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.780
However,

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.550
60% makes it look great.

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.570
Perfect are right.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:19.080
Of course,

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.250
you can change the color of your shape as we have discussed in the previous video.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.180
However,

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.450
we will cover all those features in the next series of videos But for now,

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.190
let's stick to the shapes.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.650
The next shape is called line.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.330
Okay,

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.150
it's just kind of a stroke.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.750
And if I hold shift and two,

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.300
you can see that Fatemeh brings thes shape to me automatically in a way that I can see it

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.150
clearly.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.670
Okay,

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.760
so I'm going to click on that.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.550
And here on stroke,

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.930
you have different properties as well.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:53.840
For instance,

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.380
you can change the thickness off thes line.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.450
Or let's say this stroke like this let me set it to 10.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.880
And if you click on these,

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.730
darts can see that we have different options here.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.230
It's called Advanced Stroke and we have cap and joint.

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.890
So what does that mean?

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.070
Let's take a look at it.

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:14.750
Let me open up this menu.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.950
And here we have different options we have round that will make our line round it for both

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:21.560
sides.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.750
We have square,

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.760
which doesn't make sense because it's kind of the same.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.640
We have line arrow like this,

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.750
and we have Triangle arrow like this,

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:32.640
and if I choose,

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.370
for instance,

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:39.370
line Arrow and I decide to modify this shape by double clicking on this shape and for

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:40.160
instance,

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.650
moving this point,

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.110
you can see that it will change automatically pretty good.

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.480
And we will cover joins in the future.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.470
Lessons are right now let's talk him out The next shape that make me Condon to finish

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.490
editing the next shape is a narrow Okay,

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:59.900
like this,

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.350
it's again kind of a line.

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:03.380
Or let's say,

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.440
just stroke that we just created.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.960
However,

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.460
you could create a narrow like this as well.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:09.100
As you can see,

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.390
you have different times round,

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.550
square line,

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.750
arrow and triangle Arrow.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.490
And the 1st 1 by default was mixed.

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:20.140
Okay,

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.420
because we had a customized line,

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:23.260
okay.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.010
And the next shape is the circle.

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:31.610
So I'm gonna hold shift in order to keep the aspect ratio like this,

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.250
and I'm gonna drag and drop to create these circle pretty good.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.300
And this circle has a new property,

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.930
which is called Arc.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:47.650
So let's click on that and try to move a little bit to see what you can achieve by

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.730
modifying this property like this.

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:51.990
That's pretty awesome.

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:57.630
And specially it's so useful when you're creating a chart awesome.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.950
And the next shape is called polygon.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:00.740
Okay,

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.070
I'm going to create one.

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.440
Let's remove these shape for now,

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.860
I'm gonna make it larger.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:07.800
Pretty good.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.390
The polygon shape has two different properties.

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:15.750
The 1st 1 is corner radius and it works like rectangles.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:16.610
Okay.

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.780
And the second one's called Count,

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:23.040
which means the number of edges that were using we are creating.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:28.580
So let me increase it by holding shift and clicking on that like this,

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.560
I'm gonna move my mouse up and down.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.360
You can also modify it in the Inspector.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.610
Let's set it to eight pretty good.

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.730
And I can also modify the radius.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:39.390
Obviously.

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.980
Here.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.010
Fantastic.

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:42.400
Let me remove that.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.850
And I'm going to create the star once again.

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:46.610
Here.

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:47.320
Pretty good.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.270
The Star shape has three different properties.

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.590
The 1st 1 is Cornet Radius again like this.

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:57.210
The 2nd 1 is the ratio,

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:01.100
which is the ratio between these two edges like this.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:02.630
You can modify that.

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.360
I'm going to set it to 40 and the last one is count.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.970
Okay,

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:10.730
that you can increase and decrease as you wish.

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:12.010
Pretty awesome.

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.690
And last but not least,

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:18.490
is the place image that you can choose an image from your system.

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:25.090
And if you drag and drop like this and make sure to hold the shift key on your keyboard In

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:26.840
order to keep the ratio,

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.900
you can place an image okay?

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.510
And you can also change the radius as well.

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:32.600
It's so simple.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.200
All right,

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.800
so now let's talk about the Dimension Property right over there.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:38.840
So here,

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:39.600
as you can see,

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.500
you have different properties like X and y,

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.950
which refers to the position of these shape.

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:48.840
So if I said zero and zero for why,

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:49.770
As you can see,

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:56.750
it moves to the left and top corner because zero and zero points starts from top and left

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:57.310
corner,

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:57.910
OK?

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:01.010
And now you can modify the whiff and hide.

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:02.180
For instance,

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.670
you can set it to 300.

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:05.410
However,

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:06.370
as you can see,

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:08.800
the width and height are linked.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.100
So if you want to change them separately,

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:17.920
you can easily unlinked them by clicking on this icon which is called constrain proportions

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:17.920
.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:24.450
And then I can modify the with or hide separately like this are right,

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:25.870
like in sketch.

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.450
You can do mathematical operations here,

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:29.600
for instance,

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:34.550
I can divide 300 by two like this,

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:35.540
and there we go.

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:43.020
We have 150 or I can multiply 180 by two.

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:48.450
It's a great and useful feature when you're designing your user interface and we have the

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:49.280
alignments.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.780
Were there rights at the top?

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:53.060
For instance,

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:56.450
if I choose thes object for this shape,

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:59.360
I can align it to the center horizontally.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.330
I can align it to the left side,

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.320
aligning to the right side,

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.200
align it to the top,

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.910
aligning to vertically and align it to the bottom.

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:09.750
Okay,

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:10.700
are right.

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:16.450
But what if you want to align an object which is placed inside another object?

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:21.510
So suppose that we're going to put thes object.

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:22.110
Okay,

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:22.630
here,

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:27.700
I'm going to change the color to something like dark Gray like this.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:30.690
I'm gonna make it smaller a little bit.

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:35.010
Suppose that we're going to align this shape with our rectangle.

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:35.710
Okay,

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:38.180
which looks like a square right now.

00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:39.460
But how can we do that?

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:40.130
First of all,

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:44.770
you need to make sure that you chose both objects at the same time.

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:48.630
You can hold shift key on your keyboard and select them,

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:50.460
or you can select them like this.

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:52.010
We drank ing and dropping.

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:52.650
Okay.

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:59.360
Then you will click on align her resentful to the center and align vertical to the center.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.340
And it's done pretty awesome,

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:02.400
A right guy.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.120
So now in this video,

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:10.350
we have learned how to use shapes and you know the properties off each specific shape.

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:14.850
So I hope you enjoy this video and I will see you in the next video.
