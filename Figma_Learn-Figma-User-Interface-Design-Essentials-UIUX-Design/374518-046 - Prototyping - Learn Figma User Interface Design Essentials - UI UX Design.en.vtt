00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.400
Hello,

00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:00.900
everyone.

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.770
And welcome back to another video of thes course.

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:04.700
In this video,

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.900
we're gonna be talking about prototyping in fig MMA.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.540
As a UX designer,

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.650
it is crucial to know about prototyping and so important to master this topic.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.790
Because no matter how beautiful and how amazing your designs are at the end of the day,

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.690
if you can not present it in an amazing way,

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.440
your hard work doesn't pay off.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.290
So you need to master this topic.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.060
And because of this reason,

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.880
we have a complete section about prototyping in these course.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:32.840
So in this video,

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.310
I'm going to show you how prototyping works.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.040
And I want to make you familiar with the concept.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.990
So without further I do.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.420
Let's get it started by adding to art boards.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.690
So I'm gonna press a on my keyboard and let's choose iPhone 11 pro or X.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.480
Then I'm going to duplicate that because we need to different our ports.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:00.270
And that's add a rectangle to this first art board like this.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.600
I'm gonna increase the corner radius to 40.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.420
Pretty good.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.480
Let me align it to the center.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.340
And then I'm going to choose a picture from our assets file,

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.620
for instance,

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.440
let's choose this one in cards folder number two.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.150
I'm gonna open it and let's put it here.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.240
Pretty awesome.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.140
Then on the second are poured.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.520
Let's create another rectangle pretty good.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.730
It should fit your art board and then I'm gonna place the same image here.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:31.580
Fantastic.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.730
So now it's time to add interactions.

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:34.500
Tar design.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.820
So let me rename its inner to refer to that easily.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.450
So I'm gonna change the name to home and the 2nd 1 to detail.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.500
Pretty good,

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.860
actually.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.160
If the user clicks on this image in our home art board,

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.010
our detail art board should be presented in a second,

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.570
OK,

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.690
and then we need to animate it.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:56.870
So first of all,

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.730
in the property section,

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.570
you can select prototype from these three taps like this.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.980
Then you need to select your object.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.780
As you can see my images selected already.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:09.510
And as you can see,

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:10.960
a circle appears here.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.990
So if I click and that's and hold my mouth's like this,

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.100
I can easily connect it to the next our board.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.390
Let's drop it.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.700
And there we go now are art boards are connected,

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:23.330
okay.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.370
And if I want to remove this connection.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:26.810
I can drank and drop.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.650
It's the canvas like this.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.110
Once you created your first connection,

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.450
a small blue square will appear at the top left corner of your first our birth,

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.210
and it means that your prototype starts from this artwork.

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:41.590
If you want to change it,

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.440
you can easily click on that,

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.550
drag it and drop it here like this.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.690
So now that we have created our interaction,

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.390
let's preview for a second.

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.130
If I go to the toolbar and click on this preview button,

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.200
I can see my art boards here.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.590
And if I click anywhere in my art board like this,

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.740
you can see that it shows me that there is an interaction for this image.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.630
So these blue box is a hot spot Now,

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:08.920
if I click on that,

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.470
you can see that my second art board appears immediately Okay,

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.060
However,

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.850
we don't have any animation here,

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.230
so let's go back to our project file.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.040
And in the prototype section,

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.020
you have interaction section.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.380
You have animation.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.950
Okay.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.110
Here we can choose the type of interaction.

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.860
For instance,

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:32.460
we have on tap on drag while hovering wine pressing mouse.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:33.680
Enter etcetera.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.270
We're not going to dive into these details right now because we will cover it in the

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.410
prototyping section of this course.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.680
You have also the destination here.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.760
Navigate to open,

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.130
overlay salt with back close overlay and open your L.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.140
And here is your destination.

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.750
Then we have the animation section as well.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.700
As you can see it said to incent by default.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.130
So if I open up this drop menu,

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.800
I have plenty of options.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.290
I have smart animate,

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.880
which is a new feature we have moving,

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:06.720
move out,

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:07.440
push,

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.280
sliding and slide out.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.550
So now I'm going to choose smart animate.

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.400
And here we have advanced options.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.070
For instance,

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.260
I can choose is Ian is out is in and out,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.320
and Lanier is a related to animation stuff.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.270
We will cover it in the advanced section and here you have the time.

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.960
For instance,

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.540
I can set it to 400 milliseconds like this.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.270
You can also open up the prototype setting here it is related to this window.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.540
We can modify,

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:35.170
for example,

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.880
the background toe white like this.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:38.840
As you wish,

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.790
you can change the model of your iPhone.

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:41.850
For example,

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.520
here it said to gold.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.920
I can choose Midnight Green like this.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:47.820
Fantastic.

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.230
Now let's check it out.

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:50.300
Once again,

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.110
I'm gonna go to the first page and now let's click on our image.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.030
There we go.

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.140
It is fantastic,

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.700
isn't it?

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.350
If you want to start over,

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.180
you can click on this button,

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.150
restart,

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.760
and then you can check it out once again.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.490
So now let's go back to our project file.

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:07.100
And here,

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.110
as you can see,

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.800
the name of our rectangles in these two art boards are different.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.310
So let's make them the same.

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:18.430
So I'm going to change it to image and this one image as well.

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.180
So what do you think is gonna happen?

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.360
Let's check it out.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.190
I'm gonna go to prototyping.

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:24.580
That's Restart that.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:25.510
And once again,

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:26.720
I'm going to click on that.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:27.800
Fantastic.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.370
Did you see the difference here?

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.820
So with the help of smart animates,

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.150
you could create these kind of animation and prototyping easily in fig MMA,

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.610
which is pretty amazing.

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:43.820
And you're going to dive into more complex animations and more complex prototyping in the

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.320
prototyping section of this course are right guys.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.910
That's all for this video.

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:50.160
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.250
And I will see you in the next video
