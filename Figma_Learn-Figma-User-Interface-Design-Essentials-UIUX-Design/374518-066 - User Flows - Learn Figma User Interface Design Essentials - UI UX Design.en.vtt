00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.250
Hi,

00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:00.830
everyone.

00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:01.840
In these video,

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.280
we're gonna be talking about user flow.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:09.870
User flow is a path taken by prototypical user on an APP or website.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.710
To complete a task.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:18.110
The user flow directs them from their entry point through a set off phases toward a

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.850
successful outcome and final action,

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.460
such as sending a message or purchasing an item.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:30.080
Let me give you an example of a very simplified user flow for an e commerce app.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.130
The user starts from the home page from the home page.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.220
The user clicks onto a category page.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.650
Then,

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.150
from the category page,

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.950
the user clicks on a product and then from the product page,

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.450
the user adds an item to the card and then from the shopping cart to use their checks out.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:51.720
And after that,

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.140
from the check out page,

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.480
the user completes the payment,

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.500
and in the end the user can get his or hair received.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.340
So this is how a user flow look like,

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.050
and it's very important for every project to have at least a simplifying user flow
