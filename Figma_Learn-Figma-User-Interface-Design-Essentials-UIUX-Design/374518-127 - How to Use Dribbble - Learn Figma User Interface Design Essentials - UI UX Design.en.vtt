00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.270
Hi,

00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:00.840
everyone.

00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.010
In these video,

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.590
we're gonna be talking about how you can use drivel in order to use driven services.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:08.140
First,

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.430
you need to have an account.

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.360
Once you create your account,

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.720
you can whether browse other designers,

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.600
artwork for inspiration.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.570
Or you can upload your own creative artwork each month.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.240
You can upload up to 48 shots,

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.590
and your shots should meet the DRI bones guidelines.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:33.840
You can upload high resolution images we PNG J pic and GIF format and also animated GIFs to

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.720
your profile.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.760
Additionally,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.250
if you're a pro member,

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.200
you can upload videos as well.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.040
After applauding your artwork,

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.050
you can set a title for it.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.350
You can also add relative tanks to let other users find your artwork easier.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.840
Last but not least,

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.810
you should write a short description for your shot,

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.850
and then you can publish it right away or in the future.
