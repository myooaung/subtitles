Hello,

00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:00.910
everyone.

00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:01.940
In these video,

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:04.780
we're gonna be talking about imagery sources.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.290
We has Designers work with images a lot.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.490
It could be any kind of images in the form of profiles,

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:13.610
products,

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:14.360
etcetera.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.740

There are so many websites that offer you a variety of images,

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.790
Some of them are paid and some of them are free.

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:30.630

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:36.990
their license,

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.230

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.270
categories.
