00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.270
Hi,

00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:00.870
everyone.

00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.910
And welcome back to another video of these section in these video,

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.360
we're going to start designing our profile screens.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.860
Okay,

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.400
so first things first we need to have a new art board.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.080
So what I'm going to do is just duplicating these OTP a screen.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.000
And after that,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.680
I'm going to remove all the objects on.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.950
Let me rename it to profile.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:23.910
Okay,

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:24.670
so basically,

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:30.440
these profile screen is going to have a background and also a profile image placeholder

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.290
right at the top and some tax feels and at button.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.800
Okay,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.020
so first of all,

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:42.000
let's go ahead and insert a rectangle in order to create our background like this,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.450
make sure that it fits your screen,

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:45.880
then change you too.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.730
Linear.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:47.460
Radiant.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.720
I'm gonna make it fit like this and let's select the first color.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:59.690
And I'm going to set the Color co 2 49 60 and f nine like this and the second color is

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.490
going to be 1937 f e Okay.

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:05.050
However,

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.370
make sure to increase the capacity to 100% like this.

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.760
And also I'm going to change the direction at little bit to get a better Grady int

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.190
something like this.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.440
It's pretty nice,

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.030
isn't it?

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.990
After that,

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.920
we need to add our status far and our home indicator.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.410
Okay,

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:24.120
However,

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.100
this time we need to get the white state of smart and the white home indicator.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.760
So let's go ahead and place an image and from apple on yours,

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.120
your folder bars say this far,

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.850
Let's choose the dark one and place it here like this pretty good.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.620
And then let's place another image and from home indicator folder that shoes the dark

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:55.200
portrait and place it right at the bottom line into the center and also aligning to the

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.170
bottom life.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.240
This pretty good.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.190
So so far we have created the base screen.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.750
OK,

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.340
now it's time to add some details.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.740
Street.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.680
The first thing we need is a banking arrow right at the top left.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.250
Okay,

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:14.000
so let's place an icon from our icons folder and here I'm gonna choose left arrow and place

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.540
it here like this.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.510
Sometimes when God these icons,

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:18.990
they may be invisible.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.980
This is probably a bag of fig MMA.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:21.570
However,

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:22.770
if you want to fix that,

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.010
you can close your file and open it once again and then you will see those icons.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.550
Okay,

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:29.190
are right.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.880
Now let's check the pad ings.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.850
The left fighting is going to be 30 pixels like this,

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:40.000
and the top padding is going to be 24 pixels like this.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.050
The top fighting is going to be against the status bar.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.510
Okay,

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.940
Not the edge of this are poor pretty good.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.420
Now let's create our profile image placeholder together.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.060
So what I'm going to need is a rectangle.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.350
So I'm gonna insert that that's hold,

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.650
shift and drag and drop like this.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.050
So make sure that the width and height are both said to 100 pixels and then I'm going to

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.200
set the corner radius to 36.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.110
And also,

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.360
I'm gonna make it smooth like this.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.330
Pretty good.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.160
And after that,

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.050
let's change the color to White.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.090
And now I'm gonna add some details feet,

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.500
So let's duplicate it.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.640
First Command E or control the then let's make it a little bit larger.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:30.770
So let's set the heightened with both to 104 pick songs like this and I'm going to set the

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.090
color too a light blue.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.050
So let's write 40 c e and F two Okay,

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.950
Fantastic.

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.310
Now let's move these layer down right below our first rectangle.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.470
Then I'm gonna align it to the center,

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.340
this white one as well.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.390
And now let's select both off them and align them both horizontally and vertically.

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:54.750
And now let's rename them.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.220
So the blue one is going to be blue,

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.960
and the white one is going to be white.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.990
That we can recognize them is itchy.

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:03.740
And now let's select the blue one,

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:09.030
and I'm going to rotate it by minus 57 degrees like this.

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.350
Then,

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:10.150
once again,

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.040
that's duplicate.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.940
The white one are right.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:19.310
And now let's change the color to be 52 double F on eight like this.

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:20.290
And this time,

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:27.400
let's make it 106 by 106 peak cells are right and make sure that it's a line to the center

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.520
Or,

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.400
.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.280
incidentally,

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.520
I'm going to move it up like this.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:36.340
Let's change the name to purple movie down right below the blue one,

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.180
and this time,

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.270
let's rotate it by minus 30 degrees.

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.190
Fantastic.

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.080
It's so fancy,

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.640
isn't it?

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.490
And then we need to place our camera.

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:45.200
I can,

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.490
right at the center off this White Square.

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.630
So let's go ahead and place an image from icons.

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.530
I'm gonna choose camera and place it here.

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:59.780
Then make sure to align it with your white square both vertically and horizontally.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.900
And after that I'm going to select all these elements,

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.990
group them and let's call it profile.

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:14.460
Image like this are right and the top hiding is going to be 40 pick cells like this and

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.780
make sure that it's aligned to the center or is entirely.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:23.600
And also I'm going to remove this 400.6 from the UAE access to get a 40 pixel top,

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.410
adding like this are right pretty good.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.950
Now it's time to create our takes feels okay,

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.010
So in order to save our time,

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.180
I'm going to choose thes email address,

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.650
text field cop.

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.370
It is pasted here pretty good.

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.950
I'm gonna move it up and let's change the title to user name.

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:48.610
And also the color is going to be a T E zero and double F.

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:53.520
Let's copy this color code because we're going to need that and these text layer is going

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.960
to be your user name,

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.250
and the color code is going to be the same pretty good.

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:00.880
Let's hide this tick icon.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:01.660
However,

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:06.180
don't remove that because in the next screen you're going to an hide it.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.630
So let's just hide it for now.

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:13.520
Then Selectees takes feels nine and make it white pretty good.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.150
And I'm gonna rename these tax field to use their name,

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.130
this group as well,

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:19.980
Pretty good.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:25.320
And now it's time to duplicate that and place it with a 24 pixel top.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:25.830
Adding,

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:26.970
like this,

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:27.580
once again,

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.110
duplicate that and once again,

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:31.020
pretty good.

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.370
The 2nd 1 is going to be our first name.

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.700
So let's right first name.

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:40.760
And here is going to be changed to your name.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:46.910
And the group and frame name is going to be first name here as well.

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:48.550
Pretty good.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.750
And the 3rd 1 is going to be last name.

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:53.210
Fantastic.

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:57.460
Here Needs to be your last name too pretty good.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.900
And the last one is going to be date of birth.

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.250
Fantastic.

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:02.660
Here,

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:07.510
let's write your birthday and I'm going to write a format for these.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:08.460
So let's right.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.050
D d dash.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:11.700
Mm dash.

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:12.110
Why?

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:12.400
Why?

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:12.780
Why?

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:13.280
Why?

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:13.910
OK,

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:19.350
so it means that the user should enter the day and month and the year.

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:19.920
Okay,

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.390
Remember to rename your friend's name and also your group's name.

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:32.950
So I'm gonna change it to last name this one as well and the last onto birthday.

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:34.500
Pretty good.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:35.130
All right.

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:39.150
Now let's elect all of them by holding shift key on your keyboard.

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:40.730
And let's shake the top.

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:45.630
Heading 8 71.2 Let's make it 40.

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:46.740
Like this,

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:50.360
You can group them and call It takes fields.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.010
And as you can see,

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:55.180
the right and left padding are 30 pixels.

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:55.700
Okay,

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:58.790
then the last thing we need is a bottom.

00:07:58.790 --> 00:07:59.340
Okay,

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:01.270
It's going to be our complete button,

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:06.030
so I'm gonna choose these verify button copy dis pasted here.

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:07.740
That's removed these circles.

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:08.950
We don't need them.

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:09.760
And also,

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.850
I'm going to change the color to a solid wind.

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:17.220
So make sure to select a rectangle to not rectangle one,

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:18.880
because this is our mask.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:22.500
And I'm going to change the color to solid white.

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:23.530
Pretty good.

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:29.860
And the text color should be C eight c eight and see eight like this.

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.650
And let's change it to complete.

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:33.130
Okay,

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:36.850
The last thing we need to add to the Spartan is a teak icon.

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:37.380
Okay?

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:41.950
So let me copy and paste thes tick icon from our sign in page,

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:42.950
and I'm going to pace it.

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:44.750
Here are right.

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:48.470
Let's use the same color for the stick icon as well.

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:51.480
And I'm gonna align it with my text vertically.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.350
Pretty good.

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:56.300
And make sure to move this layer inside your bottom group.

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:56.940
Okay?

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:58.680
So it's gonna be here,

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.790
and the left fighting is going to be a pixels.

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:07.980
The reason that we chose a light gray color for these elements is that this button is

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.630
inactive in the screen.

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:10.060
Okay?

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:13.360
Because the user didn't complete this form yet.

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.680
So now let's rename me to complete.

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:17.980
Fantastic.

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:21.020
And now everything he's done are right.

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:21.290
Now,

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:23.420
let's go ahead and design our profile.

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:24.530
Completed Page.

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:25.050
Okay,

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:29.140
so I'm gonna duplicate this screen like this,

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:30.180
and then first,

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:32.570
let's feel these take sales together.

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:36.830
The 1st 1 is going to be Emma Underline.

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:37.710
Actually,

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:39.740
you can choose whether you want it.

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:40.950
Doesn't matter.

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:42.700
I'm gonna make it white.

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:47.050
The first name is going to be Emma White as well.

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:49.210
Last name should be Ashley.

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:51.840
Let's make it white.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:52.840
Pretty good.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:10:00.230
And the date of birth is going to be 20 of December 1990.

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:02.360
That's make it white pretty good.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:03.120
And now,

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.410
as I mentioned before,

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:06.520
you're going to on Haidar Teak icon.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:07.150
Okay,

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:09.500
so let's go ahead and on height,

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:10.880
them like this.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.110
Fantastic.

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:18.810
And the color off our company text should be changed to to be 47 FC.

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:23.660
That's competence because I'm going to change the color of this teak icon as well.

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:25.230
They said here pretty good.

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:27.020
Now this Pontin is active.

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:27.550
All right,

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:30.670
so now let's go ahead and change our profile.

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:31.460
Placeholder.

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:31.950
Okay,

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:34.670
so we're going to add an image to this.

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:35.420
First of all,

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:38.250
we need to remove thes camera icon like this.

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:40.510
Then that's choose this White Square.

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:42.560
And now I'm going to choose a plugging.

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.140
I'm going to use the contents real plugging that.

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:47.100
I already showed you how you can use.

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.220
So I'm gonna click on these content,

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:49.530
really,

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:51.450
and let's go to avatars.

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:52.650
Choose female,

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:55.550
and it's refreshing until you get a great picture.

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:57.260
I think it's pretty good,

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:58.340
fantastic,

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:01.640
and also I'm going to add a drop shadow to these square.

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:02.920
So let's add effects.

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.200
The days I'm going to change the setting.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:12.550
So let's set the Blur to 22 the Y 28 and decreased the capacity to 20%.

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:13.530
Fantastic.

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:14.510
And after that,

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:18.090
I'm going to select these blue and purple squares,

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:21.910
move them out of our profile Image group are right.

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:25.160
And let's scare them a little bit like this,

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:30.330
and I'm gonna choose the blue one first double click on that to enter the edit mode.

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:31.060
And after that,

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:34.370
I'm going to add and no right in the middle like this.

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:39.150
And then I'm going to move it to the right side till I get a shape like this.

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:40.050
Pretty good.

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:41.740
Let's move to the right,

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:43.060
click and done.

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:46.470
And let's do the same thing to this Purple Square as well.

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:53.210
So I'm gonna add a note here and move it like this pretty good movie to the top.

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:56.130
And let's rotate it a little bit like this.

00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:56.870
However,

00:11:56.870 --> 00:12:01.450
I'm going to scale it to make it larger a little bit more,

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:03.920
and that scale these blue one as well.

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.980
That's rotated a little bit pretty good.

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:08.780
I'm gonna move it to the right.

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:09.300
You like it?

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.140
The best location possible.

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:17.130
Now let's select both off them and I'm gonna move them down right below our profile image

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:18.820
and also our status bar,

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:19.900
which is this line?

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:20.790
Pretty good.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:23.370
Move them up and that's all.

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:24.220
It's pretty good,

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:24.820
isn't it?

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:30.480
The only thing that I noticed is that we didn't align these text layer these complete text

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.910
layer to the center.

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:39.030
So let's go ahead and select this company Tanks and the stick icon group them and aligning

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:39.950
to the center.

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:44.080
But I'm going to do the same thing to these elements as well.

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.480
So I'm going to select them,

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:46.280
group them,

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:49.810
select the rectangle and align them to the center.

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:51.870
And now everything is done.

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:53.840
Can you see how beautiful it ease?

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.050
It's pretty interesting,

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:55.600
isn't it?

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.470
Our right guys,

00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:58.250
that's all for these video.

00:12:58.250 --> 00:12:59.620
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:00.920
And in the next video,

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.200
we will design our homepage together.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.250
So see you that
