00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.175
Hey, welcome back.

00:00:02.175 --> 00:00:07.439
In this video, we are going to start designing our second feature section,

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:10.065
right below these credit card section.

00:00:10.065 --> 00:00:11.910
Okay, so first of all,

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.560
let me take a look at our wireframe and see what we need to design.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.145
So as you can see for our second feature section,

00:00:20.145 --> 00:00:23.190
on the left side, we need to have some cards, okay,

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:29.775
so two small cards at the top and one large card at the bottom, okay?

00:00:29.775 --> 00:00:32.250
And on the right side we need to have a header,

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.250
a description, and also a button.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.540
Okay? So what we need to do is select

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.120
these title and description that we created for our feature one section.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.950
So I'm going to double-click on that.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.810
And as you can see in the layers list,

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.570
feature one is selected, I'm gonna copy it.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.225
So press command C or control C on your keyboard and I'm gonna paste it.

00:00:56.225 --> 00:01:00.200
Okay, made sure that this new layer that we just

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.475
paste that is outside this feature one section, okay?

00:01:04.475 --> 00:01:06.755
If it's inside like this,

00:01:06.755 --> 00:01:08.285
make sure to move it out,

00:01:08.285 --> 00:01:10.790
okay, and then using my arrow key,

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.905
I can move it down like this.

00:01:12.905 --> 00:01:15.590
Now let me press Control G on my keyboard.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.630
And if you don't know these shortcuts,

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.760
you can easily head over to these question mark icon at the bottom right corner.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:23.795
You can click on that.

00:01:23.795 --> 00:01:26.900
And there is an option called keyword shortcuts.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.115
Okay, I'm going to click on that since now I'm using Mac OS.

00:01:31.115 --> 00:01:33.410
It shows me only the Mac shortcuts, okay,

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:34.954
but if you're using Windows,

00:01:34.954 --> 00:01:36.065
they might be different.

00:01:36.065 --> 00:01:40.805
All right, so if I head over to view here you can see for layout grids,

00:01:40.805 --> 00:01:43.115
it's written control g, okay?

00:01:43.115 --> 00:01:45.560
And you can check out all other shortcuts here.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.550
I'm going to close it.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.870
And now let me move this layer to the right side here, like this.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.625
Let me put it right over there.

00:01:52.625 --> 00:01:55.010
Perfect. Okay. And as you can see,

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.305
it covers four columns, okay,

00:01:57.305 --> 00:01:59.870
then I'm going to rename it to feature too.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.375
So if you double-click on its name,

00:02:02.375 --> 00:02:04.130
you can easily rename it.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.310
And finally, we need to modify the content.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.370
Okay, so I'm gonna copy and paste the text that they already prepared from my clipboard.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.930
So for the tidal,

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.565
I'm going to write manage your finances like a pro in no time.

00:02:19.565 --> 00:02:20.120
Okay.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.955
And let me move this description down to get a 30 peak cell top margin like this.

00:02:25.955 --> 00:02:26.465
Okay?

00:02:26.465 --> 00:02:28.550
And for the description,

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.755
I'm going to again copy and paste the description from my clipboard. And there we go.

00:02:33.755 --> 00:02:36.080
So the description is like this.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.600
We draft bookkeeping, banking,

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.210
and invoices are all in one place.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.295
You will always know where you stand.

00:02:43.295 --> 00:02:44.855
And right below that,

00:02:44.855 --> 00:02:46.280
we need to add a button,

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.855
okay, and learn more button.

00:02:47.855 --> 00:02:52.370
So what I'm gonna do is select the register now Watson, okay,

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:59.450
from our hero section copied Control C or Command C and paste it and will be down.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.035
There we go. And I'm going to set its top margin to 30,

00:03:03.035 --> 00:03:04.970
okay, to keep everything consistent.

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.320
And finally.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.415
We need to change the text to learn more.

00:03:10.415 --> 00:03:15.350
And let me move it to the right side to get a ten pixel right padding.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.860
Perfect.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.295
Alright, so in order to make this button look more interesting,

00:03:19.295 --> 00:03:21.365
I'm going to add some shapes it OK,

00:03:21.365 --> 00:03:25.505
let me hide my layout grids and then I'm going to select the Pen tool.

00:03:25.505 --> 00:03:31.610
Click here, once, click here and drag like this to create a curved line.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.345
Okay, click once again and drag and finally,

00:03:35.345 --> 00:03:37.160
connect your nodes together.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.245
And now that her path is closed,

00:03:39.245 --> 00:03:40.550
we can give it a field.

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.780
Okay, so let me remove the stroke and add field to it.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:45.470
Perfect.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.065
And then I'm going to add a gradient to this one.

00:03:48.065 --> 00:03:49.985
So I'm gonna go and click on this.

00:03:49.985 --> 00:03:52.220
And then I'm going to open up this drop menu at

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.205
the top and change it from solid to linear.

00:03:55.205 --> 00:03:57.410
And now we have a linear gradient.

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.410
So for the first color, I select that,

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:06.380
I can set the code to 55 for double D and E,

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.835
OK, to get this purple.

00:04:07.835 --> 00:04:09.860
And the second color is going to be the same.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.530
So I'm going to copy these color codes and select

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.815
the second color and paste it here like this,

00:04:15.815 --> 00:04:19.895
and make sure that the capacity is set to 0% for our second color.

00:04:19.895 --> 00:04:21.185
Okay, fantastic.

00:04:21.185 --> 00:04:25.190
Alright, now I need to mask these shape. How can I do that?

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.505
First of all, let me select the rectangle,

00:04:28.505 --> 00:04:31.445
okay, this rectangle, 47 in my case.

00:04:31.445 --> 00:04:33.245
And then I'm gonna duplicate it,

00:04:33.245 --> 00:04:38.570
Command Z or Control D and select this new rectangle that we just created.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.970
Hold down the Control key or command key on

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.570
your keyboard and select the shape that we just created.

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.660
This one, okay, this purple one, like this.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.895
Now that both of them are selected,

00:04:49.895 --> 00:04:52.625
click on Mask icon in the toolbar.

00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:53.390
And there we go.

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:59.375
Now we've just mask these shape and we can easily move it around like this.

00:04:59.375 --> 00:05:00.229
Perfect.

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:03.005
However, I'm gonna make it a little bit smaller.

00:05:03.005 --> 00:05:07.010
So let me hold down the Shift key and scale it down,

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.650
and I'm going to rotate it a little bit.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.975
A good, Alright, fantastic.

00:05:11.975 --> 00:05:16.565
Now let me select this shape duplicated Command Z or Control D.

00:05:16.565 --> 00:05:21.500
Move it to the top, right-click and add and flip it vertically.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.955
Like this.

00:05:22.955 --> 00:05:24.965
It looks amazing, right?

00:05:24.965 --> 00:05:26.284
It's pretty cool.

00:05:26.284 --> 00:05:28.520
And last but not least,

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.045
we need to modify the color of this new shape.

00:05:32.045 --> 00:05:39.800
So I'm gonna change the color gradient to F double for E 77 like this,

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.880
and the same for our second color like this.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.840
Alright, you can modify the gradient using this handle.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.205
Okay, perfect.

00:05:49.205 --> 00:05:52.265
Let me modify it for the first shape as well.

00:05:52.265 --> 00:05:53.720
Pretty cool.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.085
It's amazing, isn't it?

00:05:55.085 --> 00:05:59.525
Now that the right side of our second section is ready,

00:05:59.525 --> 00:06:01.865
we can start designing the left section.

00:06:01.865 --> 00:06:07.850
Okay, so let me unhide the layout grids and we need to start creating our cards.

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:12.365
Okay, so we need to have two small cards and one large card.

00:06:12.365 --> 00:06:16.760
I'm going to select the Rectangle tool from the toolbar, click and drag.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.085
Okay, and now I have a rectangle.

00:06:19.085 --> 00:06:21.350
However, I'm going to set its width.

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:25.490
223 pixels like this,

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:30.230
and it's height to 180 like this.

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:34.655
And also, I'm gonna change the corner radius to 50.

00:06:34.655 --> 00:06:35.855
Everything looks great.

00:06:35.855 --> 00:06:38.810
And the next thing I'm gonna do is change its color.

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:40.790
So I'm gonna change it to white.

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:42.995
However, as you can see,

00:06:42.995 --> 00:06:48.860
it's not visible because our background color is also set to white, which is a problem.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.180
How can we fix that?

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.435
We can easily select the landing page art board.

00:06:53.435 --> 00:06:55.130
And then as you can see,

00:06:55.130 --> 00:07:02.120
the field is set to white and I'm gonna change it to our neutral color like this.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.535
Now, our card is visible, okay,

00:07:04.535 --> 00:07:07.175
and it creates a beautiful contrast.

00:07:07.175 --> 00:07:09.620
However, in order to make it look much,

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.145
much better, we will add drop shadow and stroke to it.

00:07:13.145 --> 00:07:14.855
So let me add a stroke to it.

00:07:14.855 --> 00:07:20.645
Alright, I'm gonna choose the stroke color sign that we already prepared by this.

00:07:20.645 --> 00:07:26.135
And then let me modify it thickness to 0.5. there we go.

00:07:26.135 --> 00:07:28.360
And the last thing we need is some drop shadow.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:33.410
So I'm gonna click on this plus icon to add some effects and let me modify it.

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:35.120
Alright, so for the Blair,

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.264
I'm gonna set it to 50.

00:07:37.264 --> 00:07:40.340
For the Y, I'm going to set it to 25.

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:44.585
So 50 divided by two is equal to 25.

00:07:44.585 --> 00:07:45.875
And for the color,

00:07:45.875 --> 00:07:52.475
I'm going to write the color code 16194, f like this.

00:07:52.475 --> 00:07:57.200
And finally, let me decrease the opacity to 5%.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.885
There we go. Everything is ready, perfect.

00:07:59.885 --> 00:08:04.490
So let me unhide the layout grids and I'm going to add a text layer to it.

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:06.770
And let me write balance.

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:07.430
Okay?

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:12.440
So it shows a balance of the user right below this text layer.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:15.365
And now I am going to use another textile.

00:08:15.365 --> 00:08:18.530
Okay, let's use main, buddy main.

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:19.775
It looks pretty good.

00:08:19.775 --> 00:08:22.460
I'm going to set its top padding to 40,

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:25.025
and it's left padding to 40 as well.

00:08:25.025 --> 00:08:28.895
Duplicated Command or Control D movie down.

00:08:28.895 --> 00:08:35.930
And here let's write 5600 sign for these hex layer.

00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:43.010
I'm gonna use h because we need to have a good hierarchy since this amount,

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:44.255
which is the balance,

00:08:44.255 --> 00:08:47.675
is more important than the Thai, they'll itself.

00:08:47.675 --> 00:08:51.469
We need to use a larger and also a bold font.

00:08:51.469 --> 00:08:54.950
So this is why I use h3 for that.

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:58.940
And finally, I'm going to set its color to our purple.

00:08:58.940 --> 00:08:59.645
There we go.

00:08:59.645 --> 00:09:03.605
Okay, let me set its bottom padding to 40.

00:09:03.605 --> 00:09:06.410
And now it looks amazing, right?

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:07.940
So what else do we need?

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:11.345
We need to create another card right next to it,

00:09:11.345 --> 00:09:14.420
ok, for the last transaction amount.

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:16.355
However, before I do that,

00:09:16.355 --> 00:09:21.965
I want you to pause the video right now and try to create it by yourself, okay?

00:09:21.965 --> 00:09:23.630
So you don't need to do so much,

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:28.805
you just need to duplicate the elements that we just created and just modify the content.

00:09:28.805 --> 00:09:31.250
So pause the video and when you're done,

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:33.470
you can play the video again, are right.

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:35.464
I hope you could do that by yourself.

00:09:35.464 --> 00:09:36.710
Now it's miter.

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:39.470
First of all, I'm going to select all of these elements.

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:41.615
So let me select them, group them,

00:09:41.615 --> 00:09:44.450
and I'm going to call it balanced card.

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:45.395
There we go.

00:09:45.395 --> 00:09:46.985
Now I'm gonna duplicate it.

00:09:46.985 --> 00:09:48.980
Command Z or Control D,

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:50.540
moving to the right side,

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:53.645
make sure that it touches your sixth column.

00:09:53.645 --> 00:09:56.720
And as you can see, the margin is set to 20.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:00.335
Okay, all right, now I'm going to double-click on my text layer

00:10:00.335 --> 00:10:04.310
and let me change it to last transaction.

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:05.000
Okay?

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.545
And let's change the amount to $230.

00:10:09.545 --> 00:10:10.250
Pretty good.

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:12.845
I'm going to zoom out and it looks great.

00:10:12.845 --> 00:10:15.770
The last thing we need before we finished designing

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:19.280
our second feature section is a charge card.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.885
Ok, but before that,

00:10:20.885 --> 00:10:25.130
make sure to rename this last transaction card okay.

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:27.080
To keep everything organized.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:32.630
So it's going to be last transaction card.

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:38.585
Then I'm going to select one of these cards duplicated movie down like this,

00:10:38.585 --> 00:10:44.240
and I'm gonna rename it to charge and select these takes layers and remove them.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.670
We don't need them anymore for our charge,

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:48.020
we need a large card,

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:50.405
so I'm gonna make it larger.

00:10:50.405 --> 00:10:55.010
So its width is going to be set to 466 pixels and

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:59.960
its height is going to be set to 246 pixels.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:04.505
Okay? We can later modify it if we are not satisfied with the result.

00:11:04.505 --> 00:11:06.575
Okay, but for now it looks great.

00:11:06.575 --> 00:11:08.165
Let me zoom in. Perfect.

00:11:08.165 --> 00:11:12.080
So actually we are going to design a simple bar chart, okay,

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:15.035
so we're going to have Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,

00:11:15.035 --> 00:11:19.070
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, and some bars.

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:21.965
So let me start with that takes layers.

00:11:21.965 --> 00:11:24.680
I am going to press T on my keyboard and click here.

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:27.470
And I'm gonna write m or n,

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:29.375
which stands for Monday.

00:11:29.375 --> 00:11:32.990
Which textile is suitable for this one?

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:35.585
I think this small one is great.

00:11:35.585 --> 00:11:38.885
And also I'm going to change its color to secondary light.

00:11:38.885 --> 00:11:43.235
However, we have one problem and that is the weight of these takes layer.

00:11:43.235 --> 00:11:47.795
What I'm gonna do is detach it from its style and change.

00:11:47.795 --> 00:11:50.045
It's way too bold.

00:11:50.045 --> 00:11:52.775
All right, now it looks much, much better.

00:11:52.775 --> 00:11:57.500
Will be to the left side a little bit duplicated to the right side.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:00.590
And let me write Ti Ui duplicated,

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:05.525
moving to the right side and then WEB again, duplicate it.

00:12:05.525 --> 00:12:10.895
You're not going to set the padding for now because first I'm going to create the vars,

00:12:10.895 --> 00:12:13.504
okay, later we will deal with the spacing.

00:12:13.504 --> 00:12:17.930
So for each day we need to have two bars next to each other.

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:20.165
I'm going to select the Rectangle tool,

00:12:20.165 --> 00:12:27.604
click and drag like this to create a tall rectangle and then make it completely rounded.

00:12:27.604 --> 00:12:34.010
You can set it to 20 to make sure that it's rounded and its width is going to be 14.

00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:38.075
I'm going to set the corner radius to 25 to make sure that it's rounded.

00:12:38.075 --> 00:12:40.025
Alright, so for this bar,

00:12:40.025 --> 00:12:45.050
let me set the high to something like 134.

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:46.969
It's just a random number.

00:12:46.969 --> 00:12:48.245
It doesn't mean anything.

00:12:48.245 --> 00:12:50.479
We can make it shorter or taller.

00:12:50.479 --> 00:12:51.905
It's totally up to you,

00:12:51.905 --> 00:12:55.385
but I think 134 is a good number.

00:12:55.385 --> 00:12:59.120
Then I'm going to change the color to our primary one.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:02.420
Duplicated Control D or Command D will be to

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:07.055
the right side and make it shorter and change the color to accent.

00:13:07.055 --> 00:13:11.960
And make sure that you have a four pixel padding between them, like this.

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:15.140
Pretty good. So our first day is ready.

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:18.590
However, I'm gonna select both these bars.

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:21.305
Hold the Shift key on your keyboard and click on

00:13:21.305 --> 00:13:24.095
each of them to select both of them at the same time,

00:13:24.095 --> 00:13:26.690
grouped them, control G or command G,

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:28.955
And let's call it bars.

00:13:28.955 --> 00:13:32.270
Then I'm gonna hold down the Shift key and select

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:35.915
Monday and align them horizontally like this.

00:13:35.915 --> 00:13:37.100
Let me zoom in there.

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:39.920
Bottom padding is going to be ten pixels,

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:42.515
so I am going to move them up by two pixels.

00:13:42.515 --> 00:13:45.140
And there we go. Now, I'm gonna select

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:49.490
the bars duplicated over to the right side like this.

00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:52.580
And I'm gonna modify their height a little bit.

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:55.850
So if you hold down the Command key or control key on

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:59.390
your keyboard and click on one of these bars.

00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:04.580
You can select that particular layer and you can easily modify its height like this.

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:07.775
I'm gonna set it to 98, okay,

00:14:07.775 --> 00:14:09.155
and the next one,

00:14:09.155 --> 00:14:13.835
I'm gonna set it to something like 40 to exclude.

00:14:13.835 --> 00:14:19.040
Then make sure that it's aligned with your text layer to the center.

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:21.170
Perfect selected duplicated.

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:23.420
Move it to the right side, okay?

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:26.119
And I'm going to modify their high to gain.

00:14:26.119 --> 00:14:29.315
And you just need to repeat this process over and

00:14:29.315 --> 00:14:32.510
over again to create a very unique bar chart.

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:33.065
Okay?

00:14:33.065 --> 00:14:37.715
Can you see how simple it is to create these kinds of charts are right?

00:14:37.715 --> 00:14:39.680
I'm going to align them perfect.

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:43.505
The duplicated, move it to the right side like this.

00:14:43.505 --> 00:14:49.400
Alright, the last thing we need to do is to group these bars with its corresponding name.

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:51.395
Okay, so I'm gonna select them.

00:14:51.395 --> 00:14:55.445
Monday, group them, and I'm gonna call it m or n.

00:14:55.445 --> 00:14:59.315
And I'm going to fast forward this process to save some time.

00:14:59.315 --> 00:15:01.625
Alright, now that all groups are ready,

00:15:01.625 --> 00:15:04.490
I can select all groups, okay,

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:07.954
hold down the Shift key and select them one by one,

00:15:07.954 --> 00:15:10.445
makes sure that all of them are selected

00:15:10.445 --> 00:15:13.340
and I can distribute and even space between them.

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:17.120
So if you head over to the Alignments section in the inspector,

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.295
you can see these dropped many ok,

00:15:19.295 --> 00:15:20.930
just click on this icon,

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:25.835
more options and click on Distribute horizontal spacing. There we go.

00:15:25.835 --> 00:15:28.670
Now it's set to 16.

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:33.110
I'm gonna set it to 20 using these pink handle.

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:36.965
And finally, I'm going to group them and let me call it charge.

00:15:36.965 --> 00:15:39.200
There we go. And last but not least,

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:42.710
you need to align these charged with your charge card.

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:47.390
Okay? So I'm going to select these charge card and this bar chart at

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:52.280
the same time and align them horizontally and vertically are right.

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:56.840
You can also group them and colleagues charge card.

00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:00.110
There we go. Our charge card is ready.

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:01.760
Let me check its top padding.

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:03.470
It's set to 22.

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:07.910
I'm gonna set it to 20 to keep everything consistent are right.

00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:12.890
And now we can select all these cards and move them up like this,

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:15.965
group them and call it cards.

00:16:15.965 --> 00:16:19.370
And also let's organize everything on the right side.

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:21.710
So we have these mass group,

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:23.465
which includes these shapes.

00:16:23.465 --> 00:16:26.585
Hold down the Shift key and select this register button.

00:16:26.585 --> 00:16:28.205
We can rename it for sure,

00:16:28.205 --> 00:16:30.440
group them and colleagues.

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.915
Learn more button.

00:16:32.915 --> 00:16:36.544
Then you can hold down the Shift key and select your texts.

00:16:36.544 --> 00:16:40.880
Again, group them and call it feature two,

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.069
and you can align them vertically.

00:16:43.069 --> 00:16:44.675
So hold down the Shift key,

00:16:44.675 --> 00:16:50.285
select cars and the feature to group and align them vertically. And there we go.

00:16:50.285 --> 00:16:52.850
Our feature to section is ready.

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:54.635
So I am going to hold down the Shift key,

00:16:54.635 --> 00:16:56.615
select both of them, group them,

00:16:56.615 --> 00:17:01.280
and let's call it feature to section like this.

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:02.225
Pretty good.

00:17:02.225 --> 00:17:06.500
And it's top margin is going to be 260 pixels.

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:09.890
Okay? So I'm gonna move it down and there we go.

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:11.885
Everything looks great.

00:17:11.885 --> 00:17:14.120
Alright guys, that's all for this video.

00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:17.880
I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you in the next one.
