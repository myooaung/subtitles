00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.710
Hey, welcome back.

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.235
In this video, we are going to continue designing our hero section together.

00:00:05.235 --> 00:00:07.725
So without further ado, let's get started.

00:00:07.725 --> 00:00:11.715
Alright, so let's take a look at our wireframe and see what else we need.

00:00:11.715 --> 00:00:13.229
So we need a headline,

00:00:13.229 --> 00:00:16.590
we need a subtitle and also a call to action.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.335
And on the right side, we need to have an image.

00:00:19.335 --> 00:00:20.820
So first of all,

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.845
let's create our headline.

00:00:22.845 --> 00:00:26.925
I'm going to press T on my keyboard and click to create a text layer.

00:00:26.925 --> 00:00:31.950
But as you can see, this takes layer has been created inside my background group.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.765
Ok, so I'm gonna move it outside of it like this, pretty good.

00:00:36.765 --> 00:00:42.830
And let me write smart banking for freelancers.

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:48.800
Fantastic. And I'm going to select it and let's change the text style to heading one,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.535
h one, okay, which is the largest heading that we have.

00:00:52.535 --> 00:00:58.970
And now let me unhide my layout grid by pressing control G on my keyboard like this.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.710
I'm gonna move it to the left side,

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.990
make sure that it's aligned with the left side of your second column, okay, like this.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.460
And then I'm gonna decrease its width like this.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.630
It looks pretty good.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.840
Okay, now I'm gonna change its color from black to white to get a better contrast.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.685
Let me move it up a little bit.

00:01:19.685 --> 00:01:21.335
There we go. All right, perfect.

00:01:21.335 --> 00:01:23.870
Now let's add our subtitle.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.745
All right, so let me duplicate it,

00:01:25.745 --> 00:01:31.880
move it down and I'm going to change it from heading one to body main.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.610
Okay, and then I'm just going to copy and paste that

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.775
takes that I already prepared in order to save your time.

00:01:37.775 --> 00:01:39.350
So let me paste it.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.780
There we go. So the tax is draft is

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.150
a revolutionary mobile lab bill to help you

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.955
manage your business easily and save your money.

00:01:46.955 --> 00:01:48.290
It's interesting, isn't it?

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.540
Now let me decrease the width like this to make it a little bit smaller, r, right?

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:54.035
Perfect.

00:01:54.035 --> 00:01:55.145
Now it looks amazing.

00:01:55.145 --> 00:01:58.325
So let me take the top margin of this X layer.

00:01:58.325 --> 00:02:00.395
As you can see, it's set to 23.

00:02:00.395 --> 00:02:03.260
I'm gonna set it to a 30 like this.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.135
And then we need to create a button.

00:02:05.135 --> 00:02:07.565
So let me select the Rectangle tool,

00:02:07.565 --> 00:02:10.610
click and drag to create a rectangle like this.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.070
And again it's inside our background.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.645
I'm going to move it out.

00:02:14.645 --> 00:02:18.935
And in order to prevent that problem from happening again and again,

00:02:18.935 --> 00:02:20.390
I'm going to like this group.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.340
Ok, so let's select BG and click on this lock icon.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.585
So for this button,

00:02:26.585 --> 00:02:28.835
I'm going to set the width to 200,

00:02:28.835 --> 00:02:32.105
like this and the high 254.

00:02:32.105 --> 00:02:33.800
So let's keep it as it is.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.614
Then I'm gonna make it rounded.

00:02:35.614 --> 00:02:37.429
So let's set it to 20.

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:38.885
And last but not least,

00:02:38.885 --> 00:02:40.370
we need to give it a color.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.965
Ok, so I'm gonna choose secondary dark.

00:02:42.965 --> 00:02:45.410
As you can see, we don't have a good contrast here.

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.650
So later on, we may modify our background a little bit,

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.885
but for now let's keep the scholar as it is.

00:02:50.885 --> 00:02:52.820
Then for this button we need a text,

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.210
so I'm going to press T and let me write register now.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:57.200
Pretty good.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.955
I'm gonna make it white.

00:02:58.955 --> 00:03:00.515
And for this button,

00:03:00.515 --> 00:03:04.055
I'm going to choose the caption textile like this.

00:03:04.055 --> 00:03:08.915
It may zoom in, make sure to align them both vertically and horizontally.

00:03:08.915 --> 00:03:11.240
So far so good, but for this button,

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.760
I'm going to add an icon to it, okay?

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.700
A right arrow icon that shows the users,

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.425
if they click on this button,

00:03:18.425 --> 00:03:19.820
they are going to move forward.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.994
Okay, from the assets folder,

00:03:21.994 --> 00:03:25.970
I'm going to open up icons and you have arrow right, SVG.

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.755
So drag and drop it here.

00:03:27.755 --> 00:03:30.875
There we go. I'm gonna move it up into layers list.

00:03:30.875 --> 00:03:31.865
Like this.

00:03:31.865 --> 00:03:35.765
Alright, so I'm going to select this icon and hold down the Alt key.

00:03:35.765 --> 00:03:39.770
And let's see what's the padding between these texts layer and this icon.

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.360
As you can see, it's set to four.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.625
I'm gonna set it to ten.

00:03:43.625 --> 00:03:46.490
Okay? I'm gonna move it to the right side,

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.175
then select both of them, grouped them,

00:03:49.175 --> 00:03:51.065
hit Command Z or Control G,

00:03:51.065 --> 00:03:56.465
select the Rectangle and align them to the center horizontally and also vertically.

00:03:56.465 --> 00:04:00.095
Okay, now I'm going to select this group and our rectangle,

00:04:00.095 --> 00:04:03.920
group them once again and name it Register button.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.270
Pretty good. Alright, so what's the top margin of this mountain?

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.505
Top margin is set to 18.

00:04:10.505 --> 00:04:13.070
I'm gonna set it to 30 pixels.

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:14.255
Like this.

00:04:14.255 --> 00:04:18.665
I think it's a good idea to decrease the line height of these headline a little bit.

00:04:18.665 --> 00:04:22.010
By default, we set it to 150%,

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.760
but I think it's too much since this font size is so big.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:33.005
So we can detach it from its style and we could decrease it to 130% like this.

00:04:33.005 --> 00:04:34.910
And now it looks much, much better.

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.905
Make sure to modify the margin to get 30 pixels between these elements.

00:04:39.905 --> 00:04:41.990
Perfect, all right, as I mentioned before,

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.630
we don't have a good contrast for these buttons,

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.400
so we may need to modify our bank around a little bit to get a better result.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.635
So I'm gonna go ahead and open up this background group that we liked.

00:04:54.635 --> 00:04:59.105
I'm going to unlock it and let's select these dark secondary color.

00:04:59.105 --> 00:05:00.920
Ok, this is vector one.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.070
In my case, I'm going to move it down a little bit

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.195
and move it to the left side to get something like this.

00:05:08.195 --> 00:05:10.520
Alright, this is the result I was looking for.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.170
Perfect so far, so good.

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.500
Now that we have created our text content for our hero section,

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.110
it's time to focus on the right side.

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.490
Okay, since this landing page is for a mobile application,

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.235
let's say banking mobile application.

00:05:25.235 --> 00:05:29.150
I already designed a simple mobile at the screen and you have

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.065
it in the assets folder, images, a section.

00:05:33.065 --> 00:05:36.305
And here you have Phone and some shapes.

00:05:36.305 --> 00:05:36.845
Ok?

00:05:36.845 --> 00:05:39.815
So if you drag and drop it into your project,

00:05:39.815 --> 00:05:41.330
you can see the screen.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:42.905
Okay, I'm going to zoom in.

00:05:42.905 --> 00:05:45.410
It's simplest screen that we already designed.

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.340
And since this section is not about mobile application design,

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.530
I prepare it for you in advance, okay,

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.115
so you can put any image you want under ride side.

00:05:55.115 --> 00:05:55.670
Perfect.

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:58.115
Now I'm gonna move it up a little bit.

00:05:58.115 --> 00:06:00.320
I think here it looks good.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.375
Let me unhide my layout grid.

00:06:02.375 --> 00:06:06.305
I'm going to make sure that it's aligned with my layout grid pretty good.

00:06:06.305 --> 00:06:07.760
Alright, so as you can see,

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.260
it already looks good.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.200
But in order to make it look more interesting,

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.690
I want to add some 3D shapes to

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:19.880
this lining page and you have access to these 3D shapes that they already prepared.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.100
So if you open up the hero section,

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.230
okay, in the assets folder,

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:29.375
images here a section you can see that I prepared for different shapes for you.

00:06:29.375 --> 00:06:34.295
So I'm gonna select Shape one and drag and drop it into my project like this.

00:06:34.295 --> 00:06:36.590
And I move it up and put it here.

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.450
Ok, it looks pretty good.

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:42.020
Let me move this font a little bit down, right?

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.150
It looks much, much better here.

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.720
And also let me drag and drop the second shape here.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.075
I'm gonna put it right over there.

00:06:50.075 --> 00:06:55.460
You can modify the colors easily since they are vectors and also shape three.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.605
I'm gonna put it right over there.

00:06:57.605 --> 00:07:01.355
But for this one, in order to create the depth effect,

00:07:01.355 --> 00:07:03.950
I'm going to add a blurry effect to its, okay, alright,

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:08.000
so I'm going to add the effect to it and then I'm gonna change it to

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.680
layer Blair and increase the Blair amount like this, okay?

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.460
And using this technique you can create these depth of field effect,

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.745
OK. And it looks much, much better, Fantastic.

00:07:19.745 --> 00:07:21.515
And last but not least,

00:07:21.515 --> 00:07:27.110
let's drag and drop shape four and put it right here.

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:30.470
Now I think it's a good idea to select all these elements on

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:34.025
the left side and move them down a little bit.

00:07:34.025 --> 00:07:36.800
As you can see, I have so much whitespace here.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:41.900
By whitespace, I don't mean the white-collar like this background here, okay?

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:46.460
White space or negative space is the space between your elements, okay?

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.040
And it's so important to have enough white space in

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:52.430
your design in order to let your design brief.

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.830
One of the mistakes that they see most beginners

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:57.739
make is that they don't have enough Myspace.

00:07:57.739 --> 00:07:58.220
Ok?

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:02.315
So if you try to move these heading down like this and move this,

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:04.340
but an RP, as you can see,

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:06.050
your design cannot brief.

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:11.705
Or for example, if you select all of them and move them to the right side like this,

00:08:11.705 --> 00:08:14.885
you can see that you don't have enough white space here.

00:08:14.885 --> 00:08:19.355
So you're gonna modify your design until you're satisfied with the spacing.

00:08:19.355 --> 00:08:21.560
So let me move it a little bit down.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.570
Predict good are right,

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:25.520
our heroes section is ready.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.260
Can you see how beautiful it is?

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.380
So let me select my art board and preview it.

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:31.745
It's amazing, isn't it?

00:08:31.745 --> 00:08:33.440
I hope you like it, are right guys.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:37.410
I hope you enjoyed this video and I'll see you in the next one.
