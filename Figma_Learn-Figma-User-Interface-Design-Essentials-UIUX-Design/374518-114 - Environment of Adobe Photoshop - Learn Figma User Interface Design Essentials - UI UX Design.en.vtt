00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.330
Hi,

00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.070
everyone In these video,

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.040
we're gonna be talking about the environment off adobe further shop.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.920
So without fair I do.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.340
Let's open up our I don't before the shop are right.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.310
As you can see,

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.620
I'm using Adobe for the shop version.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:15.710
See a six.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.680
It doesn't matter which version you're using right now,

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.850
because we're going to focus on the basics on Lee.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:27.680
And I can assure you that almost Onley elements are the same in all versions.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.160
But it would be great to use an US version as well.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.610
So here another before the shop,

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.640
we can divide this environment in different sections.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.380
For instance,

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.270
on your left,

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.080
you can see that there is the tools panel.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.700
Okay?

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.490
And here there are all tools that we need for editing our images or even creating some

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:49.450
graphic design.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:50.560
And on your right,

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.650
you can see that there are more panels.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:53.420
For instance,

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.660
here we have the layers panel,

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.610
which is one of the most important panels in adult before the shop.

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.870
And also we have adjustment colors,

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:03.630
etcetera.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:04.400
OK,

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.050
but the most important panel here is the tools panel.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.730
Okay.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:09.080
All right,

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.380
guys,

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.590
Thank you so much for watching this video.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:12.930
And in the next video,

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.690
we're gonna be talking about the basics of adult before the shop and how you can use these

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:19.310
tools.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.950
So see you in the next video.
