00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.260
Hi,

00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:00.850
everyone.

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.990
Welcome back to another section of these course in these section,

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.380
we're gonna be talking about fig MMA.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:07.940
What?

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.650
ISF Sigma Sigma is an interface design tool that runs in the browser.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:18.250
It gives you all the necessary tools for designing a world class user interface.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.150
But it's actually much more than that because of the fact that Fatemeh,

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.160
in its nature,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.620
is an always online tool.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.090
It allows for life and riel time collaboration,

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.110
which is a fantastic feature.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.650
All of Sigma is browser based.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.540
There are desk aversions for both Windows and Mac OS.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.580
I will show you how you could use both browser and desktop versions in the next video.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.930
Unlike other tools such as sketch Fig mayes free to use.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.200
Unless you need to create more than three projects,

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.000
you can create unlimited pages and files in the free version are right.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.510
Guys,

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.870
