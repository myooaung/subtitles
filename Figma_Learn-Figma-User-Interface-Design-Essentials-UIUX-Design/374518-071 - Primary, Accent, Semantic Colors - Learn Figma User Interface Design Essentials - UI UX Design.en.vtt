00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.320
Hi,

00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:00.900
everyone.

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.940
Welcome back to another video of these course in these video,

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.910
we're going to start creating our style light,

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:08.350
okay?

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:09.850
Or our design system,

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.060
which is very important when you want to work on a complex project.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.560
Okay,

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.380
so at first,

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.370
it may seem that there is lots of work to do.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:19.490
However,

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:20.300
it's worth it.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.440
So first of all,

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.610
we need an art board.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:23.250
Okay.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.180
As you can see,

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.500
I have created a Mac book Pro Arte board and I'm going to change its name to colors.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.720
Nice.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.800
Then let's go ahead.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.490
And in certain rectangle like this,

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.000
I'm gonna increase the corner radius to make it round it.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.810
But mizzou mean make it smaller.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.530
The with is going to be five,

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.590
and the height is going to be 64 for now.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:52.790
And I'm going to change the color to 41 35 f 33 denies.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.720
Then let me move it to the left side a little bit.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.050
And here I'm gonna insert a text and it's right colors.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.680
I'm going to use SF pro around it.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.040
He denies,

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:14.170
and let's increase its size to 24 points like this and it's going to be regular.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.210
However,

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:22.790
I'm going to change the color co two for a for A and for A or right,

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.350
Let me a line it vertically,

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.580
and I'm going to make it a little bit smaller.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.990
I'm gonna group that.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.970
Fantastic.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.870
So now we need to create our sections because in colors we have different sections.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:37.650
For instance,

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.630
we have primary colors.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.450
We have accent colors and we have semantic colors.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:44.090
Of course,

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.350
you can have background colors as well.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.170
However,

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.560
in the state Auriol,

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.420
we're going to create primary accent and semantic colors.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.990
Okay,

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.690
so now I need a line like this.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:03.760
I'm gonna hold shift and I'm going to change the color to e four e four and e four.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.370
Okay.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:05.330
Like this,

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.700
Then I need to add a text.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.990
That's right.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.390
Primary colors.

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.140
I'm going to choose the same color as a used for these texts.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.280
So let's copy and paste this hex color code.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.910
Fantastic.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.710
I'm gonna align them to the left and its bottom padding is going to be eight pixels.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.790
Let's group them and I'm going to call it primary colors.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.720
Fantastic.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.000
It's pretty nice.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.100
Then I need to create a square here like this and let's make it round it fantastic.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:46.670
Then we need to change the color to four yuan 35 f three.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:47.050
Actually,

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.750
this is the color that I want to use in these tutorial so you can use different colors for

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.000
your design system and keep in mind that you can always change them.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.630
So if you're not sure why and how I choose thes collar,

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.950
it just depends on your project.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:09.160
And he takes some time to understand how you can create your colors pallets properly.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.000
Okay,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.430
but now we just want to focus on creating our design system,

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.190
and I'm gonna show you how you can do it properly so the colors do not matter,

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.720
are right.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.650
It's top heading is going to be 16 peak cells.

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.410
I'm going to duplicate that like this with a 16 pixel left padding.

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:29.200
Once again,

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.840
duplicate that and once again,

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.380
OK,

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.620
so we have four different squares.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:41.360
I'm going to select the 2nd 1 and I'm going to decrease its capacity to 75% like this.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.650
And the 3rd 1 I'm going to change it to 50%.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.280
And the last one that city to 25%.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.830
Okay,

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:54.810
The reason that I changed the capacity is because sometimes we need to have different

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.260
states of each color.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.420
For instance,

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.330
if you're creating a bottom,

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.520
it may have different states such as active,

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.670
the active hover,

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:05.550
etcetera.

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:06.050
OK,

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.910
for instance,

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.350
if you're using these color for the active state,

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.520
we can use other colors such as this one for the Harbour State.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.000
Okay,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.670
so it is quite necessary to have different versions off your color.

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:19.160
All right,

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.350
now let's elect the first square,

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.790
and I'm gonna go ahead and click on these four darts and dang click on this plus button.

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:37.340
And here I'm going to write colors slash primary slash pair pill 100% and creates time.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.880
Okay,

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:38.760
fantastic.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.950
And then the next one colors primary.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.450
Her poll.

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.080
75%.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.580
I'm going to copy it,

00:04:48.580 --> 00:05:00.420
and then the next one it's going to be 50% and the last one is going to be 25% like this.

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.990
Okay,

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.850
fantastic.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:02.320
All right.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.150
Now let's select all of them.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.950
Group them and it's going to be primary colors.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.490
And let's hold,

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:15.010
shift and click and this Primary Colors title once again,

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:20.450
group them and I'm gonna name it Primary Colors.

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:24.080
Then I need to duplicate it like this,

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.990
and that's changed its name to accent colors.

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.590
And I think it's a good idea to decrease the fund size a little bit.

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:32.490
For instance,

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.890
let's set it to 20 this one as well.

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:37.080
Now it's better.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.710
And now let's select the 1st 1 First,

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.250
we need to detach it from its style and the same thing for others.

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.930
So now let's select the 1st 1 and then change the color co.

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:54.760
Two b E five to F and two pretty good.

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.250
That's copies,

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.650
and I'm gonna pay sit for others.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.070
Fantastic.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.890
And now we need to create the color style for these Connors as well.

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:09.140
So let's repeat the procedure here.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:10.990
We need to write colors.

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.550
Accent slash.

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:14.170
That's right,

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:18.540
Purple one and this one as well.

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:24.770
Colors accent purple to that's competence,

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:29.600
and here is going to be propelled three,

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:34.150
and the last fun should be propel for.

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:37.140
You can name them as you want,

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:37.840
however,

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.180
keep it as organized as possible.

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:40.700
Okay,

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:51.000
then I'm going to rename this group to accent colors fantastic and also this one and once

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.560
again duplicate them and here is going to be semantic colors.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.010
First,

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:59.230
we need to detach it from its style.

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:03.920
And we don't need this last one because we're going to have only three different versions.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:11.170
So let's select the 1st 1 I'm going to change the color CO two double F cf and five.

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:11.710
See?

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:12.240
Okay,

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.550
I'm gonna competence,

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:16.680
and that's pace it for others.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.670
All right,

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:18.990
now,

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:22.230
let's go ahead and create our color signs.

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:28.040
So let's write colors semantic and let's write orange one.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.400
I'm going to copy this.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.910
The next one is going to be orange,

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:32.550
too,

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:34.420
in the last one.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:35.860
Orrange three.

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:37.770
Great.

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:39.990
We need one more semantic color,

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:44.360
So I'm gonna duplicate them like this again.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:48.460
We need to detach them from their sile like this,

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:52.930
and that's a like the 1st 1 I'm going to set the Connor Co.

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:53.770
Two,

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:58.030
Double 0 84 F four.

00:07:58.030 --> 00:07:58.630
Okay,

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:01.990
let's competence and paste it for others.

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:03.210
Fantastic.

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:05.010
Now the last step.

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:07.410
He's to create our color sign.

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:16.550
So let's right colors Semantic blue one and then blew two.

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:17.950
And finally,

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:20.730
blue three are right guys,

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:21.950
we're almost done.

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:22.810
However,

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:27.850
I'm going to show you something and we need to cost A mites are color signs a little bit.

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:28.350
Okay,

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:33.970
so now that we have created thes color Stein's with different amount of opacity,

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:40.400
we will have some problems if we decide to use thes colors on top off a colorful background

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:40.400
.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:40.880
Okay,

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.650
now that we're using them on a white background,

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:45.480
we cannot understand the difference.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.190
However,

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:47.420
I'm going to show you something.

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:49.880
So let's create a rectangle here,

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:50.460
OK?

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:54.780
And I'm gonna move it down right below our last group.

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:56.140
And if I move it,

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:57.420
you can see that actually,

00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:01.610
are Connors are changing because we changed their opacity,

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:03.650
but we need to do one more step.

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:04.250
Of course,

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:05.710
for the first colors,

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:10.750
nothing changes because the capacity of this first layer is 100%.

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:12.740
So how can we fix this?

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:15.670
The best way is to choose each one for example,

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:16.320
this fun.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:23.060
Then go to color style than edit style and choose the eyedropper and click and these color

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:23.880
and it's done.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.830
So let's do the same thing for all of them.

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:28.150
There we go.

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:34.180
It's a great technique for creating your color styles because sometimes you don't have all

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:35.120
the colors cold.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:38.230
So in these cases can use thes technique,

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:40.050
and then you can change the colors.

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:42.950
So I'm going to do the same thing for all of them,

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:44.180
are right,

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:45.100
and it's done.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:53.320
So now if I create the same rectangle once again like this and I'm gonna put it right below

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.760
our first group,

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.850
you can see that our colors are not changing.

00:09:57.850 --> 00:09:58.970
So from now on,

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:02.390
even if you use a colorful background on your design,

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:04.650
your colors stay intact.

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:05.220
Are right,

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:05.540
guys,

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.220
that's all for this video.

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:08.530
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:10.850
And I will see you in the next video.

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:11.950
So see you then.
