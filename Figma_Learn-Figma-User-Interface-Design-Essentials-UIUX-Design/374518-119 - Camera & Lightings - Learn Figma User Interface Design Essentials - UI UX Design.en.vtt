00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.220
Hi,

00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:00.860
everyone.

00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.200
Welcome back to another video of thes course in these video.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.840
We're going to continue working on our previous project.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:08.820
As you can see,

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.740
we have these three d tex.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:11.560
However,

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.820
now it's time to add a camera to our canvas or our view.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:16.270
Okay,

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.850
let's get it on these camera pretty awesome.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.240
And now if you pan around,

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.590
you can see the camera is fixed and facing our tax in the specific view that we said.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:28.210
Okay,

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.810
so if you click on this camera view layer least there we go.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.900
You will get your designer camera view.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:40.630
A camera helps us to keep a specific view whenever we want to render our project.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:41.120
OK,

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.450
so now let's render our tanks once again.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:45.640
And as you can see,

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.330
it doesn't seem realistic,

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.720
OK?

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.620
Because we don't have great shadows and gray lighting,

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.100
so let's fix it.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.920
What we're going to do is choosing a shadow plane pretty awesome.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.380
I'm gonna move it down,

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.590
and as you can see now we have a shadow plane.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.190
Okay,

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.510
As a matter of fact,

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.690
whenever you puts an object or anything,

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:13.830
been a very puts an object or let's say a three D tanks on top of a shadow plane.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.840
It will automatically create a shadow for that.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:17.570
So,

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:18.300
for instance,

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.860
here at Mizzou Mean,

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:20.890
As you can see,

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.180
our tanks is not perfectly above our shadow plane.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.970
So first of all,

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.250
let's elect our three D tanks and press a pretty good.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.340
And then I'm gonna move it up like this.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.800
Make sure that it's above your shadow plane.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.480
Okay,

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.180
As you can see,

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.050
it's not so.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.430
I'm gonna move it up again.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:44.950
Now it's pretty good.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:45.580
Okay,

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.850
So if you render your objects right now,

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.750
you can see that we've got a great shadow.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:53.860
Can you see that?

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.160
As a matter of fact,

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.150
you can also add some lights,

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.910
for instance.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:58.260
Here,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.840
I'm going to go for a rectangle light like this.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.670
I'm gonna move it a little bit and let's render are seen once again.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.260
It's too bright now it's better.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:10.300
Fantastic.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.660
All right,

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:11.010
guys,

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.040
Thank you so much for watching this video.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.250
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.450
I will see you in the next video.
