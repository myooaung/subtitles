00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.400
Hello,

00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:00.880
everyone.

00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.840
And welcome back to another video of thes course in these video.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.520
We're gonna be talking about masks.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:08.170
Actually,

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:13.750
masks allow you to show a specific portion of an image or an object.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:14.210
Okay,

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.520
So whenever you want to use a specific section of an image,

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.200
you can easy to use masks.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.750
Or if you want to present on Lee a portion off an object you could steal.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.120
Use masks for that.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.320
So how can you use masks?

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.550
As you can see here,

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.350
I have created a square,

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.020
and I have placed an image from our assets.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.350
Fine.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.530
And if I want to use masks first,

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:42.090
I need to choose this'll a er and then I can click unmask icon right at the top like this.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.970
And after clicking and this icon,

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.150
your layers will be disappeared.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.720
Okay,

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.720
so now I can select my image from the layers least,

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.240
and then I'm gonna move it to the left side.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.420
And as you can see now,

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.520
it has been clipped.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.930
You need to keep in mind that masks well,

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.260
applying toe all layers above it.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.760
Okay,

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.270
so here,

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.030
if I move these image layer to the bottom of my mask,

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.820
You can see that nothing happens.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.190
The other way of applying masked your layer east to choose both layers.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.760
So first I'm gonna put this image on top of my rectangle or square,

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.270
and then I'm going to choose both off them and then click Unmask like this.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.510
The other important thing that you need to keep in mind is that if you're using a Grady int

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.720
or an effect for your rectangle and you want to use masks,

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.590
you need to duplicate your shape in order to keep those effects.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.130
Okay,

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.870
so if I add some drop shadow here like this,

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:45.080
I'm going to set it to 20 and the UAE to 10 and then I'm going to create my mask.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.050
However,

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.330
now,

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:47.360
as you can see,

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.050
my drop shadow color has been changed.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.680
So in order to fix that issue before creating my mask,

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.750
I can duplicate my rectangle.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.110
I'm gonna put it here right below my mask layer,

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.800
and then I can create my mask easily.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.220
And now,

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.950
as you can see,

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.250
I have a mass group.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.600
So if I want to put these rectangle,

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.460
which is my drop shadow into this group,

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.350
I need to make sure that I place it right below my mask layer here.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.680
Because if I put it above that,

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.480
this mask layer will applying to this rectangle as well.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.030
All right,

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.440
guys,

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.590
Thank you so much for watching this video.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.810
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.890
And I will see you in the next video.
