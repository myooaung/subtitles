Hi,

00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.180
everyone.

00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:05.660
Welcome back to another section of thes course in these section.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:11.760
We're gonna be talking about you elements which are so important when you're designing a

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.160
user interface.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.000
In the next years of videos,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.720
we're going to talk about tax bills,

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:18.620
bottoms,

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:19.850
sliders,

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:20.750
cards,

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.110
dialogues or even steppers and charts.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.600
So if you're confused about all those elements,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.730
I suggest you watching this section.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.400
