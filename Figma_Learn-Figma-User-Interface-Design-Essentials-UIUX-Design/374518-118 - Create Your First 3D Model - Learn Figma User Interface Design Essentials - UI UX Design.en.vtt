00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.270
Hi,

00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:00.850
everyone.

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.940
When come back to another video of these course in these video,

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.670
we're going to start working with rectory.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.690
So without further ado,

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.100
let's get a started.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.110
First of all,

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.240
let's go ahead and click and start creating.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.590
Then here you can create new project.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:18.660
Or instead of that,

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.650
you can use some pre made projects.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.650
So I'm gonna go ahead and click on this project our right.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:25.820
As you can see here,

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.920
we have a three D environment with three dimensions.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:30.810
There we go.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:31.480
So far,

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.480
we were working on a toothy environment.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.030
However,

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.850
now we're going to dive into a three D environment That's so interesting.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:40.160
So,

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.050
first of all,

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.260
let me explain to you some basics.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.490
If you want to move around these canvas,

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:46.130
okay,

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.230
you can easily hold space on your keyboard and move around.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.490
If you're gonna zoom in or zoom out,

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:57.680
you can scroll like this and you can also pan around.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.560
We left click on your mouse.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.410
Rectory is a quite complex application,

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.190
so we're not going to cover all the tools.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.940
However,

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.670
I'm going to teach you the requirements in order to let you know how you can use this great

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:13.380
application.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.690
Right at the top.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.070
We have some moments.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.720
As you can see,

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.380
we have object edit mode,

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.700
library and comments in object.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.830
We have different options as well.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.710
Here we have primitives,

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:27.470
as you conceive,

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:28.510
have bikes,

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:29.130
fear,

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.690
cylinder tube,

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:31.560
etcetera.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.910
You can easily click and banks here and there we go.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.170
You have your bunks,

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.870
so let's zoom out.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.460
Pretty awesome.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.500
And on your right,

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.400
you can modify some variables such as position,

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.260
rotation,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.030
scan size and even material like this.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.230
Pretty awesome,

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.910
isn't it?

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.060
Behalf segments as well,

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.750
So I'm gonna make it 10 for now.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.450
As you can see here we have a gizmo.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:00.950
It's some arrows,

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.310
some cubes and some arts.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.950
Okay,

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.030
This gizmo lets you rotate scale and move your object.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.560
Okay?

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.430
So if you want to move your object,

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:19.110
you can use these arrows like this in any direction you want.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.750
If you want to scare your object,

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.080
we can use thes cubes.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.770
As you conceive.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.370
We have two different cubes.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.110
The outer cube lets you scale your object in one direction like this.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.400
And the inner cube lets you scale your object proportionally.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.050
If you wanna rotate your object,

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.960
you can use thes arcs.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.170
Fantastic.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.560
So now I'm going to remove this object.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.630
The other thing you can use is text.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:47.210
Okay,

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.430
so whenever you click on this three D tanks,

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.500
you can see that victory automatically creates a new tax year for you.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.430
And if you want to change these tanks,

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.450
that can easily head over to a three D tax section.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.650
And let's change this to you.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.920
I ux design pretty awesome,

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.080
and I can move.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.540
It's easily here.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.160
I can change the depth perfect.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.790
And also I can change the material.

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.990
Or,

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.160
let's say the color in this case pretty awesome,

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.810
and you can also change the funds.

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.440
So let's look for months aretz there ago.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.780
You can change the weight as well,

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.950
the characters pacing and the line spacing.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.500
When you're working with a three D object,

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.470
you need to render its OK.

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.440
So here at the top can see the reason grander toggle.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.760
And if you hover your mouse on top of that,

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.050
you can see that there are three different options,

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.940
low quality,

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.010
medium quality and high quality.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.370
So I'm gonna go with medium quality.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:53.610
There we go.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.340
It has been rendered perfectly,

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.920
of course,

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.460
There are some watermarks in free version.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:59.820
If you want to remove them,

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.530
you can use the premium license off victory.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.300
So now let's stop rendering our text.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.690
Alright,

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.970
guys,

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.730
that's all for these video.

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.980
Thank you so much for watching this video.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.150
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.340
And in the next video,

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.580
we'll talk about the camera and lighting.

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:17.650
So see you then.
