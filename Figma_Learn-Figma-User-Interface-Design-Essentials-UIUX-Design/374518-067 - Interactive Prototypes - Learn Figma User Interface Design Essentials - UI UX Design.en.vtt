00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.320
Hi,

00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:00.880
everyone.

00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:01.930
In these video,

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:05.270
we're gonna be talking about interactive prototype.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:06.300
Nowadays,

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.870
prototyping is playing an increasingly vital role in the design process.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:12.460
So you,

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.070
as a young UX designer,

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.770
need to know how to make a high fidelity prototype of your project in a way that it can

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.580
clearly convey the message of your design and also the exact interaction you want to

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.250
achieve.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.580
Not only can prototyping help you as a designer to show off your work,

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:36.410
but also it can help developers to know how your designs should be converted to code.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.850
Here are some useful tools you can use for interactive prototyping sketch.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.340
It can be used for simple interactive prototyping.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:52.340
InVision studio It can be used for modern and complicated interactive prototyping principle

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.340
.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.740
It can be used for modern and detail,

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:55.390
interactive,

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.410
prototyping and so much more.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:58.080
For instance,

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.360
you can use proto pie as well for advanced prototyping
