00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.360
Hi,

00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.000
everyone,

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.020
and welcome back to another section of these course in these section.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.520
We're going to talk about three D modeling.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.890
You may be wondering that how three d modeling is going to help you in your career as a

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:14.210
Yuan UX designer.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.500
So let me explain it to you in a simple term.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.540
For you as a yuan UX designer is good to know a little bit about three D modeling because

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.880
sometimes you want to design a creative landing page or,

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:27.370
let's say,

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:33.790
a scream for an application that needs some simple shapes or even some three D contexts.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.560
So in the section,

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.940
I'm gonna teach you how you can use thes techniques in order to create amazing self for

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:41.620
your design.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.650
So you may be familiar with traditional three D modeling software's,

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.500
such as Cinema four D three D's Max etcetera.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.300
However,

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.710
working with these traditional software's could be quite dunning for the beginners.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.390
So instead of working with those Softwares,

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.860
I'm going to show you another great environment.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.560
There is a Web application,

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.090
which is called Victory.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:11.630
It's an amazing and brand new Web application that can help you to create amazing three D

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.000
stomp in a quick and easy way.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.830

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.810
I'm gonna teach you how you could use victory to get the best results possible.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.750

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:25.640

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.250
this is the landing page.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.760
There we go.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.490
We can see these features.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:31.610
And the good news is,

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.500

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.340

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:42.860
And you can put the coat on your website or you can even preview it as an augmented reality

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:43.470
