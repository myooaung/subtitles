00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.410
Hi,

00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:01.010
everyone.

00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:02.170
In this video,

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:04.690
we're gonna be talking about dialogues.

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:09.640
Dialogues inform users about critical information or even tasks.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:15.410
They also ask users to make a decision or choose between different options.

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:16.410
For example,

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.280
dialogues can be used for asking for permission or even choosing from a range of different

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.670
variables on a Snyder and so much more When you're designing dialogues,

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.420
make sure to pay attention to the following things.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.730
Number one hierarchy,

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.700
a dialogue has the highest hierarchy,

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:43.930
and it blacks the APP usage until the user tanks a dialect action number two visibility die

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.370
unlike must be recognizable easily.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.980
So I recommend adding a dark overlay to the view and putting the dialogue on top off That's

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:52.870
number three.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:59.060
Straightforward dialogue should convey the message in an understandable and clear way.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.780
And lastly bottoms,

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.300
I recommend using side by side buttons on a dialogue,

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.050
as you can see in the picture
