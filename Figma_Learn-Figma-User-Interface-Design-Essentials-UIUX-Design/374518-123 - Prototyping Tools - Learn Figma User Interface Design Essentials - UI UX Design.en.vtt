00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.450
Hi,

00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.080
everyone,

00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.200
welcome back to another section off.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.160
He scores in these section.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.960
We're going to talk about prototyping,

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.550
but first things first.

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:14.790
I'm going to introduce you to some of the best tools for prototyping your projects.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.070
As a matter of fact,

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.080
you can use feet MMA for creating a prototype.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.950
However,

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.190
if you want to make a fancy and complex prototype,

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.950
I recommend that you use other websites and applications well,

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.070
whether the best prototyping tools Number one prototype I,

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.090
which is my favorite application as well because it's so easy to work with.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:43.160
And there is a trial version and you can try it out before purchasing any license number

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:51.080
two Zeppelin number three Framer X and then envision studio Fatemeh and Maro.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.590
So in the next video,

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.040
we'll start prototyping one off our previous projects in Fig MMA.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.180
So see that
