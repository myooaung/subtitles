00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.430
Hi,

00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:01.010
everyone.

00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.430
Welcome back to another video of these course in these video we're gonna be talking about

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:08.490
via framing in fig MMA.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.220
As I mentioned before in previous videos,

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.880
creating a low fidelity wire frame is an important task for a U.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:16.950
N UX designer.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.770
So in the CDO,

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:24.170
I'm going to show you how you can create your own wire frame using the pre made wire frame

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.490
You like it by figure.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.170
.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.590
So first of all,

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:35.500
I'm gonna ask you to open up this your ill Fatemeh dot com slash templates slash wire frame

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.990
dash Keats.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.660
Okay.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.950
And on these page you can find thes wire frame kids that has been designed by feet,

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:43.440
Mom.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.650
And if you scroll down a little bit,

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.690
you can get a free copy of that.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:48.940
So click on that,

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.380
and then you will see something like this.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.870
Okay,

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.150
this is a pre made when your friend you want kids,

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.260
which has been designed by fig MMA,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.480
and I'm gonna show you how you can use this.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:58.790
So,

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:59.450
first of all,

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:00.160
as you can see,

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.220
you have three different pages.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.320
Start build your own an example.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.680
So,

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.810
in start page,

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.590
if I zoom in a little bit.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.100
You can see that you have some information about all those components.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.110
For example,

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.970
we have buttons and cards.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.050
We have navigation.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.680
We have here a sections.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.550
We have social proof.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.450
We have features left features,

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:26.440
right,

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.490
etcetera.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:28.070
OK,

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.320
then we have feel your own and examples.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.210
So let's open appeal your own.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.980
And here you have a frame.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:40.260
I'm gonna delete this component and suppose that we're going to create avoiding a frame for

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.030
a website.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.530
Okay,

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.120
so first of all,

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.700
we need a hero section,

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.000
so I can easily go to assets.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.570
And here I have plenty of components.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:50.240
Okay.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.870
I have hero.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:52.680
I have food,

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.940
her features.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:54.560
Right.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.500
Feature left ct a etcetera.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.240
Let's start with here.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.580
Oh,

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.120
and here I have three different options.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.400
I'm going to start with the 1st 1 that's drag and drop it here.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.760
I'm gonna put it here and aligning to the center.

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:11.760
Perfect.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.650
As you can see,

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.000
it's the hero center,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.880
so I can easily go to the incense section off the inspector.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.570
I can open up this drop menu and from here I can change it to whatever I want.

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:24.840
For instance,

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.090
I can change it to hero side image.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.650
Right?

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:29.580
Like this.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.130
I prefer this one because I haven't image as well.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.050
So let's stay with this one.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.690
Then.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.110
I'm gonna increase the high size off my friend.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.660
So let's increase it a little bit toe.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.540
Have more space to work with.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.260
Perfect.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.270
After that,

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.400
I'm gonna add some features.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.980
So let's open up features,

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:50.720
right?

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.730
Pretty good.

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.710
And I'm gonna use this month Fantastic,

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.370
because it's a low fidelity wire frame.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.530
You don't need to worry about all these information,

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.240
all these colors,

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.340
so keep it as simple as possible.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.050
Then I'm gonna add some posts.

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.200
So let's open up the post section.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.000
And from here,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.900
I can use post tail like this off course.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.780
You can edit thes takes and all these contents if you want.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:19.680
And after that,

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.320
I'm gonna have some social proof such as testimonial that to use this one,

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.490
it looks great.

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:26.590
And after that,

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.590
I need to have a CD A So let's open up CT A.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.780
And I'm going to choose ct a center pretty good.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.550
I need to increase the height of my frame.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.230
So let me select it are right.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.480
And last but not least I'm gonna add a food her because it's necessary to have one.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.210
So let's use this food or fool fantastic.

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:50.070
And that's all.

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.430
So,

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.240
as you can see,

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.250
I didn't add any navigation,

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.260
but it's necessary to have one.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.780
So let's go and add one navigation.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.860
I think this navigation right is a great option like this.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:02.860
Fantastic.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.060
Now I need to decrease my height size,

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.540
and that's all.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.700
So now if I preview it,

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.340
you can see that I have the navigation.

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.030
As you can see,

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.260
I have a logo,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.030
some menus at the top,

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.320
and I have a registration button.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.650
And here I have my hero section,

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:26.300
which consists of some techs and a CD A and also an image.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.380
Then I have my key feature like this.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:30.120
And after that,

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.270
I present some posts and then I have the social proof.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.450
It could be reviews,

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:36.570
testimonials,

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:37.110
anything.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.950
And then I have another c t a here,

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.970
which is my last city A.

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.250
And after that,

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.700
we added a footer,

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:45.380
okay,

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.820
And here I have all the lings related to my website.

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:50.220
All right,

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.540
guys,

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.860
did you see how easy teas to create your own wire frame?

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:54.270
in Fig.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.330
MMA are right.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.010
That's all for this video.

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.280
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.480
And I will see you in the next video.

So see you there.
