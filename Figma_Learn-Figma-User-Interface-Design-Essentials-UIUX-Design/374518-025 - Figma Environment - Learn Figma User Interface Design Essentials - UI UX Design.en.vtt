00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.310
Hi,

00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:00.910
everyone.

00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:04.680
And welcome back to another video off these course in this video,

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.350
we're gonna be talking about the environment off fig MMA.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:08.830
So,

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.230
as you can see right now,

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.550
I'm using fig ma on my browser.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:13.510
However,

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.560
I'm gonna go ahead and open up the desktop version.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.150
Inertia,

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.270
accelerate my design process.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.470
So let me open up the fig.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.130
My up.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.020
There we go.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:23.490
All right.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.300
This is my primary count,

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.390
as you can see.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.260
And this is the desk,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.270
a version that we can use easily.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:30.150
So first of all,

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.690
let's go ahead and create a new file are right.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:34.800
And here,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.850
as you can see,

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.210
we can divide the fig HMAS environment into four different sections.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.480
The toolbar which is right at the top.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:50.230
And it consists off all the necessary tools that you need for designing a world class user

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.080
interface.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.760
As you can see,

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.390
here you have a menu,

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.950
and here you have some sub menus such as file edit,

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.070
view,

00:00:59.070 --> 00:00:59.950
object,

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.190
vector text.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.380
Arrange etcetera will cover all of those options.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.670
During this course.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.050
Here you have some tools,

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.230
such as move tools,

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:16.960
scale and also the frame to the frame and slice to.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.610
Then you have the objects or shapes toe and also the pan tool.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.980
And we have the text and comments right on your left.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.470
We have the layers,

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:28.150
pain,

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.600
at least all of your layers and also all of your assets,

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.620
respectively.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:34.680
As you can see,

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.140
there is no component here yet because we didn't create any components so far.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.770
However,

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.150
in the future lessons,

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.500
you will learn how to use these sections as well.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.780
Then on your right,

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.490
we have the inspector,

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.410
which consists off three different parts.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:52.140
As you can see,

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.720
we have design,

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.810
prototype and coat.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:56.470
Okay,

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.730
So if I click on A on my keyboard,

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.420
I can create an art board for starting my design process.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.640
For instance,

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.450
I can choose phone,

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.790
and here I'm going to choose iPhone 11 pro or X,

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:11.400
as it can see.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.400
You have the dimension right over there.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.040
I'm going to click on that.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.830
And here you have your our sport and you can see the name on the layers least.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.400
And if you double click on that,

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.260
you can change it to whatever you want.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.480
For instance,

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.160
let's say home pretty good.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.600
And I can easily choose direct angle shape and there we go.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.710
We have another layer right under this art board.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:39.350
Okay?

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:40.090
And here,

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.870
on your right side in the inspector section,

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.200
you have different options.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.890
For instance,

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.790
in the design section you have alignments,

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.450
you have a dimension,

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.740
and also the location,

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.810
the positioning of your shape.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.050
You have also the constraints section,

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.960
and we will dive into each section separately in the next series of videos.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:06.850
So don't worry if you don't understand what the constraints are or basically what they do.

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:07.760
For example,

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.210
here we have layer and you can adjust capacity of your layer and it's mode.

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.660
And here you have feel for changing the color.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:17.830
As you can see,

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.230
we have stroke.

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.130
We have effects for adding some shadows,

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.400
and then we have the export for prototyping.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.760
You can go to prototype section,

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.280
and here we have different options as well that we will cover in the prototyping section of

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.160
these course.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.870
You have also the code section,

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.730
and it's so useful if you're a developer or you want to hand over the properties off your

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:48.480
design to your Web developer or even your application developer because you can easily

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.960
export your properties in code,

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:51.510
for example.

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.650
For on us we have variable and different properties.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:56.820
That's pretty cool.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.380
And last but not least,

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.260
the fourth section is the canvas which is in the middle off fig MMA.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.250
And here you will place all your designs and all your art ports.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:14.120
You have also the share option right over there that you can share your file or components

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.650
with your team members.

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.410
Or even you can send it to your clients for reviewing the project.

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:21.840
Etcetera are right,

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:22.280
guys.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.620
Thank you so much for watching this video.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.180
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.650
And I will see you in the next video.
