00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.400
Hello,

00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.010
everyone.

00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:03.580
I hope you're doing well in these video.

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.900
We're gonna be talking about the newest feature off Fig MMA,

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.410
which is called Auto Layout.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.860
The auto layout feature has been added to figure recently,

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.060
and it's a super powerful feature.

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:20.950
And I'm gonna show you how you could use that in order to accelerate your design process

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.690
and make your life much,

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:23.490
much easier.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.880
So without for I do,

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:25.920
let's get a start.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:26.610
First of all,

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.890
I'm gonna go ahead and create a button.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.250
So to do that,

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.070
I'm going to need a rectangle.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.800
So let's create one.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.910
There we go.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.950
I'm gonna set there with 2 300 the high to 70.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:40.590
Nice.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.300
Then let's increase the corner radius 2 16 And as you can see now,

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.260
those little circles do not appear here because I'm far away from the Spartan.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.040
However,

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.770
if I zoom a little bit thes circles would appear are right.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.870
Now let's change the color toe light purple like this.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:00.750
Nice.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.060
Then we need the text,

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.790
obviously.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.550
So I'm going to write liking and let's change the color to white,

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:15.140
and I'm gonna increase the font size to 24 pretty good that select both layers and align

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.910
them both horizontally and vertically.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:18.670
Pretty good.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.080
I'm gonna make it a little bit smaller.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.480
Now it's better.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.150
So let's group them and call it looking pretty good and everything is fine now.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:34.460
But suppose that you create this button you designed to duplicate that and change the tanks

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.700
or something else for incense.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.450
You want to change it to get started.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.990
And can you see that?

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.390
What's the problem here?

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.760
So our buttons are not responsive,

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.620
and previously we needed to constantly Czar Buttons separately like this.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.020
We needed to resize them manually and again.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.670
We had to align them like this.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.520
However,

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.240
now,

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.130
with the help of photo layout,

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.570
everything will be done in a second.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.150
So let me show you how you could do that.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.800
First of all,

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.610
I'm going to duplicate this lugging button once again.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.000
There we go and,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.660
as you can see in the Inspector and new section has been added,

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.350
which is called totally out.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.200
And you can either click on this plus button to add photo layout to your button.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.420
Or you could hold shift any and that's all.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.560
Alternatively,

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.950
you could right click here and choose Adauto layout.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.050
All work the same.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.010
So as you can see,

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.870
nothing has been changed here.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.060
But if you trying to change these tanks to,

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.600
for instance get started,

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.680
you can see that What's the difference here now are button is responsive.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.710
That's super cool.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.630
And it can also customize the horizontal padding,

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.460
the vertical padding and the spacing between items.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.070
However,

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.730
because we have only one item here,

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.540
we can't use thesis section.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.430
You can change the mode from presentable to vertical,

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.250
but you can see the difference here.

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.840
However,

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.370
if you're trying to create,

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.650
at least you can use vertical and we have different options as well for the height.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.320
So as you can see here we have photo height.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.040
So if I try to add some lines like this,

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.490
the height size will automatically increase.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.890
Okay,

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.750
but if I try to change it to fix height and then I add some lines,

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.810
you can see that it's not responsive anymore,

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.120
so you can easily customize the options that you have here.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.820
This is the horizontal padding.

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.890
You can change it easily like this.

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.420
If you're familiar with CSS,

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.540
it works exactly the same,

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.770
and also the vertical padding.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:41.630
That is pretty,

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:42.590
pretty awesome.

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.520
Now let's try something else.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:51.740
Let's create another rectangle here and I'm gonna set it to 450 by 80.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:52.530
Nice.

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:59.610
Let's increase the corner radius to 24 change the color to this light purple.

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:00.210
Okay,

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:07.310
let's suppose that this is our tap are and we're going to add some icons or just simple

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.020
shapes.

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.680
So I'm going to create a rectangle like this,

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:18.080
and it's going to be 45 by fortifying Let's change its collar toe white.

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.080
Pretty awesome.

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:23.330
I'm gonna zoom in a little bit and then I'm going to create another shape,

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.150
such as a circle,

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.050
and I'm going to set it to 45 my 45 as well.

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.250
Let's change the color toe white,

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.500
and lastly,

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.910
I'm going to duplicate thes square and increase the corner radius like this,

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.150
and I'm going to rotate it by 45 degrees.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.700
Okay,

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:48.300
then let's elect all our shapes and click on distribute or resentful spacing to get the

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.740
same spacing between our shapes,

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.850
and I'm going to set it to 91.

00:04:53.850 --> 00:05:00.740
Then that's group them and select our tap bar and aligning to the center both horizontally

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:01.750
and vertically.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:02.410
However,

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:07.100
you need to remember because we're going to make thes shaves responsive.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.270
We need to group them after alignments.

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.530
So I'm going to write critic here on group them and select the tap our which is our

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.550
background here like this.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.950
And one second group them and I'm gonna call it tap bar.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:22.180
Okay,

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:27.920
then let's press shift A in order to add or the layout to this group and everything is done

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.920
.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.600
So how can we check it out?

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.800
The easiest way is to try to remove one of these shapes.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.610
So I'm going to remove the circle and there we go.

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.710
Our tapper is responsive now.

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.250
You could even add more objects and the size would automatically change.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:44.870
So I'm going to duplicate it.

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.350
And as you can see,

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.320
it's perfectly working.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.640
That's pretty awesome.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.270
You could also change their place easily like this.

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:54.790
That is fantastic.

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:59.870
Are right now we're going to create a more complex or the layout group.

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:00.730
So what do you think?

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:03.090
If we could create a responsive car,

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:04.180
that would be nice.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:09.200
So let's go ahead and create a new rectangle right here,

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.020
and I'm gonna increase the radius to 40.

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:18.570
And let's change the dimensions to 300 by 400 Nice.

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:23.200
And I'm going to change the color to White and its ad stroke to it.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:28.440
We'd the same light purple that we have here and then I'm gonna add some details.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:28.880
Street.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.880
Suppose that we're going to have a profile image.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.800
So we need a circle here.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:39.970
Let's set it to 70 by 70 and I'm going to change the color to this purple pretty good.

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:40.740
And as you can see,

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.190
the top padding is said to 30.

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:46.280
Let's set the left petting to 30 as well.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.400
Then I'm gonna add some texts.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.260
So I need to have name.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:52.850
That's make it smaller.

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.150
I think 18 points would be nice.

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:58.310
I'm going to change the color to this purple as well.

00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:59.410
Duplicate that.

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:02.500
And here I'm going to write surname pretty good.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.060
And the left padding is going to be 16 pixels like this.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.050
Then I'm gonna add another tanks.

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:09.820
Which is the description,

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:10.900
for instance.

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:11.850
That's right.

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:12.920
Hello,

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:13.680
everyone.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:16.380
In these video,

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:28.330
we are talking about photo layout in Fig McKay and I think it's better to make it a fixed

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:35.700
size text layer like this and I'm going to change the ultra high to 24 pretty awesome.

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:38.600
And let's make this card a little bit smaller.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:39.290
For now,

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:41.410
the top padding is going to be 30.

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:47.130
So we need to have 32 the top for the steaks and 32 the bottom.

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:47.290
So,

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:47.900
as you can see,

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:53.840
I have 27 I need to add three more so I can go to height.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.650
And here I'm going to write.

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:57.150
Plus three.

00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:57.870
There we go.

00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:59.650
Let's make it larger,

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:00.450
a little bit.

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:01.510
Fantastic.

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:01.930
Now,

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:04.440
how can we make this card responsive?

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:08.770
We need to use an undertaking here because if we just group them,

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:14.140
let me show you and press shift and a it's not gonna work and everything is going to be

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:15.100
disorganized.

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.460
So we need to use another way.

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:18.510
In these case,

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:22.070
we need to have two different groups with all the layout.

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:27.280
So first we need to create a horizontal or the layout for this profile image place,

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.500
holer and these two texts.

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:32.730
So I'm going to select them and group them.

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:34.000
Let's name it,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:34.950
user.

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:35.480
And now,

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.240
as you can see,

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:40.160
we have two objects here that air placed vertically.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:47.720
So if I select my rectangle and also this user and this text and group them and call it

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:51.610
card now I can add totally out perfectly.

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:54.740
So I'm going to press shift and a And as you can see,

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:57.350
I just created everything color photo layout,

00:08:57.350 --> 00:09:01.350
but we need to create a horizontal photo layout for our user as well.

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:07.340
So now we need to group this name and surname as well in order to use a horizontal auto

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:09.620
layout for these two objects as well.

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:14.750
So now I'm going to choose the user group and press shift in a And as you can see,

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:17.490
we just created a horizontal auto layout.

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:18.080
Okay,

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:24.090
then I'm going to select my main card and press shift and a once again.

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:25.250
And as you can see,

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:27.970
I just created a vertical totally out.

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:29.450
So I'm gonna open it up,

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:34.310
and I'm going to set the alignment of user to the left and everything is done.

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:36.200
So let's give it a try.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.900
I'm gonna extend this text a little bit to see what's gonna happen.

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:46.610
Let's see whether it works or not.

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:47.830
And yes,

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:48.640
as you can see,

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:49.820
it works perfectly.

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:50.770
So that's right.

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:51.590
Yes,

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:54.920
it works perfectly.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.430
That's pretty cool.

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:58.900
So if you just trying to add some lines,

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:02.710
you can see that it increases the height size automatically.

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:05.050
But what about for the so the layout group?

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:13.650
So if I try to change the name to something else like Mike and the surname to I don't know

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:13.650
,

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:14.450
White.

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:15.760
As you can see,

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:18.570
nothing happens because it's not that lying.

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:21.990
So I'm gonna add some random characters here.

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:22.740
And as you can see,

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:23.550
it works.

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:24.500
However,

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:27.110
my description text moves along,

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:29.020
so I need to fix that issue.

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:30.430
In order to fix that,

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:31.650
I'm going to select it.

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:32.900
And as you can see,

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.280
it has been aligned to the center.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.600
So I'm gonna align it to the left.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.510
And now everything is great.

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:42.670
So let's try something here.

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:44.250
I'm going to copy and paste it.

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:45.450
There we go.

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:46.650
It works perfectly.

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:47.810
All right,

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:48.170
guys,

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:50.350
Thank you so much for watching this video.

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:51.710
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:53.750
