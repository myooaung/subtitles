00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.340
Hi,

00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.050
everyone.

00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.930
Welcome back to another video of these scores in this video.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.610
We're gonna be talking about the stroke section.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:09.310
So first of all,

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:11.350
let me create a new shape.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:17.780
This time I'm going to choose a circle like this and right under the field section that we

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.080
have talked about in the previous video.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.200
We have the stroke section.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.840
I'm going to click on this last button in order to add a stroke to my shape.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.040
And here we have different properties,

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.590
such as color again.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.650
You have all those options like in the field.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:40.420
You have the thickness of your stroke that you can change here and you have the positioning

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.410
property here as well that you can change it from inside to send her and toe outside.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.120
So basically,

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.150
it means that this stroke applies to the outside of your shape.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.260
And this one,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.290
it means that this stroke applies to the inside of your shape.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.630
And here you have the advanced option,

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.450
and we already talked about it.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:01.920
You have round,

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.410
square line arrow and triangle arrow.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:07.210
However,

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:13.210
it doesn't work here because we need to have a line or a path in order to use these options

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.210
.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.380
You could also make it dash.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.170
For example.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.380
I can write two comma five like this.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.130
Or let's say 10.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.910
I can easily change it here.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:24.650
40.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:25.680
That's pretty cool.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.290
And of course,

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.440
you can Hyatt or remove it.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.900
All right,

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:29.330
guys,

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.610
thank you so much for watching this video,

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.750
and I will see you in the next video.
