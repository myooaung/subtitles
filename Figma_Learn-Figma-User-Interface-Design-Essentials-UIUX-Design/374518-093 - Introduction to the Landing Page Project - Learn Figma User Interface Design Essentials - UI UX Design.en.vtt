00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.900
Hey everyone, welcome back to another section of the scores.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:09.150
In this section, we're going to start designing and modern and beautiful landing page,

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.750
or fictional mobile application called draft.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.860
So we will first start with creating our design system together,

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.860
we will create our textiles are colors,

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.280
styles, and then we will move on to wireframing process.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.315
Okay, so we will create a low fidelity wireframe.

00:00:27.315 --> 00:00:33.345
We'd all the necessary sections such as hero section, features section,

00:00:33.345 --> 00:00:36.410
and then we will have membership plans,

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.365
as you can see, and Q and a section,

00:00:39.365 --> 00:00:41.135
and finally, the footer.

00:00:41.135 --> 00:00:44.990
And after that, we will start designing our landing page together,

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:49.970
we will design the hero section and then reveal designed a credit card section.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:57.050
The Statistics section supports section membership plans and so on.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.610
And last but not least,

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:04.445
we will make our design interactive by adding interactions through our elements.

00:01:04.445 --> 00:01:08.585
So we will create a high fidelity prototype for our landing page.

00:01:08.585 --> 00:01:11.615
As you can see, we have different animations.

00:01:11.615 --> 00:01:16.295
For example, here we have a cool transition for these credit card.

00:01:16.295 --> 00:01:20.180
Then we'll have this accordion effect like this.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.680
The card will expand and you will learn all these cool techniques.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.200
Are you ready to start designing your website?

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.700
I'll see you in the next video.
