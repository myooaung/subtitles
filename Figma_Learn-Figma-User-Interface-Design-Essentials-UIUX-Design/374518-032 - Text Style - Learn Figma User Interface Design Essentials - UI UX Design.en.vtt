00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.370
Hello,

00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:00.970
everyone.

00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:02.280
I hope you're doing well.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.500
And welcome back to another video of these course in these video,

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.050
we're gonna be talking about textiles.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:09.530
Actually,

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:16.660
styles allow you to specify a set of properties in order to reuse them across your projects

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:16.660
,

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.190
and you could also share them with your team.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:20.470
So in this video,

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.800
we're going to dive into textiles,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.730
and I'm gonna show you how important it is to create your textile when you're designing a

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:29.830
user interface.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:35.260
Suppose that you're designing a very complicated project which consists off 50 or more

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.010
screens.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.870
In this case,

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.570
you're using a specific fund,

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.080
and after a while you suddenly decide to change,

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.890
for instance,

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.410
the fund of your header or even the fund size or the weight.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.740
So wouldn't it be nice that you could make those changes once and the changes would

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.010
applying toe all your tanks at the same time?

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.150
That's fantastic.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.410
This is what textiles do.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.930
So now,

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.160
without further I do.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.360
Let's get it started with inserting a new tanks.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.380
I'm gonna add,

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:06.290
for instance,

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.930
header one and I'm gonna make it bold.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:10.500
Actually,

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.490
when you're designing a website,

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.510
we have six different types of headers from H one to age six in HTML.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.660
You don't need to know every detail about it.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:21.340
However,

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:28.170
it's good to be familiar with some terms in some rules of HTML or CSS are.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.920
Right now it's our header Juan,

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.360
and I'm going to set the size too 80 like this.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.710
And then I'm going to create my first textile.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.800
How can I do that?

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.720
It's so easy.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.460
Do you see these four dance?

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.790
I'm going to click on that.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.180
And here there is a plus icon,

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.050
which lets me create a new textile,

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.230
and I'm going to write H one.

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:51.740
Then that's duplicated.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.690
That's right,

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.910
age to hear our right.

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:55.520
And here,

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.440
as you can see,

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.610
it uses the previous textile that we just defined for Heather one.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.020
So first of all,

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.780
we need to detach it from its style.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:06.630
OK,

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.350
and then I'm gonna set it to 60 pretty good,

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.660
and I'm going to create another textile and let's call it H two.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.190
That's duplicate that once again,

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.950
detach it from its textile and let's set it to 30.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.720
I'm going to write Header three that's create a new textile as well,

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:35.000
age three and that's all So now how can we apply our textiles to our takes layers?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.410
So lets me create a new text.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.650
I'm going to write promotions,

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.240
Okay.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.230
And as you can see,

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.010
it automatically uses H three.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.780
You can easily change that by clicking and these menu,

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.330
and I'm gonna set it to age to There we go.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.660
And if I go to my text on here and there too,

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.180
and I make some changes,

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.380
those changes will applying to these promotions tanks as well.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.850
So let's give it a try.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.290
Let's go to H two.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.410
And here you have edit style.

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.190
I'm going to click on that and,

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.890
for instance,

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.230
I'm gonna make it regular.

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.080
There we go.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.690
Did you see how amazing it is to use textiles?

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.410
You can also change the font size,

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:17.000
for instance.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.900
I'm gonna set it to 40 and that's done.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:20.650
However,

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.560
keep in mind that if you change the text color,

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.830
it doesn't apply to the instance off that text time.

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:28.750
So if I,

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:29.690
for instance,

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.450
change the color off this header to,

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:33.520
for example,

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.500
to this color,

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.240
as you can see,

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:40.180
nothing happens because for that we need to create a color sile,

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.170
which we will cover in the futures lessons are right.

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.530
Now.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:50.480
Let me duplicate these promotions and then we can try H three as well are right,

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.900
guys.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.580
That's all for these video.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:53.800
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.970
And I will see you in the next video.
