00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.370
Hey, there, in this video,

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.985
we're going to start creating our color styles together.

00:00:05.985 --> 00:00:09.000
So without further ado, let's get started.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.695
Now let me enlarge these design guide art board like this.

00:00:13.695 --> 00:00:17.820
And finally, I'm going to select all these layers and group

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.575
them by pressing Command Z or Control G on my keyboard.

00:00:22.575 --> 00:00:25.170
Now let me call it topography.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.405
Okay, then I'm going to create another rectangle or I could just duplicate it.

00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:32.200
But let me show you something.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.760
I'm going to drag and drop something like this.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.030
As a matter of fact, I am going to apply the same effects

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.355
and the same style that are used for these rectangles.

00:00:41.355 --> 00:00:41.795
Okay?

00:00:41.795 --> 00:00:44.870
If you hold down the Command key or control

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.320
key on your keyboard and click on this rectangle,

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.415
it will be selected.

00:00:49.415 --> 00:00:54.035
Alternatively, you can head over to the layers list and choose it manually.

00:00:54.035 --> 00:00:56.510
Okay, now I am going to right-click on that.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.794
And at the bottom I'm gonna go to Copy and Paste.

00:00:59.794 --> 00:01:02.900
And from here I'm going to copy the properties.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.575
Then I'm going to select this rectangle that I just created.

00:01:06.575 --> 00:01:08.390
And I'm going to right-click on that,

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.015
go to copy and paste and paste properties.

00:01:11.015 --> 00:01:12.170
And there we go.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.830
We've got the same styling for these rectangular as well.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.575
Alright, this rectangle is for our colors.

00:01:18.575 --> 00:01:21.740
So I'm going to enlarge it like this,

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.394
predict good, and let me create a square.

00:01:24.394 --> 00:01:28.370
I'm going to hold down the Shift key, drag-and-drop like this.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.900
Let's set the width and height to 250 by 250.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.525
And finally, let's increase the corner radius amount to 30 predicted.

00:01:38.525 --> 00:01:40.220
Alright, for this project,

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.150
I'm gonna create six different colors styles, okay?

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.320
Alright, so the first color is going to be our primary color.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.755
Okay?

00:01:48.755 --> 00:01:54.995
The color code is 55 for double D and E. Pretty good.

00:01:54.995 --> 00:01:58.100
This purple is going to be our primary color, okay?

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.835
Like textiles, in order to create a color style,

00:02:01.835 --> 00:02:05.030
you can easily head over to the field section and click

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.570
on the style icon and click on this plus icon.

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.705
Here I'm going to write primary.

00:02:11.705 --> 00:02:15.215
There we go. We've just created our first color slide.

00:02:15.215 --> 00:02:20.345
Then I'm going to hit command D or control the on my keyboard moving to the right side.

00:02:20.345 --> 00:02:23.314
And I'm going to detach it from its Seil.

00:02:23.314 --> 00:02:23.960
Okay?

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.365
And then I'm gonna set the color code two,

00:02:27.365 --> 00:02:31.160
f double for E, double seven predicted.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.680
This one is going to be our accent color, okay?

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.910
And we're going to use it,

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.075
for example, call-to-action buttons.

00:02:38.075 --> 00:02:42.155
Or when we want to highlight a specific part of the tags,

00:02:42.155 --> 00:02:43.790
we will use the scholar.

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.280
Ok, now let me create a colours cyan and I am going to write accent.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.510
Fantastic.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.190
Once again duplicated.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.554
I'm gonna move it down.

00:02:53.554 --> 00:03:02.450
I am going to detach it from its style and let me change the color code to 6A 69 e k.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.419
It's going to be our lights secondary.

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:06.110
Okay.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.395
But I'm going to call it secondary light.

00:03:09.395 --> 00:03:13.490
So let me write secondary slash light,

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.130
OK, because we're going to have a dark one as well.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.405
I'm gonna duplicate it,

00:03:17.405 --> 00:03:18.815
will be to the right side,

00:03:18.815 --> 00:03:20.464
detach it from its Stein,

00:03:20.464 --> 00:03:27.950
and let me change the color code to 16194 and f.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.469
Okay, let me create a color style,

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:34.235
secondary slash, dark, fantastic.

00:03:34.235 --> 00:03:35.855
We need to create two more.

00:03:35.855 --> 00:03:38.195
I'm gonna duplicate it, move it up.

00:03:38.195 --> 00:03:40.505
And this one is going to be our neutral color.

00:03:40.505 --> 00:03:43.100
And we will use it, for example, for our background.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:49.220
Okay, I'm going to detach it from its style and let me change the color code to F2,

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.250
F6, and WWF. Pretty good.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.169
It's a light blue color.

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:58.040
It's the same color that we used for our background here.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.175
Okay, and I'm going to create a color style,

00:04:01.175 --> 00:04:03.935
let me call it neutral, Fantastic.

00:04:03.935 --> 00:04:05.405
And last but not least,

00:04:05.405 --> 00:04:09.530
we're going to create a color style for our stroke.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.780
So I'm gonna duplicate it moving down,

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.540
let me detach it from its style,

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.600
remove the feel and add a stroke to it.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.040
I'm going to set the stroke to,

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.550
to the thickness doesn't matter now because later on we

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.450
can modify it when we applied this style to our shapes.

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.835
But what matters is the color.

00:04:28.835 --> 00:04:32.780
Ok, so I'm gonna set the color code to CAA,

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.215
D6 and f x1 predicted.

00:04:36.215 --> 00:04:38.540
Let me zoom in that you can see it.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:39.680
Fantastic.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.880
Now let me select it and add a color style.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.040
I'm going to write stroke.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:51.995
Alright, I'm gonna make this rectangle and legal width smaller pain like this.

00:04:51.995 --> 00:04:55.130
And let me select all of these shapes,

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:59.735
group them and hold down the Shift key and select this rectangle.

00:04:59.735 --> 00:05:02.915
And finally, in the inspector at the top,

00:05:02.915 --> 00:05:05.870
you can align them both horizontally and vertically.

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.140
Okay, what do we want to add here is a title.

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.850
So let me zoom out and it may enlarge this rectangle allele.

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:14.360
There'll be it.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:20.675
I'm gonna move these colors down and let me select this topography text,

00:05:20.675 --> 00:05:24.260
copy it command C or control C. Select

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:29.195
this rectangle and pastes it Command Z or Control V, k.

00:05:29.195 --> 00:05:32.795
And here I'm going to write colors, pretty good.

00:05:32.795 --> 00:05:36.725
It's left padding is going to be 65,

00:05:36.725 --> 00:05:39.365
and it's top padding is going to be 60.

00:05:39.365 --> 00:05:42.335
We have successfully created our design guide.

00:05:42.335 --> 00:05:43.445
As a matter of fact,

00:05:43.445 --> 00:05:47.990
you can add more elements to your design guides such as logos,

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.560
icons, buttons, sliders, et cetera.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.985
Okay, but for now,

00:05:52.985 --> 00:05:57.950
we just need our typography style and our colors styles are right guys,

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:59.330
that's all for this video.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.630
I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you in the next video.
