00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.140
Hi everyone.

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:07.095
In this video we are going to be talking about the next step as a UI UX designer.

00:00:07.095 --> 00:00:10.979
Now that you have learned so much about user interface design,

00:00:10.979 --> 00:00:13.080
it's time to take the next step.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.090
You are now ready to start designing amazing mobile apps and websites.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.675
As a designer, you should always be creative.

00:00:21.675 --> 00:00:28.785
So try to challenge yourself every single day to find out hidden secrets of UI UX design,

00:00:28.785 --> 00:00:32.474
you must have probably heard that practice makes perfect,

00:00:32.474 --> 00:00:36.375
but remember that your design should not be always perfect.

00:00:36.375 --> 00:00:38.335
The only thing that matters,

00:00:38.335 --> 00:00:40.670
your progression and improvements.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.780
So I think it's a good idea to change that famous phrase,

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.285
to practice makes progress.

00:00:47.285 --> 00:00:48.725
And we dad said,

00:00:48.725 --> 00:00:52.595
you should become a better designer every single day.

00:00:52.595 --> 00:00:55.190
