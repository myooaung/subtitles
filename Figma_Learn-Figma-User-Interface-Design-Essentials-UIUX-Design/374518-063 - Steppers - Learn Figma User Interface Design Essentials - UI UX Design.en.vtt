00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.240
Hi,

00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:00.820
everyone.

00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:02.060
In these video,

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:04.550
we're gonna be talking about steppers.

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:10.360
Sippers show progress through a sequence of logical and numbered steps.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.490
Sometimes you may use them for navigation.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:19.100
Suppers may display a temporary feedback message after step is saved.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:25.450
Using steppers could help users to avoid losing their focus when they need to feel up forms

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:26.690
or take some action.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.690
When you're designing steppers,

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.610
make sure to pay attention to the following things.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:39.360
Number one sections do not embed steppers into other steppers or you've multiple steppers

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.340
on one page.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.170
Number two types.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.060
Generally,

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.220
there are two types of steps.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.550
Editorial steps and non edible steps.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.750
We have horizontal steppers on vertical steppers and lastly feedback.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.570
You can optionally design transient feedback to show the users the progression.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.540
You should only use feedback whenever there is a long,

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.490
latent see between steps.
