00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.350
Hi,

00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:00.950
everyone.

00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:04.540
Welcome back to another video of discourse in these video.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.790
We're gonna be talking about the usage of Adobe for the shop for you on ux design.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:16.000
You as a young UX designer may need to edit your images in order to use them in your

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.290
project properly.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.970
Okay,

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.850
so there are some modifications that you cannot do in fig MMA,

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.140
and it's a good idea to process them in other before the shop.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.580
Okay,

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.510
so in this video,

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.340
I'm going to teach you how you can use a door before the shop for editing your images.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:31.680
Okay,

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.060
so without further ado,

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.650
let's open up our idol before the shop.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:36.380
All right?

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.080
As you can see,

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.400
I have downloaded an image off this shoe from unspool ash that come in order to show you

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.150
how you can separate any object from its bank around in adobe for the shop.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.720
Okay,

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.900
so suppose that you're designing a shopping application and we need to have some shoes in

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.390
our shopping lists,

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:54.930
OK,

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:55.880
so in this case,

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:02.620
it's better to separate this shoe from its background and then save its as a PNG five and

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.150
then you can import it in fig MMA.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.820
Okay,

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.150
so there are different ways you can do that.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.400
You can use different selection tools.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.340
For instance,

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.510
you can use the magic wand like this.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.620
It works in some examples,

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:17.520
but first of all,

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.690
let me show you something.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:19.670
As you can see,

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.510
this layer is called bank round,

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.950
okay?

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.520
And we cannot do anything when it's locked.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.150
So energy on like that,

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.300
you can double click.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.220
And the slayer,

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:28.960
for example,

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:29.930
sets a name.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.620
It doesn't matter what it is,

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.910
you can set it to shoe,

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.100
and now it's unlocked so you can make changes,

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.610
and I'm gonna click and delete like this.

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:40.780
As you can see,

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.890
we don't have any bag around here.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.030
However,

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.140
you need to make sure that the background has been removed completely.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.840
For instance,

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.410
here,

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:50.170
as you can see,

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.750
you have some white space,

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.960
so we need to once again select this white space and click on delete like this.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:58.230
Now,

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.780
in order to show you what's the difference here?

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.040
I'm going to create a new layer.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.380
And let's call it BG as our bank round,

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.440
and I'm gonna move it down right below our shoe layer.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.950
And let's press command A or control and windows.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.790
And then that's choose a different color.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.050
For example,

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.100
this one and press option delete.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.990
There we go.

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.180
As you can see,

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.010
that could easily change the backgrounds color.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.600
Okay,

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:34.970
so I can also remove the background and save it as a PNG file and imported in fig MMA and

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.440
use that so you could have more possibilities to work with this image.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.210
But there are some images that you cannot use the magic wand easily for separating your

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.340
specific object from the background.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.820
Okay,

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.850
let me undo these processes.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:50.840
In that case,

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.160
you can use other tools.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.740
Okay.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:53.900
For instance,

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.250
you can use the magnetic lasso like this,

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.750
and you can select your object easily and perfectly.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.170
You can also use the pen tool,

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.430
which is the best option possible because you can get a precise election off your object.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.350
However,

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.220
it takes more time and here,

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.510
after selecting two different points,

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:22.860
you need to hold option key and press on this point like this and select a new point and

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:23.410
saw.

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:24.330
Okay,

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.380
all right.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.830
Now I'm gonna show you another example of using Adobe further shop for modifying your

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:31.530
images.

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.080
Sometimes you may need to change the color off your product.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.680
Okay,

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.940
so first of all,

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.280
let me select the bank around and remove that like this,

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.950
and suppose that I'm going to change the color of this shoe.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:45.500
Okay?

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.740
It's a little bit difficult because it's too dark.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:49.320
However,

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.590
I'm gonna try it out.

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:51.070
First.

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.830
Let's create a new layer.

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.680
Then I'm going to select the whole shoot.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.870
How can we do that?

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:02.140
We can hold command key and clip undies Square here and as you can see it selected already

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.140
.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.390
Then make sure that you have selected the new layer and change different color.

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:08.500
For example,

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.610
blue color.

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.530
Then choose the brush tool.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.950
Okay,

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:12.740
Like this,

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.840
let's paint all of it like this.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.560
Now it looks strange,

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.050
but in a minute you can see how amazing this technique is.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:23.470
So as you can see here,

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.350
we have two different layers.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:26.500
Okay,

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.930
here we have the bland mold and we have different options.

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.750
If you select color,

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.440
you can see that are objects.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.940
Color has been changed perfectly.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:37.630
Okay.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.080
And it is fantastic because sometimes you as a U I designer,

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.840
I need to have different versions off a specific product.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.070
But it's not available on the Internet,

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.760
so you can create your own.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.950
Now suppose that you want to change its color to something else and you want to see how

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:59.930
hundreds of options instead of choosing each color one by one.

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.590
I have a good solution for you.

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.400
If you go to adjustments,

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.690
you can see that we have different options.

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:06.170
Okay.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.960
However,

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:07.450
if you can,

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.660
we can hue saturation.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.760
You can change the hue easily and as you can see the color off,

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.570
our shoe is changing instantly.

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:17.640
It's amazing,

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:18.290
isn't it?

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.140
And for saving your files,

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.490
you can simply press command shift and s.

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.820
And then here you can set the name,

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.320
for example shoe.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.910
Then you can choose the specific format you need here.

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.740
We have plenty of formats.

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:33.480
However,

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.550
when you want to use this image without background,

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.000
you need to choose PNG.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.680
Okay.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.990
Thank you.

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.000
You can save.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.860
Okay.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:42.800
And it's done.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.280
Now we can import thesis PNG file into your feet.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.120
My project.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.530
All right,

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:47.960
guys,

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.370
Thank you so much for watching this video.

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:51.740
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.970
And I will see you in the next video.
