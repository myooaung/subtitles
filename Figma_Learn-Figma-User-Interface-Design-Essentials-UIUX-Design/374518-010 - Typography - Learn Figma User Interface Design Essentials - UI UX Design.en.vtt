00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.100
high in these video,

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.800
we're going to talk about typography.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.330
What is typography?

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.830
Typography transforms language into a decorated visual element.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.660
Typography is one of the most important parts of you are UX design,

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.200
so it is worth your time to learn more about it.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.800
When you're designing an app or a website,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.140
limit the number of typefaces and sizes you use in order to keep your design simple.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.610
Start B two funds at most,

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.540
one for the headers and the other for the bodies.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.790
You can use free or paid funds in your projects,

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.620
but I highly recommend using free funds.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.020
If you will like to use paid funds,

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.940
check the license carefully.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.450
You should inform your clients that they need to pay extra for using paid funds.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.860
Now,

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.140
if you look at the right side of the screen,

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.090
you can see that I classify the typography foundation for you.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.150
Let's check it out.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:00.140
Step by step.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.600
Right at the top.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.110
We have properties.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.300
Every text line in any program has a base line.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.600
As you can see,

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.350
it is indicated here with the blue line,

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:17.950
and also it has the letter spacing that you can modify it in your design off course.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.090
There are more properties related to typography,

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.810
however,

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.700
for proceeding T scores,

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.680
it is enough to know these two properties.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.780
Now let's focus on letter spacing comparison on the left,

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.480
you can see we have the default spacing.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.840
But on the right,

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.480
I modified the spacing off those letters.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.700
Depending on what kind of project you're working on,

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.860
you can modify the letter spacing as you wish.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.410
Now let's talk about the weight off each fund.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.080
Most funds have at least three different weight,

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.590
but some of them have more.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:55.700
For instance,

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.730
the fund can have six different ways.

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.570
As you can see on your screen,

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.320
we have here from light toe,

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.800
bold and last but not least,

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.270
declassification off fonts.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.200
As you can see,

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.890
we have two different classifications for funds.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:12.950
The serif,

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.880
which is the left one in the picture,

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.050
and the Sand Saref,

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.910
which is the right one.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:20.870
The picture.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.320
So what is the difference?

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.050
For sure,

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.970
you can distinguish between them,

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.550
but let me explain to you in order to memorize the rule off serif and sans serif.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.980
Actually,

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:37.650
Sarah funds have some kind off flat line at the top off them and also the bottom off them.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.250
Or you can say they have feet.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.620
On the other hand,

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.710
sensory fonds do not have this kind of lines.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:53.170
Sands in English and French means without so sans serif means without serif.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:03:00.760
You as a designer are responsible for choosing the best wave of funds and also the best

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.050
classifications depending on what kind of project you're working on.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.350
Thank you so much for watching this video.

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.450
I will see you in the next video.
