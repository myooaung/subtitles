00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.320
Hello,

00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:00.830
everyone.

00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:03.900
And welcome back to another section of these course.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:04.930
In these section,

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.670
we're going to design a complete mobile application called Money.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:10.990
It's a finance up,

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.740
and we're going to design 24 different screens together,

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.150
step by step.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.930
Okay,

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.490
We're going to design all the necessary screens that this application needs.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.120
We start with designing the launch screen.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.610
Then we will design the welcome page,

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.230
and also we have two different signing pages.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.820
Then we will design three different sign up pages,

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.260
as you can see with different states,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.380
and after that you're going to design our or TPV verification page.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.130
And as you can see,

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.800
we have three different screens For these,

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.210
the first screen is forgetting the users number.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.480
The second screen is for when the user is entering the code,

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.820
and the last screen is when the button is active.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:55.430
Okay,

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.150
After that,

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:02.290
we will design the profile for as you can see here we have two different screens profile

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.800
and profile completed,

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.630
and then we will start designing our home page together with these cars and all these

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.660
components.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:16.710
Then we will design our hamburger menu and then we will design our cars page and we will

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.850
have two different cars the primary card and the secondary card.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.110
Here we have the transactions.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.080
After that,

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.250
we have the transactions page and also the transactions detail.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.260
So basically,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.650
even the user clicks on this card,

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.130
it will slide out,

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.110
and we will see the screen with all these details.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.310
And after that,

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.540
we will design the transfer screen with these non pad and all these elements.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.750
And then we have the confirmation page here,

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:49.610
and after that,

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.000
we will go for designing our notification page with riel later.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.770
And then we will design the profile page here.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.390
And last but not least,

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.000
we will design three different on boarding pages together.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.280
In order to start designing this project first,

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.000
you need to download the assets,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.310
find that I already prepared for you from the resource is section off the assets lecture.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.820
All right,

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:13.160
guys,

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.220
that's all for these video on.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.250
I will see you in the next video.
