00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.320
Hi,

00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:00.910
everyone.

00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:06.820
And welcome back to another video of thes section in this video we're going to design are

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.760
signing pages and also are welcome page together.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.680
So without further ado,

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.890
let's get started by duplicating these art board.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.530
So I'm gonna press command D or control the then that's removed this logo.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.060
We don't need that anymore.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.330
And after that,

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.680
I'm going to go ahead and rename my art board.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.930
So let's write signing.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.060
Fantastic.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.450
Actually,

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:33.830
in the signing page,

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.950
we're going to put the logo at the top.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.780
And also we need to have a text which says,

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:39.990
Welcome back.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.590
And then we have the signing title,

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.180
some text fields,

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.540
and after that,

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.150
the signing button right at the bottom.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.820
Okay,

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.420
so first of all,

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.000
let's start with inserting a circle.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.160
So I'm gonna hold shift and Dragon drop,

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.650
and I'm gonna set the with and high to 352 OK,

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.490
and then I'm gonna add a linear Grady into it like this.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:17.260
Let's elect the first color and I'm going to set the color co 2 50 to 64 f nine like this.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.770
Let's elect the 2nd 1 And this one is going to be three a.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.540
F nine and e f like this.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:26.150
Okay.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.060
However,

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.560
remember to increase the capacity like this to 100%.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.470
And after that,

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.470
I'm going to change the direction.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.570
So I'm going to select the first color at the top.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.350
And let's change the direction by these handle controllers like this.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.780
Fantastic.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.960
Now I'm going to move the circle a little bit to find a good place for that.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.530
However,

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.410
because I already calculated the location,

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.210
I can easily set the ex.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.210
And why here?

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:03.660
So let's set the X to minus 74 like this and a y tu minus 84 pretty good.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:04.250
All right,

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.830
now we need to duplicate this circle.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:07.500
Okay,

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.290
Like this,

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:13.990
I'm gonna move it a little bit and let's put this layer right below our first circle.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.430
And then we need to change the Grady int.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.770
So I'm going to select the first color.

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:25.390
Let's set the color code to two F 56 f eight like this,

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.350
and let's select the second color,

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:34.630
and this one is going to be see seeks 30 and f eight like this.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:35.690
However,

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.700
this time I'm going to decrease the capacity to zero like this.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.250
And I think it's a good idea to change the place off our colors like this.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.040
Fantastic.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.670
And that's changed a direction a little bit pretty good.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.930
Then let's duplicated once again,

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.100
and we need to move it down right below our second circle.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.900
Let's move it to the right side.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.000
And once again,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.730
we need to change our colors.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:09.670
So let's elect the first color and I'm going to change the code to see seven to Double F

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.220
and eight are right,

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.890
and now I'm going to change the direction.

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.490
And once again,

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.780
let's change the place off on our Connors.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:18.740
Fantastic.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.890
Now let's go ahead and set the X and Y for each circle.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:32.830
So I'm going to select the 2nd 1 And that set the X to minus 43 a Y Tu minus 56.

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.250
Great and the third circle.

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:43.570
Let's set the X to minus 12 and a Y Tu minus 106 like this.

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:44.320
Pretty good,

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.220
isn't it?

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.860
However,

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.890
now I'm gonna go ahead and select the first circle,

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:55.050
and let's change the direction a little bit in order to make it a little bit lighter.

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.460
I think now it's perfect.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.080
Are right Now it's time to add our local to this header.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.600
So let's go ahead and open up the assets file that you have downloaded from the assets

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.020
lecture of this section.

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.940
So I'm gonna place an image,

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:10.590
are right.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.180
And here you have four Fullers from local Fuller.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:19.990
I'm gonna go ahead and import local white and just click ones here.

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.510
Okay?

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:21.130
As you can see,

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.700
this is an SVG logo.

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.590
So if you decide to enlarge it like this,

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.620
you can see that it will change.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.360
So first of all,

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.500
you need to select the scam to okay like this.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.050
You can also press k on your keyboard to sit like that.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.280
And after that,

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.100
if I hold shift on my keyboard and try to scale it,

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.100
you can see that nothing changes except the D mansion and science.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.570
Okay,

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.290
so the size is perfect.

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.610
It's 60 by 59.

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.170
I'm going to keep it like that.

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:57.320
Let me zoom in a little bit the top adding is going to be 64 pixels.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.800
If you want to see the pad ings,

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.350
we can easily hold option key or all key on your keyboard.

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.350
And there we go.

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:04.750
You have all the pad ing's.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:05.310
Okay?

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.250
And as you can see,

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.070
the top heading off this logo is 80.

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.140
So I'm gonna make it 64 like this,

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:18.380
and the left padding is going to be 52 pretty good.

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:19.620
And after that,

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.490
I'm gonna insert a text.

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.670
So let's Presti and click here.

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:29.490
And I'm going to change the fund to Monsour it like this.

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:30.630
So let's right,

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.530
welcome back like this,

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.640
and I'm going to change the font size to 28 points pretty good.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.580
And let's change the color to white as well.

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.680
And make sure that this text layer is aligned with your logo.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.300
Okay?

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.110
And obviously it's left.

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.150
Padding is going to be 52 peaks.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.080
Cells like our logo.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.710
Okay.

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:54.920
And the top adding,

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.640
is going to be 16 pixels.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.040
Pretty good are right.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.480
We are done with Heather.

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:01.140
Okay,

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.560
Now let's select all of our shapes.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.240
These three circles,

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.030
I'm gonna group them on.

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:08.850
Let's call it shapes.

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:12.190
Fantastic to keep our layers organized.

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.560
And now it's time to add our title.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.710
So that's insert and you text here,

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.250
and I'm going to write signing with the same funds.

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:22.620
However thes time,

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.020
I'm going to change the way to bold.

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.080
And the font size is going to be 28 points.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.950
And also we need to change the color.

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:30.800
As you can see,

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:31.880
it's black.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:32.160
You can,

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:32.650
of course,

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:33.190
use it.

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:33.700
However,

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.620
it is recommended to use something lighter.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.850
When you want to use black against the white background,

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.110
it's better not to use a pure black.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.590
Okay,

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:48.920
so I'm going to change the color co 23 a three a and three a.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:49.450
Okay,

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:50.140
As you can see,

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:51.200
we will get dark.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:51.650
Great.

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:52.600
Fantastic.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.270
Then I'm going to check the padding.

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:54.960
Okay.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.610
The left padding is going to be 30 peak cells,

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.990
so let's check it out Pretty good.

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:05.650
And the top adding till this group is going to be 39 peak cells.

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:06.250
Okay,

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:09.090
Pretty awesome.

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:09.640
All right,

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.170
now it's time to create our tax feels.

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:14.710
So in order to create a text field,

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.010
we need a line.

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:21.850
So I'm going to select a line from these objects and let's hold shift and drag and drop

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:22.640
pretty good.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:27.190
That's changed the with 2 315 like this.

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:29.710
Then I'm gonna line into the center.

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:31.010
And as you can see,

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:34.850
we will get a 30 peaks l left and right padding,

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:36.570
which is what we wanted to.

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:43.290
Then I'm going to change the color to 27 43 f d fantastic.

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:46.200
I'm going to keep the thickness to one are right.

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:48.050
Let me move it down a little bit.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:50.650
Then we need to text layers.

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:55.550
So the 1st 1 is going to be email address.

00:07:55.550 --> 00:08:00.140
And let's change the fund to SF Protest like this.

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:07.390
And also the weight is going to be regular and the fund size should be 14 points like this

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:07.390
,

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:12.620
and I'm going to change the field to be nine b nine and B nine.

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:14.740
Fantastic to see these light.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:20.740
Great that missile mean I'm gonna align it with my line and it's left padding is going to

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:22.420
be 30 peak cells as well.

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:22.950
Okay,

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:24.290
then let's duplicate it.

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:26.530
I'm gonna move it down and here,

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:27.810
let's write our email.

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:34.710
So I'm going to write design at test dot com and let's change the color.

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:39.020
23 a three a and three A.

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:42.880
Which is the same color that we used for signing tighter.

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:43.550
Okay,

00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:47.420
are right it's modern padding is going to be eight peak cells,

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:48.520
as you can see.

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:52.320
And the top heading is going to be 16 pixels like this.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:52.910
Okay,

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:55.550
so now everything is perfect,

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:59.580
then the next thing we need to add is a teak icon.

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:00.110
Okay,

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:06.070
so let's go ahead and inserts another image from molasses file and from icons.

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:08.250
Here you have plenty of icons.

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:11.850
I'm gonna choose teak and let's click here.

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:12.730
There we go.

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:16.170
Now let's group all our elements together.

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:17.590
And after that,

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:24.690
select this tick icon and it's align it okay at Mizzou mean its bottom padding is going to

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:25.820
be 17.

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:27.170
Peak cells are right,

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:27.980
and as you can see,

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:32.370
you cannot get They're right padding here because we're using a group here.

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:32.790
Okay,

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:36.250
so if you were using a frame instead of a group,

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:39.020
we could easily get the right padding.

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:39.790
So right now,

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:44.130
the only ripening that we get is till the edge of this screen.

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:45.290
However,

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:48.700
we need to get the right padding till the end of this line.

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:51.000
So in order to make that happen,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.370
let's select our group.

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:52.930
Okay,

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:56.550
I'm going to rename me too email address.

00:09:56.550 --> 00:10:00.370
And after that That's right.

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:05.730
Click on that and you can choose frame selection and then you will have a frame.

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:08.620
So I'm gonna go ahead and copy this name.

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:11.250
That's paste it here for this frame.

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:15.030
And if I choose thes teak icon Now,

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:17.640
if I hold the option key on my keyboard,

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.120
I can see the right patting OK,

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:24.040
because I'm evaluating the pad ings against thes frame,

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.510
which is what we wanted to.

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:25.980
Okay,

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:26.500
All right.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:29.100
Now let's set the right padding to 16 peaks.

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:34.480
Cells like this and everything is done.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.780
So we successfully created our first text field.

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:38.880
However,

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:39.890
we need one more.

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:43.120
So let's go ahead and duplicate it.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.500
I'm gonna put it down and the top adding,

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:48.380
Is going to be 24 picks cells like this.

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:54.100
Then that's changed a title to password pretty good.

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:57.340
And let's rename our group and our frame as well.

00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:02.330
So let's change you to password and the frame name as well.

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:03.340
Fantastic.

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:05.390
And then we need to change these texts,

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:05.940
OK,

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:07.660
because for passport,

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:12.770
we need to have two different states the hidden password and the visible passport.

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:15.400
So in order to create the hidden password,

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:20.400
you could hold option or also on your keyboard and press eight.

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:21.040
Okay.

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:21.850
Like this,

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:23.260
Our right.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:24.110
As you can see,

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:26.000
it's hidden for the security.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.170
So this is what we can't use their experience because you,

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:32.000
as a UX designer,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.800
need to pay attention to all the details.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:35.270
Okay,

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:38.850
then we need to change this icon to an eye icon.

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:39.340
Okay?

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:42.790
For letting the user to make these password visible or hidden.

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:42.990
Okay.

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:44.450
So I'm going to remove that.

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:47.750
Let's place another image from our assets file.

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:49.710
And here we have.

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:51.440
I like this.

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:57.500
I'm gonna inserted here and let's move it to right inside our past for text field are right

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:57.500
.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.410
It's going to have a 16 peaks,

00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:02.950
cell bottom padding and a 16 peaks of right padding.

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:03.570
Okay,

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:05.100
Pretty good are right.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.120
So what else do we need for the signing page?

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:08.570
Of course,

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:10.550
we need the forgot password link.

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:12.100
So it's created.

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:13.380
I need a text.

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:14.240
And that's right.

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:15.460
For God.

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:16.500
Password.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:17.790
A question mark.

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:24.610
And then I'm going to change the color to to be 47 fc like this,

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:26.530
and it's make it larger,

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:29.870
so I'm gonna set the font size for 16 points.

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:32.250
Pretty good Let's align it.

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:38.960
It's left padding is going to be 30 peak cells and its top heading is going to be 24 pixels

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.550
like this and last.

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:43.680
But that least we need to create our sign in button.

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:47.250
So let's go ahead and insert a rectangle here.

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:49.390
I'm going to drag and drop.

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:50.620
Fantastic.

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:56.500
I'm going to set the with 2 315 and the high to 72 like this.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:00.740
Then let's increase the corner radius to 28.

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:01.540
However,

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:03.230
I need to make them smooth.

00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:03.750
Okay,

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:09.630
so I'm gonna click on this icon Independent corners and these icon as well.

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:10.880
And as you can see here,

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.640
I have a slider.

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:18.140
I can increase it to 60% in order to gets an iris like round the bottom.

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:18.760
Okay,

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:19.710
pretty good.

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:23.650
Then let's change the color to a Grady Int like this.

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:30.250
I'm going to select the first color on Let's change it to 49 60 and F nine,

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:32.410
and that's the day the second color.

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:39.910
Increase the capacity to 100% and changing to 14 33 on double f.

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:40.850
Fantastic!

00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:45.220
Then I'm going to change the direction a little bit like this are right.

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:46.090
Pretty good.

00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:47.520
Then we need a text.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:50.400
So let's write signing.

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:56.320
I'm going to change the fund to on Sarit and the fun size to 20 points.

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:58.470
The weight is going to be regular.

00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:59.430
However,

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:02.750
let's change the feel to wind like this.

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:09.240
And after that we need to select both our rectangle and our scientifics in order to align

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:09.470
them.

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:13.150
So I'm going to click on a line vertically Pretty good.

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:14.810
Then that's check the pad ings.

00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:15.330
Okay,

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:17.150
so I'm gonna zoom in a little bit.

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:19.590
The top left and bottom padding.

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:21.970
Czar going to be 24 pixels.

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:22.600
Okay.

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:23.680
Like this.

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:24.860
Then what do we need?

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:31.390
We need a right arrow to place it here in order to indicate that by clicking on this icon

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:34.070
you will be redirected to another page.

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:34.580
Okay,

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:39.690
so let's go ahead and place an image and from the icons you can choose,

00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:42.640
right arrow and place it here.

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:43.670
There we go.

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:49.980
And I'm going to select the rectangle and this I can together and click on Align vertically

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:50.960
Pretty good.

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:51.730
And it's right.

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:55.630
Padding is going to be 24 pixels like this.

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:56.200
Okay,

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.060
pretty good.

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:57.440
All right,

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.940
So now we have created our sign in button.

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:00.700
However,

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.910
I'm gonna add more detail Street in order to make it unique.

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:04.330
Okay,

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:09.150
so let's go ahead and create a circle like this.

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:14.510
And then I'm gonna go ahead and click on these third circle like this,

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:14.800
then,

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:15.110
right?

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:17.140
Click here and from these men,

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:18.720
you copy paste,

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:25.310
click on copy properties like this and select this small circle right click on that and

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:26.450
from copy paste,

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:28.310
you can paste properties.

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:28.870
Okay,

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:32.680
so that we can get the same Grady int that we used for our header.

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:33.240
Okay,

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.230
then I'm gonna move it down.

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:38.240
Let's put it under our arrow like this.

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.060
And after that,

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:40.550
we need to create a mask.

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:41.040
Okay.

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:41.680
However,

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:42.950
before doing that,

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:48.530
we need to duplicate our rectangle because we're going to add a drop shadow after masking.

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:49.150
OK,

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:50.190
unlike sketch,

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:53.520
if you want to have a drop shadow while using a mask,

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:55.000
it's not gonna work easily.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.040
So the best way to get that result is to duplicate it.

00:15:59.040 --> 00:15:59.580
Okay,

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:02.700
this is the rectangle to I'm gonna put it down,

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:09.580
hide it for now and then select this circle and this rectangle Anglican mask like this and

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:10.250
After that,

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:15.150
you can make your duplicated layer visible like this pretty good,

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:17.710
and you can easily move these circle around.

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:18.470
OK,

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:23.800
now I'm going to rotate it a little bit to get something like this that's put it here

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:24.700
fantastic,

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.260
and I think it's a good idea to make it larger.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:35.610
So I'm gonna set the with and hide to 144 by 144 to get something like this.

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:38.730
Let's duplicate it movie to the left side,

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:43.040
and then I'm going to copy and paste the property of the circle,

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:46.760
this blue one like this to this small circle.

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:47.780
Fantastic.

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:51.350
That's put this layer below our first circle,

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:56.300
and then I'm gonna rotate it a little bit to get the best results possible.

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:57.820
I think now it's great,

00:16:57.820 --> 00:16:58.330
all right.

00:16:58.330 --> 00:16:59.230
It's pretty good,

00:16:59.230 --> 00:16:59.890
isn't it?

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:03.630
The last thing we need to do is adding a drop shadow to our bottom.

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:05.050
So first of all,

00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:07.710
remember to choose the duplicated layer.

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:08.250
Okay,

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:11.890
this rectangle to hang click on add effects like this,

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:13.570
I'm going to change the settings.

00:17:13.570 --> 00:17:14.340
So first of all,

00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:15.840
I'm going to change the color.

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:21.110
Let's set it to one B 39 double F like this.

00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:30.300
Then change the player amount to 16 and a Y 28 like this and decrease the opacity to 20%.

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:31.340
Fantastic.

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:32.600
It's pretty cool,

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:33.340
isn't it?

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:36.200
Now I'm going to select all elements here,

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:40.690
group them and let's rename me to signing Botton.

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:44.760
Fantastic are right now as our button is selected.

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:46.880
Let's align into the center.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:47.930
And as you can see,

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:53.520
we've got a 30 pixel left and right padding and we need to get a 64 picks.

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.870
L bottom padding like this.

00:17:55.870 --> 00:18:00.550
The only thing left to add to this screen is a home indicator.

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:01.160
Okay,

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.800
so if you open up your ass,

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:04.520
it's fine.

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:05.170
As it can see,

00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:07.700
you have a folder called Apple Are Usu.

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:09.260
I Let's open it up.

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.600
And here you have different folders,

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:12.530
bars,

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:14.450
home indicator and keyboards.

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:16.370
So let's open up home indicator.

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:18.760
And here you have to wear jeans.

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:21.960
The dark portrait and the line portrait.

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:22.370
Actually,

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:25.560
delight here doesn't mean that it's white.

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:26.130
Okay,

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:29.970
it means that you can use it on top of a light background.

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:31.280
So it's black.

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:31.970
Basically,

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:34.270
I'm gonna go ahead and open it.

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:35.460
Thank click here.

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:38.960
Then let's align it to the center like this.

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:42.920
And it's bottom padding is going to be zero k r Right now.

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.550
Let's check in our signing page out.

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:46.640
It's fantastic,

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:47.280
isn't it?

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:47.900
Are right,

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:48.210
Guys,

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:50.550
Before we put an end to this video,

00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:52.520
we need to create a welcome page.

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:53.060
Okay,

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:54.920
so now I'm gonna go ahead and move.

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:56.980
These are poor to the right side.

00:18:56.980 --> 00:19:02.820
And let's duplicate it and bring this duplicated our poor to the left side.

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:03.440
OK,

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:05.090
like this.

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:07.770
And I'm going to rename me to Welcome.

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:09.290
And of course,

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:10.550
we don't need these elements.

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:12.050
So let's remove them.

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:12.820
However,

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:13.470
Keep peace,

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:16.470
sign in button and then let's use these shapes.

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:17.000
Group.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:17.670
Okay,

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:21.520
let's change the with and high to 970.

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:22.500
However,

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:28.260
keep in mind to link them first like this are right.

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:37.050
And then that said the X two minus 424 and a y Tu minus 409.

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:39.300
And after that I'm going to rotate it a little bit.

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:44.470
So let's set the rotation to minus 28 degrees to get something like this.

00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:45.460
It's pretty cool,

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:46.030
isn't it?

00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:48.640
Then let's move it to the left side a little bit.

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:49.810
It's fantastic.

00:19:49.810 --> 00:19:52.700
So make sure to do these steps in order,

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:54.660
because if you first rotate it,

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:57.560
your X and Y are going to be changed.

00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:58.140
Okay,

00:19:58.140 --> 00:19:58.940
Are right.

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:00.920
And in these welcome page,

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.960
we're going to have one more button.

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:03.540
Okay,

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:05.110
The sign up button.

00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:08.850
So I'm gonna go ahead and move these button up.

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:10.480
Duplicated?

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:14.500
That's moving down on its top heading is going to be 16.

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:16.290
Pig sounds like this.

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:18.290
Then let's change these takes too.

00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:19.700
Sign up.

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:20.120
Of course,

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:24.340
you can make it dynamic by adding photo layout to this if you want to.

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:25.030
Of course.

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:31.090
And then I'm gonna go ahead and select thes rectangle to let's remove the feel and add a

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:35.220
stroke to it and change the stroke color to 27.

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:39.270
43 f de like this.

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:44.490
Let's copy these color code because I'm gonna need that and remove the drop shadow.

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:45.950
We don't need that anymore.

00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:46.560
And also,

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:49.480
we need to remove these circles like this.

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:49.700
Now,

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:55.230
let's elect our right arrow and change the color code to the color that we chose for our

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:55.860
stroke.

00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:57.330
I'm gonna pace it here.

00:20:57.330 --> 00:21:03.100
And also I'm gonna go ahead and change the color code off my text to the same color like

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:04.180
this are right.

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:09.500
Now let's shake the pad Ing's the bottom padding is going to be 64.

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:14.940
So I'm going to select both buttons and move them down by one pixel like this and make sure

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.330
to rename your group.

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:19.320
So I'm going to change it to sign up.

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.440
And that's all are right,

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:21.760
guys,

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.500
that's all for these video.

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:25.350
I hope you really enjoyed it.

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:26.810
It was so interesting.

00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:28.160
And in the next video,

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:31.550
we will continue designing are signing pages together.

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:32.760
So see you then.
