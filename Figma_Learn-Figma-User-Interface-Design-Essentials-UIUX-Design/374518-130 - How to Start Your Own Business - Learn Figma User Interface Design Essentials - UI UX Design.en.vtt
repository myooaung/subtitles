00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.320
Hello,

00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:00.970
everyone.

00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:03.390
I hope you're doing well in these video.

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.160
We're going to talk about how you can start your own business.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.130
Starting a business is hard,

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:14.410
so you need to determine the level of your motivation before getting into this process.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.070
When you're thinking about starting a business,

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.750
you should know that it takes so much time,

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.700
energy and patients to achieve your goals.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.820
If you're aware of all these aspects,

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.070
you're ready to take the next step.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.050
First of all,

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:35.050
you should evaluate your skills level and find out what kind of services you like to offer

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:35.050
.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.000
Then you need to find out who your potential clients are.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.960
In addition,

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.850
you should work on your pricing and analyze your numbers.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.020
Second of all,

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.260
you need to register your own company.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.650
In this regard,

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:54.950
I recommend getting some advice from a lawyer and making sure you understand all the legal

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.090
requirements associated with registering a company.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.350
After registering your company,

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.010
you need to start creating your own brand,

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.900
design a logo for your company and choose your brand collars.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.380
Last but not least,

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.140
you should definitely design your own website because it's the most crucial part of your

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.000
business.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.610
Now that you have your website ready,

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.870
it's time to think about your marketing strategy.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.230
If you could not offer your services and skills to the right people,

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.650
your business would not be successful,

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.330
no matter how professional and useful your skills are,

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.350
so make sure that you have a great marketing plan and execute it accurately.
