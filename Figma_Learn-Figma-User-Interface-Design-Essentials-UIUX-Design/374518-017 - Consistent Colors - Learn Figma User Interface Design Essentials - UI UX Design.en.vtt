00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.490
Hey,

00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:00.950
everyone,

00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:02.480
in these video,

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.160
we're gonna be talking about colors.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.740
Applying colors to your your eye elements is one of the most crucial parts of the U.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:10.930
Y.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:12.150
Design process.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:19.310
Do you remember what was playing a key role in your eye designing your right consistency,

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.670
so you need to keep your colors consistent as well.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:23.620
For instance,

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.730
if you apply Blue two titles on one page,

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.690
you need to apply the same color two titles on other pages or,

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:32.320
if we apply,

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.150
read to purchase button.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:40.190
You should use the same color for any other purchase bottoms on other pages.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.500
This is why we need a design guide and the style right.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.820
If you look at the picture on your right,

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.790
you can see that we used a specific black color for titles,

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.750
and we use a specific color for our bottoms,

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:56.660
etcetera.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.150
So it is so important to keep your colors consistent
