00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:09.820
Although I mentioned before,

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.100

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:20.550
It's good to be familiar read at the before the shop environment and also the basics of

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.210
photo shop for preparing our images sometimes or even editing our fines.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.480
