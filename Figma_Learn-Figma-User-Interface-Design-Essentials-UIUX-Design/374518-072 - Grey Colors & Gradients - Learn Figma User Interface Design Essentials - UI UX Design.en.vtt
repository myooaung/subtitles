00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.280
Hi,

00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:00.810
everyone.

00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.470
And welcome back to another video off this course in this video,

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.070
we're going to continue creating hours,

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:08.860
time guide or let's say,

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.470
our design system together.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:11.930
So in these video,

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.090
we need to have two more sections to our design system,

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.140
which are gray background colors and Grady in colors.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.790
So to do that first we need to increase the height size off our art board like this.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.290
And I'm going to copy and paste one of these sections.

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:30.850
Pretty nice.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.120
That's candidate Gray background colors.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.860
Nice.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.510
I don't need this blue line.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.970
And now let me detach them from their style like this.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.580
Pretty nice.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.440
And I'm going to duplicate the last fun because I need one more color.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.780
Fantastic.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:57.950
Now let's select the 1st 1 and I'm going to change the Color Co 2 28 37 4 B like this and

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.910
let me create the color style.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.530
I'm going to write colors gray one.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.400
And for the 2nd 1 I'm going to copy the scholar code,

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.150
okay,

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.610
and that's pasted here,

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.450
and I'm going to decrease the capacity to 75%.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.650
And after that,

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:22.570
let's choose the eyedropper and click and this color nerd to get the same color with 100%

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:23.410
capacity.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.940
Okay,

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.920
then let's create the color Stein colors gray to.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.200
I'm going to copy this,

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.350
and we need to copy the color code once again.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.250
So let's pace it here.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.650
Read 50% capacity on the last one.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:45.850
We 25% opacity like this and let me change them and the last one.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.090
Once again choose,

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.670
I drop her and select the same color.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:50.570
Fantastic.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.350
Now let's create the third color style colors.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.660
Gray three.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:02.070
That's confidence and the last one colors gray and four.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.940
Fantastic.

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:12.260
Now I'm going to rename the group to gray background colors that covetous and paste it for

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.710
other groups as well.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.230
Like this pretty good once again duplicated.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.520
And now I'm going to rename me to Grady and Colors.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.070
And let's remove the last two colors because I need only two colors here,

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.500
and I'm going to select the first fun.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.750
Detach it from its style,

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.840
the 2nd 1 as well.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.270
And for the first fun,

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:43.130
I'm going to change the color from solid to linear and let's elect the first color,

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:51.380
and I'm going to change the color code to 41 35 F three and the 2nd 1 Let's increase the

00:02:51.380 --> 00:03:00.020
capacity to 100% and I'm going to change you to 71 68 F six.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.640
Then I'm going to change the direction to get something like this pretty good.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.910
Then let's create our color style.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.170
I'm gonna write colors Grady Int.

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.720
One And for the 2nd 1 that change you too linear as well.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:23.000
The first color is going to be B 52 F two and the second color.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.020
We need to increase the capacity to 100%.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:33.160
And I'm going to change the Color Co two db a five and F five like this.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.970
Let me change the direction.

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.480
Fantastic.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:42.930
And we need to create our color Stein colors great and to a last.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:51.090
But at least let's rename our group to Grady in colors for other groups as well.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.440
Fantastic.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.890
All right,

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:54.160
guys.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.690
Now let's try out our Grady INTs.

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.360
So I'm going to create a rectangle here,

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.890
and it's apply our Grady ins,

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:02.600
for example,

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.250
this one.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.740
It's pretty fantastic.

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.340
We can easily change it,

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.660
and also we can choose the background color previous ounces is in it are right,

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:12.000
guys.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.580
That's all for this video.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:14.750
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.950
And I will see you in the next video.
