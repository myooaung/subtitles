00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.410
Hi,

00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:00.950
everyone.

00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:04.910
And welcome back to another video of these course in this video,

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.200
we're going to be talking about editing shapes,

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:14.530
which is a very important topic because it happens all the time that he may need to edit

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:15.450
your shapes.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:15.880
OK,

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.030
so first of all,

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.550
I'm gonna press a And as you can see now,

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.350
I can choose my art board.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.750
Let's open up the desk up menu.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.590
And here I'm going to choose my quid pro for these video 1000 matter.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.180
But I have enough space to show you how you can edit your shapes.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.500
Then what I'm going to do is creating any rectangle here.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.600
I'm gonna hold shift and dragon drop like this.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.530
Then let's increase the corner radius.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.390
And by the way,

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.570
if you hold shift key on your keyboard,

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.910
you can increase or decrease the corner radius by 10 units.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:53.380
Okay.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.380
Like this pretty good.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.900
Then I'm gonna fill it with another color.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.120
So let's look for a very beautiful blue.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.610
I think it's great.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.360
And then I'm going to create another rectangle here.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.810
So let's hold shift again,

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.410
and I'm gonna show you a very great technique to choose your colors properly.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.980
Okay,

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.840
So if you're not sure that how you could match a good color with this blue,

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.460
that creates a great contrast between them.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.250
You can first choose the same color like this.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:34.180
And then if you just move this circle to the darker side of these color palette like this,

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.010
you can easily choose a perfect match with your background color,

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.980
which is amazing,

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:40.780
isn't it?

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.830
So now how can we edit our shape in order to edit any shape?

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:46.330
First,

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.440
we need to enter to the edit mode.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.610
So to do that,

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.950
you can double click on that shape.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.070
And there we go.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.600
Now we are in edit mode,

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.150
OK?

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.440
And as you can see,

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.920
we have four different notes here.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.240
Or let's say points that we can start editing are shaped with.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.100
So if I click on this circle and try to move it a little bit,

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.320
you can see that I can easily edit this shape as a wish like this.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.950
Okay,

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.260
I can even increase the radius of thes corner in the inspector something like this.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.210
You can also add more notes on your path.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.840
Okay.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.880
Like this,

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:25.620
for example,

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.410
here I can click once And there we go.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.250
I just created and you note and I can edit it in another way like this.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.040
Okay,

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.550
so let me come back to the first state of this rectangle or let's say square like this.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.270
So now suppose that you want to create something like care.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.020
Okay.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.060
In that case,

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.710
you can use the bend to which is here.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.160
You can click on that and choose one of those notes.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.940
Then you can see that handle controller appears.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.960
And with these handle controller,

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.910
you can easily adjust your curve like this.

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:03.610
It's awesome,

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:04.250
isn't it?

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.830
And a shortcut of Ben Tool is holding command on your keyboard.

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:09.570
There we go.

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:14.050
You can easily adjust your curve in order to meet your expectations.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.150
Pretty awesome.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.940
After editing your shape,

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.620
you need to remember to close your editing mode.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:20.750
To do that,

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.360
you can click undone like this.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.000
So right now we are out of editing wrote,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.950
but isn't it better to create a really icon inner to show you how you could use the

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.590
powerful editing mode?

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.650
Let's do that.

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:36.040
So,

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.050
first of all,

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.170
I'm going to zoom in a little bit like this.

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.220
Then I'm gonna enter to edit motile.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.260
That's double click.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.130
And after that,

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.670
I'm going to create and you knowed right here.

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:47.290
OK,

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.400
so I'm going to click on that,

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.870
Then I'm gonna drank it down by holding shift like this Pretty good.

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:01.700
And the next thing I'm going to do is selecting all notes by holding command A or control A

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:02.700
in Windows.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.880
Then I'm gonna increase the corner radius.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:06.490
Okay,

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.640
so let's increase it to six.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.250
Maybe that's pretty good.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.100
And now I'm gonna make it a little bit taller,

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.350
and the last thing I'm gonna do is rotating this icon.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.240
So in order to rotate anything in fig MMA,

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:26.730
you can hover your mouse just outside your shape and you can see that the rotation

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.490
indicator or icon appears immediately.

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.090
Then I'm gonna hold shift,

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.190
and I'm going to rotate it by 180 degrees.

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.920
As you can see,

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.580
you have the amount here and there we go.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:40.740
What does it look like?

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:41.640
You're right.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.280
It's like a bookmark.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.860
Okay,

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.240
so can you see how amazing and powerful this editing tool is?

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.490
So I'm going to make some changes in order to make it better.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.800
Let me double click on the shape and I'm going to select these two top notes and then

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.430
increase the corner radius to 26 may be pretty awesome or right.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:09.410
Let me select both layers and I'm gonna group them by command G or controlled G in Windows

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:09.410
.

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.610
And I'm gonna name it Bookmark pretty awesome.

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.540
So what else can we do?

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:20.600
Let's go ahead and create a polygon here.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:27.490
I'm going to set the color to the same blue as our bookmark icon and thats copy and paste

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.770
this background as our frame.

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:35.720
So I'm gonna hold command key or control key and windows and click and these rectangle or

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.220
square and copied by command.

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:38.800
See,

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.220
And I'm gonna paste it.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:40.950
However,

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.630
remember to move this layer outside this bookmark group.

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.100
I'm gonna move it a little bit like this.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.050
Pretty awesome.

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:54.760
Now it's double click on these triangle and here I'm going to create another node right at

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.680
the bottom like this and let me drag it a little bit.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:59.870
There we go.

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.810
We have our GPS marker.

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:02.840
That's pretty cool,

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:03.500
isn't it?

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.150
That we make it smaller?

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:06.200
Fantastic.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.710
Okay,

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:07.950
let me group it.

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:11.690
I'm going to write Marker pretty awesome.

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.720
Let me enlarge this art board a little bit.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.900
Then I'm going to show you how you can use the pan tool.

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.300
So suppose that you want to create,

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:21.360
for instance,

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.700
a narrow Okay,

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:23.800
a care of Darrow.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.310
How can you do that?

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:26.350
It's so simple.

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.220
Let's start with adding and note.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:34.080
Then you need another note like this and the last one here,

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.740
that's all.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:35.400
First of all,

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.260
I'm gonna increase the stroke thickness to four.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.500
Maybe Then I'm going to rotate it a little bit.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.460
And if I click on these dots,

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:49.390
I can change the cap more to line arrow like this.

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:50.540
It's pretty cool.

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.320
I can even edit it like this.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.270
So can you see?

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:59.240
How is it ease to create new shapes and edit them Pretty awesome are right,

00:06:59.240 --> 00:06:59.560
guys,

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.760
Thank you so much for watching the CDO.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:02.880
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:09.620
And in the next series of videos we will practice using the's tools by creating re award

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:10.450
projects.

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:11.500
So don't worry.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.700
If you do not understand all the details,

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.880
I will make sure to explain everything in detail.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.010
So I will see you in the next video
