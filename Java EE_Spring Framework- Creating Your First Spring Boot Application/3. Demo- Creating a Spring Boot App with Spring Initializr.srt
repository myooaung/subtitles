00:00:02,027 --> 00:00:05,830
Spring has made creating a new Spring Boot project easier than ever.

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:08,143
I'll be covering a couple of different ways of generating

3
00:00:08,143 --> 00:00:10,486
or creating a project from scratch.

4
00:00:10,486 --> 00:00:13,406
We'll begin first by using the site Spring Initializr,

5
00:00:13,406 --> 00:00:17,144
which you can go to at a URL, start.spring .io,

6
00:00:17,144 --> 00:00:19,076
in your browser.

7
00:00:19,076 --> 00:00:21,254
Get that open and follow along.

8
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:24,150
We're going to be building a conference scheduling app in this course,

9
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:28,090
and this app will hold difference sessions and allow speakers to

10
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,767
be assigned as the presenter of a session.

11
00:00:30,767 --> 00:00:33,228
The speaker can present more than one session.

12
00:00:33,228 --> 00:00:35,074
If you been to any conference,

13
00:00:35,074 --> 00:00:38,025
think of this as the planning and organization app that builds out the

14
00:00:38,025 --> 00:00:41,713
conference topics and sessions for the organizers.

15
00:00:41,713 --> 00:00:44,570
So to begin, any app that you create will need a few customizations,

16
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,841
and this app will be no exception.

17
00:00:47,841 --> 00:00:48,156
First off,

18
00:00:48,156 --> 00:00:50,748
we're going to be using the Maven Project type for

19
00:00:50,748 --> 00:00:53,089
the project rather than Gradle, next,

20
00:00:53,089 --> 00:00:56,390
we're going to use the preselected Java language,

21
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,804
and we'll go ahead and select the latest Spring Boot version,

22
00:01:00,804 --> 00:01:04,657
which at the time of this recording is 2.1 .9.

23
00:01:04,657 --> 00:01:10,328
For the Group name, I'm going to go ahead and change that to say com.pluralsight,

24
00:01:10,328 --> 00:01:15,577
and I'm going to change the Artifact name to be conference-demo.

25
00:01:15,577 --> 00:01:15,754
Finally,

26
00:01:15,754 --> 00:01:18,611
we need to tell the project generator which pieces of Spring we'd

27
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:21,269
like to include in our Spring Boot application.

28
00:01:21,269 --> 00:01:25,769
To keep this simple, I'm just going to select the Spring web dependency.

29
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:29,922
You can do that by switching tabs from the magnifying glass to the table layout.

30
00:01:29,922 --> 00:01:30,594
And in here,

31
00:01:30,594 --> 00:01:33,082
you can see all of the different frameworks that are

32
00:01:33,082 --> 00:01:34,353
available for your application.

33
00:01:34,353 --> 00:01:40,149
All I want to do is begin by using the Spring Web, so I'm going to select that.

34
00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:42,041
Now if I go back to the magnifying glass,

35
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:45,735
you'll see that the Selected dependencies is simply Spring Web.

36
00:01:45,735 --> 00:01:48,780
If you want, you could also type them in here on this text box,

37
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,038
and you could find different project or libraries that way as well.

38
00:01:53,038 --> 00:01:57,023
Spring Web is going to pull in Spring MVC and some REST API information,

39
00:01:57,023 --> 00:01:59,489
which we'll need in our application.

40
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:01,320
At this point, we're now able to generate the project.

41
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,491
So down at the bottom, we could go ahead and click on the Generate button.

42
00:02:06,491 --> 00:02:10,028
That will download your project as a ZIP file to your computer, and that's it!

43
00:02:10,028 --> 00:02:12,492
We have a new Spring Boot project.

44
00:02:12,492 --> 00:02:19,000
If you want to know how to import it into your IntelliJ IDE so you can start coding with it, that's what's coming up next.
