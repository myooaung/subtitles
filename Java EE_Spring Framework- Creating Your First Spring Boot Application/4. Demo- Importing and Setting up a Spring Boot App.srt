00:00:02,346 --> 00:00:03,336
As I mentioned previously,

2
00:00:03,336 --> 00:00:07,458
I'll be using IntelliJ for my main IDE for this course.

3
00:00:07,458 --> 00:00:11,450
If you're familiar with something else, like Eclipse or a Spring Tool suite,

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:16,425
feel free to use that, but all the demos I'll be doing will be with IntelliJ.

5
00:00:16,425 --> 00:00:19,807
In the previous clip, we generated a new Spring Boot application,

6
00:00:19,807 --> 00:00:22,810
and that downloaded a ZIP file to our hard drive.

7
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:29,104
So you need to locate where that ZIP file was and go ahead and extract it.

8
00:00:29,104 --> 00:00:31,750
Next, go ahead and open up IntelliJ,

9
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:36,131
and the IDE will present you with a few options to get a project up and running.

10
00:00:36,131 --> 00:00:37,582
Since we already have our project,

11
00:00:37,582 --> 00:00:40,760
I'm simply going to click the Import Project button

12
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:46,149
and find the file we just extracted.

13
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:51,793
Go ahead and select the extracted folder and Click OK.

14
00:00:51,793 --> 00:00:55,954
Next, IntelliJ asks what type of project that I'm working with.

15
00:00:55,954 --> 00:00:59,809
I chose Maven on the project creation on the Spring initializer site,

16
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:05,252
so I'm simply going to select Maven and click Next.

17
00:01:05,252 --> 00:01:07,002
This screen allows for some customization,

18
00:01:07,002 --> 00:01:09,643
but I'm going to go ahead and just leave the default

19
00:01:09,643 --> 00:01:12,674
recommended settings and click Next again.

20
00:01:12,674 --> 00:01:16,246
At this point, IntelliJ has found my project.

21
00:01:16,246 --> 00:01:23,086
I can leave the default selected conference-demo checked and click Next.

22
00:01:23,086 --> 00:01:23,754
In this dialog,

23
00:01:23,754 --> 00:01:28,262
you can choose or set up your JDK that you want to use for the project.

24
00:01:28,262 --> 00:01:31,187
Assuming you have a JDK installed, it should find one,

25
00:01:31,187 --> 00:01:38,468
and I'm going to go ahead and use the JDK 12 and click Next.

26
00:01:38,468 --> 00:01:40,263
Finally, if you want to adjust the project name,

27
00:01:40,263 --> 00:01:44,040
you can, but I'm going to go ahead and leave the recommended default here,

28
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,704
and finally, click Finish.

29
00:01:46,704 --> 00:01:50,804
After a few seconds, IntelliJ should successfully import your conference app,

30
00:01:50,804 --> 00:01:54,120
and you should be ready to start working with it.

31
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,451
Next up,

32
00:01:54,451 --> 00:01:56,948
I'm going to take a moment and go over the layout of the

33
00:01:56,948 --> 00:01:59,920
Spring Boot application and the different pieces that were

34
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:07,000
set up from the initializer, as well as set up a few of my own best practice pieces in the application.
