00:00:01,449 --> 00:00:04,160
If you were a Java developer back in 2005 and you

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,695
wanted to deploy your application,

3
00:00:05,695 --> 00:00:09,247
you'd become very familiar with containers like Tomcat,

4
00:00:09,247 --> 00:00:11,153
Glassfish, or Websphere.

5
00:00:11,153 --> 00:00:15,793
These were all containers that complied with the JEE specification at that time.

6
00:00:15,793 --> 00:00:17,496
And when you deployed a Java application,

7
00:00:17,496 --> 00:00:21,701
you created a WAR file and then installed them on these containers.

8
00:00:21,701 --> 00:00:24,476
Now with Spring Boot, apps are standalone.

9
00:00:24,476 --> 00:00:27,012
Instead of installing your app into a container,

10
00:00:27,012 --> 00:00:29,934
Spring has embedded a container inside of the framework.

11
00:00:29,934 --> 00:00:33,737
This allows you to run the app in standalone mode now.

12
00:00:33,737 --> 00:00:37,748
The default container Spring Boot uses is Tomcat out of the box.

13
00:00:37,748 --> 00:00:40,494
You can switch that out to Jetty or Undertow if you

14
00:00:40,494 --> 00:00:42,741
prefer a different embedded container.

15
00:00:42,741 --> 00:00:49,000
Let's see what it actually takes to switch out an embedded container for our conference application.
