1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:06,150
In this video you're going to learn how to use Twitter and in particular I'll show you the five different

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,490
types of ways you can communicate on Twitter.

3
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:16,050
General treats mentions replies read tweets and DMD's I show you an example of each of those and explain

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:23,370
the difference of where those different types of ways to communicate on Twitter appear.

5
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:28,760
So one thing that can be very helpful to understand these differences and especially if you're new to

6
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:34,950
Twitter for any question is to click on your profile here and you'll see the option to open up the Twitter

7
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,030
help center.

8
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:42,370
So if you open this up in a new link you there's really a ton of information here.

9
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,730
If you ever get stuck or of questions I'd recommend you come in and check the size.

10
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:53,500
And for this video there is a great article about different types of tweets

11
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:01,650
which really is very helpful to understand these different types of tweets so let's read through this

12
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:04,340
and then I'll give you an example of each.

13
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:10,060
So the general tweets a message posted to Twitter containing text photos or video.

14
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:10,930
Where does it appear.

15
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:16,280
It appears on the sender's profile page on Home Time Line and who sees it.

16
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:20,620
It appears in the home timeline of anybody who's following the sender.

17
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:25,680
So let us come into the profile give you an example of this.

18
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,840
You should see the option here to write your own tweet or at the top right hand corner.

19
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:34,220
So I'm just going to say hello world.

20
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:37,380
Now Twitter.

21
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,580
There used to be a limit of 140 characters.

22
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,570
Now that's been increased to 280.

23
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:47,440
So just be aware for these general tweets that is the limit.

24
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,010
And if you want to send that then you just click tweet.

25
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,600
So this will appear on my profile page.

26
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:59,140
And it's also going to appear in the home timeline of anybody who's following me.

27
00:01:59,150 --> 00:01:59,610
Right now.

28
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,560
No followers.

29
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:06,590
But if we look at the timeline it essentially would be it would appear here for anybody who's following

30
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:09,110
me in their time line so they could see that.

31
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:14,260
So that is the first type of tweet on the first of the five things that we're going to look at.

32
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:22,970
And second we have mentions so a tweet containing another Twitter account preceded by the symbol is

33
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:23,810
a mention.

34
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:34,830
So for example if we take this we can go back to our account we can click tweet here at the top.

35
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:40,220
We can click Healthwatch supports we are mentioning an account and we're using their to their Twitter

36
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:48,310
profile or handle names so we can click a tweet and then we can refresh the page and we can see this

37
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,610
mentioned here.

38
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,000
So where does it appear it appears on our profile page.

39
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,610
Like we can see here.

40
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:02,850
And then also for the recipient it appears in their notifications Taieb which is accessible by them.

41
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:10,270
So if I was Twitter support come into my notifications tab and under mentions I could see anybody who's

42
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:16,440
mentioned me right now nobody's mentioned me on this account so nothing is showing up.

43
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:17,820
So who else might see this.

44
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:23,890
Well anybody on Twitter who's following the sender of the mentioned that's me will see it as a tweet

45
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:30,220
in their home timeline and places that will never appear on anybody's profile page unless they wrote

46
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,560
the message.

47
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:36,520
So simply it's going to appear on my profile page.

48
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:42,460
And also it's going to appear in the timeline of anybody who's following me and the recipient is going

49
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,050
to get that notification as well.

50
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:49,720
This is a great way to get the attention of different Twitter accounts and start to connect with them.

51
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:55,130
We'll be talking more about mansions but it is a fantastic future replies.

52
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:59,160
It's the third of the five types of communication we're going to look at.

53
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:05,230
So we're apply is when we respond to another person's tweets where it appears for the sender it appears

54
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,380
on our profile page where does it appear for the recipient.

55
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:14,610
It's in their notifications tab as well like mentions replies will also appear in the recipient's home

56
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,210
time line if they are following the sender.

57
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:24,740
So if they're following us they're going to see it in their home timeline and also in their notifications.

58
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,410
So let's have a look at this.

59
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:35,360
If I come in to my timeline we can see a tweet from somebody that we are following.

60
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,600
We can at really reply.

61
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:40,660
So we can say

62
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,310
Great article and hit reply.

63
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:58,910
So once again this is going to appear in our tweets and replies here on our profile page so you can

64
00:04:58,910 --> 00:04:59,730
see there.

65
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:06,170
And it's also going to appear in the timeline of anybody who's following us.

66
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:07,160
So let's move on now.

67
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:16,400
We've also got tweets and what we could do is we can see a tweet from somebody that we think is great.

68
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,120
If we read tweet this

69
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:28,070
where does this appear while it appears on our profile page and it's going to appear in the timeline

70
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,890
of anybody who follows us.

71
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,810
So there's actually a separate article on this.

72
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:39,240
Read tweets and a retweet is really a reposting of a tweet.

73
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:45,830
And the use cases is that it helps you and others quickly share treat with all of your followers.

74
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,440
So that's essentially what it is.

75
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,720
Where do they appear.

76
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:53,380
You can see tweets by people who follow in your timeline.

77
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,790
And you also see it in your notifications.

78
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:06,620
So Charlie here will see in the notification that not only if I commented but also that I've retweeted

79
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,100
his article.

80
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:12,780
Find a way to communicate on Twitter is with direct messages.

81
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:19,380
And once again you could just type this in the Twitter help center to find out a little bit more about

82
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,260
this or get a refresher on us.

83
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:30,170
Go might have to twice like that.

84
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,480
So really direct messages are the private side of Twitter.

85
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,100
That's a great explanation for it.

86
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:40,990
And you can use direct messages to private conversations with people about tweets or other content.

87
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:45,980
So direct messages are the most private way to communicate on Twitter.

88
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:50,550
They won't be seen by either your followers or their followers.

89
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:54,400
So let's have a look at sending one of these.

90
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:56,860
We'll have a look in here and charities that can't.

91
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:02,860
Usually you'll see the option to direct message somebody right underneath their bio here and it seems

92
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,760
like Charlie has disable this.

93
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:08,170
So let's just have an look for another example here.

94
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:14,090
You can see that underneath their bio that they have that option to message.

95
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:21,180
And then you can send somebody a direct message here and it's only going to be at the recipient who's

96
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,030
really going to see that.

97
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:26,800
And that the private conversation between the two of you and this can be great if you want to reach

98
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,740
out to people and discuss something more private.

99
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:33,500
Or you can move on to an e-mail or something like that.

100
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:36,850
So it is another way to communicate on Twitter.

101
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:39,350
Some people will have enabled some people not.

102
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:47,220
Sometimes you need to follow the person before you can have a DMM or direct message them.

103
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:56,890
So recapping in this video what you learn to do is to send General tweets mentions replies read tweets

104
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,920
and direct messages.

105
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,090
Those are the five different ways that you can communicate with influencers potential customers or existing

106
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,050
customers on Twitter.

107
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:12,850
And remember if you do need refresher on any of those you can come into the tour help center and really

108
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:16,100
have a look at the guides there just to refresh your knowledge.
