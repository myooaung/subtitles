In this video you're going to learn how to set up a filter to exclude your visits from your Google Analytics

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.280
REPORTS.

3
00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:15.040
Now this is an important step to do as you set up your Google Analytics account because you want to

4
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.110
remove the visits that you make to your own site from the reports.

5
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:26.440
For example you could see that you have 50 visits to your Web site yesterday and you could think that's

6
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.310
great.

7
00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:34.780
However all 50 of those could be coming from you as you go into your site check things blog posts update

8
00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:35.910
things etc..

9
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.880
So without a filter you're not getting an accurate view of your data.

10
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:46.990
And that's really why you want to add one to access this screen then come down into the bottom left

11
00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:55.680
hand corner and click on admen then you can select the view that you want to add the filter to.

12
00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:02.770
In this case all the select my test view and then I can add the filter by clicking on filters.

13
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.480
Go ahead and click on filter.

14
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.480
You can give the filter the name

15
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.020
exclude

16
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:23.940
internal traffic only if it has a pre-determined predefined filter and select exclude because they want

17
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.640
to exclude my visits.

18
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:34.770
Now we have to have a way to identify my visits to the Web site so we can do that by excluding traffic

19
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.850
from my IP address.

20
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:45.440
Now an IP address is just an identifier and I can say my IP address is equal to my IP address.

21
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:55.090
Then to get my IP address you type in what's my IP to Google just copy that pasted in and click save.

22
00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:02.710
And now you set up that filter to exclude your internal traffic or your visits to the Web site.

23
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:09.610
Now a couple of things to note here that each device will have an IP address so if you're accessing

24
00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.600
your Web site from your phone you want to add an IP or filter for that.

25
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.130
If you are working from home you will have a different IP address.

26
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.520
And so you will want to that in as well.

27
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:30.320
If you have other coworkers they'll want to add in and exclude their IP addresses as well.

28
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.900
So now it's your turn to come into the admin section and add a filter to your google news reports so

29
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.150
you can have more accurate data.
