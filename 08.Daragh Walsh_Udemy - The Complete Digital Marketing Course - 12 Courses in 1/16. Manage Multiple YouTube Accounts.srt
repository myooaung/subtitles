Adding coworkers freelancers or clients to a YouTube channel that you have created is very simple.

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:13,030
First you just want to log into your YouTube accounts under your personal profile.

3
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:20,360
Then once inside you want to click on the icon for your channel and come down to switch it Cance.

4
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,670
It's in here that you're going to see all of the YouTube channels that you've created or are the owner

5
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:26,670
for.

6
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:30,450
And so what you want to do is just click on the channel that you want to on.

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:39,870
Owners or managers to once you see that you're logged into that channel you want to click the icon again

8
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,250
and come down into settings.

9
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,640
In here you'll see the option to add or remove.

10
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,500
Managers.

11
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:52,120
So just click on that and click again on managed permissions.

12
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:58,980
You can see here that you're on the primary owner and if I do want to invite new users I can just click

13
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,370
on this icon.

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:05,490
Then you just want to put in the email address of your colleague.

15
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,340
Who are clients and then you want to choose a role.

16
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:15,390
There are three options owner manager and communications manager.

17
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:22,740
Now if you want to get more details on what all these mean you can just click on the learn more and

18
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,480
you can scroll down to see them here.

19
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,390
In most cases though an owner is going to be appropriate.

20
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:35,280
If you're leaving a company and you want to hand full ownership back to a colleague or if you created

21
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:42,030
a YouTube channel for a client and you want to hand it back to them they can then afterwards remove

22
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,690
you as an owner if they don't want you to have access.

23
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:52,010
Managers is probably most appropriate then for colleagues so that they can upload videos respond to

24
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:52,890
common success.

25
00:01:52,890 --> 00:02:01,370
Tara So once you decided the role you just need to select this and then hit invite and see put their

26
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:04,520
email address in and they will get a notification.

27
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:09,940
So that is how you add owners or managers to YouTube channel that you've created.
