1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:07,470
In this video you're going to learn about event response sides and how you can promote your event with

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,560
Facebook ads.

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,960
So you get more response and have a successful event.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:19,610
We'll start by really understanding what events responses are and some of the benefits of them.

5
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:25,590
Then we will look and get some examples and understand some of the copy that you can use for these type

6
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,220
of ads to make them more successful.

7
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:32,610
We're going to look at a couple of case studies here just to get some ideas in terms of targeting and

8
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:39,420
other type of event ads we could set up that we'll look into Facebook and show you how to set up an

9
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,010
event on your Facebook page.

10
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,240
That's the first thing you need to do before you can actually promote it.

11
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:50,880
And then we will finish up once again inside the ads create to walk you through the process of setting

12
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,000
up events response.

13
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,950
And some of the things to look for when doing so.

14
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:59,190
So what is an event response.

15
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:06,540
Well it's as the name suggests you're really promoting your event to get more people to attend.

16
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,780
Now that could be an opening day.

17
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,370
It could be a launch of a product line in store.

18
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:19,470
But this is all going to happen off line these are off line events that we're really talking about here.

19
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:25,770
No as I said the first thing to do is create an event directly from your Facebook page and then you

20
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:31,190
spread the word with the adverts and you can choose your audience.

21
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:37,130
It can be based on age gender interest location you can use custom audiences as well.

22
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:43,350
And when a person joins your event or shows your interest it will automatically be added to their calendar

23
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:44,980
on Facebook.

24
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,190
So by promoting your event you're going to boost the awareness of it you're going to allow people to

25
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:56,310
say they're coming in a very simple way and then you have all of the insights and analytics on your

26
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,690
Facebook page to understand how many people are coming how many people have accepted as well.

27
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,660
So it's kind of it and a bad management solution as well.

28
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:11,980
Let's start to dig into some of the examples and have a look at what these really look like.

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,050
So I'm inside of the Facebook Ads guide you can come here anytime you want.

30
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:22,050
Just type it into Google and have a look at these great examples so you can see join us.

31
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,840
That's probably a good piece of copy to start with.

32
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:31,040
Join us at our Open House we'll be dishing at famous apple pie to show our thanks.

33
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:37,860
So there's a great free incentive for people to come in and you can see that there is a nice picture

34
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,990
of the event that's relevant.

35
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,300
You have a date here.

36
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,230
Very easy to see the time.

37
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:48,000
You can also see how many people are interested in going and how many are confirmed that they're actually

38
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,050
going.

39
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,020
So this is what looks like a desk top.

40
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:54,630
This is what it looks like on the news feed.

41
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:59,820
Here now let's have a look at a couple of case studies now in this case study.

42
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:05,730
They don't actually use this event response feature but I thought it was pretty interesting to just

43
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:10,890
look at some of the targeting that they did for this so they were really promoting ticket sales.

44
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,280
They did it in a slightly different way.

45
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:19,560
But you can see that the main target for their campaigns was a custom audience created from people who

46
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:29,040
have likes their Facebook page also ice hockey fans an online ticket buyer database that was there people

47
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,360
who'd bought the tickets previously.

48
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:37,430
And then what they also did is they targeted ads to a lookalike audience based off of this custom audience

49
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:43,610
so for your own event when you're setting that up you can target people who are your Facebook fans.

50
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,210
Create a custom audience for that.

51
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:49,570
You can create people who are interested in what you're offering.

52
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:55,260
And also if you've any customers you can target them as well from that database he can combine a number

53
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:03,650
of custom audiences into one audience for this campaign and then you can also in a separate set build

54
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,810
a look alike audience based off that as well.

55
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:11,340
So I wanted to show you this just to give you some ideas in terms of the targeting for this type of

56
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,760
event response.

57
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:18,140
Now let us look at another case study here's this from Miami Dolphins.

58
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:26,950
And again they were really trying to to to get people to an event and this event wasn't actually a game.

59
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:30,310
It was a tour of its new stadium.

60
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:37,310
And really what they did here was they generated 4600 high quality leads.

61
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,570
Now what was the goal of this.

62
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:44,040
Well the goal was to ultimately drive new season ticket memberships.

63
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,900
So a pretty smart strategy.

64
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:51,730
It is an event essentially it's a tour they have that incentive to get people involved.

65
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,740
Maybe like the the free apple pie that we've seen.

66
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:59,730
But really the goal was to drive those season ticket memberships.

67
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:05,800
Now once again they didn't actually use the event response feature.

68
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:13,260
But what they did is that they run a number of lead ads in inviting fans of the Facebook page I guess

69
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:17,210
to sign up for the new tour stadium.

70
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:23,550
So I wanted to show you this example just to show you that you don't have to just use the event response

71
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,330
feature to really create these type of ads.

72
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:30,600
You can be pretty creative in terms of using the lead ads as well.

73
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,730
If it's something more like you need their details and you want to keep the numbers down you can also

74
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,220
use the event response.

75
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:44,010
And if it's quite an open event and you don't need to really manage the numbers like you would here.

76
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:50,100
Now let's look into a Facebook page because the first thing you need to do to create an event response

77
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:56,220
is to actually create an event to come into your Facebook page and down on the side bar on the left

78
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:03,330
hand side here you can see events just click on that then you just need to go ahead and click Create

79
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,530
event.

80
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,150
Now you will you can change this photo as you want.

81
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:17,650
You can edit the name as always these fill these fields are really going to be dependent on the event

82
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:19,420
that you're setting up.

83
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:26,780
So you just put in your band name location the day that's perfect tomorrow.

84
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:35,770
And any details category's about if you want to include this stuff so maybe people think they can really

85
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:41,140
understand what this type of event is you can put a description and some keywords in there you can say

86
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:48,010
if it's kid friendly and free admission important things to to out in if people need to buy tickets

87
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,850
or even just reserve a ticket.

88
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:58,170
You can pop that in there and there are loads of online services where you can get you know free ticketing.

89
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:04,750
You can just look them up on Google in terms of cohosts and you can add people to help manage this.

90
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:08,920
Now here's a cool thing that you can do instead of publishing it straightaway to your page you might

91
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:14,710
want to work on it for a little bit maybe show some colleagues as you can save the drafts

92
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:22,960
and maybe show this to some colleagues work on it is a clear.

93
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,080
Are those exact dates we want to work from now.

94
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:34,460
Once you do publish what you want to do then is push it through the organic channels onto you know get

95
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:38,750
people posting on your Facebook page encourage people to to share to friends.

96
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:46,310
Then you can come in to your Facebook ads create two and really start to promote it through Facebook

97
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:49,210
ads so what is your marketing objective.

98
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,350
It's going to be engagement here.

99
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:59,520
And we're really looking at an event response here so selecting agent event response and click continue.

100
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:07,630
Now in terms of the audience for this as we said in this example here you could select a custom audience

101
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:12,430
so web site custom Orlean's people have engaged with your Facebook page youve talked about setting those

102
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:19,540
up before she can include numerous ones here if you want your local audience even except to trust you

103
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:30,310
like this example of the at Elsy Hage line here you can add that in and coming back here you can even

104
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:33,400
include location interests etc as well.

105
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:38,080
So weve gone through those type of things previously to him setting up your audience in terms of your

106
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,970
placements.

107
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:45,340
Then you can set these up as we discussed before your budget and schedule and identity and format this

108
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:49,090
is the piece thats a little bit different for this type of.

109
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:56,740
And you can see you have to select the Facebook page that you're promoting and then if I publish that

110
00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:02,460
event that will be showing up here and or I could just paste the URL straight in.

111
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:06,800
So in order for the events to show up here it personally has to be published.

112
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,080
So that's really the steps.

113
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:15,970
But from there it's fairly straightforward you just need to enter the text as usual and there's nothing

114
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:22,840
really different then from there on Cinelli you understand what event response ads are the copy that

115
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:28,750
you can use targeting options and even some alternatives on how to set it up inside the ads create to

116
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,580
go ahead and set one up for yourself.

117
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:36,090
If you want to reach more people who are likely to attend your next event.
