1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:06,620
In this video I'm going to show you a real quick way to come up at your first five tweets on Twitter.

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:13,240
And what we wanted to do is once again look at the top influencers in our age that we are following

3
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:19,980
and it's from these top influencers can center Naish that we're really going to get the ideas for our

4
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,360
first five tweets.

5
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:30,800
I'm going to go ahead and open up the five or six influencer cans I'm following here.

6
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:38,390
And this is where we're going to get everything that we need in order to come up with the ideas for

7
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,710
our first tweets.

8
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:47,680
Now to be clear what we are trying to achieve here is just to build some content on our Twitter page.

9
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:53,490
We don't expect to get any likes or engagement on these tweets because we have no followers.

10
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:59,450
So the purpose of doing this is to build out really a sample of the type of content and tweets that

11
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:00,750
we'll be putting out.

12
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,320
And then when we do go to encourage people to follow our account they'll get a clear understanding of

13
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,210
okay what is the what is the content you're putting out and why should I really follow you.

14
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:16,110
So the best way to come up with that content is just to look at these influencers.

15
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,630
And so what we can do is come in one by one and have a look at these.

16
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:25,520
So really what we're looking for are tweets that have had a huge amount of engagements on what we can

17
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,280
do if we to like a tweet.

18
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,290
We think it's a good idea it's maybe something we can do we just simply like this.

19
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:42,350
And then what's going to happen is if we refresh this we should see now in our likes top here any content

20
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:49,070
that we've liked and this can really be our short list of ideas for content that we can put at.

21
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,430
So I'm going to go through some of these.

22
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:56,270
Can Pick a side some ideas and then show you how to really make your own posts.

23
00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:01,190
So I think that is a great piece a great some something that we could do or something that we could

24
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:03,010
retweet and even comment on.

25
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:11,830
So what we've got here another great post he's sharing an article from a nother Web site in the nation

26
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:16,050
but he hasn't just shared the article he's added his own comments as well.

27
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,690
And that's something that's interesting and something that we could do as well that is a much better

28
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:27,860
way to get engagement and engage in the conversation on Twitter not just post a link but give your opinion

29
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:33,320
or say something about that and add your own little twist on to it.

30
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:40,160
That's a way to create a post very easily even if you're not creating the actual article that's there.

31
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,590
So let's keep going then.

32
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,870
OK so he has here a link to a blog post that he made.

33
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,590
So he's using Twitter to share blog content.

34
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:51,910
That's definitely something we could do as well.

35
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:52,730
OK.

36
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:53,390
Here he is.

37
00:02:53,390 --> 00:03:00,250
He's been featured in the book not something that we could do probably immediately as Brown you can

38
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,140
but it is something.

39
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:08,670
Again and he's sharing a blog content sharing your blog content as well.

40
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:19,570
And here we go some some more kind of comments on different things that we could do useful shortcut.

41
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:22,930
Maybe that's something we could do is a huge huge useful shortcut.

42
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:28,850
Quick tip like that and let's move on to another influencer then to get more ideas.

43
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,760
And this is more of a business account.

44
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,000
OK.

45
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:39,880
A simple way to friends to gift k a video.

46
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:46,220
This is a video uploaded to Twitter you can see it's got 1500 views so that's maybe something we could

47
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:52,190
do just record a quick video from our phone posted to our Twitter profile.

48
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:57,920
Wouldn't even have to look that professional but it gets a good amount of views and something very it's

49
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,740
a different type of content you can see it's very eye catching in the news feed here and even on their

50
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:09,110
profiles page it is something very attractive and really catches the eye.

51
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:15,570
So scrolling down a little bit is early retirement realistic dreams so that's a good kind of question.

52
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:23,310
At the start of sharing a blog there so they've asked a question to kind of hook you in.

53
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:30,700
And then they posted the the the blog there what investing questions you have for our experts.

54
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:30,990
OK.

55
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:35,730
So that's something interesting it's probably something I can do maybe not immediately but definitely

56
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:36,590
in the future.

57
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:41,600
And then they've got links off to their blog posts here.

58
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,660
Let's move on to a another example.

59
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:50,390
You can see just by going through different accounts he can build up ideas quite quickly.

60
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:52,850
OK.

61
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:57,180
So Calment What's the worst job you ever had.

62
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:59,370
They're really sharing at a blog post here.

63
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:06,620
But again as you can see they're trying to engage people in the conversation rather than just dropping

64
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,010
the link.

65
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:14,020
So that's pretty easily something we do here they've retweeted a visual image from another account something

66
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:17,510
Daphne we could do that's not too hard.

67
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,020
Moving on slowly then

68
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,010
sharing an article.

69
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,450
Ok sad news.

70
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:34,570
Again just read tweeting someone else that has a lot of mentions.

71
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:41,060
That means that something good that we could do because if we read tweet this something like this and

72
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,920
all of these people will be notified.

73
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:47,450
And that gets us on their radar.

74
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,280
So let's keep coming down.

75
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:53,970
Now as you can see it can take you a little bit of time just to go through.

76
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:58,330
But it's definitely much easier than trying to come up with stuff yourself.

77
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,840
Just come through on like these.

78
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,990
Did you ever use your shop Happy Monday.

79
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:05,520
True common.

80
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,110
I mean that's not too hard to do.

81
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,490
Or have a great weekend.

82
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:15,780
Maybe that's even a better thing to do if we've no audience it's maybe just to just say Happy Monday.

83
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,720
That's something we can do.

84
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,060
It's Monday today.

85
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:23,810
OK I'm going to take a minute just to have a look at some other ideas here.

86
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,860
Here's something interesting interesting I find you know the boom is back.

87
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:36,530
When you buy a coffee at a train station on the estate agents or advertising on the paper cup so that's

88
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:40,310
a something that is noticed just out and about.

89
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,680
It's a simple picture.

90
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,450
I mean taken most likely from his mobile phone and then just tweeted out.

91
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,890
And it's commentary on what's happening in the world.

92
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:50,900
Very simple.

93
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,410
I could definitely do that.

94
00:06:54,110 --> 00:07:00,320
Now coming down we'll look at the final profiles in number six and that's pretty cool.

95
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:05,610
I mean it's just the team from their business in their Christmas jumpers.

96
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:08,740
It's around Christmas time now and them.

97
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:12,960
So anything seasonal is also a great thing that you could tweet out initially.

98
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,770
You wouldn't need to have a huge audience for that and it just looks great.

99
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:22,870
People get a sense of who you are who your team is and that's something very easy you can do

100
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,470
OK.

101
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:34,640
So I've collected some ideas for my first tweets from those influencer cants disclose close all these

102
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:37,330
then so we can focus in them.

103
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:43,470
And I'm just going to refresh the page sort of 13 like so already there.

104
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:52,430
I have 13 ideas about what I could do and this is how you can come up with your first five or 10 posts

105
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,200
on Twitter.

106
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,540
Just look at what influencer is doing.

107
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:04,240
Like any one that you think you could easily replicate and then you can go ahead and do this.

108
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,210
It's very very simple videos.

109
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:16,730
You've got comments you've got sharing blog posts we've got comments on other articles and we have really

110
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,590
questions that they're asking the audience as well.

111
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:25,310
So what I'm going to do is go ahead and start doing my first tweet straightaway if you've got any other

112
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:28,010
tweets there that you just did for practice.

113
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,530
You can go ahead and delete them.

114
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:34,370
And one tweet I like there that was in our list was happy Monday.

115
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,830
We're almost near Christmas as well.

116
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:43,610
So what I can do is days.

117
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,820
So you get seven days of Christmas.

118
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:50,300
What I can do is be Monday.

119
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,590
Seven days

120
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,480
and maybe I can even put in a gif here.

121
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:07,170
So these are gifts that are actually built into Twitter.

122
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:08,280
That's putting in Christmas.

123
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,820
You can find free search for these.

124
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:18,810
So you something like this could be pretty funny just to put in it shows that it's seasonal it shows

125
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:21,060
that the account is active.

126
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:24,880
And there we go it's kind of a happy Monday to me.

127
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:32,160
But also seven days until Christmas and that's going to resonate with anybody who sees our profile right

128
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,930
now because it's timely.

129
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:39,870
It's something to do this Christmas and it definitely catches attention and something else that I think

130
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,390
I could do straight away.

131
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:51,040
Is we saw this conversation down here while we can actually do is read tweet tweet but we don't want

132
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,090
to just re read tweeter.

133
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:54,160
We want to add a bit of our comments as well.

134
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,950
So we want to have some content on our profile that relates to our topic and in this example just setting

135
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:02,770
up a personal finance type Twitter account.

136
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:12,260
So the tweet here originally is I think Bitcoin is a ridiculous Bacula But bubble and we can really

137
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:17,080
outer uncomment in here we can certainly like some heated debates.

138
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,850
In this thread

139
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,380
personally

140
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,040
it's a bubble

141
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,210
What do you think.

142
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:40,350
So there we've kind of outed our commons.

143
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,740
We've said water opinion as we've also asked a question as well.

144
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:54,190
So if we come to our profile now we've got something here that really odds are common as well to something

145
00:10:54,190 --> 00:11:00,520
else that has been written about and then really lays the foundation for a contest.

146
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:05,290
So once again we're not trying to get likes and comments and shares on the streets.

147
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:10,880
We're just trying to build the base of content on her profile so that people can see when they do come

148
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:17,050
in when we kind of go after them the followers that they understand what we are actually tweeting about

149
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,060
and why they should follow our Can't.

150
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:27,460
