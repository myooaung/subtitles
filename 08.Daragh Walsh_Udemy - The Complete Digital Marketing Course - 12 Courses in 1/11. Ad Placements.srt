1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:05,650
After you've selected the audience for your ad the next step is for you to select where you want your

2
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:07,080
ads to appear.

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:11,720
And this is actually a pretty quick thing to do but it is important to understand.

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:16,180
So to remind you we're still working in the asset level under placements here.

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,290
This is the second thing.

6
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:21,590
Last thing we have to do and then we'll be done with the set.

7
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:28,570
So in terms of where your odds are going to appear by default Facebook will automatically place them

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,780
into five different places.

9
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:34,220
So it's important to understand where these five places are.

10
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,130
If we click on the learn more bid button here we can find out.

11
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:44,280
So over here on the right hand side we can see that the first place is the Facebook mobile news feed.

12
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:51,880
The second Facebook desktop feed Facebook right hand column Instagram and the audience network.

13
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:57,090
So those are the five places now to explain a little bit more about the third place there.

14
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:05,140
Instagram if you didn't know already face back Facebook bought Instagram and they have allowed us through

15
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:14,080
this ad creates tool to advertise to the Facebook audience which is 150 million daily active users so

16
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,690
that's a lot of people a lot of great people that you can get your ad in front of.

17
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:25,720
Now the even cooler thing is that you don't need to have an Instagram account in order to run ads on

18
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,860
Instagram.

19
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:31,330
It is recommended that you have it but if you don't have it it's actually fine.

20
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:39,850
And what happens actually is Facebook will pull your Facebook profile and username and show that in

21
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:43,620
the normal profile that you would see on Instagram.

22
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:48,850
So the people who click on the out wouldn't even know that you didn't have an instagram account.

23
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:53,250
So that's a pretty handy feature that they've built in to enable that.

24
00:01:53,260 --> 00:02:01,720
Now the final place is the audience network and this is a network of apps and Web sites where Facebook

25
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,110
can also publish their ads.

26
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:07,210
Now they don't have a full list of where all those places are.

27
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:13,540
So in my opinion it's like it's a little bit gray area about where those ads are actually appearing.

28
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,480
So what I would recommend is for your first campaign you really want to think about where those placements

29
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:23,550
should be and perhaps you should even edit some of these placements.

30
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:27,440
Now if you want to remove some of those placements it's very easy to do.

31
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,650
You can come down for example to the audience network.

32
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,640
And I'm just going to take this here.

33
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:36,900
You can come in and Instagram and on Twitter if you want.

34
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:43,570
And what I'm going to do is really focuses on the Facebook news feed because that is the place where

35
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,660
people get a lot of click through is engage.

36
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:50,420
So I'm going to remove it from the right hand column instead of articles.

37
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,110
And as you can see my reach was two million people and dropping down to four.

38
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:57,200
Eighty.

39
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:03,850
Now from my experience in my campaigns as well for my particular audience they do a lot better on desktop

40
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,170
and they take a lot more action.

41
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:10,480
So I'm going to reduce that and select like device tied to be desktop only.

42
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:16,180
So if you're starting in your first campaign maybe something to think about is just to concentrate on

43
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,730
the Facebook news feed.

44
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:23,020
But of course this is once again going to depend on your audience the type of ad that you're putting

45
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:23,460
out.

46
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,610
But now I understand the options and we're almost finished with the outset level.

47
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:32,790
Just finally the budget and schedule which we'll cover in the next video.

48
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:33,960
I'll see there.
