In this video youre going to learn a couple of tips and tricks to reduce the spam on your Instagram

2
00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:08.870
account.

3
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:15.470
So the first thing that you can actually do is turn off Commons altogether when you do post on Instagram.

4
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.670
So I'm just going to walk through the steps of say adding picture here.

5
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:23.380
Just going to go next.

6
00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:30.980
Skip the filters and then down here in advanced settings you can see do the option to turn off commenting

7
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.250
all together.

8
00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:39.260
And as it says here you can actually beside the post turn that back on if you want later on but that

9
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:46.820
option is is there just to turn off commenting altogether if it might be a controversial post or you

10
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.240
are just tired of the comments for a while.

11
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:50.090
That option is there.

12
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.510
Thats a pretty new feature.

13
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.540
So its good to know that that exists.

14
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.050
Now let me come back Council not upload.

15
00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:03.720
I'm never going to go into the settings for your Instagram account and this is where you can adjust

16
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.820
the settings not just for an individual post but across your whole account.

17
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.330
So firstly what you can do is adjust the settings for your stories if you want as well.

18
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.090
You can allow or disallow messages.

19
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.830
So right now when you post a story or when I post a story anybody can message me right back.

20
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:30.570
You can change that to just people I follow or I can turn that off completely and probably initially

21
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.030
if you're just getting started on scrummy be delighted to get a message from a story.

22
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.960
But after a while it could become a little bit overwhelming.

23
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.790
So you can allow them to turn that off as well.

24
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.200
And so that's a pretty handy feature to have as well.

25
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.330
And there's some other things that you can allow sharing etc..

26
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:57.780
Coming away from stories coming into just your normal posts if we come down here to the commenting section

27
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:06.000
you can see that this is the place where you can really set up some filters.

28
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.640
So comments with certain keywords can be filtered out and you can actually block certain people as well

29
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:16.500
here so you can allow comments from everybody by default or just people you follow and your followers

30
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.600
people follow or your followers so you can adjust those settings if you want.

31
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.670
You can also block comments from certain people if you know it's kind of a couple of abusive people.

32
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.820
You can just type in their name there as it says here.

33
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.300
They won't be notified when you block them.

34
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.840
And any new comments that they make on your posts won't be visible to anyone but them.

35
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.110
So they won't really be aware and their comments are not being viewed by everybody.

36
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:51.240
But essentially that allows you to remove them if there's someone who's kind of getting abusive on Instagram.

37
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:57.490
They're coming on down here you can see that by the fall there is a filter to hide offensive comments.

38
00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.650
But you can also get more specific if you want and enable a manual filter where you can put in key words

39
00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.980
or phrases that you want to be filtered out from the Commons automatically and you can just come in

40
00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:16.520
here maybe add one and then add another one separated by a comma and then all of those comments are

41
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.330
going to be filtered out.

42
00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:24.110
So that saves you coming in after each tiny posts and filtering the my team to set these filters to

43
00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.360
automate the process for you.

44
00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:34.850
So once again there is a lot of great ways to reduce spam or messages in general comments just on Instagram.

45
00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:41.630
You can do it when you post where you can come in and do it on your profile settings or your Instagram

46
00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:42.700
settings as well.

47
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:48.590
So take a look it's very handy and it can save you a lot of time and keep your Instagram and family

48
00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:49.160
friendly.
