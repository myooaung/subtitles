In this video you're going to learn how to link your outwards account to your Google Analytics account

2
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.990
and we share data between the two platforms.

3
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:17.360
So to do that you want to come into your admin section and then click on Adwords and then you can really

4
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.980
link a new group.

5
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:26.090
Now I've already set this up here and all you really have to do is click on link a new group if you're

6
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.760
logged into your Google account.

7
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.370
It's just going to show it right there.

8
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.830
You can see it's already linked for me.

9
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.940
And then you just need to continue.

10
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.940
And that's really it.

11
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.920
It's so simple to link up the Adwords and analytics are not easy.

12
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.990
The main reason that you want to do this is so that you can really track what people who come from odd

13
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:57.500
words do on your site after they click through so Google Adwords will give you a detailed dashboard

14
00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.580
about what campaigns are working keywords the different gods etc..

15
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:09.440
But if you really want to get a lot of information here in your AdWords reports on your acquisitions

16
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:16.190
section and understand what those users do after they click through on your site does that really lead

17
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:23.560
to a sale on your site et cetera then it is great idea to link these two accounts and get that set up.

18
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:31.310
So once again come into the admin section and you can do that under your property and the odd ones odd

19
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.680
words linking section.

20
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:39.310
Just remember you will need added access in order to link both onwards and Analects up together.
