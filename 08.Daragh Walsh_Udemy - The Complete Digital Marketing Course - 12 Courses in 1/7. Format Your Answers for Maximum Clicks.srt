00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:06,570
In this video you are going to learn how to answer a question on curagh seeking at maximum Chicks back

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:13,770
to your Web site and also answer it so you can stand out from competing answers and be the top answer

3
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:19,080
for the question so that you can really get a hold of views for the question.

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:19,830
OK.

5
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,630
So I'm going to walk you through just how to answer a question the process that I use and the first

6
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,300
thing to do is really to edit your credential.

7
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:35,190
So as you can see right now says Zama certified Google marketer etc. but this doesn't really relate

8
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,250
specifically to the question that I'm answering.

9
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:45,120
And so what gives me the opportunity to do is just edit my credential and make it more relevant to the

10
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,730
question that I Mansouri than the reason that I would want to do this is because if we scanned and here

11
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:59,730
at some of the other competing answers I can see digital marketing experience marketing content copywriter.

12
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,540
So nobody here is really saying that they're like Facebook card's expiration and an easy way that I

13
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:13,650
can stand and then is just to change my credential I can get a credential for this topic Facebook ads.

14
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,530
So mean this in

15
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,840
and every time that I answer a question about Facebook gods it'll show against plants or that I'm a

16
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,810
the cots expert.

17
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:39,110
So I can say that now that I can see that's come up and just click out of this and you can see it's

18
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,120
changed to Facebook Ads X..

19
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:46,510
So if somebody is scanning that and through the answers here they see right next to my name I'm an expert.

20
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:54,470
Well then automatically I have an advantage over the other writers here because I seem like I'm more

21
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,780
of an authority on the topics.

22
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:01,710
That's a simple trick just to get ahead of the competition without even answering your question.

23
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:09,560
Now in terms of how do you stand that once you write your answer will I think you really need to essentially

24
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,170
write a headline that's going to grab people's attention.

25
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:17,890
So the question is how effective is the new Facebook the ads.

26
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:25,280
And so I really wanted to write something that's going to grab the attention of somebody who has that

27
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,140
same question in their mind.

28
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:32,140
So what I'd like to do is write a headline something like lead outs are a huge deal.

29
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:36,440
So that is going to pull them into start reading my question.

30
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:44,980
Now the next thing that I like to do for all of my questions is to after my headline in a relevant image

31
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:51,970
so I'm going to upload an image from my desktop here that relates to the question.

32
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:58,490
So this is a visual of what the leader on Facebook looks like.

33
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:01,710
So you can see there's three basic steps to it.

34
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:09,520
So already I've got a headline that stands out then an image that relates to the question and if I scanned

35
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:16,530
and three other answers here none of these people have images where they don't have any headline that's

36
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:22,450
grabbing my attention so I think already after changing my credential headline or an image I'm ahead

37
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,950
of everybody here.

38
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:28,990
And that's really what you want to be thinking about not just answering questions but answering questions

39
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,700
better than anybody else.

40
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:40,060
Now after that you want to maybe give a quick summary so that you know you're a huge deal and give a

41
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,490
little bit of an explanation of why they're a big deal.

42
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:50,760
So I got in an Art Shell and I want to leave that unbolted lead on to reduce the sign a process to just

43
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,990
two clicks without ever leaving Facebook's.

44
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,720
That's a little bit of an explanation of the image here.

45
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:04,170
And then you can go on to give a little bit more detail so obviously I've got this prepared before this

46
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:16,400
can take you a little bit of time and just on both this thankfully they give you a little spell checker

47
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:17,050
there.

48
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:23,940
So I'm saying this is a huge deal for mobile users that no longer have to wait for a new page to load

49
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,950
and Trojan through external web sites.

50
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:31,770
I'm saying what are the advantages of these ads are backing up really the headline here that I've said

51
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:35,020
the ads are a huge deal why are they a huge deal.

52
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:43,440
And I go on to explain it that it really makes it easy for people to sign up and submit their information

53
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,180
to your business.

54
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:55,510
And also the Facebook pre-populated sign up form and there's no pain for people to fill that at.

55
00:04:55,540 --> 00:05:00,940
Maybe give some information to back up or statistics to back up the answer that you're giving.

56
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,860
So here we go.

57
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:08,340
I'm backing it up now I'm saying this development has led to amazing results for businesses.

58
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:15,670
I've seen businesses generate 60 percent more leads then they expect to go at 37 percent lower cost

59
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,400
per lead.

60
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:22,600
So I've not only said how it's different from one of the benefits of it but also some of the results

61
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:30,170
that are being driven the business and it's always good to include a link to a resource in your answers.

62
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:40,180
I've said here that the best part is that the leads gathered from the Dadds always good to check the

63
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:44,750
spelling coming directly out of here database VSC or am sinking.

64
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:53,500
So this is just some information linking off to Facebook about how to actually integrate delete ads

65
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,090
with your CRM system.

66
00:05:55,090 --> 00:06:02,310
So again essentially just a backing up why am I saying they're so good.

67
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,410
And once I've given the answer this is the key part.

68
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:12,430
So by being helpful in my answer and now I want to really get them back to my Web site.

69
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:21,010
So what I've said here is you know if you want to learn more about it it's how to set up lead in other

70
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:24,370
types of face the kinds of documented everything here.

71
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:31,810
And then I think back to my product where I have a full explanation on how to do Facebook cards etc.

72
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:40,570
so we can see that I've just included a link there to my site and you can do that easily.

73
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:49,350
You can hide in the link like that and then you just want to click submit and maybe have a quick read

74
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:49,970
through it.

75
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:54,030
Maybe we could see a bit of a block of text here.

76
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:54,930
Maybe we could

77
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,010
help some things stand there.

78
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:13,530
Pre-populated to sign up for and maybe it is just two clicks.

79
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,790
So it's good to

80
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,570
unbolt this part.

81
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:32,190
To both some of the text in there to really help people look at the key points in there and that will

82
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:35,930
help you start a note from the competitors who just have a block of text.

83
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,730
So now I'm going to submit my answer.

84
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:47,160
I now have the option to share this on Facebook or Twitter which can be great too if you are following

85
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:47,560
there.

86
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:52,480
For now I'll just skip it and then we can come back and look at the question here.

87
00:07:54,540 --> 00:08:02,230
And right now I'm just already automatically in the in the first second third fourth position.

88
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:09,850
But as more people begin to see this question and even if I go ahead and share that out on social networks

89
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:13,410
then I'm going to start to get views on this.

90
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:19,320
When people are going to start to opt for this question so I can move towards the top.

91
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,840
But as you can see I think it definitely does stand out a lot better than the other questions there

92
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:31,410
that you know how to answer questions on your own and structure them to get the most visibility and

93
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,210
click through.

94
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,910
Go ahead and answer a question for yourself.
