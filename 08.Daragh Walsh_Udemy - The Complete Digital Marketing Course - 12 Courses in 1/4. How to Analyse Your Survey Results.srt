1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:07,860
That once you have distributed your survey the next step is to analyze the responses and you can analyze

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,260
them right here inside Google Forms.

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:17,700
Just click over the responses tab and you can see the different responses to your questions plus any

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,270
e-mail addresses that were submitted.

5
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:27,190
So you can analyze them here and this can be fun to look at as the responses are coming in.

6
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,270
But what I would recommend you do is wait and see when the responses stop coming in.

7
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:38,310
You'll notice that because this number stops going up and that will probably be one to two days depending

8
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,920
on how much you've promoted the survey.

9
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:47,130
So to look at it in a deeper level and really analyze it I would recommend you view the responses in

10
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:47,910
Google sheets.

11
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,490
Open that up right away.

12
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:56,580
And the first thing that you want to do is select the top row here on what you want to do is really

13
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,010
put on a filter.

14
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,020
And the reason you want to do this is because we want to filter down our responses and really just look

15
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:12,850
at the responses that say people have a problem that they find very difficult to resolve.

16
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:13,770
Now why are we doing that.

17
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:20,040
Well remember we if we want to create a successful product or service or even a piece of content like

18
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:27,150
a blog post or video we need to be solving problems that are not well solved in the marketplace.

19
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:33,660
And that's why we why we really want to focus on this and you can see if we scroll down here just to

20
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:40,560
the third response give you a visual we can see that around 30 40 percent of the answers.

21
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,240
People said it's a very difficult problem for them to solve.

22
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:52,760
So by just filtering that there we removed 60 percent of the problems that people don't think are that

23
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,970
important or not that hard to solve.

24
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:04,770
And we're just focusing on at 40 percent which for this survey is about 80 responses as opposed to over

25
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:05,280
200.

26
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,330
So just makes it easier to analyze it as well.

27
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,970
And the next thing you want to do is go ahead and open up a different tab here.

28
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,800
You can use that like that.

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:27,170
What we're going to do in this tab is just write down problem and why resolves.

30
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,510
So these are two important things that we want to get out of this survey.

31
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:37,050
When we look at it we want to know what the problem actually is and why it's going to be important for

32
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:40,870
them to resolve it so that really come from these two columns.

33
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,250
So let's just go on have a look at it here.

34
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:49,050
So again not every response is going to be perfect so you're going to just have to go through one by

35
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,220
one and through them and pick them.

36
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,710
So let's see the problem here.

37
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,730
What's your biggest challenge.

38
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,780
Can you show me the most direct path towards getting a minimal viable product in the marketplace.

39
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:00,210
Okay.

40
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,140
That's a great problem to solve.

41
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:13,300
So what we can do is I always like to frame the problems as like how to delete this when I did earlier.

42
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,890
So we can start fresh.

43
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:19,230
And while we can just pop this in

44
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:29,110
and what I like to think about is if I was writing this as a course or a piece of content or you'd like

45
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:32,820
a blog post or a YouTube video what would the title be.

46
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,920
It's always just easiest to started but had to.

47
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:41,580
So how to get a minimal viable product into the marketplace let's say in one day because they're looking

48
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,490
for speed.

49
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:46,790
That's what they said in their response here.

50
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,330
Let me get back to this.

51
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:49,720
OK.

52
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:54,270
It would save me save time and aggravation.

53
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,020
So that's a benefit.

54
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,090
I'm going to close this down actually because I keep thinking back to it.

55
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:04,470
So you know why would they why do they want to resolve this why would they buy our product or read a

56
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:08,290
blog post to save time and aggravation.

57
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:14,230
And they're really looking for a streamlined process.

58
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:20,940
So that's another benefit of them maybe buying our product or service or reading or blog posts so get

59
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:28,100
a streamlined process so you can see already here.

60
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:34,620
Just reading one response what I've got first for me is a potential course that I could make or even

61
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:42,060
a potential section or lecture within a course of potential blog posts a potential YouTube video that

62
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:46,920
is tailored to my audience and that would really resolve a problem that they have.

63
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:52,080
What are some of the benefits that I could mention at the start of the video or course or put on a sales

64
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,140
page or in a Facebook ad.

65
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,700
Look this is going to save you time and aggravation.

66
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:01,710
You're going to get a streamlined process to get a minimal viable product into the marketplace in one

67
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:02,210
day.

68
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:08,120
That's a very good pitch an offer and it resolves a pain point that people have.

69
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,870
So that's only one answer.

70
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,870
Now let's go down and have a look.

71
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:13,770
OK.

72
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:20,910
All beginning again same process I'm just going to do three of these to give you examples of what you

73
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,000
should be looking for.

74
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:27,930
And then obviously your responses are going to be different so hard to obtain and Kline's trust I guess

75
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,410
as a digital marketer is really what they're asking here.

76
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:40,210
And why would they want to do this you know grow your business steadily.

77
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,910
That's.

78
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:48,740
That's why they want to resolve this because they think trust is a big barrier to signing clients.

79
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:54,880
And that's true.

80
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,520
How can you get them to trust you.

81
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:02,550
They're going to hand over money and access to you know their analytics or whatever.

82
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:06,390
So this is a big barrier for a lot of people how do you overcome that.

83
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:13,480
That could be a great lecture or a course or a blog post or whatever could be a great Something piece

84
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,150
of sales coffee on a course or Facebook gods.

85
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:22,930
Again you just copy and paste this is the why this process is so beautiful powerful because there's

86
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:24,440
very little work for you to do.

87
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,490
Once you start to analyze this.

88
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,010
So let's have a look here this looks interesting.

89
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,820
How does Voice Search affect SEO.

90
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,560
This could be something interesting.

91
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:41,190
You know how to hide two benefits.

92
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,550
Moyses SEO maybe

93
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:56,060
or two ranked number one

94
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,410
phone voice the CEO on mobile.

95
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:09,050
Safe for example.

96
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:16,750
So I'm just thinking about you know what does the have to look like to resolve that problem.

97
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:18,810
And why would they want to do this.

98
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,570
You know leverage voice

99
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:36,030
leverage voice voices the show to get to that leverage voices here in NY to get free traffic to your

100
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:36,900
site.

101
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:47,560
So you can see I'm using what I'm hearing from the customer here and adding how you know putting my

102
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,700
spin on why they would want to do that.

103
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:57,910
And this allows me just looking at three responses to find products and services that people desperately

104
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:06,880
need and will pay money for and also gather powerful sales copy that I can use on my sales page and

105
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:11,690
Facebook ads in emails and other marketing materials.

106
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:19,240
So that is the process to analyze your survey results in order to find those product ideas and get that

107
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,660
powerful sales copy.
