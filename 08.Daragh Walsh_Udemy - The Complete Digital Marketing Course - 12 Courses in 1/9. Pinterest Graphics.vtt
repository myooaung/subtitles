00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:05.610
In this video you're going to learn how to make custom graphics from Pinterest so that you can get even

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.910
more clicks through to your Web site.

3
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.210
Now you can see that I do have a graphic for this in here.

4
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.250
And this was taken directly off my blog post on my web site.

5
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.520
However when I created this blog post I didn't have Pinterest specifically in mind as a marketing channel

6
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:29.910
and I didn't create this image for Pinterest so I just created for my blog posts and so I think that's

7
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:30.560
OK.

8
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.180
But actually if we look go into look at the search bar and we look for create a Web site which would

9
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.780
be essentially competitor pins for this article is that Sadak creating a Web site you can see that people

10
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.980
have these really cool visual graphics psychotic create a web site to create your own web site.

11
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.960
Essentially these are like the thumbnails on a YouTube video.

12
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.150
This is what gets that clicks because Pinterest is such a visual platform.

13
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:06.630
It can be necessary or you can get better results really if you create these custom graphics so you

14
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.170
can see it that is likely to get a lot more pictures than the one that I have put here which doesn't

15
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.980
really kind of give you communicate visually what the post is about.

16
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.280
And he can see it slightly slower as well.

17
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.230
It's not the kind of dimensions that are suited to interests.

18
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.360
So how do you make your own graphics like this for free.

19
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.510
Well you can do it in a tool called convert dot com.

20
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.000
It's absolutely free to sign up for and use.

21
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.840
And the recruiting by Columbine's once you sign up and create an acquaints income to create a design

22
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.200
and then you're going to see this auction for a Pinterest graphic which gives you a template for the

23
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.440
exact dimensions that you can use for Pinterest.

24
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:57.190
So I get to go in here and design a better image for that post so I can get more traffic to my site.

25
00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.550
Schooling is about Kamba that there are all these templates.

26
00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.140
Here in the site that are really easy to manipulate and he is.

27
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.070
So here's what I think is pretty cool.

28
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.540
It's got that nice white border around the west side.

29
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:25.060
And if I want to change the tax I'm going to say the effortless way to set up a Web site in five steps.

30
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.570
Now the cool thing is is well done at the bottom of this image.

31
00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.580
I can just put in my web site.

32
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.990
And this is good for two reasons.

33
00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:39.250
One it just communicates to people you know that they should come to my website see all the details

34
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.080
here.

35
00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:41.800
That gets into to click through.

36
00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.560
And also no one can reuse this image because it's got my details there as well.

37
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.810
I will want to change the background image because that's not really relevant to what I'm doing.

38
00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.960
So I can select that and then click delete.

39
00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:01.480
And what you can do is put your own backgrounds different colors there or I might do is use an image

40
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.630
that I've uploaded that that's really bright background so you can see you know it's really popping

41
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.020
off the page.

42
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:13.460
Now I do want to communicate a little bit more visually what this post is about.

43
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:19.350
The cool thing about Canada is they have a lot of icons here which I can use.

44
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:20.310
Some are paid.

45
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.820
And that's how they make their money.

46
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.210
So all these elements are paid.

47
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.040
But a lot of them you can use for free.

48
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:32.750
So what I can do is just drag and drop this and make this pretty big so catches people's attention.

49
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:38.150
You can see that Kamba really helps you center things make it look really good.

50
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.590
And Alex too bad.

51
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.410
And now I'm going to really use this.

52
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.540
Go ahead and see if you can see that.

53
00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.960
I think took me less than a minute to do and it looks pretty good.

54
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:57.330
And actually what I'm actually might do is just decided that I'm actually going to change the text

55
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.340
to black.

56
00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:07.060
So this is the cool thing as well if you want if you want to change your mind about how to use the tax

57
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.340
it's no big deal.

58
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.500
You need multiple versions.

59
00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.030
It's not going to cost you anything.

60
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:20.620
So now I think that it's better all-Black through the park and more page more and you can even move

61
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.800
some of these elements around as well.

62
00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.250
And why just so slightly so there you go.

63
00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.830
I think that's pretty cool.

64
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.480
So you get a standard

65
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:38.470
and then we're going to do is apply this to pictures.

66
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:45.710
So now I have got my design but I want to do is come back to you can just read my profile and what I

67
00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.750
can do is create a pin for my device and upload the image.

68
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.500
So I set up a Web site

69
00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.040
five steps.

70
00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:02.110
Now I can take that you were else in this pop.

71
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.610
And then select the page that I want to put her back.

72
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.340
And I think that looks a lot better looking at it again.

73
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.540
Maybe I could edit it slightly to make it a little bit better.

74
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:20.910
But definitely you can see in even the pins that I have them here this pop say I think 10 times more

75
00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:22.960
than the original one here.

76
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.710
So you can really see the value of creating these custom graphics.

77
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:33.570
They will help you get a lot more attention a lot more breakthroughs a lot more traffic and ultimately

78
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:34.760
unlock more sales.

79
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:40.620
And the coolest thing is that you can do absolutely for free on Kamba and use the templates that they

80
00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:41.800
have there.
