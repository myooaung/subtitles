00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,240
In this video you're going to learn a very quick and simple way that you can reposed other people's

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:13,220
content on Instagram and reposting content like the image that you can see on screen here is not only

3
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:21,770
a way to really get free content and to publish on Instagram but it's also a way to connect with other

4
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:22,880
in ceramic cans.

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:30,050
So for example on screen here you can see Dave Ramsey has reposted an image from another catch.

6
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:36,920
Jenny eats donuts and you know that this is reposted because it's showing it in the bottom left hand

7
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,620
corner of the image and also in the comments below.

8
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,550
Here you can see hash tag he posts.

9
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:49,910
So Dave Ramsey has added a Commons on top of the original comments which you can see is down here and

10
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:58,200
it's a great way you can see got 15 times and likes and it's a great way to maybe highlight someone

11
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,870
and your audience is doing very well.

12
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:03,090
Hit it go like this that you're trying to encourage other people to do.

13
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:08,210
We're just somebody that senior space or similar kind that's doing something really cool.

14
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:14,180
You want to share with your audience so just a fantastic way to solve the content problem on Instagram.

15
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,350
What do you post.

16
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:20,800
And also just make connections as well in scrammed is all about engaging with people.

17
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,980
So if you want to post other people's content like this very easily.

18
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:31,220
Well then you want to go into your browser and you want to go ahead and download repos for Instagram.

19
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:36,860
This is a separate app that will allow you to repo's just like that example that I Shoji.

20
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:43,490
So you can see it's on the left hand corner here and it's got 40000 reviews and it's absolutely free

21
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:45,150
as well.

22
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:51,350
And once you've got that downloaded then you just want to open up the repo's stop and you can see that

23
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:58,070
you can click into Instagram and what you want to do here is really go ahead and look for any posts

24
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:02,630
that you might want to repose so let's just come into this again.

25
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:08,500
And maybe let's think about if I wanted to repost this as an example.

26
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:15,890
I click on the top right hand corner the three dots here I'd copy the link and you can see that link

27
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:24,020
has been copied to the clipboard inside the reposed free Instagram app.

28
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:30,630
So what I can do is come back to at the repo's for Instagram.

29
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,070
I can see it's been copied there.

30
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:37,920
Now I want to go ahead and repost thus us and you can see now that I've got the image with the little

31
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:43,160
pre-post symbol and the account holders name in the bottom left hand corner of the screen.

32
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,540
So now I can go ahead and click reposte

33
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:50,180
and it's going to show you how to paste the caption.

34
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,130
So this is great as well.

35
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,420
Saves you typing a the caption that they originally had.

36
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,520
And I'll show had to do this you just literally go down and click paste.

37
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:03,710
It's actually copied in the clipboard as well as the image really just takes that a couple of great

38
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,130
steps.

39
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,710
Why this app is so cool.

40
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,610
So I got that.

41
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:11,320
Now I want to share it to in Stroom.

42
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,540
It's going to open up.

43
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:19,170
I can pick sharing my story on my feet as usual and then like uncropped for if I need to just click

44
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:19,870
next.

45
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:23,420
And select a filter for one to click next.

46
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,500
And here is where we write the caption.

47
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:34,560
So what I can do is hold then my finger and you can see now if I click paste that is going to be the

48
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:42,810
original comments from Gary V and you can see it even says reposte and it mentions the OP there as well.

49
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:50,280
So what I can do is go ahead and add in my my own comments

50
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:54,670
if you wanted to.

51
00:03:54,870 --> 00:04:00,220
And you can put in your comments as well and then you just click OK and then you click share.

52
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:05,470
And now that has been shared or reposted on my Can't you can see it's coming up under my name.

53
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:12,170
You can see it's as the kind of the image there re post-cart V and then you can see my commentary if

54
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:14,740
I'd put in a bigger column it would have appeared there.

55
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,560
And then the original Colman's under me.

56
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:23,240
So that's a great way that I can share something I think is interesting from other accounts on Instagram

57
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,410
with my audience that's valuable content for them.

58
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:33,140
Also it takes a couple of minutes you know a lot easier than creating your own content maybe and also

59
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:41,030
maybe be able to re start to form a conversation or a relationship this big it can't.

60
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:45,980
Now this particular guy is quite a big account but he can do with maybe smaller cans and make those

61
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:49,210
connections and start those conversations a lot quicker.

62
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:55,370
Now if I come back to my profile you can see that that's there on my account as well.

63
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:59,710
So that is how you repo's on around very quickly and easily.

64
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:05,540
The key to it all is this re post for Instagram app which is absolutely free and you can go ahead and

65
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:08,310
then load it really makes the process a lot easier.

66
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,940
So I hope you enjoy that and make good use of it.
