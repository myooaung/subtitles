00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,450
In this video you're going to learn how you can perform in-depth analysis in Google Analytics by using

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:14,880
custom dashboards and custom dashboards appear here inside the customization section of your Google

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,530
Analytics account.

4
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:23,670
So really what this is enabling you to do is go beyond the standardized reports that you find in Google

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:32,130
Analytics and create custom dashboards or reports for yourself by creating the CS customized dashboards.

6
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:38,760
You can really do that in-depth analysis and see correlations that you might see inside the standardized

7
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,910
reports.

8
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:47,450
So if we come in to the dashboards here we can see that there's already a number of ad dashboards set

9
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:49,850
up in this Google Analytics account.

10
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:56,670
For example if we click into these side performance dashboard what we can see here are many metrics

11
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,090
related to site performance in one place.

12
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,270
So why would you want to set up a dashboard about site performance.

13
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:11,100
Well many of these metrics you wouldn't find them normally in one report.

14
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:18,060
So what you can do is really gather the information and put them into one dashboard like this so you

15
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:25,140
can monitor this particular aspect of your Web site in a very focused way.

16
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,390
Now you also might want to create a dashboard say if there's somebody on your team who's responsible

17
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:36,450
for more technical stuff about your Web site and in particular site performance well then you can create

18
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:42,410
this dashboard for them so they can really focus on improving these particular metrics.

19
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:48,270
They might not have anything related to do to marketing or advertising so they don't really need to

20
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,520
see all of this other stuff down here.

21
00:01:52,530 --> 00:02:00,420
So the way that these dashboards work is that these are actually widgets and these are summaries of

22
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,280
different reports or metrics taken from different reports.

23
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:09,870
And that's the advantage of these dashboards that you can see a lot of different metrics and reports

24
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:16,680
or a summary of them in one place and that allows you to see different correlations be tween metrics

25
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:23,310
and really spot trends and opportunities to grow so as well as creating dashboards for things like site

26
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:30,240
performance you could create it for say somebody who's responsible for the PPC advertising or responsible

27
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,240
for SEO.

28
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:38,390
You can create those dashboards for those different roles or for those different aspects of the business.

29
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:45,030
Now there are two ways to add dashboards to your Google Analytics account.

30
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:51,750
The first way is to create them from scratch yourself and you can pick a blank canvas like this click

31
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:59,280
Create dashboard and then you can go ahead and build up an ad in these widgets.

32
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:04,060
Taking those metrics or reports or summaries for them and putting them in one place.

33
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:09,960
Now there is a little bit more advanced and can be quite quite time consuming.

34
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:17,400
So the easier way to add dashboards to your Google Analytics accounts is really to get them from other

35
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,010
Google Analytics users who's who've already built them.

36
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:26,540
And the easy way to do this is to come into the Google analytics solutions gallery.

37
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:33,330
This is where different Google Analytics users share the templates for their custom dashboards and reports

38
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:39,180
and you can really import these into your Google Analytics accounts in one click.

39
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:45,150
So there are a list of the most popular custom dashboards and reports here or you can also say search

40
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:48,980
for one specifically if you want to find that.

41
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:56,580
And you can see here SVOD dashboard there is top content in keywords you can look at something like

42
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:04,980
this a starter bundle which if you click to import you can see this not only contains some custom dashboards

43
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,870
here but also some custom reports.

44
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,100
That's really a big starter bundle and you just have to click Create there.

45
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:19,260
And that is going to be imported into your Google Analytics accounts and then you'll find all of those

46
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:25,470
once you import them underneath your custom dashboards and custom reports.

47
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:32,100
So the cool thing about the dashboards is there's those two ways to add them and it's great that you

48
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,260
can just go to the solutions gallery and import a load of them check them out.

49
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:41,790
Now one thing that you can do also is if you've imported some dashboards and you find well that's way

50
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,580
too technical or it's not what I'm really looking for.

51
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:50,640
What you can do is come in and collectively dashboard and you can just get rid of them and focused in

52
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,250
on what you need.

53
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:59,220
So if you do create dashboards and you want to share them with team members what you can do is come

54
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:05,790
in here you can export these dashboards so if you wanted to give a specific report to say a boss on

55
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:10,620
site performance you can export the dashboard as a PDA.

56
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:15,900
And that really gives them like a printout that you could present in a meeting or in a presentation

57
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,690
really showing the key metrics related to say your specific role.

58
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:27,900
You could give this to clients for example to really give them some metrics to see how it's performing.

59
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,530
Now there are a couple of limitations with custom dashboards.

60
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:42,780
You can have up to 20 dashboards per account and also within each dashboard you can only have 12 widgets

61
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:49,880
or 12 kind of snapshots of different metrics or reports so choose those wisely.

62
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:56,400
So in summary custom dashboards allow you to go be on the standardized reports and get a dashboards

63
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,770
full of metrics and reports that are specific to your business or roll.
