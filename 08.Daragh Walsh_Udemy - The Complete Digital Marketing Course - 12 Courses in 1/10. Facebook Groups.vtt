In this video you're going to learn how to find groups on Facebook that contain your target audience

2
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.190
and how you can promote your business to them in those groups.

3
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:17.670
So define the groups what do you want to do is come up to this search bar in Facebook and type in keyword

4
00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:18.710
for your business.

5
00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.310
So imagine that I was a financial planning consultant.

6
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:29.480
I could type in something like personal finance could be financial freedom could be something like that

7
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:37.220
in order to find the groups across the top here I can see Pages posts photos etc. we really want to

8
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.900
focus on the groups and really the groups then you can see them all listed at.

9
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.880
Here you can see the option for public groups or close groups so close groups you'll have to recall

10
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.650
requests to join.

11
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.470
Usually they'll just automatically approve that in 24 hours.

12
00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:01.050
And really what you want to be looking for the groups not really match up with your target audience

13
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.780
so you can have a look at those.

14
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.500
Read what it's about.

15
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:11.560
And also you want to look for the groups with a decent amount of members and also active groups can

16
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.010
see 10 posts a day.

17
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.840
That's a pretty active group.

18
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.870
We even open this up.

19
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:24.890
We can get a sense of what it's about the description and new post today you can see it's very active

20
00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.130
in here and really the best way though is to go ahead and join the group.

21
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.370
And then once you get inside you can really see if it matches up with your target audience.

22
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:41.000
So maybe pick five groups and just join them and get access to them to see really what's going on in

23
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.740
there and the types of conversations that they're having now Heidi promote your business in these groups.

24
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.390
Well the key thing is not to promote directly.

25
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.110
I want to show you example of this what you should be doing.

26
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.320
So I'm just going to come in to a group that I am a member of.

27
00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.240
I'm going to find a post that I think does this well.

28
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.970
So this is a closed group to join this to be honest.

29
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.010
And this is a great example of it.

30
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.120
Now this guy is a moderator of this group but he wasn't at the time that he posted this.

31
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.640
And really what he's said here is if you don't know me I'm X..

32
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:30.570
So tell people kind of who you are and ask ask people to ask you anything you know how can you help

33
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:31.510
us actually.

34
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:37.140
So if you want to go and promote your business or your product your service in these groups don't just

35
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.880
post a link to your product page.

36
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:47.250
You have to come in as part of the group and the purpose of these groups is to share ideas to help each

37
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.880
other I wish to be helpful to engage with other people.

38
00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:00.810
So similarly imagine you were walking into a meet up awful line where you're trying to meet similar

39
00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.090
minded people you're not just going to go in and hand out a business card you're going to try and be

40
00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.060
helpful and get to know people.

41
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.190
And so this is a good example of what you could do.

42
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:17.760
You know ask me anything common know what's your biggest problem with X topic and really come in and

43
00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.950
you'll start to see something like this where you're getting either a lot of people just liking it or

44
00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.840
a lot of people asking you a question about ask you anything.

45
00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.330
So this is a great examples and give a little bit of social proof.

46
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.500
Why are you an authority and why should they be asking you anything first.

47
00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.150
And then you can just say Ask Me Anything below.

48
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.080
And that is a great way to get in front of your target audience to make you aware of them and in your

49
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:53.040
responses to those comments you can give them a little bit of help respond to them and then you could

50
00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:00.000
even link off to your Web site and say you know what I'd recommend is you do X Y Z and if you want a

51
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.460
little bit more help what.

52
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.120
We'll then check out my web site and you can link back.

53
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.060
So here's an example.

54
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.440
That's a different one.

55
00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:15.350
So 40 common stuff potentially 40 people that you could get as clients out of those groups.

56
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.600
If you help respond to their whatever they're asking you and then you can link back to your product

57
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:28.230
page or service and say Look hey if you want more help you know connect to me here and we can whatever

58
00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.920
you can sign up for my product or I can help you out and Salt Lake cetera.

59
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.430
So the groups are extremely powerful but the key thing that I want to get across is you can't just go

60
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.120
in and paste a link to your site.

61
00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.900
You'll probably be banned that the group steered away.

62
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:49.170
So you need to come in with this kind of helpful attitude and maybe a great idea is give some authority

63
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.140
about who you are and ask people to ask you anything.

64
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.460
And that can give you that opportunity to connect with a lot of people get those comments.

65
00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:04.320
Respond to those comments and link back to your site for the the really the Opsahl whatever it is going

66
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.250
to be.

67
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.590
So that is how you use Facebook groups to promote your product or service.

68
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.870
Go ahead and do that for yourself right now or put this strategy in your back pocket for later.
