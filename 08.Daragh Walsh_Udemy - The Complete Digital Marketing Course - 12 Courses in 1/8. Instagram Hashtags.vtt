00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:06.630
In this video you're going to learn how to use hashtags to increase the visibility of your posts.

2
00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:13.030
Now hashtags are essentially just a way to tell instagram what your content is about.

3
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.010
And with that they can group content together.

4
00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.370
And one of the cool new features about Instagram is that you can actually now follow hashtags.

5
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.560
So for example on screen you can see hash tag motivation you can see how many posts that applies to

6
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.980
127 million on the opportunity to follow that.

7
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:39.170
So this is a great way as a as an owner a business owner a personal brand to increase your visibility

8
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.970
because of.

9
00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.140
Use the hashtag motivation.

10
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.360
Well then I have the opportunity to appear in front of all those people who are following that hash

11
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.220
tag who are just who or who are just searching for that hashtag.

12
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:59.360
So what I would recommend you do to get started to understand what hashtags you can use to increase

13
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.740
your visibility is to come in to the discovery tab on Instagram.

14
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.230
By default its going to go beyond the top top here.

15
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.100
But you want to come across to town.

16
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.180
And then you want to type in a hash tag that you think could be related to your business.

17
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.200
So something like motivation for example we can just type that in.

18
00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:29.370
Now the cool thing is is that when you type in one hash tag just like Cannes itself you can see related

19
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.700
cance or related hashtags.

20
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.690
We've got motivation.

21
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.740
We can see determination hard work discipline results.

22
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:45.280
So what I would start to do is write down these hashtags and if I was creating content similar to what

23
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:53.100
I can see here and that that I think would be appropriate I can start to note those Dan now another

24
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.550
way to find the appropriate hash tags that are going to get visibility for your posts is to come in

25
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.770
and have a look at some of those top accounts in your Nishan have a look at the hashtags that they are

26
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:07.880
using.

27
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:16.670
So if I come into post here we can see that doesn't seem to be hash tags are not all come into this

28
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.700
same so we can see here Debt-Free journey.

29
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:28.510
That free community and mortgage debt is dumb and if I click into any of these I can see how popular

30
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:37.560
these hashtags are and so 83000 posts before we saw motivation 127 million site is extremely popular.

31
00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:46.450
It might be hard to catch the attention of people following the motivation hashtag because there's probably

32
00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.630
a lot of competition but you can see this hash tag Debt-Free journey is much less competition honest

33
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.590
in terms of only 83000 posts so anybody following this hash tag.

34
00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.190
If I use it I have a much better chance of them seeing my posts.

35
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:09.190
So I would recommend for your own post you want to use maybe 20 hashtags 10 which are big like that

36
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:17.910
motivation etc. and maybe 10 that are very niche specific like that free journey that is dumb no mortgage

37
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:18.810
etc..

38
00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:25.330
And on a good way to come in and find out news goals debt free agency debt free seems to be a pretty

39
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.060
big one.

40
00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:33.310
Five hundred thousand posts so you can use maybe those high volume medium or really means you can break

41
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.900
them up but in total you want to be using about 20.

42
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.300
So let me show you actually how to input hashtags.

43
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:46.810
So while we can see here is Ive got a piece of content that Ive already uploaded and then I can actually

44
00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.710
edit this and then I can write a caption.

45
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.350
Now when you upload a new piece of content are going to see the same option to write a caption.

46
00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:02.120
And this is what I recommend you put in your hashtags right when you before you post.

47
00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:09.110
Not like an hour or two after you post it so always include your hashtags before you actually hit the

48
00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:10.240
publish button.

49
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:18.790
And if I go ahead and start to include some of those hashtags I saw some motivation maybe really high

50
00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:30.820
volume on and we can put in something like results we can see also a very popular one something that

51
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:38.980
we could do this is kind of an older quote so we could say throwback Thursday.

52
00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.370
This is a very popular hashtag t beat t Throwback Thursday.

53
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:51.330
You can see there and that's kind of appropriate because this is a bit of an older quote and if I was

54
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.120
posting this on a Thursday then that would make sense.

55
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.790
It's actually a Wednesday today.

56
00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:04.290
But you can see that you can include those teams hashtags not happen on Instagram on a weekly basis.

57
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.370
So what else can I put in there.

58
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.430
Maybe I should take learning.

59
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:09.990
Let's see how popular that one is.

60
00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:21.330
Learning is fun learning so you can see you can just keep including those there as you ones.

61
00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.230
And one cool thing is you can also look at this Web site you can type.

62
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:34.380
Top hashtags on Instagram and if we come in is a pretty cool list here at top dash hashtags dot com

63
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.820
and this can also give you some ideas about what hashtags to use.

64
00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.330
So love fashion and beauty happy Qs.

65
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.050
You can see that TB Throwback Thursday.

66
00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.820

68
00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:56.810
No filter.

69
00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:04.730
Amazing Instagram Beej swag motivation you can see number 61.

70
00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.380
So those are the three ways that you can identify the hashtags to use.

71
00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:14.020
Number one use that discovery search bar and have a look at those related hashtags.

72
00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:20.350
You can also come into the top influencer accounts and see what really are the hashtags that they are

73
00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:21.050
using.

74
00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:29.440
That could be very neat specific for you and you can also look at the top hashtags on Instagram if you

75
00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.820
want to find those really top hashtags that you can encourage.

76
00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:40.870
And remember the key to this and the reason that this gets you more visibility is because people search

77
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:45.180
for hashtags or even follow hashtags on Instagram.

78
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:51.550
And so this is an incredible strategy that you can use to increase the visibility of your posts just

79
00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:59.650
by including these simple hashtags and maybe taking a minute or two to that before you post your content.
