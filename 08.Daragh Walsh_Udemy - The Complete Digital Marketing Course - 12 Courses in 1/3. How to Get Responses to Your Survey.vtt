00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:06.600
Once you set up your survey the next step is to share it out and get responses on and I'm going to show

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:13.700
you three ways that you can do your survey and get responses even if you don't have an audience.

3
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.260
What so ever.

4
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.540
So to send out your survey you can come up and click on send.

5
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.990
And the first that way you can send the site is by e-mail.

6
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.920
You can just type in some e-mail addresses directly here and send it straight.

7
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.260
If you want if you have an e-mail lists and you're using an e-mail marketing tool like MailChimp you

8
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.200
can just write an e-mail.

9
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.240
Tell your audience you know the benefit of filling the site.

10
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:46.810
Paste that link in and send not directly from MailChimp or whatever email marketing service you're using.

11
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.720
But what if you don't have an audience Bill.

12
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:51.660
Yes.

13
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.730
What can you really do.

14
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:59.970
Well what I would recommend is that you start to look and think about what are the contacts that you

15
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.960
already have available to you.

16
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:09.780
And one thing that you can do is go ahead and export your contacts from Gmail or Yahoo or whatever email

17
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.350
service you are using for your personal mail.

18
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:20.190
Now I went ahead and did this recently and I was shocked to see that I had over 800 e-mails in my gmail.

19
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:26.350
Now am I saying that you should go ahead and just spam everybody in your inbox with your survey.

20
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.410
No I'm absolutely not saying you should do that.

21
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.790
What I am saying is once you export your Gmail contacts you're going to get an excel sheet full of all

22
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.040
of your contacts.

23
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.740
And I would go through one each person one by one and say you know what would this really help them

24
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.620
or would they even know somebody that they could forward this on to and I guarantee you're going to

25
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:57.810
get 10 to 15 people at least out of your contacts that you can send the e-mail directly to.

26
00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.740
Now where else might you have e-mail addresses just from your normal connections that you've made for

27
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.580
Linked-In is in other place and you can export all your connections from Linked-In.

28
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:16.740
Again this is going to produce a huge Excel sheet full of people's names first name last name and e-mail

29
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:17.160
address.

30
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.300
It's like having your own email lists before you even have a Web site or anything.

31
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.770
So once again I'm not saying you should spam everybody I'm saying you probably have people in your contacts

32
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.390
already on Gmail or Illington that you can send survey directly to.

33
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.870
And if not you're going to have at least one person who knows where you should be sending this e-mail

34
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.880
to maybe they know certain Facebook groups etc. you should post in.

35
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.370
So that was the first way to share your survey e-mail.

36
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:53.390
Now there is one important point that I want to stress by e-mail and that is the subject line.

37
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.340
You can see by default here the subject line is I've invited you to fill in a form.

38
00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.770
Now how many people do you think are going to open that if they see that in their inbox.

39
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.840
Probably not and they're not even going to they're just going to skip on over the mail and won't even

40
00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.080
read it.

41
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:17.250
So that's why the subject line is so critical for e-mails because if they don't click to open your e-mail

42
00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:23.340
they're never going to click the link to fill out your survey so you must write something compelling

43
00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.680
here in the subject line.

44
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.180
Now if you leave this by default that's not going to work.

45
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.590
Even if you change it to something like can you spare a few minutes and fill in my survey.

46
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.200
That's not going to work either.

47
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.950
Why.

48
00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.590
Because there's no benefit to the customer or the potential customer.

49
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.890
Can I spare can you spare a few minutes.

50
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.110
What's the benefit for me.

51
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.780
I'm not going to open up sorry.

52
00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.060
So you need to come up with something that's going to get people to open.

53
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:56.550
Now if you have an audience something that I've done before is saying you know I'm creating I'm creating

54
00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.890
new courses for you or I'm creating a new course makes it sound even more specific

55
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:13.830
for you and I love your input so you can see the benefit here is that I'm creating something for them

56
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.420
already and it's going to be a course.

57
00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.720
So they know what the product is and it's for them.

58
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.750
I'm just asking for their feedback.

59
00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.670
People will happily give their feedback because they want to solve their own problems and they're going

60
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:31.190
to help you solve their your you know their problems.

61
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.000
So there's a clear benefit for them as what I'm trying to say.

62
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.130
Now another thing that if you don't have an audience how are you going to catch their attention.

63
00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.030
Well I'll tell you one subject line that actually caught my attention very recently.

64
00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.830
Hey Dara could I try to

65
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:55.160
solve your problems as an online instructor.

66
00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:00.120
So this was actually an email that just someone sent me and I opened it.

67
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:04.280
And the reason was because they didn't say Can you fill out my survey.

68
00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.270
They said Could I try to solve your problems.

69
00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.100
They didn't guarantee that they were going to get that kind of hints at that.

70
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:17.270
They're gathering some feedback and they specifically said as an online instructor so they had taken

71
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:23.560
the time to actually figure out what I do and they want to help solve my problems and I can tell you

72
00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:29.540
as an online instructor I have a lot of problems a lot of things that are difficult to do and if someone

73
00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.440
can help me with that well then I'm going to open the e-mail.

74
00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:38.930
So that is something that you could easily copy and use for whatever your thing is.

75
00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.950
Hey could I try to solve your problems and to become financially independent.

76
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.100
Could I try and solve your problems too.

77
00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.120
You know whatever.

78
00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:53.380
With Adobe effects whatever it is you can really copy and paste that in.

79
00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:58.450
And I guarantee you're going to get a lot of people opening your email and responding to it.

80
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:05.740
OK so that wraps up email as the first way to distribute your survey talked about ways to have an audience.

81
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:11.450
And if you don't have an audience now the next way to collect responses is through social media.

82
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:17.270
Again if you have an audience to share the links directly there and if you don't have an audience what

83
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:22.510
are you going to do while there is the magic of Facebook groups.

84
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:27.250
So what you want to do is type in your keyword or your topic or your nation here.

85
00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:33.920
So let's just say something like you know financial independence is something I'm interested in and

86
00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:35.540
come across.

87
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:42.590
And let's look at the groups here so if I had some sort of solution or I was a coach help people become

88
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:51.500
financially independent I would be posting my survey into these groups and getting some responses from

89
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:52.280
them.

90
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:56.420
Now what you can also do is this really works for any different type of needs.

91
00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:02.120
You know the ins doublin vegans there's PIOs of people in these groups.

92
00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:05.270
And remember that you probably have to join the group.

93
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:11.930
That might take a day or two to get approved and then once you're in the group you just want to have

94
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:15.110
a look and check out the group rules.

95
00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:17.290
So let's have a look at these for this one.

96
00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:21.510
You know don't give out personal details et cetera.

97
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.000
Let's see let's see.

98
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.400
So you want to read these rules just quickly for any group because you don't want to be banned from

99
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:34.600
the group or you don't want to kind of upset the atmosphere that they've created in there.

100
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:39.410
So some groups for example they only allowed you to post links on a certain day.

101
00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:45.940
And so you just respect that and wait for that day and post the survey in then.

102
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:52.500
So as well as Facebook groups there are also groups on LinkedIn.

103
00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:54.570
So let's just quickly head over there.

104
00:07:54.710 --> 00:08:01.400
And again it's the same thing that you want to do not just put a link to your survey in there and say

105
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:03.180
fill the site and help me.

106
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:10.880
You want to say hey guys I'm curious what your biggest problems are as say vegans in Dublin and you

107
00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.700
know fill out my survey below.

108
00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:14.540
I'm happy to share the results.

109
00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:17.000
And let's brainstorm some solutions to them.

110
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.010
That's something very positive you're there to help them.

111
00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:30.020
And again you're not just there to really you know get their money and run off into the sunset or whatever

112
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.120
you want to do.

113
00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:36.500
And Linked-In is an opening for me but it's the very same process over there.

114
00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:45.650
Now let's look at the final way that you can go ahead and get responses to your survey and that's to

115
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:54.130
use for them so all you need to do is once again go to Google type in whatever your need short keyword

116
00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:58.610
is and then just put for them there on up is going to pop up a lot of forums.

117
00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:05.650
This really works for anything you know any different knishes that you have.

118
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:08.330
You can see there's a lot of them here.

119
00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:12.000
Even you can go into rattus and things like that.

120
00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:19.340
And so forums are just another place that you can post your survey and get responses that people are

121
00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:20.870
right there already.

122
00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:27.560
And so you might not be able to post it into one Facebook group or one Linked-In group or maybe someone

123
00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:28.860
will delete your posts.

124
00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:30.850
That's going to probably happen.

125
00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:36.100
But there are times Tauzin civ groups across all those three methods that I've showed you.

126
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:40.120
So you are going to get responses to your survey.

127
00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:46.840
And if you just stick with it on a recap we've looked at three different ways to distribute your survey.

128
00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:55.250
Even if you don't have audience e-mail sort of recap we've looked at three different ways to distribute

129
00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:59.820
your survey and get responses even if you don't have a survey.

130
00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:05.600
And we talked about some tips and tricks and in terms of really getting responses and that's your subject

131
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:10.440
line and the way that you posted into those different social media groups.
