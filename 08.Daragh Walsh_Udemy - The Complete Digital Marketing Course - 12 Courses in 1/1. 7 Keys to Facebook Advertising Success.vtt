00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.650
Before you go ahead and create your first Facebook card it's very important that you understand the

2
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.210
keys to success.

3
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.450
Many beginner advertisers dive straight in and it's no wonder that they struggle to get click through

4
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.320
conversions on a return on their investments by watching this lecture.

5
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.990
You will be able to avoid those common mistakes and really understand the seven things that you need

6
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.280
to focus on in order to create Facebook accounts that will grow your business.

7
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.560
This video is essentially a crash course in Facebook ads.

8
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.020
So I highly recommend that you grab a pen and paper right now.

9
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.580
Start taking notes because this is going to save you a huge amount of time money and frustration.

10
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.310
The first key to success with Facebook ads is targeting and targeting simply means getting your ads

11
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.710
in front of the right audience.

12
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.960
This is not only the first key to success but it is the most important one where I recommend you put

13
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.850
most of your attention.

14
00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.300
The simple reason that targeting is so important is because there is such a massive audience on Facebook.

15
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.440
There's over 1.8 billion active users.

16
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:12.390
And for example if you wanted to get just 180000 customers from that audience over 1.8 billion people

17
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.860
we're talking about a tiny tiny tiny percentage 0.01 percent.

18
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:25.020
So you need to be really laser focused in who you put your ads in front of because remember that Facebook

19
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.360
is an advertising company and if you hand them money they are going to spend it.

20
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.990
So the onus is really on you to get your ads in front of the right people.

21
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.190
If you want to get the best results.

22
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.590
The great news is that there is a ton of great ways to target your ads on Facebook and I want to give

23
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.340
you an overview of them right now.

24
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.890
So the first way to Target for ads on Facebook is with core targeting and this allows you to put your

25
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.440
odds in front of people who may be near you in a radius by demographics.

26
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.840
Male Female what age they are interests.

27
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.710
What Facebook pages they like or their behaviors online.

28
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:12.120
And if they're connected to your Facebook page or not there when this came out initially this was revolutionary

29
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:19.590
and gave Facebook a huge advantage in the online advertising space because they had all this information

30
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.690
from the US when we created our profiles.

31
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:31.420
That's why this information was so accurate and such an amazing thing when it first came out for advertisers.

32
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.800
However the game has changed now and there is a new type of targeting that is even more powerful.

33
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.910
It's called Custom audiences.

34
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:46.020
And if you aren't using these you're advertising like it's five years ago because custom audiences really

35
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.310
allow you to target people on Facebook who you already have a relationship with.

36
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:58.350
And as you can imagine that's much easier to get a sale out of instead of just hitting up somebody who's

37
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.900
cold who hasn't heard about your business or maybe targeting someone who's already been to your Web

38
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.950
site you know a much better chance of getting a sale.

39
00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:13.280
Now in terms of the different types of custom audiences they are many different ones.

40
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.140
But the general thing that links them together are general team is retargeting or remarketing.

41
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.840
So retargeting to people who've already engaged with say your web site and creating a custom audience

42
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.300
of those people you need to have the Facebook pixel in order to do it are going to show you exactly

43
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.130
how to do that step by step.

44
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.380
You can create a custom audience and retarget people who are on your email list who have engaged with

45
00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:44.310
your Facebook page who have engaged with your app you need to have the SDK installed to enable that.

46
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.710
That's essentially the equivalent of the Facebook pixel and you can also create custom audiences in

47
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:50.660
many different ways.

48
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:56.460
Even people who have watched a video that you put on Facebook you could retarget those people would

49
00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.370
say lead and get leads out of them.

50
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:06.210
So extremely powerful extremely flexible and Ill actually be showing you had set up all of these custom

51
00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.690
audiences.

52
00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.860
Later on in the course so let's look at some use cases to try and bring this to life.

53
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:19.110
So taking the example of an e-commerce site let's imagine that we wanted to remarket to people who had

54
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.540
visited our online shop.

55
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:29.430
We can do that and make it even very personalized by using this type of remarketing called dynamic product

56
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.540
remarketing.

57
00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:36.110
So in the ad here that we can see on the right hand side are the exact products that I looked at at

58
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.710
the Adidas store.

59
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:43.070
I could see them in my Facebook news feed and I can go ahead and shop straight away.

60
00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:49.560
So thats just one example you can shoot and a ton of different ways but you can see the power of remarketing

61
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:55.940
using these custom audiences over just targeting people by interests who may be interested in your product

62
00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.380
but haven't even taken a step to visit your website.

63
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:07.010
Now the third and final way to Target on Facebook is through look alike audiences and these are really

64
00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:13.710
a marketer's best friend because they allow you to scale your marketing efforts extremely efficiently.

65
00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:20.210
So a lookalike audience helps you to reach people who were like your current customers website visitors

66
00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:25.650
or Facebook fans what they actually do is you use a source audience.

67
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:32.000
So one of the custom audiences that you've created and then use that to find similar people on Facebook.

68
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.810
So for example I had a source Ionians of 10000 people and I was able to scale that into a targeted audience

69
00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:45.920
of two million people who were similar to that audience of 10000 people who had visited my web site.

70
00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:54.600
So extremely extremely valuable way that you can still scale your marketing efforts in a targeted way.

71
00:05:54.950 --> 00:06:00.320
So how would you start from scratch you might say OK that's great but I don't have any people coming

72
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.760
to my Web site or using my app yet.

73
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:09.410
So the process would be you might run an ad starting using Core targeting interests that type of stuff

74
00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:14.930
then you get those people to maybe come to your Web site or have a look at your app you can create a

75
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:21.690
custom audience of those people and then on the back of that you could create a lookalike audience.

76
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:26.900
So it is a process that you can build up and take advantage of all of these types of audience even if

77
00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.280
you're starting from scratch right now.

78
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:32.810
So that wraps up the first key to success which is targeting.

79
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.970
Now we're looking at the second key to success which is funnels.

80
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:44.100
So what is a marketing funnel and how does it really apply to Facebook ads.

81
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:50.180
Well here is actually a screen shot from inside the ads ads create two where you create Facebook ads

82
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:55.040
and you can see those three columns here awareness consideration and conversion.

83
00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.590
And this is essentially the funnel although it's on its side.

84
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:05.840
So people first become aware of your product then they actually consider taking an action like watching

85
00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.150
a video going to your Web site.

86
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:14.420
And then finally they'll converge make a sale or sign up or visit your store in person.

87
00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.670
So that's the type of marketing funnel.

88
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:23.930
And this is an important mindframe to think in because Facebook ads and the Facebook platform is actually

89
00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:26.580
different than google and google adwords.

90
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:32.480
You don't hear a lot of talk about funnels in Google and that's because on the right hand side here

91
00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:37.100
you can see when people go to Google they type in something like Nike shoes.

92
00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:44.240
I can see the ads pop up right there but that's because I've already decided to buy Nike shoes or I'm

93
00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.280
interested in them because I'm typing them into Google.

94
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:53.570
So my intention is much clearer and I'm probably much further down that funnel that we've talked about

95
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:59.840
now over on the left hand side here I don't go to Facebook and I don't browse my news feed because I

96
00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.380
have a specific thing in mind.

97
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:07.590
I'm really there to connect with friends and that's why you may need to make people more aware about

98
00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:14.200
your product first in Facebook and then start to move them down the funnel towards the sale.

99
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:19.640
So here's an example of a couple of funnels that you could set up and think about say for example we

100
00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:23.620
wanted to get sales for an e-book an online course or anything.

101
00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:29.640
Firstly what you could do is starting off and get some traffic to a landing page where you give away

102
00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.530
a free ebook or something like that.

103
00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:38.450
People pop in their email you get their email address and then you start an email sales funnel to get

104
00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:39.490
sales.

105
00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:40.700
That's one example.

106
00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:45.830
Another thing that you could do if you're an online coach or a local business lawyer or something like

107
00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:53.420
that is you could create a lead and once again give away a PTF or an up option for a free 15 minute

108
00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:54.800
consultation.

109
00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:59.960
People pop in their email address you do the consultation over the phone and you make the sale at the

110
00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:00.730
end of that.

111
00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:06.710
You could also set up a phone something like people to watch a video showing the new features of an

112
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:09.780
app that you've released and people having a lot of fun with it.

113
00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:15.080
And then you could remarket to those people who watch the videos to install the app.

114
00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:20.660
So there are a couple of examples but the key thing is to think about the funnel and where people are

115
00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:21.730
in that funnel.

116
00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:23.570
Are they even aware of your product.

117
00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:26.530
Could they move to can to consider and take an action.

118
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:31.280
And are they really ready for the sale before they've even taken that consideration.

119
00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.800
Moving on to the third key to success would Facebook ads.

120
00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:36.970
It's for months now.

121
00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:41.720
The key thing here is that you really want to match your ad format to the objective.

122
00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:48.410
There's a lot of different formats for ads on Facebook you can use videos you can use images you can

123
00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:51.400
use what's known as carousel ads.

124
00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:56.250
And here are some basic rules that you can follow if you want to get traffic to your website.

125
00:09:56.330 --> 00:10:01.230
You should use a really an image link God or a carousel.

126
00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:07.760
If you want to get video views or use a video if you want to use collect leads use a lead out in and

127
00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:11.490
leave out forms if you want to get conversions and sales.

128
00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:16.270
Well having a link straight there is going to be better than showing people the video because people

129
00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:21.570
are going to click and go directly there instead of staying on Facebook and watching the video.

130
00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:26.890
Now if you want to run conversion that's member you have to have that Facebook pixel set up.

131
00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:28.810
And if this isn't making sense to you at all.

132
00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:29.770
Don't worry about.

133
00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:30.880
Go into a lot of detail.

134
00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.460
More later on.

135
00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:37.540
Finally if you want people to engage with a Facebook post you might be promoting a competition or something

136
00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:38.220
like that.

137
00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:42.330
Usually it is a simple image is going to be the best.

138
00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:49.900
Now moving onto the fourth key to success would Facebook ads its budgets and this is the key question

139
00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:53.990
that comes up how much does it cost to advertise on Facebook.

140
00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.290
Well I think there's really two ways to look at this.

141
00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:58.530
One is to look at the absolute minimum.

142
00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:02.330
So this is a screenshot from Facebook for business.

143
00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:07.150
It shows the minimum ad spend for the currencies that are listed up the top here.

144
00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:14.380
So for us the Australian dollar Canadian dollar euro a lot of countries there the minimum spans are

145
00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:15.360
as follows.

146
00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:22.210
If you just want to get impressions of people just to become aware of your ad there is a minimum of

147
00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:24.760
$1 per day but that's just going to be an image.

148
00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:31.210
People won't actually be able to click through if you want people to click to get a like on your Facebook

149
00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:39.490
page to watch your video to engage with the post then the minimum budget is going to be $5 per day if

150
00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:44.740
you want to get something like more of a low frequency event like an opt in.

151
00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:47.530
And the budget is at least $40 per day.

152
00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:49.290
So those are some of the minimums.

153
00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:51.770
Let's have a look at it from another perspective.

154
00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:56.590
And probably the better way that you should be looking at and matching your budget to your goals.

155
00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:03.770
So here are a couple of guidelines for maybe what are the type of expenses that you could be getting.

156
00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:05.070
A big disclaimer.

157
00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:06.350
Is there just a guideline.

158
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:08.650
You're not on the current guarantee you're going to get these.

159
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.780
But I would encourage you to try and work towards these numbers.

160
00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:19.320
So if you want to get Facebook fans you want a budget maybe 50 cents per fan e-mail subscribers one

161
00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:24.170
dollar per subscriber website traffic maybe about 35 cents per website.

162
00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:26.450
Visit product sales.

163
00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:34.650
You want to budget maybe $30 per conversion and up and sales for free up budgeted by $2 per install.

164
00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:40.950
So results will vary but there is some very rough guidelines to work towards.

165
00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:46.780
Fifth the key to success for Facebook ads is the odd creative and this is what people actually see in

166
00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:48.600
their Facebook news feed.

167
00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:52.320
So here are the four parts to a great and creative.

168
00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:54.280
First it needs to be visual.

169
00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:59.050
Remember that there is going to be a lot of competition for eyeballs in the news feed.

170
00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.700
So it needs to catch attention.

171
00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:08.110
Bright colors faces will really stand out so we can see here that this example its visual that pops

172
00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:10.000
really of the background this night.

173
00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:11.100
Nice bright color.

174
00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:16.750
Its relevance because the image is really related to what the ad is about which is freelancing.

175
00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.390
Here's to people working at home.

176
00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:21.580
They look like they're having fun at freelancing.

177
00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:28.060
It should include an enticing offer something that's going to catch my attention so interested in becoming

178
00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:29.880
a full time freelancer.

179
00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:36.670
We can see freelancing Asie head start working from home learn from five year full time experience so

180
00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:39.120
that's a pretty enticing offer.

181
00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.490
I can learn all that stuff.

182
00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:47.320
And again all of those Copie there is a strong call to action and encouraging me to really learn more

183
00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:48.550
about this.

184
00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:51.280
Let's have a look at one other example.

185
00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:53.280
This is not for Linked-In.

186
00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.700
Once again it's Bryce.

187
00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:58.710
We've got a picture of a girl here and a good face catching attention.

188
00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:02.700
It's relevant you can see $50 credits that's a good offer.

189
00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:03.490
And learn more.

190
00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:08.320
Strong call to action to really kick click through and get that offer.

191
00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:12.470
Now D6 key to success with Facebook ads is split testing.

192
00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:14.610
And this is all about really.

193
00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:19.960
If you want to maximize your budgets you need to find out what is most effective in your ads in terms

194
00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:23.230
of copy imagery targeting etc..

195
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:31.030
So you want to when you put out a campaign not only have just one add one image and one audience that

196
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:32.390
you're putting it into.

197
00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:35.860
You want to really test different variables.

198
00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:40.180
So here is just one example there's many different ways that you can do this but you could have two

199
00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:43.350
images you want to test which one gets more clicks.

200
00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:48.460
You can see there's a product here in the image or person in the image using the product and then you

201
00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:51.160
really test to see which one performs better.

202
00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:57.700
Now the great news is is these are pretty easy to set up in Facebook and here are just some of the split

203
00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:58.810
tests that you can run.

204
00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:04.390
So in terms of the creative you can test the headline a different image that landing page that you send

205
00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:10.960
people to the placement in terms of does instagram work better than the Facebook news feed or Facebook

206
00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:16.420
mobile in terms of targeting He can try different countries different genders different interests different

207
00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:18.010
consume audiences.

208
00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:24.610
So the Web site custom Ionians email testimonials etc. and there are other things like R-Type image

209
00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:27.260
versus video type etcetera.

210
00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:28.900
So it's just an overview of it.

211
00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:32.890
But the key thing to understand is testing is a big part of Facebook ads.

212
00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:36.590
That's a real key to success to find out what really works for you.

213
00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:42.580
And finally this seventh key to success but Facebook ads is tracking and reporting and the first thing

214
00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:48.240
to do and that's really important before you dive into reports is to define success for yourself.

215
00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:50.440
What are your business goals.

216
00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:56.390
Can you really get sales through emails if that's the goal then start to set some KPI.

217
00:15:56.410 --> 00:15:57.100
For those ads.

218
00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:01.290
What can I put forward per E-MAIL subscriber that really makes sense.

219
00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:04.450
And then you assess the results in terms of the metrics.

220
00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:09.580
There's a lot of different metrics in these reports like CPM to your CPC.

221
00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:15.250
What's really important of all these things and not to leave loose focus is how much is the cost per

222
00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:21.540
desired actions so the cost to get Facebook like if that's what you want is to get an email subscriber.

223
00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:23.530
That's really the key thing to get focused on.

224
00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:26.530
So these reports are not that hard to look at.

225
00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:32.890
Final thing is if you want to track conversions and see how many people from Facebook and say buy a

226
00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:38.960
product on your store you need to have the Facebook pixel set up and even you can track this through

227
00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:40.870
on the medics as well.

228
00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:45.310
Now I'll show you how to do that in terms of tracking reporting.

229
00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:51.040
This is the key message is you need to test learn and iterate and it kind of links back into our split

230
00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.110
testing.

231
00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:57.990
You want to really use that reporting as a feedback loop to improve the next campaigns.

232
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.320
I would encourage you to set aside some budget to experiment.

233
00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:04.870
Don't expect to get massive results from the first campaign.

234
00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:09.450
It's going to be a little bit of a process until you find your rhythm.

235
00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:15.790
So to recap here are the seven keys to success with Facebook ads targeting follows odd formats.

236
00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:20.120
Budgets are created split testing and tracking and reporting.

237
00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:23.230
Of course this is just an overview of the keys to success.

238
00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:27.220
Will I keep putting this all into practice as we go through the course.
