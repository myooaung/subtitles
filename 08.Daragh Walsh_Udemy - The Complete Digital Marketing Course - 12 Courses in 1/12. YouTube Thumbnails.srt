1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:06,810
In this video you're going to learn how to create customized YouTube thumbnails so that you can really

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:13,380
stand out in the search results from competing videos and get a lot more clicks to your videos and rank

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,540
higher in the search results.

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:21,930
The best thing is that on your show you had to do it very quickly and to do it for free in less than

5
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,300
five minutes.

6
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:29,790
So the first thing that you want to do is go ahead and log into Kanva dot com This is a free ad designed

7
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,080
tool very easy to use.

8
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,120
Much simpler than something like Photoshop which costs a lot of money.

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,680
And personally I find pretty difficult because was free.

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,520
You can sign up if you don't have an account with Facebook or your Gmail.

11
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,540
So just log in and then come up and click on create a design.

12
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:54,990
And the cool thing about Kanva is that they have templates for YouTube thumbnails so you can really

13
00:00:54,990 --> 00:01:00,720
create a common thumbnail very quickly using these templates and in the perfect dimensions that's going

14
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,210
to fit exactly on YouTube.

15
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:09,810
So come in and then click on YouTube thumbnail you'll see down here in the left hand side that there

16
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,070
are a lot of templates that you can just choose from.

17
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,750
Now as you can see they're geared towards different type of videos.

18
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,150
Make up more business.

19
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,010
Maybe something to do with a puppy.

20
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,730
Fitness food.

21
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:31,260
So there's a lot of cool templates here that you can just take and apply and if you do want to use a

22
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:37,010
particular template you can just drag and drop it across and you can start to use this.

23
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:41,670
Now in this example you can see that this background image is actually a paid image.

24
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,740
This is how can they make their money.

25
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:49,050
They can charge usually a dollar for each of these images but if you don't want to use these images

26
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:49,980
that's fine.

27
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:57,150
You can just take this as an idea delete this and then come and upload your own images to here.

28
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:06,330
You can find those images or upload them from your computer or you can actually search for royalty free

29
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:15,680
images and there are some great Web sites like pick's eBay or pestles dot com where you can get royalty

30
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,330
free images that you can use in your YouTube videos etc..

31
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:28,800
What I'm actually going to do is just create a thumbnail from scratch just to show you how it's done.

32
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,620
So we can really just use this template.

33
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:40,150
So we have the dimensions but I'm really going to use my own background image which I've uploaded previously.

34
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,940
So you just want to scale that.

35
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:46,890
Very easy to do as you can see to fit the exact dimensions.

36
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:53,660
Now when I leave a little bit of space up here so that I can input my text and make sure that this looks

37
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,660
good.

38
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:01,970
Now my advice for YouTube thumbnails would be to keep it as simple as possible you can see this top

39
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,930
ranking thumbnail here.

40
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,690
It says you analytics.

41
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:06,580
It's very simple.

42
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:12,260
Although the title says a little bit more the thumbnail itself is just very simple and I'm going to

43
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:20,390
model that for my thumbnail because remember text on these thumbnails can be very hard to read especially

44
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,770
on a mobile device.

45
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:26,800
So you're better off I think just keeping it down to one or two words.

46
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:32,780
I really just get across the topic and then even in the title and description you can get a little bit

47
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,720
more specific about what the video is about.

48
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:44,340
You can see that some of these thumbnails for me personally are just too much information.

49
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:49,070
I'm really looking at YouTube to learn how to do something quickly and easily and simply.

50
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:55,450
Now if I see a lot of text there I'm probably not as likely to click on it rather than a just a simple

51
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,670
thumbnail like this.

52
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,540
So my advice would be always to keep it simple and keep in mind that people will be seeing this on mobile

53
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:06,050
devices whether it will be very very small.

54
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:12,300
So that's why I'm just using a similar image to the one there I want to bring across my youtube logo

55
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:18,930
which I have uploaded before I make it a thumbnail here about each video and you can see it's very easy

56
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:25,770
to size this up and then you probably don't want to keep it right at the edges but just leave it there

57
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,680
you can zoom in and zoom out.

58
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:37,050
Now I can also add in some text so I can just drag and drop this across into it line it up and I can

59
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:40,100
really change the text to whatever I want.

60
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,120
So I'm making a video of YouTube analytics.

61
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:55,720
I want the thumbnail to really just communicate change the seismic 56 scale this up a little bit as

62
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,280
well.

63
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,780
So everything's in line.

64
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:08,430
May want to change the font as well try and get it to match up with the logo.

65
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:14,200
It's very easy to use as you can see very accessible.

66
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,990
One of the one of the things I really like about it.

67
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:17,550
OK.

68
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:24,780
So I've got my railway techs going to make the bold and make this use this space a little bit more

69
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:30,220
OK I think that looks pretty good.

70
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,320
Now maybe you want to change the color.

71
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,800
You can do this for any text as well.

72
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:39,300
Just click on this icon and you can select it here.

73
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:44,570
I'm going to make this gray and maybe you can make that a little bit darker.

74
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:49,910
So you can just move those around there.

75
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,880
So I think that looks pretty good.

76
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:56,450
I might just play around with a little bit.

77
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,320
That looks pretty good.

78
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:57,750
OK.

79
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,260
I'm happy with that.

80
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:04,810
And there are many styles of thumbnails that you can make to include images.

81
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:10,480
Again that's very very simple to do just drag and drop them in as you please.

82
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:16,420
Once you are happy with your toenail you maybe just want to change the name and include the key word

83
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,640
or phrase that you want to reinforce so

84
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,990
you analytics

85
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,070
and click done.

86
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:35,200
Then you can click download and if you want to keep it as a ngi file so the quality is high and then

87
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,230
quick down load.

88
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:46,620
Now once you've created your thumbnail you can open up your video in youtube and just come to customize

89
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,120
thumbnail.

90
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:52,740
It's on my desktop so I can import this here.

91
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:58,940
And you can see I think this looks a lot better than the video thumbnail that was set.

92
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,960
So I am just going to save those changes.

93
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,240
So as you can see I think that looks a lot better than it was before.

94
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,020
And that's really going to help me stand out in the search results.

95
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,780
I get a lot more clicks.

96
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,240
So now it's your turn.

97
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,610
Go ahead into Kanva dot com.

98
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:20,750
Use one of the templates and create a customized thumbnail so you can get more clicks to your video.
