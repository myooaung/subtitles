00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.940
Once you publish your answer on curagh is important not just to leave it there.

2
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.920
You do need to do a bit of promotion especially when you're just getting started in order to get the

3
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:11.720
word out.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.980
So I would encourage you to go ahead and share your answer really across any social media profiles that

5
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:27.030
you've got set up so I can tweet this site and I can go ahead and view that on Twitter and you can really

6
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:35.680
see that you get the questionnaire and then the answer that's tweeted out there as well.

7
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.880
So what you can do is share that idea on your social media or what you can also do is just take the

8
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:48.640
link if you clicked this little button here you can copy the link and you can really share this anywhere

9
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:55.710
then that you could share this by e-mail to your e-mail list you could share this on Facebook.

10
00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.290
So you can post that in to directly onto your Facebook page if you have one or you can share that out

11
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.950
on your own personal profile.

12
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:11.800
Another thing that you can do is if you come into Facebook you can share these answers in Facebook groups.

13
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.210
So if you're part of any Facebook groups you can come in and instead of just posting the questions directly

14
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.290
here which often groups don't allow you to do.

15
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.320
You can actually start to search groups.

16
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:32.970
So if you use that search bar you can search for questions maybe actually even a more specific Facebook

17
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.820
lead us which is all the questions about it.

18
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.680
So you can start to see anybody who's been discussing this.

19
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:50.410
And if we scroll down even to generate lead and say OK test video fan pages ads.

20
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.920
So if this was a you can see those 29 comments here.

21
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.990
There's people linking off to other stuff that they've done and what you could do is in the Commons

22
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:06.080
say something like if they're saying what would be an effective way to market my business.

23
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.600
You could say you should try lead odds they're extremely effective way and then you could link off to

24
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.640
your own strong cure where you've really given more details on that.

25
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.520
So that is a way you can do.

26
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.740
One key tip too when you do share your answers especially by e-mail if you've got a warm audience like

27
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.860
that you can say you know vote this answer if you find it helpful.

28
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:36.820
And that will enable you to get more up folks so you can really tight climb to the top quickly.

29
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:44.330
So those are a couple of ideas for how you can promote your curagh answers just copying the link there

30
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:51.860
and sharing it to your email list on Twitter and on your own Facebook in Facebook groups.

31
00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:58.640
Really if you could share it on LinkedIn really anywhere you can but the key point is to it to enable

32
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.270
us to get to the top and get those fields and initial views.

33
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.840
You do need to go out and promote those.

34
00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:11.580
So for your own questionnaire go ahead and start to promote your answers off of your swell.
