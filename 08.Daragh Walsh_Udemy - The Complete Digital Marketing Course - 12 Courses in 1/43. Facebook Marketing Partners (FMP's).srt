00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:06,420
In this video you're going to learn about Facebook Marketing Partners and the huge ecosystem that has

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:13,650
grown up around the Facebook platform was Starpower really understanding what Facebook Marketing Partners

3
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,710
are or FM Pease's they're known for short.

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:23,340
And then you start going to start individually looking at some of these to really understand why you

5
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:28,890
would need to use one of these Facebook Marketing Partners and the value that they're really bringing

6
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,590
to the table.

7
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:35,130
So let's start for really understanding what these Facebook Marketing Partners are.

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,670
Well the key thing is that they're not just agencies.

9
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,640
This is not a list of agencies that you can use.

10
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:49,680
These are actually marketing partners who have additional technology features or services that are built

11
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:53,900
on top of the Facebook platform.

12
00:00:53,910 --> 00:01:00,330
See you could maybe compare it to something like either or both for that you might be used to using

13
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,190
on social media.

14
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:08,580
It's a similar type of volume that's built on top of the Facebook platform and really connected into

15
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:18,150
it through an API as you can see here there are only 171 partners so it's quite a small number of partners.

16
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,340
And there are a number of different categories of partners as well.

17
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:24,230
Specialisations is what they call them.

18
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:31,200
So the technology community management content marketing small business solutions audience onboarding

19
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,290
audience data providers and measurements.

20
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:41,070
Let's just take a look at these small business solutions because you might be familiar with some of

21
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:45,150
these names on espresso our role in constant contact.

22
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:51,900
Now the key thing about these Facebook Marketing Partners is if you are just advertising for your own

23
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:58,410
business you may not ever need to use these and you don't need to understand them in a lot of detail.

24
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:04,980
But if you are working in the industry in an agency or in a company you maybe need to understand at

25
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:10,040
least what these are so that you can engage conversations about them.

26
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:15,030
So let's jump straight into actually looking at some of these individually to really understand the

27
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,940
value.

28
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,800
And some of the reasons why you might consider using them.

29
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:26,220
So the first one here is our espresso and this is actually by now the key advantage of our espresso

30
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:32,940
and it's listed right here in the home page is that it makes AB testing painless and the key thing is

31
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:38,190
that you can create thousands of variants of your Facebook ads in only three clicks.

32
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,480
So an example of how this might work is there is three fields.

33
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:47,220
They just put in they say put in three different headlines and they automatically create three different

34
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,820
odds based off that.

35
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,460
Or you just upload three images and then they automatically create three Cadsoft that.

36
00:02:54,540 --> 00:03:01,860
So it's a way to really automate the process of HIV testing and it has a better interface that's really

37
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,160
geared around.

38
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,990
The thing that we have to remember is that the odds create two or the power editor tool is really designed

39
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,950
to serve all of the marketing objectives in one interface.

40
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:18,420
It's really at a platform to serve every single person.

41
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:24,950
Whereas a lot of these platforms are really broken down to focus in on a particular feature like AB

42
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:30,890
testing on Hazon interface that's more geared around that and makes it much easier to do.

43
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:37,500
Now in terms of some of these Facebook Marketing Partners an honest person in particular let's have

44
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,090
a look at the pricing for some of these.

45
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:44,460
So we can see that the base is $49 per month.

46
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:50,410
You are Facebook Ads Ben is up to 3000 and you can see all the features there.

47
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,740
Then it goes up to 150 and then to 9.

48
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:00,780
So I think for a lot of these Facebook Marketing Partners the best practice is to make sure you have

49
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:07,060
proven your aura y inside Odd's create two or power Ed..

50
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:11,790
And then once you got that done and you want to start to automate it and make it an easier thing to

51
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:15,600
do and scale then you will start to use partners like this.

52
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,290
Let's look at another example.

53
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:24,290
Drif track here and these guys are pretty interesting and they focus down on really lead generation.

54
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:31,650
So if we come into our odds create tool here we can see that this is just one single marketing objective

55
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,550
and this is what these guys really focus on.

56
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:40,330
And they have built bigger solution to really support the whole life cycle of the generation.

57
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:48,290
So in terms of acquiring them not just from Facebook but also from Instagram and rolling in lead forms.

58
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:55,140
Then in terms of what do you do afterwards converting them and there's all sorts of really trainings

59
00:04:55,260 --> 00:05:01,800
and guidelines and all of that stuff to really get those leads converted so really building a whole

60
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:05,330
solution around that one marketing objective.

61
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:11,290
Now let's look at another example of a Facebook marketing partner which is Wallner and this really helps

62
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:19,780
with content creation and what Walter does is helps you find exceptional Instagram content creators

63
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,960
for your brand.

64
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:26,520
So it's really providing a simple structure a safe marketplace to collaborate with.

65
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:34,090
Instant Instagram content creators so Centier sourcing content creation you upload a brief you send

66
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,120
it to creators.

67
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,560
You agree on who it's going to be and then you prove the content.

68
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,680
And that's really a marketplace.

69
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,920
In order to do that and outsource some content creation work.

70
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:53,770
Let's move on to another example here which is a smartly Daddario And once again these guys are really

71
00:05:53,770 --> 00:06:01,510
focusing down on one particular thing and objective and Naish really which is e-commerce that is the

72
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:08,350
key additional features that I have that they have are really around dynamic adds and scaling this on

73
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,620
automating this whole process.

74
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:18,460
So we can see in this example here that a Norwegian mobile phone provider started automating their advertising

75
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:24,550
after running Facebook on its mind for a number of years and I think this is the key phrase to really

76
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:25,270
think about.

77
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:32,500
You would never consider using these guys straight away once youve kind of proven your understanding

78
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:38,980
of it and proven in worldwide then you go to automate it because I think the price tag on this is something

79
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:43,300
like that ties and dollars and want a minimum level.

80
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:47,710
So these are definitely for bigger bigger companies.

81
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:52,990
Next up weve got an odd row and you might have heard about these guys before and not know exactly what

82
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:59,230
they do but they really focus in on retargeting now as we looked at it in the course this is just one

83
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,310
of the many things that she can do.

84
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:07,150
They really focus in on and thats the core of their business and they enabling you to reach your customers

85
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,660
everywhere and serve personalized ads across devices.

86
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:19,120
On the odd roll premium network including 500 networks and exchanges so it's not just for Facebook on

87
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,180
Instagram.

88
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:29,470
So for Twitter Tumblr AOL Google Linked-In etc. So that is really what they do focus on retargeting

89
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:34,850
across all networks not just the Facebook network.

90
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:39,820
Finally we have constant contact and you may have heard of these guys before they really focus and are

91
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:46,350
known for email marketing but their Facebook marketing partner as well are hooked in.

92
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:52,270
And I find an interesting case today just to highlight some of the things that they can do here.

93
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:58,030
So from this case city because they were integrated with the platform.

94
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:04,330
Constant Contact automatically Puplick populates odds with copy an image is drawn from email campaigns

95
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:10,930
so that really allows you to use previous email campaigns to populate odds and you will probably understand

96
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,580
which of those email accounts delivered the bass which headlines etc..

97
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:19,450
So its a way of really connecting these things together.

98
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,630
Now that you know what Facebook Marketing Partners are youll be able to discuss them at work or in business

99
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:30,730
and you can come in anytime to the Facebook marketing partner directory.

100
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:36,160
Look at all these guys individually if you wanted to take them on and use them as saw as part of your

101
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,330
Facebook advertising solutions.
