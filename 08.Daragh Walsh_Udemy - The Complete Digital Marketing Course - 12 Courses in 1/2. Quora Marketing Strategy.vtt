00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.030
In this video you are going to learn how to get traffic from curagh.

2
00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:11.510
I'm going to walk through some real life examples to show you the overall strategy whether you're a

3
00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.180
business or an individual.

4
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:20.870
And then we will really look at some of the key benefits of cures and marketing channel over their marketing

5
00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.280
channels like YouTube Facebook and ceramic cetera.

6
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.740
So firstly let's start with the strategy.

7
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.900
What is the strategy to get traffic from curagh.

8
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.380
Well it's very simple.

9
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:38.940
You just want to answer questions that your potential customers are asking and that's important to note.

10
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:45.230
I answer questions that your potential customers are asking not just any random question about a topic

11
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:51.260
that you know of where you really want to answer those questions that your potential customers are asking

12
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:59.150
so that you can really get in front of them with an answer and then give a decent answer and then redirect

13
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.630
them to your Web site or product so they can learn more.

14
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:09.650
So for example this is a question of my potential customer might ask How hard is it to make money on

15
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:10.960
Farver.

16
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.570
Now I give an answer with some valuable information about how to do it and what is the potential revenue

17
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:25.130
etc. and then are really at the end tell them that if they want to learn more Ive documented everything

18
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:32.010
here in essentially an online course which I'm redirecting them to there.

19
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:39.140
So I am answering questions to show that I'm an authority to be helpful and to get in front of my potential

20
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.620
customers and redirecting them to a Web site where they can buy my product.

21
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:51.050
So it's a very simple strategy just be helpful answer your questions and then redirect them back to

22
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.470
your site.

23
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.330
That's the strategy.

24
00:01:53.330 --> 00:02:00.230
So the cool thing is that I can see that 30000 people have viewed this question so I know it's a good

25
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.210
question to answer.

26
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:09.460
And also I'm the top rated 20 so I am getting the vast majority of the views for this question.

27
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.900
You can see there are the ones down there.

28
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.600
So we're going to go through how you can get to the top like this and get most of the views but for

29
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.970
now just understand that the strategy is very simple answer questions that your potential customers

30
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.950
are asking give an answer read them or redirect them back to your site and it doesn't matter if you're

31
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.860
kind of an individual like me or if you're working for a company it's the same strategy.

32
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.700
So here's an answer from somebody who works in a company.

33
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:43.400
If you're answering questions on behalf of a company to get traffic to a company's side the best way

34
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.770
to do it is to answer from your own personal profile.

35
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:53.630
But just update your profile name with that your in whatever company.

36
00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.250
And then you can.

37
00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:01.010
At the end of the question once again just redirect them back to your company web site.

38
00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:09.450
In order to get more traffic to the site it's the same strategy whether you're an individual or company

39
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.150
now.

40
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.590
So that's we looked at how to do it to get ad sales.

41
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.500
This is a traffic just redirecting them back to a blog post.

42
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:26.390
And here's another example of ads for somebody in kind of personal finance investing what happens defend

43
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.600
or when backed by angel investors if a company fails.

44
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.740
He is a very helpful answer.

45
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.750
And then at the end I write about investing several times a week for free here.

46
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.400
And if you click through you can see and pop up rates.

47
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.880
Join the mailing list.

48
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:51.570
So I've shown you their examples of how to use cure to drive sales traffic and e-mail sign ups.

49
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.820
And in all three cases the strategy is the same.

50
00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.120
Just answer questions that your potential customers are answering.

51
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.150
Now some advanced advantages of q or over other marketing channels like say YouTube.

52
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.240
Well you can see that this answer is only about two paragraphs long.

53
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:16.960
Took me about 10 minutes to write and that's a lot easier than writing a huge blog post or creating

54
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:21.840
a YouTube video which can be a little bit harder to put together especially for not so familiar with

55
00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.650
how to create videos.

56
00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.660
Another advantage of cure is that there is very long term traffic.

57
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.500
So I wrote this answer over a year ago.

58
00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.040
I'm still the top dancer.

59
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:42.640
I'm still getting the majority of the views and so that is a lot longer shelf life than say Facebook

60
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.870
post where you're only in their news feed for 24 hours.

61
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:47.770
Same with Instagram.

62
00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:48.820
Same with Twitter.

63
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.200
So cure.

64
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:57.580
Not only is it easier to create content on but it's also the shelf life that content can be much much

65
00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.760
longer than other marketing plan platforms.

66
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:06.940
So I hope that's got you excited about your dot.com at why it's such a good market and channel how easy

67
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:13.180
it is to drive traffic and read that you understand the basic strategy is just answer questions and

68
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:20.260
then redirect people back to your site or your product or your email list so they can really sign up

69
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.330
and learn more from you.
