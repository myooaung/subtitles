00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:06,380
In this video you're going to learn how to set up an email address that uses your own domain name.

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:12,480
And this is absolutely free to do with blue hose and the benefits of doing it are that your e-mails

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:17,510
can look more professional it's easier for people to remember if you're saying it in a conversation

4
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:24,870
and it's going to be a lot more relevant if you're sending a newsletters and e-mails from your site.

5
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:30,270
You can also use this process to set up say info at your domain or support it's your domain and that

6
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:37,560
allows you to delegate work to other people can free up a lot of time for you and also you can set up

7
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:43,770
e-mail addresses for other team members and you'd be surprised at how something as simple as having

8
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,470
a common e-mail address can really make you feel like a team.

9
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,330
So the steps to set this up are very simple.

10
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:57,650
Firstly log into your blue hosts portal and if you don't have the link that check your email again that

11
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:01,000
you have got from registration you can click straight through.

12
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:02,400
Then you want to come don't e-mail.

13
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,910
Here in the sidebar.

14
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:06,970
But we want to do is go ahead and add an e-mail account.

15
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:15,870
So I'm just going to set one up for example support W.P. set up a dot com then you want to enter your

16
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:18,780
password.

17
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:26,460
Very simple make it something secure and just make sure that it's the same and then you can go ahead

18
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,370
and click Create it can't.

19
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:32,330
So now we can see that the account is being created.

20
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:37,460
We can go ahead and viewers on what you can do now is go ahead and click access web mail.

21
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,540
So this will bring you to your inbox.

22
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,600
Essentially it's the same as something like a Gmail inbox.

23
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,410
You need to choose a web mail application and all of these are pretty much the same.

24
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,650
There's no difference between them and they're all free.

25
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,740
So you can select that and come on in.

26
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:02,190
And once you're inside you're just going to see one e-mail here which includes some details about your

27
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,490
e-mail account.

28
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:10,290
Now one thing you might want to do just for convenience is to set up any e-mails that arrive at this

29
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:16,260
e-mail address and forward it to maybe an e-mail account that you check more regularly.

30
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:25,110
So what we can do is come down to forward forwarders here and what I'm going to do is forward any e-mails

31
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:31,830
that I get so I'm going out of order here and forwarded from this account that I just set up support

32
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:37,600
a W piece set up demo and I can afford it to my personal account.

33
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,290
Let's just say that I check all the time.

34
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,040
So that's all I simply need to do.

35
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:52,740
And any time I get an e-mail sent to support a WP self demo it'll forward to my personal account which

36
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,360
I check much more regularly.

37
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,010
And then I can come back in and really respond to that e-mail.

38
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:06,480
So one thing you might be wondering is how many e-mail accounts can you set up and that really depends

39
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:10,080
on the hosting package that you selected.

40
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,170
So if you have the basic plan you can get five e-mail accounts if you the plus plan then you can have

41
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:24,300
unlimited e-mail accounts and that is the benefit once again of checking and selecting the plus plan.

42
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:30,690
So to sum up setting up an email account that use your own domain name not only looks more professional

43
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:36,570
it's easier to remember it's more relevant to readers when you're sending out newsletters and then really

44
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:39,080
allow you to delegate work to team members.

45
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,950
So go ahead and set one up following the steps in this video.

46
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,280
It's absolutely free to do with most.
