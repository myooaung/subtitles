00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.410
In this video you're going to learn how to enable monetization on your YouTube channel and to get started.

2
00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:12.460
You want to go to YouTube dot com forward slash it can't underscore monetization.

3
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:18.260
And I will put the link in the description of his videos he can click directly through here and you

4
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:24.430
can see there is an application process for monetisation before you go ahead and start this.

5
00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.590
I want to draw a couple of things to your attention.

6
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:35.510
So first of all you need at least 10000 views on your account to be approved for monetisation so you

7
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:36.490
can apply right away.

8
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.440
Now even if you're just getting started.

9
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.170
But to be approved all channels need at least 10 times in views.

10
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:49.820
So as well as that requirement for 10000 views there are a couple of other things that you should know

11
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.630
before you start into this process.

12
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:58.640
And the one is one thing and probably the major thing is how much money can you really make from YouTube

13
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.130
and enabling your videos from monetization.

14
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:09.170
Well the answer is quite not really that much to be honest and you need to be getting a huge amount

15
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.070
of views in order to make this a sustainable business.

16
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.980
You can see here I've come to influencer marketing hub dot com for slice their YouTube money calculator.

17
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:27.350
And even if you're getting 20000 views a day that's still only going to be earning you about maximum

18
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:38.680
$50 a day and that his monthly earnings of maybe 5500 and then 17000 dollars on a projected yearly revenue.

19
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.830
So that's almost six hundred thousand views per month to just be making $17000.

20
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:52.130
So really to make money from a YouTube channel you need to be getting massive amounts of views on a

21
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.640
regular basis.

22
00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:01.520
And therefore for a business I wouldn't recommend that monetization is a big priority for them really

23
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.980
sending people back to sign up to your email list that you can sell to them later.

24
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.700
True product is a much more profitable way to use YouTube as a marketing channel.

25
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:19.930
So aside from revenue there are some other restrictions in terms of monetizing your videos.

26
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.500
And there are a couple of guidelines and information about them here in the right hand side which you

27
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.660
can check out in more detail if you want but really there are a couple of things that you should know

28
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:37.030
like if you have any cop copyrighted music in your videos they will not be able to be monetized.

29
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:47.810
You also cannot have controversial maybe racist or sexist or pornographic type videos because they won't

30
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.630
be monetized as well.

31
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:56.510
And YouTube has cracked down on the type of content recently that they are advertising on.

32
00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.940
So it needs to be really family friendly.

33
00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:05.710
You can be swearing too much or using copyrighted images or controversial topics etc..

34
00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.150
So there's more information there.

35
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.910
But the key thing is there are certain limitations to this.

36
00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.650
You need to have 10000 views.

37
00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.800
You need to be getting a massive amount of views.

38
00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.080
And in terms of the content it really needs to be from family friendly.

39
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.140
Now if you're happy with all those things well then go ahead and apply for that monetization and you

40
00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.100
can really go through the steps here.

41
00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:33.470
You'll have to set up a nonsense account which will really take the most amount of time but once you've

42
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:41.720
done that and gone through the steps you're going to really see a page like this where your monetization

43
00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.080
is then enabled.

44
00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:50.700
And if you want to enable or disable monetization on individual videos Well then you just come into

45
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.850
your video manager.

46
00:03:53.180 --> 00:04:01.960
If you come into Eddas here and you can see here there's a monetisation tab under each video you can

47
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.110
monetize and enable monetisation if you want.

48
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.100
You can select the type of ads that you want.

49
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.320
You can even select when you want those ads to appear.

50
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:20.570
So you can say within the video where are the certain breaks where you don't mind if anon pops up.

51
00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:28.450
So there's all sorts of personalization that you can do for each video here if you want to monetize

52
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.630
them.

53
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:35.350
Personally I don't bother because it's much more valuable for me to get the viewer onto an email list

54
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:43.360
where I could sell my product and get a much higher margin from and YouTube that way.

55
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:44.660
But it's up to you.

56
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.700
And now you know how to enable monetization if you want.

57
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:57.620
Once again come into YouTube dot.com hordes slash can't underscore monetisation.

58
00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:02.060
And then you can enable monetization on or you can't if you want.
