1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:06,990
To start advertising on Facebook the first step to take is to set up your Facebook Advertising can't.

2
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:13,870
And in this video I'm going to walk you through that step by step and also answer some very common questions

3
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:14,860
that come up.

4
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:20,790
So the first thing to do is to log into Facebook Tulkarm on your normal Facebook profile.

5
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:26,650
So the Facebook profile that you use on a daily basis to connect with your friends and read your news

6
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:27,430
feed.

7
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:31,450
Now if you don't have a Facebook profile just go to Facebook dot com.

8
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:33,460
Follow the prompts and set one up.

9
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:40,240
It will only take you two minutes once you're inside your Facebook personal profile come across here

10
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:47,950
to the right hand side and click on the dropdown and then come then click on create ads by clicking

11
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,230
on this button.

12
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:55,870
You then create your Facebook advertising account and once it loads up watch you will see on screen.

13
00:00:55,870 --> 00:01:03,220
Here is what's known as the ads create tool and the ads create tool is a tool with in your Facebook

14
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:10,450
advertising account that guides you through the process of creating an ad for now watch you can do is

15
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:14,320
come down to the bottom left and just click close.

16
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:18,850
So already you have created your Facebook advertising.

17
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,690
I can't.

18
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:25,540
But in order for your odds to go live you do need to add some billing information.

19
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,100
So let's set that up now.

20
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,950
Come up to Odd's manager here.

21
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:36,930
Come on down to all tools and you can come across here to billing and payment methods.

22
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:41,640
Now at this point I do want to say that Facebook often changes its interface.

23
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:48,400
So if the buttons aren't in the exact same positions don't worry the steps are going to be the same.

24
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:55,690
So once you find billing and payment methods you can just click on this I once that loads up is very

25
00:01:55,690 --> 00:02:01,330
simple for you to add in your payment method you just click on the big green button here and you can

26
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:07,390
out of debit or credit card Paypal online banking Facebook and coupon etc..

27
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:10,970
Now to reiterate you don't need to set this up right now.

28
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:16,180
If you want to play around with the advertising and can't even go through the process of creating an

29
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:21,880
ad but you will need to set this up if you want those ads to go live.

30
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:28,630
Now before we leave this billing information there is one other thing that's a good idea to do and that

31
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:32,210
is to set up an account spending limit.

32
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:38,050
So if you want to control how much you spend and really put a limit on the maximum that you can spend

33
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:41,640
on Facebook ads you can set up an account spending limit.

34
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,690
This is probably a good idea to do if you're a beginner advertiser and we want that safety net in place.

35
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,350
All I have to do is click on set.

36
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,010
Can't spending limit.

37
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:59,260
Type in the amount that you want to set the limit as for example 250 and then just simply click to set

38
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,580
that limits.

39
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,410
Now with your advertising can set up your payment details on.

40
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:09,640
And your current spending limit in place you really everything you need in order to start advertising

41
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,270
on Facebook.

42
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:17,920
However before we move on I do want to answer a very common question which is can you advertise on Facebook

43
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,070
with a Facebook page.

44
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:21,600
And the answer is yes.

45
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,430
If you don't have a Facebook page you can still create or not.

46
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:33,430
However you can only show that out in the right call him or Facebook uses single image as your format

47
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:39,440
and you use the traffic advertising objective which sends people to your Web site.

48
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:45,700
So to give you an example of what that looks like you can create an ad on Facebook like this one here

49
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:51,740
on the right hand column and just an image and it can only bring people to your Web site.

50
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:57,600
So watch you're missing out on if you don't have a Facebook page that you can put ads in the news feed

51
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:06,310
here you can to use things like video or lead ads where you can put your ads on Instagram on other platforms.

52
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:12,670
So even if you are a solo printer and you're trading off of your normal Facebook profile it still is

53
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:19,380
a great idea to set up a Facebook page so you can use all of these advertising features.

54
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:26,110
And just to quickly show you how to do it come down to the dropdown here click on create a page and

55
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:30,060
you can follow the prompts to really set up a page for yourself.

56
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:35,990
Not only does that give you access to all of those extra advertising features but a Facebook page in

57
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:43,550
general gives you great access to information about the demographics people interacting with your page.

58
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:48,970
What are the posts that are really getting a lot of engagement and this information you cannot get on

59
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:56,040
our personal Facebook profile page or even within a Facebook group setting up a page is really a must.

60
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:02,230
If you're serious about Facebook Marketing now there is one other scenario where you can advertise on

61
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:05,400
Facebook without having a Facebook page.

62
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:11,640
And that is where you are advertising on behalf of an employer or on behalf of a client.

63
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:17,790
Now in order for them to argue as an augmented their page what they need to do is log into this to call

64
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,240
a business manager.

65
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:26,770
It's with in the ads manager tool and here they can come down to page roles and really assign you as

66
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:34,020
a new page to one under advertiser and in this way you can access all of those advertising features.

67
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:37,360
I really do the advertising on behalf of them.

68
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:41,740
To recap the steps to setting up your advertising count are very simple.

69
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:48,480
Just log in to Facebook dot com and come down and click on create ads with your advertising account

70
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:53,500
to set up what you will need to on some payment information before those ads can go live.

71
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,490
And setting up an account spending limit is a good idea.

72
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:02,100
If you don't have a Facebook page I would recommend you go and set that up not only to tap into all

73
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:07,570
those advertising features but also to access all these great analytics that only come with Facebook

74
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:10,180
pages in the other scenario.

75
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:14,550
Ask your employer or inclined to argue in the business manager too.

76
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:18,410
You can really get set up to start advertising on behalf of them.

77
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:21,730
So we'll finish up there and I'll see you in the next video.
