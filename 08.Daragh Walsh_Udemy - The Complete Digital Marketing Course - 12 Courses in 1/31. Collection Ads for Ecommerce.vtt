00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:07.470
In this video you're going to learn a by collection odds and how you can use this new format to drive

2
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.350
more sales for your online store.

3
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.470
We'll start by understanding what a collection that is and the benefits of it.

4
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:22.890
Then we will look to really see in our ads guide where this new ad format is available what objectives

5
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.890
is it available for it because it's not available for every type of objective.

6
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:35.490
Then we will start to look at some case studies and see how Adidas is using this new format to get some

7
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.110
great results.

8
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.450
Also see how Tommy Phil Hilfiger is using this and looking at these case studies I think you're going

9
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.520
to give you some really great examples of how you can put it into use for yourself.

10
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:55.680
Finally then we will finish up in our hands create tool and you'll learn how you can create a code using

11
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.320
the collection format for yourself.

12
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.380
So let's start by understanding what a collection is.

13
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:04.890
The benefits of it.

14
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:11.020
So the high level idea is that you inspire shoppers to purchase with an immersive experience.

15
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.650
So let's really come down and have a look at the example here.

16
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.930
This is what it's going to look like in somebodies new news feed.

17
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.540
So what is different here.

18
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.920
Instead of carrousel loud that just has products here or a single product.

19
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.030
Dad what do you actually have as a video here.

20
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:36.130
And then you have the products related to that video below here and people can click through on these

21
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:43.740
images directly to your mobile site where they can purchase these products.

22
00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.660
Now the key thing to understand about collection odds is that they're only available on mobile right

23
00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:57.290
now and they're really designed for mobile as well and to give a better experience for people.

24
00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:04.360
So the idea is that this ador advert format helps brand connect with people by pairing a video with

25
00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.320
photos of your product images in the news feeds.

26
00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:15.250
And the idea is that you inspire sales with deeper stories so instead of just seeing the product you're

27
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.790
actually seeing a video that showcases the key reason why you should buy the product or just to see

28
00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.390
the product in action.

29
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.790
And you know paint more of a lifestyle that you will achieve or get if you buy the product.

30
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.510
So classic marketing but just a more interesting odd format than a static image.

31
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:42.390
Now in terms of the products that you want to put you want to choose products that play off the best

32
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.210
story in you were featured video and in the two examples We'll look at.

33
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.700
Look at two different ways that you can maybe do that.

34
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:56.760
The key thing is that this is a new format and a lot of advertisers won't be using it yet.

35
00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.020
So if people see this in their news feed it's going to catch their attention because it's something

36
00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.290
completely new.

37
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.990
So for new ad formats and many more will come out on Facebook.

38
00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.480
The key thing is that the sooner that you use them the more benefit that you're going to get out of

39
00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.200
them because as more and more competitors start to use them it doesn't grab as much attention.

40
00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.980
So for all of these new ad formats the key thing is if they are relevant for your business to use them

41
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.260
straightaway.

42
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.170
Now let's have a look out when you can use this odd format.

43
00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.100
It's not going to be suitable for every single marketing objective.

44
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:39.050
But there are two key areas where it fits perfectly and one is clicks to Web site.

45
00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.470
So we're in once again in here in the Facebook Ads guide.

46
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.960
Right now it is available only for clicks to Web site.

47
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:53.580
You can see Facebook collection here and also web site conversions down here.

48
00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:59.280
So essentially these are the same thing driving people to a website or driving people to a Web site

49
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:05.520
where it's optimized for conversions and you do need to have the Facebook pixel installed in order for

50
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.330
Facebook to optimize for conversions for you.

51
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:16.860
But you can see here Facebook collection obviously this is going to be ideal for e-commerce stores where

52
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:22.210
the products are featured there it's not going to be ideal for brand awareness.

53
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.640
It's not available for brand awareness at the moment.

54
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:31.370
Event responses doesn't really make sense the generation local awareness Page Likes obviously doesn't

55
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:38.480
make sense so you can see that this odd format is really tailored to online store sales.

56
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:44.940
Now let's have a look at some of the case studies to really understand how brands and companies are

57
00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.070
using this right now.

58
00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:53.760
And here's what I need US did they used this odd format to really cross-sell with a video and this is

59
00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.570
a pretty interesting way that they used it.

60
00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:03.210
Now they got some great results one point X decreased in cost per conversion and a five point 3x return

61
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.310
on outspent.

62
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.810
Why.

63
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:10.110
Well probably because this is a new ad for matter and it really engaged people.

64
00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.430
Now let's look down at what they actually did and this is their example here.

65
00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:21.540
So they their their main objective here was to cross-sell on what they did is they had a video featuring

66
00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.970
their new product which is this hoodie.

67
00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:31.800
And then down below they had really complementary products for the featured product which is like the

68
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.200
runners the bag the tracksuit bottoms et cetera.

69
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:40.330
So it's really weird and objected to cross-sell to these different products as well.

70
00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:48.180
So what they did with this collection format is had the video paired with four products and then this

71
00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:54.390
quickly could open it up into 50 more products so viewers can instantly bread and shop for additional

72
00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:55.440
products.

73
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.220
So what's so cool about this Heidi.

74
00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.880
Why would they make a video about it.

75
00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:05.720
Well it says here that it's an oversized leaping to block out noise and help people relax while traveling.

76
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.080
And so I imagine the video showing some of the benefits there.

77
00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:12.270
And actually that does not sound like such a bad idea.

78
00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.290
Could be pretty handy when you're traveling.

79
00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:19.170
Finally can see here that when interested customer has clicked on any of these product images they arrived

80
00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:22.120
at the Adidas mobile web site where they can make the purchase.

81
00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:28.790
So this is the key thing that this is an odd format that's only for mobile right now.

82
00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.690
It's designed for mobile.

83
00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:36.090
And so if you are sending people are thinking to use this you want to make sure that your site is mobile

84
00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.190
optimized and mobile friendly.

85
00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:41.900
Otherwise you're going to be losing those people once they click through to your site.

86
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:49.130
Now let's have a look at Tommy Hilfiger and see how they use this collections and format and they actually

87
00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:54.760
did a slightly different thing instead of using it to cross-sell.

88
00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.500
They used it in a different way so let's have a look at this.

89
00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:05.060
So they use the collection format to enable European customers to instantly buy pieces featured in the

90
00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.490
runway show video.

91
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.380
So let's have a look down at this.

92
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:11.510
They had the runway show video.

93
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:17.510
And down here below that they have the products featured in there that people could buy straightaway.

94
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:19.410
So that's not a cross-sell.

95
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:24.480
It's showing that these are the products they're showing them again and again through a live runway

96
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:25.420
show.

97
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:29.610
And then you can go ahead and purchase them by clicking on the links here.

98
00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:37.100
And the results again were pretty impressive 2.2 X higher return on outspanned 37 percent lower cost

99
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:41.630
per visit to its e-commerce site 2x higher engagement rate.

100
00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:47.420
Now let's come down and have a look at some of the details here how they set this collection up.

101
00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:50.750
Was they uploaded it's video creative.

102
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:52.270
Along with its product catalog.

103
00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:56.490
So these are really two key steps that I'm going to show you how to do.

104
00:07:56.490 --> 00:08:03.200
First you need to upload the video and you also need to have your product catalog set up as well and

105
00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.490
really combine these two things.

106
00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:10.400
Now coming down let's have a look at actually some of the strategy and the tactics behind this campaign

107
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:14.320
because this is interesting for you to think about as well.

108
00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:21.690
So what they did is they targeted the collection to women across Europe aged 20 to 40 with interest

109
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:23.320
in fashion and shopping.

110
00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:28.430
The team also installed a Facebook pixel on its mobile site and used information gathered from it to

111
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:34.180
build a look alike audience based on a woman who had visited or made purchases from their mobile site.

112
00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:40.490
So this is really smart what they did is targeted women by interest and demographics.

113
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:42.920
They had the Facebook pixel set up.

114
00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:50.030
They obviously created then a custom audience based on that and then using that custom audience of people

115
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:52.010
who had bought it.

116
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:56.510
Then they built a look alike audience on the back on the back at that and really extended the reach

117
00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:57.420
of their campaigns.

118
00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:58.680
A nice little strategy.

119
00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:02.750
Could really see how you could put that into action for yourself.

120
00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:07.250
Now that you understand watch collection odds are on the benefits of them.

121
00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:09.800
Let's look into the ads create two.

122
00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:13.240
So you can understand how to set this up for yourself.

123
00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:20.120
So firstly when selecting your marketing objective remember that this format is not available for every

124
00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:26.330
type of marketing campaign just really traffic and conversions and you will have to have the pixel set

125
00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:30.170
up in order to to optimize for that.

126
00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:35.570
That's just like the traffic marketing objective just to keep it pretty simple for the moment.

127
00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:41.360
Now in terms of your ad says traffic audience placements budget that's going to be the same decision

128
00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:47.990
making process as we've covered previously really where there is a difference for this format is down

129
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:55.250
in the level where you can see this collection format is available and the first thing you want to do

130
00:09:55.250 --> 00:10:02.300
is upload that video that you want to use in this collection on formats so I've just got a video here

131
00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:05.330
that I'm just going to use.

132
00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:13.390
Now I'll let that upload what I want to do is come down into the images here so we can put in the headline

133
00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:19.990
and text as normal so I can put in a new collection.

134
00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:33.440
New collection now what I want to do is re import my product catalog.

135
00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:41.110
Now we've covered this in a previous lecture but essentially inside of your ads manager here you can

136
00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:46.690
see that there is the option to upload a product catalog and essentially that's what you want to go

137
00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:54.160
ahead and do before you start to use this format so I've already done that and now I can come down and

138
00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:59.580
really select the products that I want to include in the site.

139
00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:02.110
And you can start to see them loaded up here.

140
00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:08.440
The images are really being pulled from the spreadsheet that I uploaded where I had the links to the

141
00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:12.250
images on my site.

142
00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:16.070
Now let's come back and see if this video has been uploaded.

143
00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:25.090
Maybe I need to just make sure that this is uploaded before I move on to the next screen.

144
00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:31.280
Now once the video is uploaded you can just select the thumbnail for the video.

145
00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:37.630
And one other thing to note here is that for instagram again it needs to be under 60 seconds.

146
00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:41.400
Now this video is just an example that's just a little bit over 60 seconds.

147
00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:49.080
But keep in mind if you want to run on Facebook and Instagram at this stage you can also upload those

148
00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:57.960
video captions if you want and upload the 20 files which is the file format you can use for video captions

149
00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.630
scrolling down a bit now I can see a preview of my AD.

150
00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:05.120
So very simple to set up just two steps.

151
00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:08.440
Upload the video and import that product catalog.

152
00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:11.430
So now you understand what a collection ad is.

153
00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:13.040
And the benefits of it.

154
00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:18.750
Think about how you could use this as part of your marketing campaigns perhaps think about featuring

155
00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:23.880
a product like added us here and cross-selling complimentary products.

156
00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:29.550
Or you could also have a video featuring a lot of products and have them all listed be low.
