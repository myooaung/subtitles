00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.550
Once you've created your business manager it can't.

2
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:08.870
And you've added any added Kaine's pages SOP's or other assets to it.

3
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.770
The next step is to manage roles and permissions for those out accounts and pages that you've written.

4
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.240
You want to make sure that the right people have access to the right pages in the cans so that they

5
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.280
can start working on them.

6
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.620
So to do that what you need to do is come up into the top right hand side here pick on business settings

7
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:37.480
and then we're working in the first top here that really says people here and watch you can do is move

8
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.180
up and add new people.

9
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:47.500
So if you are a company what you could really do here is adding any employees or if you had somebody

10
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.310
running on your behalf.

11
00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.150
This is where you be adding them in now.

12
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:59.500
Equally This is the process that someone will be doing if they were to hire you as a freelancer or working

13
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.280
on their articles.

14
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.450
So it's important that you understand the process from their side so that you can guide them through

15
00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:05.710
them through it.

16
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.320
If they've any confusion about it.

17
00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.670
So the first thing that you want to do is out the person's email address that you want to give access

18
00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.150
to the pages eradicates.

19
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:23.440
So as an example you can just really just put in any any e-mail here you can just remove this later.

20
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.590
In most cases you will select them as a business manager employee and you can see that that gives them

21
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:30.850
less permissions.

22
00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.290
They can change any business settings remove employees manage permissions etc..

23
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:44.990
So it's kind of odd and this example person in here the next step then is to assign pages to this person.

24
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.300
So I've just got one page in this example.

25
00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.300
Business Manager can salsa like this here.

26
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:58.550
Next we want to assign the roles for this person for this individual page and you can see that there

27
00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.570
are five different roles here.

28
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:06.910
Aardman editor moderator advertizer an analyst and this is really going from the most amount of permissions

29
00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.460
and Ogmund all the way down to our analyst here you can learn more about the rules here but I'm also

30
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:19.420
going to include this link in the resources section of this video because I think it just spells it

31
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.230
out a little bit easier.

32
00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.860
We can see a chart here of the permissions.

33
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.500
See you can see Aardman has the most amount of permissions here.

34
00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.260
Everything the editor has a little bit less but they can manage Pedros they couldn't add new people

35
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.450
a moderator a little bit less responsibility again.

36
00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.190
They can do most things sending messages responding and deleting comments removing a burning people

37
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:51.520
but they can't do things like edit ops and pages maestro's go live etc. advertiser as you can imagine

38
00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.870
really doesn't have much to do with the individual management of the page.

39
00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:02.750
More by creating and viewing sites and see who published and see who published as the page analysts

40
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:08.380
that really just has access to the insights and can give feedback on that.

41
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.200
Not really any access to managing the page itself.

42
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:18.010
Now life contributor seems to be a new category as you can see just allows people to go live from Mobile

43
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.660
device.

44
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:25.600
So I think this chart breaks it down really easily in terms of the different responsibilities all includes

45
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.740
in the resources section of this video.

46
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:34.870
So for now what I'm going to do is come back into my business manager here I will just select this person

47
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:41.410
as an advertiser for example then I need to select the AD account that they can have access to because

48
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.090
they're going to be an advertiser.

49
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.680
This is one of their responsibilities so they can select that.

50
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.020
And once again.

51
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.450
And to be in the Advertiser.

52
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.560
Now there are other things here and like product catalogs.

53
00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:01.870
If I had an e-commerce business had a product catalog uploaded to my manager account then that would

54
00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.950
appear here and I would allow them to run things like dynamic product ads etc..

55
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.810
For now for this account I can skip that.

56
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.680
So that's it.

57
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.600
And the person has been notified by e-mail that would have been e-mails sent to this what I can do is

58
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.360
cancel this invitation any time that I want and you can see that has been removed.

59
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:29.570
You can also come in here for any existing employees and you can assign assets to them in the same way.

60
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.770
And in that way you can really manage roles and permissions.

61
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.780
You don't just set it once you can change it any time.

62
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:44.230
So now that you understand how to add roles and permissions in business manager go ahead and set this

63
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:45.110
up for yourself.

64
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.380
Following the steps that you've learned in this video.
