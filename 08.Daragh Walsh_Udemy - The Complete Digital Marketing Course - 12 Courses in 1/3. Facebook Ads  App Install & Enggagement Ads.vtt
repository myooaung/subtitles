00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.320
In this video you're going to learn how you can promote your app through Facebook ads.

2
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:11.220
Start by looking at the different objectives that you could have up in stalls and engagement and some

3
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.980
of the details around that that we're going to look at a couple of companies who have had some amazing

4
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.330
success using Facebook app ads.

5
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.240
You can see some huge installs here and also some great results in terms of engagements and we'll look

6
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.780
at exactly what they did in order to achieve those results.

7
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:36.630
Then we'll move on and look at some of the set up process including registering your app and installing

8
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.130
the Facebook SDK giving an overview of the process for those two steps.

9
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.640
And then finally we will look once again in the ads create tool on practically Highwood run one of these

10
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.980
campaigns.

11
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:55.260
So let's start in the Facebook Ads guide here and looking at the two different objectives that you would

12
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.140
have with our marketing.

13
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.470
The first objective that you probably have if you're a brand new app is to drive up installs and you

14
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.360
can see that you can place these ads on the Facebook mobile app you can even do on the Facebook desk

15
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:17.060
top up Instagram mobile app and you can put it on Instagram using carrousel ads as well.

16
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.350
The format of the odds are probably going to be pretty simple and the objective in the call to action

17
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.120
button is really just going to be install now.

18
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.380
Now that looks pretty normal to what we've seen before.

19
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.040
What is slightly different is what happens once people click here.

20
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.350
They will be brought to either.

21
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.830
They will be brought to the Apple Store or the Google Play store depending on their device so that they

22
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.640
can download the app directly.

23
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.580
Now the rest of these recommendations you can have a look at them in more detail the reseller.

24
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.840
But here is one interesting thing to note that your star rating from the Apple Store or Google Play

25
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.560
Store will automatically show on your iPod.

26
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:06.270
And so that is great social proof that you can pull through from those app stores to show on your AD.

27
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.580
So your first objective is going to be to get people to install your ad and if you're running a campaign

28
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:19.110
this is probably the first step next step then is to drive more engagement and get more activity on

29
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.370
your mobile app.

30
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.700
It's not enough just to get people to install it.

31
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.410
You might need to drive more engagement once they have downloaded it and really a top tip in order to

32
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:35.310
achieve this is to create a custom audience of people who use your mobile app and then reach them with

33
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.520
it.

34
00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:42.380
I'm not encouraging them to take specific actions now in order for you to create this custom audience.

35
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:51.210
You will need to have the Facebook SDK set up and that is the equivalent of really the Facebook pixel

36
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.040
for a web site you want to set it up for those same reasons.

37
00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.360
So now you understand that you have two objectives apps installs an app engagement.

38
00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:08.490
Let us have a look at some of these case studies to see how businesses are piecing this together and

39
00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.510
getting some amazing results.

40
00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:18.630
So what we have here is a brand new take out ordering app and you can see that through Facebook ads

41
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:26.460
they were able to get 15 times an app installs over four months on over 70000 app interactions so they

42
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.260
are installs Plus the interactions.

43
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:36.420
Now the name of the app is 10 bese at Israel's largest take ordering app on in your country you probably

44
00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:43.650
seen an equivalent to this really linking a lot of restaurants together and enabling people to order

45
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.220
food through one single up.

46
00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:53.010
Now if we look down here their solution and how they achieve their goals is pretty interesting what

47
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:59.670
they really did was start by using interest and demographic toward targeting with mobile iPods.

48
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:06.600
And they wanted to reach groups who were most likely to download and use their op such as those with

49
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:13.200
known interest in food and restaurants single people and younger age groups so that is some smart targeting

50
00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:19.380
through interest in demographics there you can see that people who already are interested in food restaurants

51
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.200
are probably going to be interested in their op.

52
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.100
Single people who maybe don't want a coke and prefer just order.

53
00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:33.060
We're younger people who may be more likely to get takeaways more often rather than going out and buying

54
00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.270
a lot of food etc. so seems interesting targeting there just to know.

55
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:44.220
And then once they had driven some op installs using the interest and demographic targeting they really

56
00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:51.330
went on to Step two here which was to drive more app engagement and had another campaign where these

57
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:58.830
custom audiences as we've said to target ads to target people who have already downloaded the app and

58
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:05.490
these ads encourage them placeholders using the app called to action button and they did encourage that

59
00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:10.300
activity by offering special promotions for restaurants in their local area during this campaign.

60
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:19.050
So two quite very strategic ways that they first build installs and next drove those engagement by offering

61
00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.460
special coupons.

62
00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:28.690
So that was the 10 best Let's have a look at another case study here which is play space.

63
00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:34.740
This is quite an interesting one because they were really focused on driving up engagement for Brazilian

64
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:41.910
women gamers for one game and that they had an interesting enough this is a Spanish company a game studio

65
00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.200
and they were very focused on driving this growth overseas.

66
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:53.670
So you can see some of the results here too x increase in monthly users 3x increase in revenue 50 percent

67
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:59.460
increase in paying players 10x greater efficiency reach efficiency than TVs.

68
00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:05.680
You can see a lot of these results here are more focused on the app engagement rather than up installs

69
00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:13.010
coming down we can see that once again they targeted specific demographics women of a certain age rather

70
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:18.320
than interests and really did it to promote this local bingo game.

71
00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:21.960
Then they use the custom audiences once again you can start to see a pattern here.

72
00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:27.860
This is really key custom lines of existing players encourage them to come back.

73
00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:34.740
Here's the interesting part that they showed these people tailor a video tailored to the Brazilian market

74
00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:41.960
solvency in Brazil and Portuguese showcasing new game features through a series of carrousel and up

75
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.240
and stall ads.

76
00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:49.110
So that's an interesting tactic that they used to really show new features to encourage people to come

77
00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:52.540
back and download the app.

78
00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:57.360
Now that you've seen some of those case studies and understand practically what are some of the strategies

79
00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.450
that you can use.

80
00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.690
Let's look at some of the steps in the setup process.

81
00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:09.780
So if you want to start using app installed or up an engagement it's the first step is to register and

82
00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:13.710
configure an app I'm not going to go through all these steps.

83
00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:20.710
I don't have an opt myself but the key thing is that you need to do are to set up a developer account.

84
00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:24.050
You also need to create your new app in there.

85
00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:28.070
The outcome of that process is really to create an app ID.

86
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:34.230
Once you've got that app ID you can install it into your otic can't and then you're pretty much ready

87
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:34.790
to go.

88
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:41.700
However you probably do want to set up that Facebook SDK so that you can do things like measure installs

89
00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:48.630
without the Facebook SDK won't be able to do that and you won't be able to set up those custom audiences

90
00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:53.190
for improved targeting and measure up conversions et cetera.

91
00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:56.470
So those two steps are absolutely critical.

92
00:07:56.490 --> 00:08:00.020
Now looking finally at the ads create tool.

93
00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:01.690
How do you set these up.

94
00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:06.890
You can come in and select your campaign objective objectives up installs.

95
00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:09.870
Then once in here you need to add in your app.

96
00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:15.750
Now I have to set one up as an example here so that's the first thing that you need to do if you haven't

97
00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:18.090
registered your app that won't appear.

98
00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:22.170
Then you go through the rest of the onset set up as normal.

99
00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:29.820
Your audience your placements here your budget and schedule is set for setting up the format is pretty

100
00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:36.690
much as normally you can choose a video image etc. on the rest of the set up process is pretty much

101
00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:37.290
the same.

102
00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:42.510
The key thing that I wanted to show you is that you can't move further in the campaign unless you've

103
00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:43.760
got the apps set up.

104
00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:51.180
And that's why you need to first register your app so nave a good understanding of app marketing on

105
00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:57.150
Facebook I'll put a link to these two resources in the resources sector of this lecture.

106
00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:03.130
So if you are going to market drop you can just follow these steps to get set up.
