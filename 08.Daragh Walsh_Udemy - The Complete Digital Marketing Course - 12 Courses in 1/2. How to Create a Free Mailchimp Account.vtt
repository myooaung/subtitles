00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:07.470
To send e-mails to a big list of email contacts and to get analytics on all those campaigns what you

2
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.490
need to do is set up in an account with an email service provider.

3
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.310
There are tons of options out there but the one that I recommend and use is MailChimp.

4
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.600
It works on any type of site.

5
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.320
They've been around for ages and they are also free to use up to two thousand subscribers which is always

6
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.780
a great reason to use product.

7
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.320
So what you want to do is type in MailChimp into Google.

8
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:38.310
Go ahead and just click through and then you can go ahead and sign up and you can sign up with your

9
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.120
personal account.

10
00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:46.120
If it'll only be you using it where you can sign up with your company email if you want as well.

11
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.800
Now once inside watch you want to do is come up and click on lists and then you want to create a list

12
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.440
and you can just go ahead and create a list.

13
00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.700
So by creating a list we'll be able to send one e-mail to everybody that's on our list.

14
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.910
So we need to fill out some of the less details like the list name.

15
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.640
So they even help you walk through some of this here.

16
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.640
A good example is just your domain name and newsletter.

17
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.970
So I'll just put in example the main.

18
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.520
Now here we want to put it in the default Frome address and this is the address that people will respond

19
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.090
to.

20
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:31.200
Now this will need to be an email that you have access to because then you'll need to verify this in

21
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:39.950
just a second but it's best not to put in a domain specific e-mail that you will have set up next.

22
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.490
Select the default name and use something the in you recognize like your company name.

23
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:53.730
So I'll just say example to me now what we want to do is put in a short reminder about how they got

24
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.380
this e-mail and you can just re rewrite the example down here.

25
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:10.040
You are receiving this e-mail because you opted in on our site.

26
00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.200
It's just a requirement for anti spam down here as well.

27
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.980
You're going to need to input some of your company information so you can change this to your company

28
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.140
name and address.

29
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:28.730
You don't need to put it in like the number say your office whatever 10 A you can just put in the street

30
00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.850
address in the city name etc..

31
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:37.970
Again this is just anti spam measure maelstrom proxy required to collect this information.

32
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.970
So next you can just put in your country and your state and the phone number if you want as well.

33
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.220
And then you can also select if you want to get notifications of a simple daily subscribers on subscribers

34
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.460
cetera and then you want to go ahead and click save so.

35
00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.150
Excellent.

36
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.160
We now have created a brand new list.

37
00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.270
And one thing that we actually want to do right now before we start to import contacts or anything is

38
00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.330
actually to verify our email address.

39
00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:16.100
So what I'd recommend you do is go and type and verify all verify email MailChimp and what we need to

40
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:23.630
do is just to show MailChimp that we own that domain that we've popped in.

41
00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:31.490
And so what you can see have to do is come then into account and it may actually even show up if we

42
00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:36.430
come into settings lists the names and let's see.

43
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.590
Yep it says it here.

44
00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.640
This is actually maybe the easier way to do it.

45
00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:49.390
So he come into your list and then you come in to settings lists name and defaults you're going to see

46
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:58.140
that you have to verify your domains that you can send emails and receive replies from this mail.

47
00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.640
So what we can do is go ahead and click verify domain here.

48
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.990
We can just pop in or e-mail address get them to send a verification email.

49
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.370
The verification is e-mail on the way.

50
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.050
So I just need to go and get that

51
00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:22.030
so to do that I'm just logging into my host on where I've set up my domain specific email and now I

52
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.140
can see this verification email from MailChimp.

53
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.370
So I just need to get into this and verify the domain access.

54
00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.550
I can actually just take this code.

55
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.060
Copy this page step back in and click verify.

56
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:45.820
So now my domain has been successfully verified so I can send emails with this email appearing and also

57
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.910
receive emails back.

58
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:55.930
So now that I've verified my email what I might want to do is come back to my list again and I now have

59
00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:01.930
the opportunity to start to import context into this email list if I want.

60
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:08.140
So if you've already got some email addresses maybe from LinkedIn maybe from G.M. maybe from other sources

61
00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.320
you can just import those CSP files there.

62
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.910
And you could just upload those and what you can also do which is sometimes Handy is you can use actually

63
00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:22.270
copy and paste email addresses in.

64
00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:28.340
So this is going to just give you a tab that you really just copy and paste them into.

65
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.910
And once you've got that done then you're going to have a list of emails that you can send an email

66
00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:35.750
directly as to.

67
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:41.020
And again the benefit of setting it up in MailChimp is that you can send send them in bulk you are not

68
00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:46.840
going to get caught in that spam filter as opposed to if you're sending a bulk email from a personal

69
00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:47.640
address.

70
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:53.260
They're going to recognize your your brand name and also you get all those cool analytics like how many

71
00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:59.710
people open the email and etc. sonata you know how to set up a mailchimp account for free.

72
00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.480
Go ahead and set one up for yourself.

73
00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.370
Don't forget to verify that domain.

74
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:09.010
And if you've any questions or problems with that just check their support guides and then you can go

75
00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:14.950
ahead and import those contacts so you're ready to start sending an email campaigns to your email list.
