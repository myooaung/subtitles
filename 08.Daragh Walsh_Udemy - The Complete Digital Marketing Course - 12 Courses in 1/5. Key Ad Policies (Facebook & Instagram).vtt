Before you create your face for God it's important that you understand the key and policies for Facebook

2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.310
and Instagram because there are some restrictions in terms of the content the targeting and the images

3
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.050
that you can use in your Facebook pass.

4
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.660
Now the best place to understand the Facebook policies is on the Facebook Web site itself.

5
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.590
They have a very detailed guide about what is allowed what is not allowed and if you want to access

6
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:32.150
this for yourself you can go to Facebook come forward slash policies for Slash ads.

7
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:38.280
So the first thing to understand is that there is an odd review process before your ads show up on Facebook

8
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.910
and Instagram they're reviewed to make sure they meet these advertising policy laid out here that typically

9
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.780
that will happen and your ads will be reviewed within 24 hours.

10
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.300
And if for any reason you're out is not approved you'll get a notification by e-mail explaining why

11
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.500
and the changes that you need to make.

12
00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.140
So let's start by looking at some of the prohibited content.

13
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.270
Now anything that's listed here cannot be advertised on Facebook.

14
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.120
And as you can imagine a lot of these things are pretty obvious like illegal products or services tobacco

15
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.910
products drugs.

16
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:20.520
But here there are a couple of surprising categories here like on safe supplements and that's probably

17
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:26.400
a reason why you don't see a lot of supplements for bodybuilding eccentric in your Facebook news feed

18
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:33.950
because Facebook has the sole discretion to decide whether your supplement is safe or unsafe.

19
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.550
So that's a big question mark.

20
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:43.340
If you are advertising in this Neech moving then again some more obvious categories like adults content

21
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.140
or products.

22
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.870
But down here is another interesting one third party infringements.

23
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.010
And I have a great example of this.

24
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:58.140
I had a friend who wanted to create a T-shirt company that had printed on the T-shirts the latest means

25
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.140
from you ran the Internet.

26
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:06.000
And the problem with this and why he wasn't able to really get his business idea off the ground on access

27
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.300
Facebook gods is because a lot of those means and images included copyrighted trademarked images.

28
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.460
So that's worth considering.

29
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.870
If you are going to sell T-shirts or any products like that that had copyright infringement you won't

30
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.030
be able to advertise them through the Facebook platform.

31
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.810
They're moving them a further little bit here.

32
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:35.310
There are a lot more things under the prohibited content here payday cash loans multi-level marketing

33
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.300
penny auctions etc..

34
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:43.770
Some of things you might expect to see now after brick Hibbett content there are restrictions on certain

35
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.270
other types of content like alcohol.

36
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.800
You must follow the local laws.

37
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:55.680
So for example in Ireland where I'm from you wouldn't be able to advertise to anybody under 18 in relation

38
00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.800
to alcohol or other types of restricted content like online pharmacies supplements.

39
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.380
If you're in this business once again it's good to come in here and really check before you go through

40
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.580
that process of setting up your odds.

41
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.980
Doing all the targeting only to get approved at the end of all of that.

42
00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.480
So prohibited unrestricted content are the big policy areas that you want to review.

43
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:27.570
Now another important one where there's a lot of confusion is text in images and Facebook recently changed

44
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:28.400
the rules on this.

45
00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.610
So this is worth looking at in a little bit more detail.

46
00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:38.940
So Facebook policies recently were or previously where they prohibited odds would tax the covered more

47
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.000
than 20 percent of an image.

48
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.570
So they wanted to keep the Facebook news feed looking good.

49
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:52.080
They don't want it looking spammy and having ads but a lot of text on them and they've recently revised

50
00:03:52.140 --> 00:04:00.510
a new solution that allows ads with greater than 20 percent text to run but with less or no delivery.

51
00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.060
Now why did they change the rule.

52
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:09.690
Well my guess is that they wanted to reduce the workload that they had in term terms of rejecting ads

53
00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.990
and going through that approval process.

54
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:18.240
So they decided to put the onus back on the advertiser and say if you have ads that are greater than

55
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:24.240
20 percent text on the images you're going to you're going to be able to advertise but with less or

56
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.650
no delivery.

57
00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.090
So let us have a look at a couple of examples for this.

58
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:37.110
Now here I am inside the boose post tool and I have an image here that has more than 20 percent text

59
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.970
on it so you can see a lot of text in this image here.

60
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.390
And I'm getting this morning saying you're boosted post may not run images with a high proportion of

61
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:46.020
text.

62
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.070
Don't use their budget as efficiently.

63
00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.520
May not even run.

64
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:56.740
So you will get this automatic warning if you're trying to run an ad with more than 20 percent text.

65
00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:03.350
But if you don't it's good to just ensure measured out for yourself and if you have any doubts of whether

66
00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:10.160
your image contains more than 20 percent tax you can use this tool here I'll put the link in the resources

67
00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.570
section of this lecture.

68
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.660
But you just upload your image and that'll really check the text for you.

69
00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:22.200
Let's look at one other example and this is actually an ad that I saw on my Facebook news feed.

70
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.330
I have saved it so doesn't appear is enough.

71
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.130
Now this is an ad for Linked-In.

72
00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:31.220
And as you can see there's quite a lot of text on the image here.

73
00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:37.250
Now according to the Facebook rules this will get a lot less delivery or not run at all.

74
00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:43.120
So I think that that rule is maybe slightly fact is flexible if everything else about the advertisers

75
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.110
is looking good.

76
00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.810
But to be honest I don't know why Illington even need to include this much text.

77
00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:55.680
I think just saying get fifty dollars on credits is enough for me to be curious and click through.

78
00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:01.280
So to recap in this lecture what you've learned is that before your God show up on Facebook and Instagram

79
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:06.290
they are reviewed to make sure they meet those advertising policies.

80
00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.810
Ads will get approved or disapproved within 24 hours.

81
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:16.010
But to save yourself all that time of setting up campaigns it's worth reviewing these policies before

82
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.750
you take the next step.

83
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.980
So put this link in the resources section of this lecture.

84
00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:25.900
If you've any doubts go ahead and check that out now and then I'll see you in the next video.
