In this video you're going to learn how to use Facebook competitions to grow your Facebook page extremely

2
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.670
fast.

3
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.850
Now Facebook competitions are such a great way to grow your page because they often get a huge amount

4
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:16.010
of engagements.

5
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.700
So you can see here is a competition that I actually did when I first published this page.

6
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:30.780
And that's a great time to use competitions to really help get awareness about your page and brand very

7
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:37.860
quickly so you can see it's got a lot of engagement here and it also got a good amount of shares and

8
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.340
likes as well and comments below.

9
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.970
So the reason their competitions are such a great idea is because they give people an incentive to engage

10
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.160
with your post.

11
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.780
The more people that engage with your posts than the more of their friends that are going to see your

12
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:55.590
posts.

13
00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.530
So you can really create that viral effect and create a huge amount awareness for your posts through

14
00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.900
the social network of other people.

15
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.080
So let me show you just how to set this up and just put a free competition like this.

16
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.730
So this competition is closed.

17
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.940
So I added this comment in afterwards.

18
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.270
So what you want to do is really create the competition.

19
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.790
And then afterwards obtained it once it's over.

20
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.720
So here's what I said and this is just to give you a couple of ideas it's obviously going to change

21
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.030
for your business.

22
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.350
I mean in a show you had to find some ideas for competitions as well.

23
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:42.210
So I said when two free passes to enter simply like uncomment Tag a friend or colleague you can take

24
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.270
the course with.

25
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.450
And the winner will be announced Friday 20 July just before the course launches.

26
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.810
Good luck to everyone and I included a quick video here as well just to make sure they caught some attention

27
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.290
in people's newsfeeds as well.

28
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.120
I recommend you do that.

29
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.520
You could even just create a simple post and competition time where have a quick video there.

30
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:11.640
So when two free passes to enter simply like and comments and at the time a very small amount of Facebook

31
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.500
likes.

32
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.850
And this got 11 shares and 69 likes and colons etc..

33
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:27.500
So the key thing is is you have to make part part of the entry has to be for them to take an action

34
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.350
on the post.

35
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.880
That's the key thing that's how you create that viral effect.

36
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:38.930
Now I do want to point out that for competitions on Facebook you do have to be quite careful about what

37
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.600
you say in terms of entering.

38
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.520
So to highlight this I want to show you the Facebook guidelines.

39
00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:56.970
These actually mention some things about competition so we go to promotion's says some guidelines about

40
00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:57.600
promotions.

41
00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.210
The important part is is that

42
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:09.930
personal time personal timelines and friend connections must not be used to administer administer promotions

43
00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:17.520
e.g. share on your time line to enter or share on your friends timeline to get additional entries or

44
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.750
tag your friends.

45
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.790
In this post to enter.

46
00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.620
So that's the key thing that you can say.

47
00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.210
You actually can technically say Like and Share to enter.

48
00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.680
That's why I said here.

49
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.670
Like and Comment now I said.

50
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:39.270
Tag a friend or colleague as an option so that wasn't that wasn't actually a term of entry but I just

51
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.220
suggested that as well.

52
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:48.260
So that's a kind of a way to get around those those guidelines to simply say like and comments.

53
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:54.560
The reality is is that most people don't strictly abide to these Facebook guidelines.

54
00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:00.990
She come into Facebook any typing competition you're going to see a lot of people say like this post

55
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:08.250
tag friends and enter you're going to see people say simply share and like this posts and you can see

56
00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.130
that this was yesterday.

57
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.020
It's 7:40.

58
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.910
It's still published it's got 50000 shares on Forte's and.

59
00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:23.070
So even though Facebook's guidelines say you shouldn't say share.

60
00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:29.910
The reality is that in practice a lot of pages are doing it without any repercussions.

61
00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.380
So my point is if you want to be safe don't make sharing a term of entry.

62
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:42.330
But if you want to try it out and do what most people are doing and get that much more viral effect

63
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.050
you can actually include that if you want.

64
00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.540
So I'm just pointing out what people are doing.

65
00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.630
The option is really up to you and you can make the best choice for your page.

66
00:04:52.660 --> 00:05:00.540
Key point to get across is no matter which way you do it that competitions are an incredibly good way

67
00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:08.370
to promote your page because you're you're creating that viral effect and using other people's friends

68
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:14.380
to help spread your message when they share their message is going to quites all their friends.

69
00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.770
So I could have one person they have 200 friends most of their friends are going to see that or at least

70
00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.190
the ones that are engaged with competitions are extremely powerful.

71
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:31.380
And this is a simple type competition you can set up to really kick off her Facebook page or to do at

72
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.280
any stage.

73
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:37.800
They just work so well that you should really be doing these regularly enough if you something good

74
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:38.740
to give away.

75
00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:45.660
So go ahead and use Facebook competitions to grow your own page or consider easing them for clients

76
00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.020
for a company's page.
