00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:05,700
In this video you're going to learn how to set up event tracking in Google Analytics and the reasons

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,860
why you would want to use it.

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:15,450
So event tracking reports appear here underneath the behavior section and the events section here in

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,390
google analytics.

5
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:23,880
And really the benefit of using event tracking is that it allows you to capture user interactions on

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:29,070
your site which Google Analytics does not automatically capture.

7
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:36,170
So some examples of this to make it really clear are tracking how many people click on a click to call

8
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,640
phone number on your Web site.

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,470
So imagine you're a local business you have a phone number at the top.

10
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:48,290
You really want to track how many people click on that because that is the main purpose of your Web

11
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:53,760
site to click to get users to click on the Web site so they can make an order from you.

12
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:59,730
And normally with Google Analytics we cannot track this because when they click on that phone number

13
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:04,440
it will just open up their phone and they'll die dial straight away.

14
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,880
Now obviously we don't have our Google Analytics installed on their phone so there's no way that we

15
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,010
can really track you know that they went there.

16
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:19,260
And also at it's not like when they click on that link they go to a thankyou page that we could track

17
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:23,280
at like we normally do with goals in google analytics.

18
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,530
So that's a very clear example for event tracking and probably the most common use case.

19
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,400
But there probably.

20
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:37,260
There are plenty of other ones as well such as clicking on an external link to a third party a live

21
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,240
chat application.

22
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:44,850
Again we can't track this because it's not like they're going to another page on our Web site and obviously

23
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,630
we don't have our Google Analytics installed on this third party tool.

24
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:55,420
So it's another example clicks on email addresses similarly it's just going to open up in your at you

25
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,900
know e-mail clients video plays.

26
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,020
Again it's not like they're leaving the page.

27
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,870
So we can't really track that interaction.

28
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:10,650
So that happens on the page same as podcast plays at same for say if they select a color or size we

29
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:16,360
can't track that normally abandonment of a form fields they don't complete anything.

30
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:22,190
Movements have even a nice scrolling then the page or clicks to social profiles.

31
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:27,870
Again these are all examples of things you can't normally track with Google Analytics and that is the

32
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:31,230
big advantage of event tracking.

33
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:36,810
So now that you understand the benefits of event tracking and use cases Heidi set it up.

34
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:45,060
Well the first step is really to copy the tracking code template so to tracking events a snippet of

35
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:52,010
code is added to the link on the site that you want to track or when the link is clicked.

36
00:02:52,020 --> 00:03:00,190
This interaction is tracked and displayed as events in Google Analytics like we have seen here.

37
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:08,700
So what we need to do is really give a way for Google Analytics to receive the category of that event.

38
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:15,540
What type of action it was on maybe a even give a label to it so that when we look at a reports here

39
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:21,960
we can really understand what type of category event is what type of action it was.

40
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:27,810
And also the event label like what particular product was a clicked on.

41
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,280
So that is what we want to do.

42
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:36,380
But the first step is really just copy the link and then this code is really added to the normal length

43
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,280
that we would have on our Web site.

44
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,170
So this is a full example of it all put together here.

45
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:47,800
So this is an example of a link that you would have on the back of your on the back end of your Web

46
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,270
site.

47
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:54,740
So this is what it would look in its coded form so we have a link to download a PD.

48
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,720
Now you might be thinking Can't we track downloads of PBS by going to.

49
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,520
Thank you Paige.

50
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:06,810
Yes we can normally but in this example we're saying that they just click on a link and they download

51
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,660
the PDA straight to their computer.

52
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,280
We don't send them to a tiny CU page where they can download us.

53
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:17,040
So in this scenario and that's why we would be using event tracking.

54
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:21,000
So what we have here is the normal length that we'd have for them to download the PDA.

55
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:26,760
And then we also have this extra information that we're sending an event to Google on and it's saying

56
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,890
they downloaded a PDA F and it was this particular PDA.

57
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:37,620
And this is the text here that would appear on the Web site as a user reach reads it they just see download

58
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,100
PDA.

59
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,860
They wouldn't see any of this extra information.

60
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:42,000
So that's the first step.

61
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,550
Copy the tracking code template.

62
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,870
Next step is to replace the template fields.

63
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:54,420
So we want to replace the category action label and potentially the value fields to describe the user's

64
00:04:54,540 --> 00:05:01,170
interaction with our Web site so that we can really see that once we open up our Google Analytics reports

65
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:04,950
like this category action and label.

66
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:07,490
So the category this is required.

67
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:13,530
This typically is the object or group of objects that was interacted with could be like the video or

68
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:21,000
the PDA f then the action is the type of interaction could be like play or download or in this example

69
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:29,640
here could be things like product clicks onto cars removed from cars etc. then then you have label.

70
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,140
So this is useful for summarizing what the event is about.

71
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:38,820
For example the name of the video or the name of the PDA f or in these examples here it's the name of

72
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:47,040
the particular product and you have the option to add a numeric value as well associated with the event

73
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:50,520
that could be a dollar figure if you wanted to track that.

74
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:57,360
So that step to replace those template fields so you can really send information about the interaction

75
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:02,220
to Google Analytics as a step number three is to implement the tracking code.

76
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:07,970
So you need to manually add this link plus all this extra event tracking code to your Web site.

77
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:14,470
So you'll need to log in to the back end of your Web site and add this code in.

78
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:20,520
And this is really the full example once again that's what it's going to look like when you code it

79
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,430
in or just copy and paste that.

80
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:27,990
But this is all that the user will see when they click on your Web site.

81
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:34,440
So to summarize in this video we've looked at the three steps to setup event tracking the use cases

82
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,860
for us and how to find the reports in google analytics.

83
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:43,600
So what I'll do is I'll put the template for event tracking in the description is video along with the

84
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,650
example so you can really take that and use it for yourself and track those user interactions in Google

85
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:50,190
Analytics.
