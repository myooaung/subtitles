00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:05,480
In this video you're going learn how to bulk manage with power editor which is one of the key benefits

2
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:06,680
of the tool.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,890
We'll look at a couple of different examples.

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,880
Firstly how you can both manage ads.

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:17,160
That's then how you can both manage ads and upload new images and also how you can book manage with

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,890
Excel as well.

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:23,140
So let's start off by looking at how to book Manage an odd set.

8
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:29,390
Let's take this example of one campaign to really get started to select one campaign and say for example

9
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:33,580
there was one thing that I wanted to change in my onsets.

10
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:39,020
After the campaigns have run for a while and I've understood what's really working what I can do for

11
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:46,220
example is if I've noticed that a certain age range is really getting all the results for my campaign

12
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:52,000
and I want to narrow it down to that I can do that in bulk here in power Ed..

13
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,460
Otherwise I'd have to go through all of them one by one and change them.

14
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:56,790
But here it's pretty simple.

15
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:03,530
So what I want to do is firstly come to my sets tab then I can just select all of the assets that I

16
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:09,990
want to change or I can just select the ones individually that I want to change then I can come into

17
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,940
the edit button here.

18
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,480
Now what I'm going to see here are all of the values for these campaigns that I can really change.

19
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:24,020
So what you're going to notice here is because all of these odd sets of different names you're going

20
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,920
to see mixed values.

21
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:31,820
Also if you see in terms of share you'll start starkers mixed values here and also if we move them to

22
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:36,030
the audiences themselves there these are three completely different audiences.

23
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:40,690
So I kind of edit these in bulk I can reset them if I want them to be all the same.

24
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:48,410
But what this book management tool is allowing us to do is to both manage do things that are equal across

25
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:49,280
all of the campaigns.

26
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:55,880
For example the body is the same the end date was the same and also the age range was the same across

27
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,400
all our campaigns on the gender.

28
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:03,080
So what I could do for example for all three of these campaigns because this information is the same.

29
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:10,730
I can change this to maybe an age range of 25 to 34 because this is where I was getting all the results

30
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,600
for this campaign and going forward.

31
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,350
I just want to narrow it to that.

32
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:21,020
So essentially those changes have now been made is pretty much as simple as that I can come up here

33
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:26,450
on the top right hand side you can see the green box here review changes here.

34
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:33,050
I can really see the changes that Ive made to the campaign I can either apply them or I can click Cancel

35
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,090
and then discard them.

36
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:41,660
So you can change not only the age and gender but really any of those parameters that is that are same

37
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,430
across all of the sets.

38
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:46,810
Thats our first example just managing onsets in campaigns.

39
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,310
You can do a lot of different ways.

40
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:54,050
That's just one example to show you how to work the same process for all of the different things.

41
00:02:54,050 --> 00:03:02,590
Now let's come down into the level and look at how we could update the images across all of our ads.

42
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:07,940
So let's come back again and actually just stick with the same example for this one campaign.

43
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,440
We've got three onsets.

44
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,960
And then in here we've got a number of ads.

45
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:16,780
Now what I may have noticed from my campaigns is that one image was I performing everything else and

46
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:21,100
I want to update all of the odds to be the same in terms of the image.

47
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:28,370
I still might have different copy across the different cards and that's why I still maintain them as

48
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:31,020
separate odds in the onsets.

49
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:37,640
So what I can do once again is just come in here and select all of the odds or the individual ones that

50
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:45,390
I want and in terms of how I could change the image just come into edits and then I could come down

51
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,090
into the image section.

52
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:54,020
Here you can see I could change the image I can use my own image library and pick maybe an image here

53
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:59,450
I could maybe pick this image would I put the text that was the one that was performing well or get

54
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:03,880
upload an image like no one who uploads stock images as we've seen before.

55
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:12,110
So if I selected this or another image I could select this here and then that would update this image

56
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,310
across all of them.

57
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:19,920
Now what I can do once again is really decide to actually counsel lot and discard those changes.

58
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,570
And it goes back to as it was here.

59
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:29,620
Another way that you can book Manage your power editor is actually to take the information out of power

60
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,790
editor an edited in Excel and then upload it back up.

61
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:41,020
So for example if I wanted to really like this campaign and all any information in it I could just select

62
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:45,560
it here then come to this little icon for export and import.

63
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:51,760
And I can really export this data that's selected and it's going to pop open in Excel.

64
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:59,470
Now what I can do is really edit this information here in my cell and then upload it back into power

65
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,040
editor.

66
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,710
So for example what I could do is the campaign starts here is paused.

67
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:12,070
What I could do is change this to active for all of these

68
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,760
assets and then what I can do is just upload that back up and it's the same principle for anything here

69
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,700
you can read just any of these things.

70
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:27,230
Now as you can imagine you would have to probably have to have a lot of bad sets and odds to really

71
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:30,100
justify exporting and doing it this way.

72
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:35,720
But it is great to know that this option is available and there's another reason that you might want

73
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:43,460
to use excel in order to create campaigns either as a freelancer or either as a business owner and that's

74
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:49,880
because you could actually give someone a template you can see download template here and ask them to

75
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:51,400
create campaigns for you.

76
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:57,020
Or if you're working as a freelancer create campaigns here send them to people and then it could upload

77
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,970
them into their power editor.

78
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:07,520
You also might want to use Excel to extract some information out to power editors so you can replicate

79
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,540
the structure of some campaigns.

80
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:17,060
The type of ads that I use and some of the ads setups for other clients or other campaigns so that's

81
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:24,060
another reason why you might want to export this so you can really transfer odds and different sets

82
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:29,020
and structures and things like that to other accounts very very easily.

83
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:36,350
So now that you know how to both manage handsets and images insides and even both managing Excel go

84
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,570
ahead and take a couple of minutes to play around with that.

85
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:43,880
Remember that you can always come here to review any changes and discard them if you don't want to follow

86
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,470
through.
