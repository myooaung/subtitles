1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,720
So I'm going to share five of the best digital marketing tools to grow a business.

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:10,740
I use them all on a daily basis and they're all absolutely free.

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,630
I'm also going to share at the end of the video this list with all of the tools that we'll be looking

4
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:21,870
at which are start here plus some of my other favorites so hang around to the end and I'll share that

5
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:22,700
list.

6
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,980
So the first tool is similar Web dot com.

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:32,970
And if you want to get a digital marketing strategy for any business in about five minutes then this

8
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,270
is the tool to use.

9
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:39,930
All you need to do is go ahead and type in a competitor or a Web site that has a similar audience to

10
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:47,700
the one that you want to attract and just type it in and similar way boom creates a big marketing report

11
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:53,460
here really showing you behind the scenes look at how they get web site visitors.

12
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:59,640
So I've typed in arm brothers here which is just an e-commerce site that send sells men's bracelets

13
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:04,770
and we can see straight away how much traffic they're getting per month.

14
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:07,520
What are the countries that the traffic is coming from.

15
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,910
What are the different marketing channels that they are focusing on.

16
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:18,090
Even the Web sites that are sending them traffic water even the phrases and words that people are typing

17
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,550
into the search engine that are bringing them to their site and also even water to some of the phrases

18
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,350
that they're advertising around.

19
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:30,090
So with this information I can really figure out you know what is this social media channel they're

20
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,080
focusing on.

21
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:35,140
I could create content around these terms as well from my own site.

22
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:41,460
And it's just an incredible look behind the scenes at any business and how they market it.

23
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:47,280
Now you're not able to get this information and in fact you know Arab brothers probably are not too

24
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,910
happy that all this information is out there but with similar web you can really see how they market

25
00:01:53,910 --> 00:02:00,030
their business see what's successful for them and you can take and apply those strategies for yourself.

26
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,070
You can do it for three or four other competitors and you can get a really clear picture of what marketing

27
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:10,980
channels they're focusing on even go into say their Facebook see what posts they're making and you don't

28
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,530
have to do a lot of guests guys.

29
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:17,900
All of the proven strategies tailored specifically to your business are out there.

30
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,210
So check it out on similar web.

31
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:25,350
You can use it for your own business to get a digital marketing strategy for any client that you come

32
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,330
across.

33
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:33,960
And also you can research the companies they are interviewing for and really show them in a lot of detail.

34
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:38,820
I know how you guys market your business and I can help improve x y z.

35
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:45,170
So that's the first tool similar Web really a key tool for any digital marketer.

36
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:50,540
Now the second tool is Google Trends and this is incredibly useful tool.

37
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:57,780
Once again if you want to find sizzling hot topic ideas for blog posts or YouTube videos then there's

38
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,060
no better tool than Google Trends.

39
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:06,600
And that is because Google Trends really shows you what the world is searching for.

40
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:14,760
So how I use it if if I'm thinking to create a say video or blog post around something like WordPress

41
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:20,610
what I'll do is come in and type that into google trends come then and change this filter to the last

42
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:21,420
30 days.

43
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,170
You can change the country as well if you want to.

44
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:31,110
Really what I'm looking for here are these break out terms I can see that WordPress 5.0 it's up one

45
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:38,410
hundred and ten percent over the last 30 days and we're press 5.0 is break at meetings way above you

46
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:43,230
know even one hundred and fifty percent so as a marketer what does that telling me.

47
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:46,030
Well it's telling me over the last 30 days.

48
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,410
You know there has been an explosion in interest.

49
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:51,360
People typing into Google WordPress 5.0.

50
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:58,260
So if I could create a YouTube video or a blog post explaining what WordPress 5.0 is its features its

51
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:04,500
benefits its release dates etc. then I'm going to easily be able to get to the top of the search results

52
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:10,410
or the top youtube video because if it's in the last 30 days you can be guaranteed that not a lot of

53
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:17,040
other people have created content on this topic and Google Trends and is really looking at these breakout

54
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,200
terms solves a key problem.

55
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:26,670
If you're a new business how do you really get found when a lot of the big topics are saturated every

56
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:32,280
good company is made of you know something about Facebook ads say a blog post.

57
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:38,340
If you were a new company how would you do you want to come look at these breakout terms and that really

58
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:44,250
gets you to the top of the search results or get huge amount of shares because there is incredible interest

59
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,340
in these new breakout terms.

60
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,460
So that is the second to Google Trends You can use it again for your own business for any clients business

61
00:04:53,490 --> 00:05:00,310
or again come into an interview with some incredibly ideas about content that they could make that would

62
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,740
really suit their audience.

63
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,580
Now the third tool is kinda dot com.

64
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:12,190
And if you want to save money on stock photos and expensive graphic design software like Photoshop then

65
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,760
you can use COM dot com.

66
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:20,800
Now as a digital marketer it's really essential that you make know images for your Facebook guides blog

67
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:27,640
posts youtube tutorials and you want to be able to do that yourself quickly so that you can make changes

68
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:32,140
and adjustments and can really advise you that they have all these templates.

69
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:38,100
For example a Facebook post that you can just use you can drag and drop them in here.

70
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:45,430
You can change the colors you can change the text very easily and so you can really create those eye

71
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:52,920
catching images and really some basic graphic design skills are really essential as it is digital marketer

72
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:53,290
now.

73
00:05:53,290 --> 00:06:00,100
So you can add huge value to your business your marketing clients business or again have some extra

74
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:07,560
skill on your resumÃ© but coming in practicing and getting familiar with can dot.com.

75
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:14,170
Now the fourth tool is a Chrome extension called vid IQ and this is for YouTube.

76
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:19,810
Now YouTube is the second biggest Web site in the world and the second biggest search engine in the

77
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:20,540
world.

78
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:27,250
So if you want to get traffic and build an audience on the second biggest big biggest Web site in the

79
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:31,280
world and video IQ is a tool that would really help you do this.

80
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:38,530
So personally how I use it is if I'm considering making a video on a topic say for example Google Analytics

81
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,800
I just type that into the search bar in YouTube and then video iq.

82
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:48,820
Once I've got the chrome extension extolled brings up all this extra information at the side here and

83
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:55,570
I can see for example under the keywords score that this term Google Analytics gets a huge amount of

84
00:06:55,570 --> 00:07:00,610
search volume in YouTube it's not that's up at the top ninety three in the green.

85
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,650
So that's good.

86
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,600
But the most important thing as well is in terms of the competition.

87
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:11,230
So this is also in the green and this is actually the sweet spot that I can see that overall this keyword

88
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:19,750
has a score of 81 over 100 meaning that if I was to create a video on this topic I'd have a very good

89
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:24,730
chance of getting to the top of the search results in YouTube because there's not a lot of competition

90
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:30,640
but there's a huge amount of search volume and there's a lot of other things you can do it fit IQ but

91
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:37,990
that's one of my favorite little features that really helps me plan my content in order to get in front

92
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:45,970
of my audience so that IQ grade too especially if you want to focus then on video marketing and YouTube

93
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,670
marketing.

94
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:53,140
Now the fifth and final tool we'll look at is the keyword everywhere chrome extension.

95
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:58,190
So again this is a Chrome extension so you need to be using the Chrome browser for this.

96
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:04,480
But once you've got it installed what you were gonna be seeing is underneath these search bar in Google

97
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:07,170
you're going to see this metric here which is key.

98
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:12,890
The search volume per month so I can see for example you can type in any phrase here.

99
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,520
So online marketing course.

100
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:18,970
When I was creating my online marketing course I thought I'd name it.

101
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:24,070
The complete online marketing course and I was like OK well that gets eight times one hundred searches

102
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,620
per month that's pretty good.

103
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:29,850
But then I was like What about if I change this to digital marketing course.

104
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:37,560
Are there many more people searching for this compared to online and you can excuse the all caps.

105
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:41,860
But I saw an ad that's 60000 people per month are searching for that.

106
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:44,440
So that's just one word in the difference.

107
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:48,910
But seven times the amount of people are searching for that term.

108
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So what did I do I rename my course to complete digital marketing course I expanded my audience by seven

109
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,080
times.

110
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:02,260
And so vid are the keyword ever chrome extension is something I use on a daily basis three they test

111
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:07,870
the name of products blog posts ideas to really make sure that I'm appealing to the broadest audience

112
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:08,500
possible.

113
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:15,700
So in terms of content ideas like how to get more views on YouTube I type this in and I was pro twelve

114
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,370
thousand one hundred people per month are searching for that.

115
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:24,250
Maybe I could create a video on that and you can even star these searches for as well and it adds it

116
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,690
to a list.

117
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:37,750
So another incredibly useful tool to really validate the demand for your products or the content ideas.

118
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:45,220
So that wraps up the five best digital marketing tools and how I use them on a daily basis.

119
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:50,650
I've included them all here in this list which you can access by clicking the link on the description
