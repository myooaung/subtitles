1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:08,930
In this video you're going learn about lead adds a very new and exciting format that Facebook have released.

2
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:15,120
We'll start by understanding Rini Watervliet it is then we'll look at some of the key benefits of it

3
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:21,270
and then we're going to look at some case studies in how companies big and small are really getting

4
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:26,800
amazing results from lead ads in this and would be some really good hands on strategies.

5
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,610
I'll show you in these examples.

6
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:36,000
And then finally I want to show you how to set it up believe that some of the extra and additional things

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,690
you'll need to do when you set that up in the create tool.

8
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:49,380
So let's start by really understanding what our lead is and a great place to do that is inside the Facebook

9
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:50,360
guide.

10
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:57,440
This will give you an overview of all of the type of ads and objectives that are available.

11
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:03,810
I'll put a link to this in the resources section in this lecture so you can check it out at any time.

12
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:10,620
And for this particular video we're coming down here to lead generation to look in particular at these

13
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:11,860
lead.

14
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:20,490
That's really the purpose of this is to form our out of form to your ad to collect information from

15
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:27,390
people interested in your business so this is a way that you can collect email addresses phone numbers

16
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:33,450
for people who are interested in your business and the primary objective is to get those names you can

17
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:34,340
call them back.

18
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,980
You can put them into a C or M or you can follow up with them.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,600
Now if we look at how it actually looks here you can see that this looks like a normalized nothing looks

20
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,860
any different to maybe a Clix to Web site.

21
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,870
It's just an image that you click on.

22
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:56,920
However the big difference here is what happens after the click.

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,480
And really we look at the odd form here to really understand that.

24
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:08,850
So what we are seeing here is the full lead form and you can see that there are various steps and screens

25
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,230
in that process.

26
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:17,370
Once a person clicks through on the and this is the process and the step that they really go through

27
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:22,760
what we have to start off with is a contact's context card here.

28
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,260
And if we click in here we can see this in more detail.

29
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:33,990
This is essentially a welcome screen and you can see that there are some explanations about the business

30
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:41,760
and what happens if they click to get this deal to click to get a consultation to click to get a quote.

31
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:47,880
It's really explaining some of the terms and conditions and just letting people know what's going to

32
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,510
happen when they submit their e-mail that is optional.

33
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:57,960
You don't need to put that in there if you want but maybe as lead outs are quite a new odd format this

34
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:05,010
can be good to include So people really know what's happening after they click through this then they

35
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:09,570
click get deal they move on to the form itself.

36
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:16,410
And here's where the magic starts to happen because Facebook has your name and your e-mail your date

37
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,680
of birth and maybe even your phone number.

38
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,200
It will pre fill this form for you.

39
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,280
And that is great for the person who's filling out the form.

40
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,740
A lot of the work is done for them and it's also great for the business because much more people are

41
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,120
going to be likely to hit that submit button.

42
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:40,080
If all of the work is already done and we know that it's going to be accurate information as well if

43
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,530
people have already submitted it to Facebook.

44
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:49,720
Once you hit or the person hits the submit button it's on to the next step which again is optional.

45
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,950
A custom disclaimer which you can include.

46
00:03:54,180 --> 00:04:02,260
And then finally there is an end card which really things confirms that the submission has happened.

47
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,870
And it gives people a chance to visit the Web site if they want that.

48
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:13,830
So as you can see the ARB itself and the image looks normal but this is where the magic is starting

49
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:16,280
to happen in the lead.

50
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,640
And here are some of the key benefits of having this form.

51
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:28,590
Here is a quote from our land rover the digital and social media manager who is really talking about

52
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,030
the benefits of the lead.

53
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,220
And I think this really sums it all up.

54
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,890
That's why I want to show to you.

55
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,370
So Facebook natives lead.

56
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:43,200
I would perform with Link ads driving to the Web site to fill out a lead form in terms of total leads

57
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,640
and conversion rates.

58
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:52,890
While driving a 4 x reduction in costs per lead compared to previous social lead generation tactics.

59
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:59,240
So this is the key thing and I think this is important to understand what is the alternative to that.

60
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:08,120
Well clicks to Web site campaign and encouraging people to fill out a form on the land rover Web site.

61
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:15,600
In this example you can see that keeping it in Facebook pre-filtering not data is one of the reasons

62
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:23,370
that they for X their results and that's how powerful lead form is although it seems like a very simple

63
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:24,150
thing.

64
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:31,260
Let's start to have a look at some case studies now and see how some big companies are really using

65
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,300
these Livan forms very effectively.

66
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:40,930
This is Toyota Italy and we can see that they generated two thousand five hundred leads in seven days.

67
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:48,360
Ninety five percent lower costs than other benchmarks for digital channels and 59 percent of those leads

68
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:54,280
resulted in test drives so they're not just picking up leads that didn't result in a business outcome.

69
00:05:54,450 --> 00:06:02,460
They are getting a 60 percent conversion on the lead to the action that they want which is pretty amazing

70
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,870
as scrolling down.

71
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:10,980
Let's look at the actual tactics that they use because this is pretty interesting what a lot what Toyota

72
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:15,350
actually did is first they started with a video.

73
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,470
And there is an overview of it there.

74
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:25,470
So the car maker tested a potent combination of video and Leanne's and this is the more tactical strategy

75
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:28,090
stuff that you can maybe implement for yourself.

76
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:35,310
So the first thing to do is use a beautifully shot video or a video which really the purpose of was

77
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:39,690
to build awareness and interest for the new model of their car.

78
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:48,370
Then what they did is they actually used a lead dad to remarket to the custom audience of 1.7 million

79
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:53,110
thirty to 65 year old Italians who'd been reached by the video.

80
00:06:53,370 --> 00:07:00,600
So this is a really good strategy and will help you build up a targeted audience to put your dads in

81
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,350
front too.

82
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:08,190
First you start with a video out showing just creating awareness then you remarket to people who watched

83
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,610
the video out with the lead ads.

84
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,360
That's a very smart strategy.

85
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:12,840
Any body could use that.

86
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:17,440
You don't need to be a big car maker like Toyota.

87
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:25,050
Let's move on to another case study which is a local business the evoke who clinic day two cosmetic

88
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:27,840
surgeries and stuff like that.

89
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:30,920
Let's have a look at how they used this.

90
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:38,750
They use more cord targeting so interest demographics may be people with in the radius of their clinic.

91
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,600
And so you don't need to just use the video views custom audience.

92
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:48,180
You can also use lead ads based on demographic targeting.

93
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:54,240
In this case probably targeting women from cosmetic surgeries within a radius of the clinic.

94
00:07:54,330 --> 00:08:02,210
So you can use these lead ads with normal CT targeting or custom audiences as well.

95
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:09,120
So Nadya you understand the benefits of lead ads and some examples of how to use it in a campaign strategically.

96
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,340
Let's come into the ad manager and look at some of the things that you need to think about when you're

97
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,540
setting this up.

98
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:22,950
Now like every campaign that you will set up on Facebook you're working through the three levels campaign

99
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:27,500
ads set on ads at the start at the campaign level.

100
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:34,000
All you're doing is coming down and selecting the lead generation and then you're just clicking continue.

101
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:38,550
Now as you get into the onset level all the same steps apply.

102
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:44,780
You'll want to select an audience you want to select the placements for your god.

103
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,720
You want to select the budget and schedule none of that stuff is different.

104
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,490
It's the same as every other odd format that you use.

105
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:58,230
However when you come down into the ground level there is an additional step and you can see it and

106
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,080
hear the lead form.

107
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:07,440
So maybe what I'll do is just set up this image so we can see this properly what I'm going to do is

108
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:15,390
just in a free stock image and run through a little bit of the text that you might want to use for this.

109
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:22,270
So here's an image we can use I don't want to give you an example of some of the texts that you could

110
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,630
be using.

111
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:28,660
So the headline here for example could be get a free

112
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:37,230
get a free Skype consultation or something like that is it doesn't have to be to get quote.

113
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,450
If you are in the business maybe a digital marketing you are a coach of some sort.

114
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:46,080
You can get a free 15 minute

115
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:54,390
Skype consultation I can type OK.

116
00:09:54,390 --> 00:10:00,560
So something like that is something that you could offer to get people to really sign up.

117
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,800
Obviously you can put the text in there as you want.

118
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,520
You can change the call to action put in.

119
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,860
So is it worth it.

120
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:13,170
Thinking about the headline and what are you actually offering people for them handing over their email

121
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:19,000
address or phone numbers etc. but the real different part is down here.

122
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:24,990
This final part the lead form and this is where you really decide and feel like this information for

123
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:27,130
your own flow here.

124
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,740
So if we come in here you just need to click on a new form.

125
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:37,620
Then you can see you have these options for the welcome's screen which is optional.

126
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:41,640
You can see the image from my ad as being pulled through here.

127
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:47,230
You can write in the text whatever you want and it could be good to come back to these examples here

128
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:54,670
if you want to get more understanding about what you should maybe put in there when you come down and

129
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:59,330
then you just put in the questions that you want to ask.

130
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:00,790
Is it email.

131
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:05,950
Is there something else that you want to ask people you can add in any custom questions there if you

132
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:13,810
want private policy again what you want to do is because you're collecting customer information you

133
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:20,260
will need to include a link to your company's private policy showing that you're not going to be reselling

134
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:23,420
their information or that type of thing.

135
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:29,320
So you can put in the linked text and you can put in the link or else if you want that it to appear

136
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,520
a little bit easier.

137
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:31,840
You can put that in there.

138
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:38,260
And the real thing to go to is here if you also wanted to track how many people actually click through

139
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:44,150
you could use UTM tracking and then have your looking link there.

140
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:47,640
Really click and see how many people actually click through and read that.

141
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:55,140
You can also add in a custom disclaimer which as we saw here is optional once again.

142
00:11:55,570 --> 00:12:02,840
And then finally you can putting your time cues screen and put in the link to your Web site so that

143
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:09,190
at the final stages people can click through and go to your Web site if they want to read more and you

144
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:12,640
can put that into any particular length that you want.

145
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:20,800
So you might set up a unique page about buyers by the offer that you're giving people maybe more information

146
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,690

150
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:44,620

00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,160
