00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:05.760
In this video you're going to learn how Google Adwords works and this will help you understand how Google

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:12.450
became one of the biggest companies in the world and also then how to reduce the costs of your advertising

3
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.460
campaigns.

4
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:19.140
So if you understand the mechanics and the general system you're going to be much more effective and

5
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.690
be able to reduce your advertising costs.

6
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:28.920
So firstly how did Google become one of the biggest advertising companies in the world.

7
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.600
Well it's amazing actually had a genius system.

8
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.480
They really were able to create unlimited advertising space.

9
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.150
So let me just give you an example here.

10
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:48.670
So if I type in digital marketing course online I can see that there 1 2 3 4 advertising slots there.

11
00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:55.500
And if I move further down to the bottom of the page there is three more so seven advertising slots

12
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.130
per page.

13
00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.790
Now if we look at a traditional newspaper they have a similar thing where they've got another place

14
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.850
to sell their advertisements you can see it's one ad here and as we go through there's another ad here

15
00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.120
and there's probably another couple of Odd's stand here as well.

16
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.890
So it would appear it would appear on the face of it that they're selling kind of advertising space.

17
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.850
You know Heidi Google become ten times like you know a billion billion dollar company when a newspaper

18
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.540
like this would it would a similar advertising model just didn't get big at all.

19
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.530
Well the genius part of Google AdWords is that they serve ads depending on where people search for.

20
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.710
So now you've got seven slots here to sell.

21
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:48.900
But if I change this search term to say another topic like ethical hacking you can see that we've got

22
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.000
maybe another six or seven advertising slots to sell as well.

23
00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:01.440
And if you want to get a scale of how many advertising slots they've got you can see on these Internet

24
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.700
life stats Web site that Google gets over 3.5 billion searches per day.

25
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.160
This is a live Kantar of it here.

26
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:16.350
So if there's 3.5 billion searches a lot of those terms can be there can be advertising space sold for

27
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.620
them.

28
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:25.290
Multiply that by 7:7 slots per search term and you have got a phenomenal business and really an unlimited

29
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.870
advertising space that you can sell to not.

30
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.630
It is just a lot more than a traditional newspaper and that's really how Google became the biggest advertising

31
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:44.640
company in the world it's actually genius and it's just amazing to see how powerful that is.

32
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:51.240
So with so much advertising space it's unlimited obviously there's a challenge there how do you actually

33
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.060
sell all this advertising space in an effective way.

34
00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.510
A traditional newspaper might ring up this company Virgin and say hey you know we've got a space for

35
00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.150
the banner on our Web site.

36
00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.130
You know this is what it costs.

37
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.640
And boom they book it in and they just manually put this here.

38
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.470
But obviously with so much advertising space Google can do that.

39
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.630
They can't ring individual people and they can't even set up the ads for them.

40
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:25.260
So that's why they have created Google Adwords which is a self-serve platform so you come in as an individual

41
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:32.720
and set up your own ads and that allows them to feel that advertising space very very easily.

42
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.940
Now the way that they've set it open outwards as well here is it's essentially an auction system.

43
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:48.030
So if you want to be in the top spot here in Google you have to make a bid to be at the top and then

44
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.420
you're bidding against other companies who want to appear at the top here.

45
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:57.360
So for example in this ad it's pleural side versus you to me and they would be bidding against each

46
00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.680
other to get to this top spot here.

47
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:07.170
But unlike a traditional auction where the only factor is price to the highest bidder gets the top spot

48
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.750
actually in Google they've added in another factor which is a quality score.

49
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:20.600
And it's those two factors combined that actually determine your rank or who gets the top spot and Google

50
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.970
or what position you appear in.

51
00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:31.230
So it's called Odd rank and as it says here it's really determines the position of your odd an odd rank

52
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:37.500
is calculated by the bid amount plus you're multiplied by your quality score.

53
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:43.260
So this is important if you want to really reduce the costs of your advertisements.

54
00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:49.170
The good thing to know is that you don't have to have the highest bid what you need to have is the highest

55
00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.980
bid multiplied by your quality score.

56
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:59.790
So if you can improve your quality score you can essentially rank those higher bidding competitors.

57
00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.140
Now I will explain why quality score is here in a second.

58
00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.760
But one question you might be adding Well why didn't they just leave it at the highest bidder.

59
00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:12.080
That would just seem to me just an easier process to do.

60
00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:19.970
Well that is true but the thing is say if you to me had a much bigger budgets than any other company

61
00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:25.550
then they could just buy up the advertising space for every single related keyword and Google don't

62
00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:31.310
want that they want to create ads that are really very relevant to people searching.

63
00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:36.950
So that's why they've added in this factor of the quality score and the quality score if we look it

64
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:43.070
up here it's the expect to click through race and the odd relevance on the landing page experience so

65
00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.930
it's a combination of these factors that actually make up the quality score.

66
00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:53.720
So if you want to reduce the cost of your advertisements and get to the top spot with a lower bid than

67
00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.480
what you can do is improve your quality score.

68
00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:02.420
And the way that you do that is firstly by increasing your expected click through rate.

69
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.940
Now that is based on historical data.

70
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:11.810
So if you have an advertisement here that is has great copy in it that really want and wants me to get

71
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:16.490
to click through then Google is going to say that and theyre going to say this is an ad that people

72
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.390
have clicked through in the past.

73
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:23.780
So theres a good chance that theyre going to click through in future and you can improve this part of

74
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:29.750
your quality score you expect to click through rate by really writing a great ad and that is an important

75
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:35.870
part of increasing your expected click through rate and increasing quality score.

76
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.590
Now add relevance of course is very important.

77
00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:43.610
So you want to really want to make sure that your ad includes the keywords that you are appearing in

78
00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:48.170
the ad for so people will click through and also your landing page experience.

79
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:54.020
So when they do click through on the and are they actually staying there or are they just clicking straight

80
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.840
back to their Google will be really measuring all of that.

81
00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:06.110
So in terms of having success on onwards and keeping the costs of your campaigns low it's really important

82
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:11.720
to put time and effort into writing ads that are going to grab people's attention and make them want

83
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:18.050
to click through that you were creating ads that are really targeted to specific keywords and not just

84
00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.890
general ads that cover everything.

85
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:27.110
And also then where you're sending people actually through to is that or is that relevant to the ad

86
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.320
and what they've been searching for.

87
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:31.660
So there's a couple of factors to think about there.

88
00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:38.000
It's not just about setting up your campaigns and just pressing go and forgetting about it.

89
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.490
You do need to have a think about it and make sure it's relevant and so you can really keep that quality

90
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:48.710
score high on our rank competitors with bigger budgets.

91
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:54.620
So that is really how Google Adwords works how it became one of the biggest companies in the world by

92
00:07:54.620 --> 00:08:01.610
selling Riddhi on limited advertising space and how you can reduce the costs and I rank higher bidding

93
00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:04.470
competitors by increasing your quality score.
