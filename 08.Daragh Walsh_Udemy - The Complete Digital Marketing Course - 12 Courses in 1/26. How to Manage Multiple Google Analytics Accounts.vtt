In this video you're going to learn how to someone to Google Analytics and this could be a colleague.

2
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.740
This could be a freelancer.

3
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.060
This could be a client.

4
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.690
If you've created the Google Analytics account for them and to get started then you just want to come

5
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.750
to the admin section and then under the view you can see user management.

6
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.020
Now you will need to be anatman on Google Analytics in order to do this.

7
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:32.970
So if you're not an admin on the property and view you won't be you won't even see this option to actually

8
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.630
manage the users.

9
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:41.820
But if you do then you can click in and it's in here that you can add permissions so all you need to

10
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.300
do is just pop in their email address and then you can actually set right here the different privileges

11
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.870
that you're giving them access to.

12
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.510
It can toggle them on and off you can see that if you give them.

13
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.160
They have all the options and you can see the different options and toggle them there.

14
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.880
Now if you want to understand better what those privileges are.

15
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.720
There's an escalation here.

16
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.220
And then if you click learn more you can actually see a full explanation of this as well.

17
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:19.980
But if you're handing it back to a client well then you really want to give them the top access to really

18
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.520
edited and manage users.

19
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.320
If you just want somebody to read Lies reports and not to add filters and goals and things like that

20
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.110
then it could be read an unwise access.

21
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.180
So it depends on the type of access you want to get.

22
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:41.400
But all the instructions are there and details about what accesses you are are giving by toggling them

23
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.240
on and off.

24
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.860
And it's really that simple.

25
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.400
So it's a simple task but it can be very helpful just to know to come into your admin section and then

26
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.270
click on user management in order to find someone to Google Analytics.
