00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:06.380
Now that you have selected your campaign settings the next step in the process is to set up your groups

2
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.200
and as it says here an AD group contains one or more ads on a set of related keywords.

3
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.930
So for best results try to focus all of the ads and keywords in an ad group on one product or service

4
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:26.220
so you can see that by default here we have group one on what we want to do here is put in about 10

5
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.970
or 20 keywords for one product that we want to promote.

6
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.540
Then if we have a separate product then we can set up a separate group with a separate set of keywords

7
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.100
for that as well.

8
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.950
Now in this example I'll just set up one group but it will be the same process.

9
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.750
At that you can set up for each product that you want to set up.

10
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:53.760
And just remember that the campaign settings you set up in terms of location language when it's delivered

11
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.500
will be applied to both groups.

12
00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.440
So just keep that in mind and if you want to a different set of campaign settings you should set up

13
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.270
a separate campaign so while we really need to do and the big piece of work and this step in the process

14
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.490
is to add in about 10 or 20 key words.

15
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:19.850
Now really this is where we decide what are the terms that we want to appear in the search results for

16
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:27.860
when for our ads and this is an important part of the process because this will really determine the

17
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.210
success of your campaign.

18
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.720
So I'll show you a couple of things to really reduce the cost of your campaigns and pick the right keywords.

19
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.780
So the first thing to think about is like what.

20
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.960
What is the intent of your the searcher when they type in this word.

21
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.240
So something like Digital Marketing Course if that's what I'm selling.

22
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.390
Well obviously that person really wants to buy a digital marketing course and so that would be a great

23
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.690
keyword for me to include in my campaign.

24
00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:04.280
I could also put in something like what is digital marketing that could be a keyword phrase that I could

25
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.340
get my ad to appear for.

26
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.510
The thing is though if somebody is typing in what is digital marketing you can see there's no ads or

27
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.720
not and that's for a reason.

28
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.410
These people who type in what is digital marketing are much further up the sales funnel.

29
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.810
They're not even really aware of what it is.

30
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:30.970
Whereas someone who types in digital marketing course online their intent to buy is much much closer

31
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.860
they're much further down that sales funnel and they're really ready to buy.

32
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.200
They're just searching for a course to buy.

33
00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.950
So when you think about your key words just remember where they are in that sales funnel.

34
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.400
Are they just becoming aware of this and you should really avoid keywords like that.

35
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.940
Or are they really ready to buy.

36
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.970
And you want to try and get use keywords like that when you're setting up your AD group.

37
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.900
So just keeping in mind where they are in the sales funnel.

38
00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.170
That's an important consideration when you're picking your keywords.

39
00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.790
Now how can you come up with more keyword ideas.

40
00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:11.760
Well one thing to do is just to brainstorm a little bit yourself so I could say digital marketing training.

41
00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.420
It's kind of a similar thing digital marketing class

42
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.510
marketing class.

43
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.070
So these are all terms that they might be typing in.

44
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.910
Now if I want to get a few more ideas what I can do is also come over here to get key word ideas.

45
00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:40.930
I can just take one of these and paste these in here and now Edwards is going to give me a couple of

46
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.690
ideas and I can really scroll down through these and have a look at these as well.

47
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.540
There once again I can maybe just pop that into Google just check it out.

48
00:03:52.930 --> 00:04:01.230
And are these really the type of do I want to compete with these guys have they got a very similar product.

49
00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:09.050
Or maybe I should really be focusing on something like you know an online social media marketing course

50
00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.560
something like that would probably be more appropriate for something like funding.

51
00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.870
So you want to be quite careful in terms of these keywords and get them as accurate as possible.

52
00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:25.590
Now if you want to get more keyword ideas what you can do is come up and come to and the keyword Pliner

53
00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:31.180
tool is a tool within that non-words that will help get you more keyword ideas.

54
00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:37.020
So if we for example just take one of the main keywords here.

55
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.470
Paste this in.

56
00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:45.530
We get a just that if we wanted to so we could say the location the language etc. if we wanted to narrow

57
00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.000
that down.

58
00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.080
So I'm just looking globally here.

59
00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:56.070
If I wanted to look at in terms of just say the U.S. compact disc in you should really match this up

60
00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.860
with the location you set in your campaign.

61
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.370
So let's see if we can get some ideas here.

62
00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:09.850
Now look damn We've got some of the same kind of keywords digital marketing certification.

63
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:17.140
The interesting thing about this too is now we can start to see the suggested bid so we can see like

64
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:23.630
what is the suggested bid if we want to appear in the search results for these campaigns.

65
00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:31.530
Now I will say that this is quite a competitive keyword and normally there would be courses that could

66
00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:38.370
be too grand and that people are selling off line in colleges universities etc. that's why these suggested

67
00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:39.560
bids are very high.

68
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:46.590
So don't be put off by this probably for your product the suggested bid is going to be a lot lower.

69
00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:51.720
But here's some of the ones learned digital marketing this is maybe a good term that I can use and I

70
00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.760
can actually just this in across here.

71
00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:03.750
Best digital marketing courses digital media courses can be interesting just to add to the list and

72
00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.170
check it out.

73
00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:11.360
So as you go through just keep in mind the searchers intent is what again.

74
00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:17.280
Would this be someone really looking to buy a digital marketing training or course and just think about

75
00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:23.030
that as you go through and look at these different keywords than what you can do is actually copy all

76
00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:28.470
these to a clipboard and then once you're happy and then you can add these in again.

77
00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.050
OK so some other ideas.

78
00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:37.130
How can you get some more keyword ideas where you can come and use these tools by foo and what you really

79
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:42.070
want to do is maybe come to take one of your terms again.

80
00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:53.590
Just paste that into the search results and what you want to do is just take the URL of a competitor.

81
00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:57.020
And we can pass that in.

82
00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:01.580
We can come to their paid keywords and we can just get a couple of ideas here again.

83
00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:05.240
Digital Marketing circuit is certification.

84
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:12.880
We can see a cost per click there as well curriculum development so that's kind of an interesting key

85
00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:13.610
word.

86
00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:15.570
We take that pop that into google.

87
00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:17.230
I'm not really sure what that is.

88
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:27.020
So that definitely doesn't seem to be relevant so I wouldn't want to include that in my campaign.

89
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:33.370
But digital marketing certification is definitely one.

90
00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:35.410
If I haven't got that there already.

91
00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:40.600
So you can see that you can pick up new ideas in a couple of different ways just by thinking of them

92
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:48.700
yourself searching in Google using this suggestion to here using the Google key planner and using spy

93
00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.660
fu as well.

94
00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:55.270
So what you want to do is really build up a list of 10 to 20 keywords.

95
00:07:55.630 --> 00:08:00.400
Now once you've got your keyword list built up there is one other thing that you should really have

96
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:03.020
a look at before you go ahead and click save and continue.

97
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:09.780
And that is match types so you can see here broad match phrase match exact match.

98
00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:15.640
And these are important part of setting up your ad group because these match tribes really help control

99
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.200
which searches can trigger your ads.

100
00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:23.350
So if you put a little bit of thought into this you can really reduce the costs of your odds.

101
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:28.970
Now if you just type in the men like this by default These will be all abroad much.

102
00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:35.860
So if we open this up we can actually see here that broad match is the default match type for all of

103
00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:42.790
your keywords and ads may be shown on searches that include misspellings synonyms related searches or

104
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:44.070
other variations.

105
00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:50.240
So if your keyword is woman's women's hat someone searching for by ladies heart might see her.

106
00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:57.280
So this sounds grace but what it really means is that if you leave it like this digital marketing course

107
00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:04.290
online it could be shown to people who are searching for much broader search terms than that.

108
00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:08.980
And that's not really what you want to do to reduce the cost of your campaigns.

109
00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:16.690
You want to try and trigger the ads only when you have these search terms or very closely related search

110
00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:17.710
terms.

111
00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:23.920
So what I have here is an image which I think helps explain this different match type.

112
00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.260
A little bit better.

113
00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:31.240
So here's a couple of examples this broad match if you typed in something like formal shoes then it

114
00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:36.280
would also match to formal footwear evening footwear men's dress wingtips.

115
00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:38.140
So it's pretty broad.

116
00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:42.980
Now if you do one layer down it's called a modified broad match.

117
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:50.340
So if you put formal plush shoes then that would match the evening shoes black dress shoes et cetera.

118
00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:52.360
So I want to show you how this works.

119
00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:57.500
If I put in and we'll just stick with the same example to keep it simple.

120
00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:02.140
If I put in formal shoes just like it is here.

121
00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:03.840
This is the broad market.

122
00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:08.560
This could appear for a lot of different terms that are broadly related to this.

123
00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:14.050
Now obviously that's not going to be great for us because that means are our ads could be triggered

124
00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:18.790
for a lot of different search terms were their intent might not be to buy shoes but they're just checking

125
00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:19.930
them out or whatever.

126
00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:24.300
So what you can do then one level down is put in formal shoes.

127
00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:31.620
So what I mean what if we put this little plus symbol in here it means there are only show up at if

128
00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:37.730
the at the search term includes the word shoes but it could be a little bit broader.

129
00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:44.310
So could appear for things like evening shoes black dress shoes etc. so it must include that shoes.

130
00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:48.160
But this first word can be broadly related.

131
00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:55.680
Now what you can do even further down is time put a star symbol plus symbol in front of both words.

132
00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:04.060
So it would really have to I can contain formal on shoes in the search that they're appearing for but

133
00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:06.190
it could appear words before or after.

134
00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:13.780
Like formal shoes formal evening shoes formal shoes comfortable things like that.

135
00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:20.230
Now if you want to get even more specific and trigger your ads only on a very specific search term then

136
00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:21.810
you can use a phrase.

137
00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:34.720
So what we can do then is we could say keep the form of shoes but we can remove these plus signs and

138
00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:38.550
then we can put in the parenthesis here.

139
00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:45.660
So this phrase would have to appear in the search that they're typing into Google formal shoes.

140
00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:50.780
Now there could be a word before or there could be a word after but this phrase would have to be in

141
00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:51.760
this order.

142
00:11:52.070 --> 00:12:00.230
So it could be at best formless shoes or formal shoes comfortable whereas in this one I'm above where

143
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:01.840
it's the modified broad.

144
00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:04.720
These words could be appearing before or after.

145
00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:11.430
Or there could be words in-between these like formal formal white shoes.

146
00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:14.720
Whereas here it would have to be white formless shoes.

147
00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:21.970
So hopefully that explains the difference between those and then the most narrowish type of match that

148
00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:26.780
you could have is just to put these two brackets surrenders.

149
00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:32.940
So what that would mean is that the the ad would only be triggered.

150
00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:42.070
When that exact phrase is typed into Google and no other words before after in between anything.

151
00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:45.530
So that is the exact match type.

152
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:51.640
So you can really set these by putting these little symbols in or before.

153
00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:55.690
And the key thing that you want to do is not just leave it on a broad brush because that will trigger

154
00:12:55.690 --> 00:13:01.810
your ads for a lot of Broadley related keywords and the purpose of really building up this keyword list

155
00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:07.870
and thinking about it is that you have really narrowed down the list of keywords for your ads that are

156
00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:08.960
going to be triggered.

157
00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:14.560
So what I would suggest you do is really focus on getting a pretty tight key list and then you can just

158
00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:18.600
add the modified broad search on top of that.

159
00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:25.240
So what you're saying here is if you add these in that in the search term all of these words must appear.

160
00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:29.820
Now they could be in different orders and there could be extra words before or after.

161
00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:33.860
But all of these words must appear in the search term.

162
00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:39.760
And so that's what I'd recommend when you've decided your keyword list just the plus symbol in front

163
00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:46.430
of them so that those words have to be included in the search in order to trigger your odds.

164
00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:49.950
So I'm just going to go ahead and fill the rest of these out.

165
00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:56.160
Once you're done then you can just go ahead and click save and continue on that already finishes up.

166
00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:58.960
The second step in the process setting up your group's.
