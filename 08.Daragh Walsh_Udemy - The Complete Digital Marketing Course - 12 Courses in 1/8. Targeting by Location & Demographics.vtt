00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:06.640
In the last lecture you'll learn how to set the objective for your Facebook campaign.

2
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.980
And we did that in the campaign level of our ads create tool here.

3
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.160
Now in this video we're moving now and into the onset level.

4
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.570
And you'll remember this is the place for you to find the audience for your art your placements where

5
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.870
you try to peer the budgets and these shared tools.

6
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.950
And this video I'm going to show you how to start defining the audience for your god.

7
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.250
We're going to look at the first five ways that you can do that by location age gender language and

8
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.530
demographics.

9
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.600
And I'm also going to show you some really cool tips so you can get this done really quickly and do

10
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.600
it very accurately as well.

11
00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.710
And a lot of people don't think about this when they're creating their ads.

12
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.850
So let's dive straight into it.

13
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.580
Now we're really moving down to the audience section here.

14
00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:01.020
And I think before you start to mess around with this and start to put in locations and anything like

15
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:07.590
that one good place to start looking at here is the fuel gauge which is over on the right hand side

16
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.240
here.

17
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:15.180
Now I would even recommend you write down this number right now which is potential reach so I can see

18
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:23.520
this is two point nine million people and based on the targeting options that I have in place right

19
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.950
now that's that's what the ad is going to reach potentially reach a 2.9 million people.

20
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:35.610
Now you'll see a that it says that my audience selection is fairly broad so we will want to narrow it

21
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.980
down.

22
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.560
And that's the purpose of these targeting options to make it more specific and to get it down to a smaller

23
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:50.010
audience size so that our fans are appearing only in front of people who we think are going to care

24
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:57.630
about it and who are going to click through or damaged or up or whatever the objective is that you have

25
00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.030
said for your campaign.

26
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.920
If we do that well if be targeting Well we're going to minimize or wasted and spend.

27
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.360
Going to get a lot more results out of our budget.

28
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.650
So it's a really important thing to do.

29
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.540
So let's dive straight into it.

30
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.020
Then the first way that you can target your heart is by location.

31
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:22.770
And actually this is the only targeting option that is required in order for your Facebook to go live

32
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.750
right now that you can see.

33
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:31.380
You can see here that for my example it is targeted to Arland and up came up by default because that's

34
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.200
where I'm am right now.

35
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:41.160
So we can see and understand already that we can target Aransas by country but we can also target are

36
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.200
ads in much more specific ways.

37
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:51.930
So for example I can put in here the city that I'm in Dublin so watch this gauge now 2.9 million dropping

38
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.400
off to 1.4 million.

39
00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:01.770
So if I had a business that was restricted to a certain area or serve a certain area well then a good

40
00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.790
idea to narrow it down to that area.

41
00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:12.990
You can not only do it by city like this but you can also put in maybe a neighborhood as well so here's

42
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.780
a neighborhood within the city.

43
00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:21.370
And I can see now that it's come up as a radius format and this could be ideal if you're a big business

44
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.560
that has the catchment area and everyone to narrow it down and that and I can also see that I can reduce

45
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.580
is even more down to 10 miles at a minimum and I can see the change in the fuel gauge there.

46
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:34.470
A good.

47
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.570
So location targeting is really the starting point.

48
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.770
It's key and this is going to be different depending on the type of business that you have if you have

49
00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:50.250
an online business and or fly off line business etc. These targeting options are going to vary to suit

50
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.670
your needs.

51
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:59.100
Now moving down here we have the age and really demographics skew the option here to put in the age

52
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.480
range of the people that you want to show your ad to.

53
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.620
And this is going to be something that it once again is going to be dependent on the type of business

54
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:08.720
that you have.

55
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.720
Now remember those Facebook and Instagram policies.

56
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:19.800
So if for example you are advertising an alcohol product or have any of that content on the restricted

57
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:25.170
content list well then you have to follow those same guidelines as you set up your ad here.

58
00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:33.060
Gender then you can select all male or female on languages you can enter the language that you want

59
00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.180
to include here.

60
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:42.270
So I'm just going to pop in English you ass on down here even further again you have an extra option

61
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:49.140
to really get into more demographics so let's click this down here and you can see that you can target

62
00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:58.070
people not only by their gender and their age and their language but also say by their education the

63
00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:04.480
level of education that they have at their life events so if they're getting married away from their

64
00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:12.430
hometown if it's their birthday coming down again we can see if they're you know new parents at their

65
00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:19.510
political side that they're on the work that they're in in terms of being employed or industries or

66
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:23.120
job titles et cetera their relationship status.

67
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:30.730
And this is often why people who get newly engaged will see all these ads that wedding venues etc. I'm

68
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:35.900
sure you've heard the stories from your friends where they really commented on the ads that pop up once

69
00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:41.830
a life event happens so you can see that there really are a ton of targeting options there.

70
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:46.660
Now I know personally it can be a little bit overwhelming there's so many options where would you even

71
00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:47.770
get started.

72
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.720
So I wanted to give you some advice on how to think about this.

73
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:58.600
What I would recommend is that you try to imagine your ideal customer what they look like who would

74
00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.480
really be the poster boy for your product.

75
00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:07.150
Even the blog post that you're writing for them that's really going to get a lot of value out of this.

76
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:13.660
And so if you have no data right now just imagine that and fill the details out with that one person

77
00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.390
in mind or a group of people.

78
00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:20.900
Now if you do have data I'm going to show you a really cool trick taken to this.

79
00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:27.720
So if you have a Facebook page why I recommend you do at this stage is come to your Facebook page.

80
00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:35.410
Coming to insights here and you'll notice Dan on the side bar here that you actually have a section

81
00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:37.300
called people.

82
00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:42.210
And here you have the exact information that you need to put into your Facebook card.

83
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:49.300
So if you want to reach people who are already like your existing Facebook fans then this is information

84
00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:50.320
that you can use.

85
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:56.140
And if you are creating these ads for a client or you're working in a business and you need to create

86
00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:01.090
these ads and this is a great resource and source of information that you can use.

87
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:07.960
So for me personally I can see that there is a 60 40 split split between men so men are more interested

88
00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:12.520
in the type of content I'm putting out for both sexes.

89
00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:19.230
We have more people in the 25 to 35 age range interested in what I'm putting out there.

90
00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.990
So that's very interesting to note.

91
00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:27.730
And also I can see the talk country for me is the U.S. I also see top cities on language is English.

92
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:34.390
So this is the exact information that I need to be putting into my head here in terms of defining my

93
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:36.100
audience and the first step.

94
00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:41.380
So if you have that information available to you I would recommend you do that if your art is going

95
00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.980
to be related to where you're sending people to.

96
00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:48.950
So to remind you my objective was to get people to my Web site.

97
00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:52.030
This is the Facebook page related to that Web site.

98
00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:58.080
So obviously this dataset is going to be very good for me to look at now as well as that.

99
00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:02.150
Another great source of information that you can look at is Google Analytics.

100
00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:08.920
And once again this is the analytics of the Web site that I intend to send people to through this Facebook

101
00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:09.440
Ad.

102
00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.790
So again a very accurate source of information.

103
00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:18.400
Now to access this data if you're not familiar with Google Analytics you can come into audience here

104
00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:21.040
and essentially it's going to be very very similar.

105
00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:28.240
You can come down to demographics you can see the overview here and actually there is a very similar

106
00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:35.470
place in Maine and female what we saw on the Facebook page so 60:40 more or less same age range which

107
00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:38.130
is great to see good confirmation of that.

108
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:45.610
And if we come to the G.O. report here we can actually look at the language of people.

109
00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:50.570
So English us top on once again no real surprises there.

110
00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:58.660
And in terms of location then once again I can see the hot location is the U.S. with other English speaking

111
00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:00.190
countries following up.

112
00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:03.740
And I can also see in terms of the cities here which are the big ones.

113
00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:10.680
So what I would suggest is if you do have this data available I'd open this up as you are filling out

114
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:11.370
your card.

115
00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:15.790
If you work at a company make sure you get access to that or you're working for a client.

116
00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:20.170
Try to get access to that before you start to fill out this information.

117
00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.060
And if you don't have this information now.

118
00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:27.850
Well I would recommend that you gather that information set up your Google and your Facebook page so

119
00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:31.600
that you can fill that in for later campaigns.

120
00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:34.150
So I'm going to take a minute to fill this out.

121
00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:42.290
Now for myself and for my what I'm going to do is just put it forward the top country I'm going to put

122
00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:54.250
it for that age range and then I saw 25 to 34 this down here I'm going to stick it just for males for

123
00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:58.580
the moment because I want to try and get it as specific as prob as possible.

124
00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:06.760
I am going to put it is English us and for the moment I'm just going to leave the life events and other

125
00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.510
demographic options off.

126
00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:13.110
But what I would recommend that you do is to go ahead think about that.

127
00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:19.330
Use that date if you have it and start to define your audience based on location age gender and languages

128
00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:26.880
and demographics and keep an eye on how the changes that you make impact the fuel gauge over here.

129
00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:31.420
Now you can see for me this has gone up massively because I'm targeting a much bigger country.

130
00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:36.920
But as we go through the remaining targeting options you're going to see this narrow down a lot.

131
00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:40.660
So that is how you get started defining your primary audience.

132
00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:42.000
Go ahead and do that now.

133
00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:45.720
I will be finding this in the next videos as well.
