1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,800
You've already learned how to target your odds by location age gender and demographics.

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,150
And in this lecture you're going learn about interest targeting.

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,090
This is where it really starts getting interesting.

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:18,390
Excuse me excuse the pun but this is where Facebook has a lot of power because they have a huge amount

5
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:24,740
of information on people and interest targeting is not just the Facebook pages that people like.

6
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,510
They actually have much more data.

7
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,840
Not so any information that they've added to their timeline.

8
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:35,370
Keywords that they use and their status updates the apps that they use and even odds that they have

9
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,280
previously clicked on.

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,470
So what Facebook does is categorize people into different categories based on these interests and you

11
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:47,100
can use these categories and pull these interests into your campaign.

12
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,000
So you're getting your ads in front of people who were interested in those things that you know are

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,700
going to be relevant to your product or service.

14
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:59,250
So one thing to do before we get started is once again take note of your potential reach.

15
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,120
So it's 27 million.

16
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,150
For example here.

17
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,570
And you see that how this changes as we look at certain things.

18
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,140
So interest targeting to really add this to your audience.

19
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,360
It's down here under detailed targeting.

20
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,750
And if you click on the search box here you're going to see the dropdown come up and you will see the

21
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,110
interests here.

22
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:25,770
So the type of stuff that we're talking about is you can target people based on all of these interest

23
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:26,560
categories here.

24
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:32,920
CC Business and Industry family and relationships fitness and wellness technology.

25
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,820
There's more categories down here as well.

26
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:40,680
But really this is the first way that you can do it through the interest categories here.

27
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,300
Now I'm going to click into business here.

28
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,650
Scroll down a little bit.

29
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:51,690
What I want to look for here is online interest so people are interested in online stuff.

30
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:59,250
And in particular digital marketing this is suitable for me because this is the type of interests that

31
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:04,630
I hope my audience are going to be into because this is what I am really creating my out about.

32
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:11,550
Now the cool thing is is that when I'm click to add this interest to my ad I can get to see I get a

33
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,760
sense of how many people are interested in this.

34
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,780
Thirty nine million people.

35
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:20,830
Now you'll notice that as I clicked that my potential to reach reach has dropped a lot.

36
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:24,640
So this is the total audience who we're interested in this.

37
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:30,510
But in terms of the location and age settings that I've made the people who are interested in this plus

38
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:37,620
much the options that I've targeted is now 1.9 million so 27 million and don't point nine million you

39
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,590
can see a massive drop.

40
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:46,080
So as well as using these egg drop downs and categories to select your interests watch you can also

41
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,880
do is just type something into the interests search box here.

42
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:57,780
So this could be products that are related to your Facebook pages maybe competitors or people with in

43
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:03,110
your field who you think if they're interested in that then they're going to be interested in me.

44
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,180
So let me type in digital marketer.

45
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,300
This is a Facebook page that covers similar stuff to me.

46
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:16,370
And so I can see that success 164 people are interested in this.

47
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:21,210
And if I click on this this is where it starts get really interesting because Facebook starts to give

48
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,770
me suggestions here.

49
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:26,640
So these are different categories that I could add to my campaign.

50
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:32,040
There are even well-known people within this industry sharp starting to show up here.

51
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,860
So are a couple of these.

52
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:40,350
And as you are these as well you can start to see how many people are interested in that particular

53
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:44,300
person or that particular Facebook page or their particular product.

54
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:51,110
And it's fascinating to really see how many people are interested in one person or another.

55
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:56,220
So if you think somebody is the biggest in your industry you can just be interesting to come in here

56
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,580
and actually test that with some data and see it as well as Facebook.

57
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:06,300
What is the data that they have and who do they see as being the bigger well-known person where the

58
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,830
bigger page etc..

59
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:15,570
So looking over the fuel gauge you can see that it's gone up from 1.9 to 3.8 and that is because I've

60
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,610
added in and these additional interests here.

61
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:27,870
So what is important for you to understand is that this when I add in interests like this as you can

62
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:34,260
probably guess from the number it's not that people who are interested in Amy Porterfield and digital

63
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:41,190
marketer and Gary Vaynerchuk it's just people who are interested in either one of those three things

64
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:46,340
or even digital marketing in general so that's a really important thing to understand as you are in

65
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,040
interest.

66
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:53,490
You can actually be making your audience broader rather than being people who like all of those three

67
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,200
things.

68
00:04:55,230 --> 00:05:01,560
So because these all these people are quite broad I'm going to start to remove some of them and kind

69
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,980
of get it down to something more suitable for me which I think is this.

70
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:10,060
So what I would recommend you do now is have a look at the entries targeting.

71
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:16,710
Think about the Facebook pages of competitors that might be relevant or relevant companies or products

72
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:20,370
are wiling to keep in mind as you search in here for interest.

73
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,960
Not every single well-known celebrity or page is going to show up here.

74
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:29,380
Facebook only has information and a certain amount of people.

75
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:34,290
So you've got to work around the data that is available but play around with the interest targeting

76
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:34,620
here.

77
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:39,690
Remember you can still use all these tools even if you're not considering putting this on live.

78
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,410
So I really recommend you do that.

79
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:46,350
And in the next Lion's share we're going to move on to behavior targeting which is the final way that

80
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,630
we're going to look to you to find your audience for your out there.
