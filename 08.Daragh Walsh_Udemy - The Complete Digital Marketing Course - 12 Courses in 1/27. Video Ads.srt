1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:05,580
In this video you're going to learn about Facebook video that's why you should be using them as part

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,180
of your Facebook advertising campaigns.

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:14,580
You're going to learn three tips to create powerful videos the use cases for them and step by step how

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,980
you can create a video ad very very quickly and easily.

5
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:26,190
Now the first question you might have is why should I be using video ads as part of my Facebook advertising.

6
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,200
And the reason is very very simple.

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:34,690
There has been an explosion in the consumption of video content on both Facebook and Instagram.

8
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,790
And the proof of that is right inside of your Facebook news feed.

9
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:45,230
If you come into your Facebook news feed you're going to see that almost every second post is now a

10
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:45,860
video.

11
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:50,740
This is the format of content that people are consuming on Facebook.

12
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:57,550
Now this is the big trend and the reality is is that a lot of advertisers haven't caught up with this.

13
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:03,690
So if you want to get ahead of the competition using video ads is a very good way to do that.

14
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:10,980
So key question you might have as well is how to create powerful video ads in a great place to really

15
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:16,690
understand what is inside of the insides of your Facebook page.

16
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:24,060
So to get here just come into the insides of your Facebook page and down into this tab which shows the

17
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,390
metrics related to videos.

18
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:33,450
Now you have to have a couple of videos on your Facebook page in order to see these but I'll show you

19
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:38,460
through a couple of mine samples so you can understand three things that are really important to do.

20
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:45,350
So once you're in your insides tab you can click in here to an individual video.

21
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:51,720
And one thing you want to look down on straight away is in the video views here.

22
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:59,280
And one important thing to look at is the sand off or sand on now watch you can see here is that this

23
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:09,960
video has got around 1400 views on 78 percent of those views 1200 views were watched with the sound

24
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:10,630
off.

25
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:16,470
So you probably noticed this from being on your Facebook feed that a lot of videos now how captions

26
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:21,620
on them and from this example as well you can see the importance of that.

27
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:29,850
So my recommendation is that if you are creating a video ad you'd be wise to put some captions on to

28
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:36,210
the video in order that people can really understand the content when they have the send off.

29
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:39,960
Now the great news is it is very easy to add captions.

30
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:47,450
You can just come back to your post edit the post you'll see the option here for captions.

31
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:51,270
You can order generate the captions just by clicking on a button here.

32
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:57,510
I've done an already certain that says edit captions and you can watch the captions that are auto generated

33
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:01,230
and really edit them to make sure that they work there correct.

34
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:09,150
So if you have a video on your Facebook page and you want to promote it best good action to take straight

35
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:18,030
away is to come in update those captions make sure they're all OK and then save them to the video.

36
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:25,290
Now the second tip is to really understand the average watched time of videos so you can see here that

37
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:31,220
this video is one minute and thirty four seconds and the average watch time is just 12 seconds.

38
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:38,370
If you click through here you can see a chart for audience retention which is really how long the average

39
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:45,980
person watched the video and you can see here as I move down 100 people watched the first two seconds.

40
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:54,330
But as I go down to say 10 seconds here you can see that already 60 percent of people have stopped watching

41
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:55,760
the video.

42
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:03,990
So watch this show be signaling to you is that the first five seconds 10 seconds are critical if you're

43
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:10,770
creating a video and you're not capturing people's attention or to quite question or a fact or some

44
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,730
figures or something.

45
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,170
Nice imagery.

46
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:20,610
Then you are going to lose because a lot of people watch past that and you probably know this from your

47
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:28,530
own Facebook browsing that you will see a video coming up maybe in the news feed you might watch a couple

48
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:32,130
of seconds with the sound off if it doesn't look interesting.

49
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:35,180
You're not going to continue on if it does look interesting.

50
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:40,660
Might read the captions or flick the sound on and that is generally more people do.

51
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,920
So having a powerful first five 10 seconds and putting some thought into that or if you're cutting down

52
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:51,600
a video make sure that you're coding it in a place where the first couple of seconds are really going

53
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,140
to capture attention.

54
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:58,460
So the second tip make sure those first five ten seconds really grab attention.

55
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:05,910
Then the final tip is in terms of targeting to look at who's already engaged with existing videos so

56
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:14,250
I can see for this particular video the top audience was men of this age group here and I can even see

57
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,020
a breakdown of it.

58
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,500
And if I go back as well I can see the top locations as well.

59
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:25,800
So a lot of people watch this from the U.K. and I can see the other places where it is popular so far

60
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,620
I want to use this video to broaden the reach and put it into Facebook.

61
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:35,340
I can use this information in order to inform those decisions.

62
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:42,440
So Tip Three is use existing demographic information to help target your ads.

63
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:46,410
Now that you understand those three tips to create powerful video ads.

64
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:50,850
Let's look at the use cases for videos in Facebook advertising.

65
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:59,130
Now you can use videos in a variety of different campaign objectives in Facebook as you can use videos

66
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:00,570
to help get up in stores.

67
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:03,330
You can use videos Helka clicks to Web site.

68
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:10,710
But the primary objective and the primary use for them is to simply get video views and raise awareness

69
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,270
about your brand.

70
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:19,740
That's the primary objective for a lot of people when they use videos in their Facebook ads and in terms

71
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:24,390
of how we can target these ads to where you can use interest demographic targeting.

72
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:30,810
You can target existing Facebook fans you can remarket to Web site a mobile app for visitors you can

73
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:37,050
use video views custom audiences and target people who have watched previous videos you can use look

74
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,340
like audiences.

75
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,670
You really have all of those targeting options available to you.

76
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:47,830
It's really going to depend on your own needs and goals which targeting option that you use.

77
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:53,730
Now in terms of what content can you use in your video as well you can remix content.

78
00:06:53,940 --> 00:07:00,450
Think one common thing and barrier to making people use videos is they think they need to create something

79
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:01,770
completely new.

80
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:08,610
Well if you've a longer video or a longer promotional video or sales video or whatever it is you can

81
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:14,910
cut that down into smaller videos that you could use as part of your video ads.

82
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:20,470
So in terms of just raising awareness cutting up bite size videos putting them out.

83
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,850
That's something you can easily do.

84
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:24,620
You don't have to create brand new content.

85
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:30,540
You can also use behind the scenes footage stuff that would help your product launch raise awareness

86
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:33,060
updates on how your product launches going.

87
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,240
You can use customer success stories.

88
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:41,940
So really there is a huge amount of variety in the types of content that you can use now that you understand

89
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,190
the use cases.

90
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:47,010
Let's have a look at how you can create a video views campaign.

91
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:54,300
First step is to log into your ads manager and come up and click on create ad you want to select select

92
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,740
your marketing objective and maybe just start over.

93
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:04,110
If you have any previous campaigns popping up so in terms of remarketing objective you want to see like

94
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:08,470
the video views option here and click on continue.

95
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:16,970
Now in terms of setting up the targeting for your audience here for your placements for your bhajans

96
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:22,860
and schedule that is all going to be the same process as we've learned previously.

97
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:28,170
What is a little bit different to where there are some other options are down here at the level of a

98
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:36,300
video views campaign and I want to point at some of these for you see have the option to use a carousel

99
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:41,460
here so you can add have an ad with two or more scrollable videos in here.

100
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:47,100
You can use a single video which is probably the easiest option to use.

101
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,630
You can use a slide show option and this is worth having a little bit of a look out here because you

102
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:57,750
can create a slide show very very easily and this is perhaps maybe one of the easiest ways that you

103
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:05,580
can create a video for your Facebook site so you can use 9:57 images to create a slide show and you

104
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:12,720
can see Facebook is walking you through the process here you click on Slide Show you can select the

105
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,880
image to ration how long you want to last.

106
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,310
One second is probably a good idea.

107
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:23,790
You can maybe select the fade you can and the photos then using your own images that youve uploaded

108
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:29,870
or from your own image library or you can use this free stock images once again.

109
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:36,240
So even if you don't have any good photos you can put together one of these slide show video ads very

110
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,160
very easily.

111
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,440
Now once youve got that done you can just create the slideshow and that is the video you can use for

112
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,570
your campaign.

113
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:50,370
Now you can also use an existing post has a video.

114
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:56,580
So just make sure that your Facebook page is connected and then you can scroll down and select any of

115
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,060
these videos for your video.

116
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:05,410
Once again you might want to just check that you've got those captions on the video before you hit the

117
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:07,190
publish button.

118
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:13,110
Finally let's have a look for a look at some of the limitations for your video.

119
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:20,290
You wonder if you're uploading it yourself a Chevy daughter movie an MP for one high quality or aspect

120
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:24,100
ratio should be as such in Facebook.

121
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:32,020
Your video views can be maximum 16 minutes in Instagram the maximum of 60 seconds.

122
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:37,780
It's a key limiting factor there if you want to place your video on both Facebook and Instagram make

123
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:41,250
sure it's maximum 60 seconds.

124
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:44,730
As always when you go to place your iPod.

125
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:47,340
Just make sure that the text is appropriate.

126
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:54,240
Maybe show people watch this video and you will learn a four step process to do x y z.

127
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:58,670
Or watch this video and learn whatever the benefits are of it.

128
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:04,930
So remember you need to put in the text and really sell the benefits and explain to people quickly why

129
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,740
they should view the video.

130
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:11,650
Once you've gathered all them as always review the order before you go ahead and place it and it'll

131
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,190
go into the normal review process.

132
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,360
So now you know why you should be using video has 3 tips to create powerful video ads.

133
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:27,100
The use cases and the pings to look out for when you're setting it up for yourself go ahead and create

134
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,870
a video and following the steps that you've learned in this video.
