00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,400
In this video you're going to learn how to add a profile image link to your Web site and a short bio

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,200
on your Twitter profile.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:13,800
And to do that you just want to click on the edit profile button on your Twitter profile you can see

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:19,360
that your profile image you can change the name of your Twitter account.

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:26,460
You can change your bio here or out of biol you can at a location on your Web site and even change your

6
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,490
team color if you wanted to.

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,470
And this video we're going to focus on a couple of key things on that profile image the bio and the

8
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,620
link to your Web site.

9
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:44,160
So before you start to get into this process I think a great way to speed this all up is to look at

10
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,240
the accounts that you were following.

11
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:53,760
Who are the top influencers in your knees and really look at their profile image the link to their website

12
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,120
on their bio and that can really accelerate the process for you.

13
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,540
So let's open up a few of these in a separate town.

14
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:14,270
And open that six top influences here that I've followed previously and we just want to have a look

15
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:19,350
at where they've set up their profiles so we can look at the profile image here.

16
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,650
It's a good head shot.

17
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:28,190
You can see he's kind of got something unique about himself the mustache that really stands out and

18
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:32,990
makes even from a small profile image here you can see that it's him.

19
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:39,620
So this is the key thing you want to keep in mind about your profile image that it is very small when

20
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:44,560
it's on a tweet like this and even on a mobile device we really want a close head shot.

21
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:50,800
If you are setting it up as a personal account so that people can recognize you from a distance.

22
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:57,890
If we look at the profile image for a company you can see it's just a simple logo.

23
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,660
It's two colors wide on kind of purple.

24
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:05,580
You can see that is very easy to recognize in a small tweet.

25
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:09,670
Let's have a look at another couple in their profile images.

26
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:13,250
Again this is a logo type profile two colors.

27
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:21,020
Very easy to see even on a small image like this which will even be smaller on a mobile phone.

28
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:27,840
We can see here again just more of a personal shot and close image.

29
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:32,650
Again similar type professional type looking photo smiling.

30
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:35,120
Pretty simple closeup head shot.

31
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:38,260
And finally here we go again self-tanner.

32
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:42,660
So quite a close head shot recognizable as well.

33
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:49,790
So for your own profile image you really want to either put it in your business logo or a close up shot

34
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:50,210
like that.

35
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:56,930
And to add your profile image you can just click on the button here upload the photo upload this from

36
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:03,850
my desktop and then it's going to come out as a circular type picture like that you can increase or

37
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,570
decrease the size of it.

38
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:12,950
And then just click apply so then we can refresh the profile just to see how it looks like and if you're

39
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:20,940
happy with that then we can move on to the next step which is really to add in a little bio about ourselves.

40
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,180
So this bio again we can just look at the top what are the top influencers dating.

41
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,370
They figure this stuff out.

42
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:34,600
Let's just take the best from them so we can see here is that this is more of a personal Twitter profile.

43
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:40,610
And he was the thirtysomething retiree and he writes about the need for Freeville life.

44
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:48,890
So in this bio you want to start to communicate some of the benefits of following your Twitter profile.

45
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:55,250
So writes about how to we can all live frugal yet bought us a life of pleasure so it kind of gives a

46
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,030
hint to watch.

47
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:04,460
And this profile is about why should I even follow this because he can give me some tips about how to

48
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:11,450
live frugally a badass life of leisure and you can see the stars and bring across some of the personality

49
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:18,140
of this page is all matching or the kind of crazy mustache and the personality of this profile is coming

50
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,980
across kind of scrawny.

51
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:21,850
Daphne catches attention.

52
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:27,000
Let's have a look at more professional type business bio.

53
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:27,920
Follow us.

54
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:36,440
So this is a great bio follow us to here on our thoughts in investing retiring savings Kaname and more.

55
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:43,870
This is a much more direct bio it's like why should you follow us on and saying exactly why.

56
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:50,080
And they're saying follow us we care call to action for people so people read this and they go follow

57
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,320
us.

58
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:50,890
Why.

59
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:51,320
OK.

60
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,360
Here are some of the reasons why.

61
00:04:54,770 --> 00:05:00,010
And I have a couple of terms conditions here which they lay out probably for financial business that

62
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:04,400
is you know money anything you invest is on your own risk.

63
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,930
Etc. So let's have a look at some other one get rich slowly.

64
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,070
So why would I follow this profile because I could get rich slowly.

65
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,610
Names one of the best time magazine blogs.

66
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:21,380
OK so a little bit of social proof here and her sense of personal finance again including that type

67
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:27,180
the key word in the bio is another great way to include that.

68
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,460
Have a look at another one.

69
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:36,210
Personal finance again including the key word in the Buy a frugal living tweets by Ashley Jacobs.

70
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:39,810
And then it must be playing golf to her profile.

71
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,750
So you often see that as well.

72
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:48,200
People linking off to other profiles of other companies that they're running they often think of those

73
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,370
as well.

74
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,510
So we'll look at the last one.

75
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:51,090
OK.

76
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:54,000
Personal finance again the key word is in the bio.

77
00:05:54,470 --> 00:06:00,190
And then he's using this space to promote his new book which is a pretty good idea.

78
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,190
Ok this book.

79
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,200
OK.

80
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,260
And it's and it's there.

81
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:07,830
Probably if it included it linked to that book would even be better.

82
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,320
But you can see that you can change this up.

83
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:16,460
You can use it to promote certain things that you're doing right now and even match that in maybe your

84
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,260
header image as well.

85
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:25,490
So look at your own bio and take some inspiration from the kinds that you've seen.

86
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:30,470
If it's more of a business expense or if it's more personal and you can't get across her personality

87
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:35,330
and include your keywords so I like that one follow us.

88
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:46,940
Her tips personal finance and maybe some other keywords that are related to your needs needs there as

89
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:50,060
well as I you can include location.

90
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:56,310
So Twitter's going to know this pretty much straight away based on where you're logging in from.

91
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:59,880
You can leave that as a country if he wants.

92
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,480
You don't have to put in location.

93
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,920
So this this company doesn't have it's kind of an online blog.

94
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:12,670
So maybe there's no need for all over the place and you can see really if location is a part of your

95
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:18,850
business if you're a local business or if you're based somewhere then that can be or if you're a personal

96
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,650
person you can put that in.

97
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:26,830
So I'm just going to put in Dublin where even just put in something like it in the country as well if

98
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,700
you want to if you think that's relevant.

99
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:34,690
And the next step is really to put in a link to your website so you can see there is just a link to

100
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,720
the Web site.

101
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:46,420
And what you can also do is if you if you don't want to send them to your home page you could put in

102
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,200
something like

103
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:55,940
you could put in something like offers or discounts on.

104
00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:01,120
That just gives people a little bit more incentive to click on that link if they think they can get

105
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,570
something by clicking through.

106
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:07,430
And you might even mention that in your bio like Click below to get discounts.

107
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,200
That's another strategy that can be very successful.

108
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:13,150
So once you're happy with your bio.

109
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:20,810
Your location and your web site you just want to click Save to see those changes really come up.

110
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:24,780
And again you can change this any time you want.

111
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:30,070
For now just get something set up so that when people do start visiting your profile that there's a

112
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:33,190
profile image there's an explanation of why they should follow you.

113
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:40,550
Whether that's very direct or indirect and to include a link to your Web site if you have one as well.

114
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:46,540
So now that you know how to optimize your profile go ahead and do it for yourself and use those top

115
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:51,090
influencers that you followed as inspiration to accelerate this process.
