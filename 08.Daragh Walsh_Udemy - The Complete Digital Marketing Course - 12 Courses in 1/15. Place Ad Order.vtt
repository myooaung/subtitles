00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.810
Congratulations you are now ready to place the order for your face for God.

2
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.360
And really how you're not one live on Facebook before you go ahead and do that.

3
00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:17.000
There's one important step to do and that is to come down and review your order and make sure everything

4
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.910
is in place and as you want it to be.

5
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:26.240
So just click on the review order button and now you will see that you are creating broken with the

6
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.420
three different levels.

7
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:33.640
So the campaign level out set the odds level and just to quickly recap on this for myself.

8
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.020
You can see the campaign objective is traffic.

9
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:43.010
So make sure that's Ozzie wanted to be your on set then is where you defined your audience and placements

10
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.670
and budgets and schedule.

11
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.460
So make sure that's everything in place.

12
00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.570
Then we went to the level and you can see that I'm testing two different images.

13
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:57.390
They're coming up here and I can see the headline and the text that is going to show up which is perfect

14
00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.560
then exactly as I wanted it to be.

15
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:06.740
Now at this stage it could be a good idea to get a colleague or a friend just to review your campaign

16
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.440
to see what they think particularly about maybe the ads and how they appear.

17
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.940
And once you're satisfied with that.

18
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.260
Just go ahead and place the order.

19
00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.420
Now remember that once you place your order your ad will go into the ad review process.

20
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:29.860
If everything is OK in or out should go live very quickly and you can see mine is in review now.

21
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.700
It should be approved quickly and at the latest should be approved within 24 hours.

22
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:41.690
And if there is anything in it to change bet your company will get a notification by e-mail and you

23
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.840
can make those small changes and publish and go ahead and put your ad live.

24
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.890
So well done on completing your first Facebook outing getting to this step.

25
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.400
Go ahead and place your order.

26
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.810
Now.
