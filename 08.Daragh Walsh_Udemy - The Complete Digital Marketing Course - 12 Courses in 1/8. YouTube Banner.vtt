In this video you're going to learn how to create a professional looking YouTube banner just like the

2
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.760
one that you see on screen.

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.150
It's absolutely free to do.

4
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:10.170
It's going to take you less than five minutes.

5
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.960
And I'm also going to show you a little tip to make sure that you get the dimensions perfect first time

6
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.200
to create your youtube banner.

7
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.990
Firstly head over to Kanva dot com.

8
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.740
Just create a free account and sign up.

9
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.620
Then once inside you want to come across and click on more.

10
00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:33.600
Here what we want to do is really use one of the YouTube channel art templates in order to make our

11
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.910
YouTube Boehner.

12
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.780
You can see on the left here there are a lot of different banners that you can just use as templates

13
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.230
to really get you started.

14
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.110
So here's one that I like and all that to do is drag and drop it in.

15
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.310
And now I can edit this really suited to my own YouTube channel.

16
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:56.830
Now you may see as in this example there's a background image that is a paid image but it's very easy

17
00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.980
to remove that or to replace it.

18
00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.980
What I'm going to do is actually go ahead and use one of my uploaded images.

19
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:09.220
You can upload these from Facebook or you can upload them from your computer and you use one to really

20
00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:15.370
drag and drop that in in place of the paid image and the paid image will be removed if it is there.

21
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:21.840
Now I want to go ahead and start to edit this text so my YouTube channel is not going to be about gaming.

22
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:29.160
It's just imagine it's a bad photography and I go ahead and change the name as well.

23
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.020
So it's very easy to edit the text.

24
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:37.130
You can edit the colors as well just by clicking on it and clicking to any colors that you want like

25
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.490
the orange.

26
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.590
Looks pretty good so I'm just going to keep that click on the text once again to remove it or to edit

27
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:43.550
it as you want.

28
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.530
I was going to remove this word because I don't think it really is necessary.

29
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.580
You can reposition the text if I want.

30
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:50.780
Just click on us.

31
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.400
Move it up if I want to darken the background image a little bit.

32
00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:01.340
Just click on the image come up make the transparency a little bit less.

33
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.270
So that text is really popping now just a little bit more.

34
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.220
One thing that you do have to be careful with with YouTube banners is the dimensions you need to make

35
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:17.140
sure it's going to fit across all different devices desktop immobile TV etc. to test the dimensions.

36
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:24.650
What I recommend you do is to download the image that I've linked in the description of this video uploaded

37
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:25.950
here into Kanva.

38
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.980
It'll appear once the uploaded like this here and then you just want to take it and move it across and

39
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.730
hovered over the banner that you've created.

40
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:40.040
It's a little bit hard to see here but you'll notice that there is a darker section to this template

41
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.250
when I hovered over and that's really where I want to get all of my text into.

42
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.250
So it's going to be shown properly.

43
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.420
Now I recommend you don't actually put it on the image because it can be hard to get rid of it but just

44
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.130
hovering it like this is the quick tests so I can see that that definitely is not going to fit.

45
00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:02.330
So what I'm going to do is just select the text on all this and really bring it to an a much smaller

46
00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.970
size.

47
00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.560
Reposition it in the center and I can hover over again still a little bit too big.

48
00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:14.050
So I'm going to take this again move this down center once again.

49
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.600
And the final tests.

50
00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.490
It looks like we're all good although I may even just do one more time.

51
00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:21.350
There we go.

52
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:30.340
Once you're happy with that you just want to click on download the file and then upload that into YouTube.

53
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.620
Now it's your turn heading to combat dot com and use one of the templates to create your youtube banner

54
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.820
for free in less than five minutes.
