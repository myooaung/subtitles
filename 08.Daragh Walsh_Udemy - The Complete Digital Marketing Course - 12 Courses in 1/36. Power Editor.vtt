3
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:09.750

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:16.560
And then I'm going to show you the tool itself how to access it and hate and get started using it.

5
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.700
So first let's understand what power Ed. is.

6
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.770
Well it's an alternative to the Create tool that you've already been using in this course to create

7
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:26.580
your odds.

8
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:33.540
The difference is is that it has additional features which will allow you to scale your marketing campaigns

9
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.070
and have an improved workflow.

10
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.630
So what are these additional features available empower Ed..

11
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:45.550
Well the key thing is that you can manage things in bulk and really get a lot more done with fewer clicks.

12
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:52.800
For example you can adjust budgets audiences and scheduling at once just by selecting multiple sets

13
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.000
and changing it you can modify ads themselves.

14
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.780
Calls to action and the images that are using you can bulk upload and change those things.

15
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:10.100
You can also download the information from power editor adjusted off line or an Excel upload pack up.

16
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.160
And that's a way that you can edit.

17
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.510
Tons of campaigns very very quickly.

18
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.860
And the great thing about power editors well is that you can run a b test very quickly and duplicate

19
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.820
onst duplicate sets and split your audiences there's a ton of features in there and it's much easier

20
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.870
to split test Inside Power editor and set that whole thing up inside the Create tool.

21
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.680
So who is power editor reading for then.

22
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.180
Well it's really for running large scale advertising campaigns.

23
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.740
Obviously if you can manage things in bulk This is going to be ideal.

24
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.590
If you want to work in an agency if you want to work as a freelancer or even if you're running a lot

25
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.580
of Facebook ads campaign for your own personal business.

26
00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:02.370
The other key advantage of using power Ed. is that they release features into predator first so for

27
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.270
example lead and custom audiences they would have first appeared here.

28
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.510
So if you're using this to I'm familiar with that you can access those before the general public may

29
00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.450
maybe using the ads create tool.

30
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.080
So that is well power editor is the key features of it and height and gaining competitive advantage

31
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.440
by using it.

32
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.370
Let's jump into your on Akkad on show you how to access it and get started now.

33
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.130
So you want to first come into your kind and then through the drop and the side here you can click all

34
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:39.840
tools come into power editor and the first thing you will notice is that any campaigns that you've created

35
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:47.550
in the ads create two will also appear in power added or it's not as completely separated out and it's

36
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.800
just a different interface.

37
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.370
The first thing to do when you use PERDER is to come up to the top left hand side of screen in the drop

38
00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:02.340
down here and just make sure that you still like the hand that you want to view for if you are working

39
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:08.340
in an agency or freelancing or even working on your own personal accounts.

40
00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.210
Just make sure that you selected the right one before you dive into looking up all the data.

41
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.050
Also in the top right hand side of the screen you can see the date range usually by default that's the

42
00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.230
last 30 days.

43
00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.770
But just be aware that this information in here will adjust based on the date range that you've put

44
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:26.850
up here.

45
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.820
And one of the great things about a power editor is how easy they make it to sort through your data

46
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.090
and the fastest way to find things impera editor is to use these two drop downs appear in the top left

47
00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.440
corner of the search and the filters here.

48
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.890
And you can use these in combination to really pinpoint and find things.

49
00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:53.280
So for example if I wanted to find any of my handsets that were inactive I could just select this I

50
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.710
can add additional parameters here.

51
00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.440
In terms of finding the company name I could type that in to find that.

52
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.870
So right now here I don't have a ton of campaigns to really be sorting through but you can imagine this

53
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.870
is very helpful if you've got a lot of stuff to sort through.

54
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:16.860
So these search and filters and combining them is really the fastest way to find information in power

55
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:17.780
Ed..

56
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.230
Now in terms of the layout of the rest of the dashboard this is going to look familiar to you.

57
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.980
Campaigns onsets And yes those are the three levels of the Facebook structure and we've seen that before

58
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.010
in the ads create tool.

59
00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:37.560
Now one handy tip when using this navigation is if you want to see the odd sets and ads for only one

60
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.100
campaign all you've to do is tick the box.

61
00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.660
Here you can see it's come up as one selected.

62
00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:50.670
Now in this tab I'm going to see the onsets for that one campaign and also the ads for a dark campaign.

63
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:56.820
Now what I can do additionally is come into this time and if I want to see only be ads for this one

64
00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:04.190
said in this one campaign I can see them here and that makes it much easier for me to really pinpoint

65
00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:09.860
the odds that I might want to change and optimize now in order to edit the ads themselves here inside

66
00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:16.790
parah editor you just want to click on the ad click on that in the drop down here click on edit.

67
00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:22.820
This is going to open up this type here where I can edit the ad if I want and I can also see in this

68
00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:29.110
tab some of the analytics for that particular as well to get back to the main screen.

69
00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:34.130
You want to click back on the Edit tab and just this little arrow here to move that back out of the

70
00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:40.760
way if you want to de-select any of these sets or campaigns can just click and really get back to the

71
00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:42.230
full view here.

72
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:45.650
Now you may also see these buttons across the top here.

73
00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:50.870
These are some of the features that really help you to both manage campaigns and onsets.

74
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.930
So for example I can select one campaign.

75
00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:57.320
Here are multiple ones and I can duplicate them.

76
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:02.720
I can do some quick edits turn them on turn them off find replace bin them etc..

77
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.140
Import and export them.

78
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.480
I'll be going through all of that stuff with you.

79
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:13.610
But for now just get access to the power tool following the steps that you've learned in this video.
