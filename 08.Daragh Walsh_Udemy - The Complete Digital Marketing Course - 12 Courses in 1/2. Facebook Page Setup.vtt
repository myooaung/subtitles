00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.840
In this video you are going to learn how to set up a Facebook page.

2
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.390
It's going to take less than five minutes.

3
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.610
It's absolutely free to do and it's very straightforward.

4
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.830
So the first thing that you want to do is go ahead and go to Facebook dot com on what you do here is

5
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.760
really just log in with your normal personal profile.

6
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:27.190
It's actually inside of our personal profile that we create a Facebook page for a business or brand.

7
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:33.210
If you don't have a Facebook personal profile Well then you can just go ahead and set one up here and

8
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.260
then log in.

9
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.510
So just log in normally to Facebook once you've got that set up.

10
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.630
Now what we actually do is come up to the top right hand corner here click on the dropdown and here

11
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.910
we're going to see the opportunity to create a page.

12
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.550
And now pops up the six different options that we have.

13
00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.140
So when we're creating a page we want to really select one of these six options.

14
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:06.810
You see local business or place company organization or institution brand or product artists band or

15
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.460
public figure entertainment cause or community.

16
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.010
And there actually isn't a huge amount of difference between all of these choices so you don't need

17
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.380
to worry about this too much.

18
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.920
But if you are a local business for example you'll have the opportunity to put in a local address phone

19
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.820
number.

20
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.780
You can even enable reviews.

21
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.000
And so each page has a couple of different settings.

22
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.540
But really it doesn't make a huge difference what option you choose for a business.

23
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.190
I'm going to pick this here this option for a company or organization.

24
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.220
Now I can choose my category.

25
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.140
So I'm just going to set this as education set in the company name.

26
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:57.740
I can do just put in my company name there for this video I'm just going to set up a demo account so

27
00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:58.810
click gets started

28
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.800
and then I'm brought straight into my Facebook page.

29
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:13.040
Once inside the next step is then to click on Create page username and typically you're just going to

30
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.480
put your business name where the page name as the user name.

31
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:23.690
And one important thing to understand about this is that your user name will actually form part of the

32
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.910
custom you IRL that you have on Facebook.

33
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:34.670
So it's going to be Facebook dot com forward slash your username rather than your page name.

34
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.490
And that's why you want to make it as close to your page name as possible and you want to keep it pretty

35
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.890
short if you can so that it's easy to say in a conversation to maybe a customer or you can find us on

36
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.910
Facebook account for it slash whatever it is.

37
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.040
So to make this clear let me give you an example.

38
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.500
There's kind of type in my business name and this example to set up a demo.

39
00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.630
And as you can see this may happen for you as well this season isn't available.

40
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.520
Please enter your username that isn't already taken.

41
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.830
No easy work around.

42
00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:13.230
This is just to put an official at the end and not is available in an I can go ahead and create this

43
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.960
username

44
00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.660
and there we go.

45
00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.840
It's really that simple to set up a page for a business or brand on Facebook.

46
00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.880
And once again to do for yourself log into your Facebook personal private profile.

47
00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.750
Come then in the top right hand corner and click Create page.
