00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.600
A linked in company page helps others learn more about your business brand products services and job

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.000
opportunities.

3
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:13.080
That's why in this video I'm going to show you how to create a page ad adman's publish content and not

4
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:13.920
employees.

5
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.710
So the first step is to go and create a page and to do that and you can just come into the work section

6
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:20.730
here.

7
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.730
You can scroll to the bottom and you're going to see the option here to create a page and all you want

8
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:35.330
to do is firstly put it in the company name so just putting set up as an example and then you're going

9
00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:41.450
to see that you can chose the link in public your L or your custom your l.

10
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:48.320
And ideally this will just be the name of your business and hopefully that is available there for you.

11
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.330
It is fun to click verify that your official representative of the company and go ahead and create the

12
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:54.690
page.

13
00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:03.300
Now as suggested here you should add a logo and cover photo give candidates full context around your

14
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:10.020
company by filling out all the sections and you can even add your company name on company description

15
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.880
in each target language and you are discovering.

16
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.040
So go ahead and click and get started.

17
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.960
Now I mean here you can see those options to add the profile image change the name the description etc..

18
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:29.530
Now it can be a little bit intimidating to fill the site if you're not sure what to fill in.

19
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:36.890
So what I would recommend you do is you actually open up open up Linked-In again in a separate tab and

20
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.320
then you can come into the search bar here and start to search for some companies.

21
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.630
So just take HubSpot as an example.

22
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.680
And actually I think their page came up there but if they don't you can come across to companies just

23
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:59.220
open that up and what you can essentially do is have a look at some companies and their pages and use

24
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.970
it as a template for yourself so you can see they've got a nice bright logo in it.

25
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.820
In terms of it just being two colors that's a key thing for company logos it's a great idea to have

26
00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.340
two colors and not a white background because that'll blend into the page so you really want to be a

27
00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.860
bright color backgrounds and then see white here that really pops out.

28
00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.510
You'll also see that they've used their cover image space to show the team members.

29
00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.530
It's kind of a fun place to work.

30
00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:34.180
That's appealing to candidates if they wanted to come and learn more about Linked-In and the jobs that

31
00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.090
are available.

32
00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.160
Well look it looks like a pretty fun place to have to work.

33
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.600
And that's the type of thing that you can use that cover image for.

34
00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.000
Let's open up another page again and we'll have a look at some other different types of companies.

35
00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:56.150
So if we search for like on seat didn't pop right up there so we can come to companies.

36
00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.260
And again we can look there.

37
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.420
So what we can see here and this is kind of interesting.

38
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:10.870
Best of company pages 2017 is awarded by and linked in themselves in the background there is really

39
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.500
the campus of their offices.

40
00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:21.280
And so again it's appealing really to people who potentially work there not only the team but hey that

41
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.120
looks like a pretty awesome place to work.

42
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.510
Now if we scroll then maybe down to the about us let's have a look at these.

43
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.440
So they really get into you know what they actually do what their kind of story is how many customers

44
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.500
they have and where some of the offices are.

45
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.480
So that's important for an international company.

46
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.630
And if we look at night then let's have a look at example of them a little bit of the history about

47
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.730
the company named after the Greek goddess of victory.

48
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:58.510
And again some of their places where they're actually operating there founder or founder is Phil Knight.

49
00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:59.890
It's kind of a well-known guy.

50
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.710
And then also you can see that they've added in their web site you're offended type of company and there

51
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.510
are a number of employees speciality etc..

52
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.770
If we do the same on the Hubspot you can see those same details are there as well.

53
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.010
So the point is that I would encourage you to search for some company pages.

54
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.220
Check out what they're doing and model yourself on.

55
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.070
Even people particularly in your niche or company sizes that are similar.

56
00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:36.010
But as a general rule you can see the profile logo here two simple colors and with a simple image that

57
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:37.160
really pops say.

58
00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.820
So.

59
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.980
We cannot look at the see black background.

60
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:47.200
Simple logo two colors pop side cover photo show the team or maybe even show the campus where you're

61
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.400
working and in terms of the About Us little bit of history.

62
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:58.570
Explain really what the company does at a high level and the areas where you are operating.

63
00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.820
And here's an interesting part as well for more information visit our company's site or career site

64
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:09.850
and then they include companies details so you can see that this page is really geared towards hiring

65
00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.630
people into the company because there's a clear call to action there.

66
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:19.830
They're also focusing a lot on the campus and probably a similar thing here as well.

67
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:26.140
So there's tons of ideas on existing Linked-In pages you can just take the best ideas from them and

68
00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.640
apply them to your own page.

69
00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.950
So I'll let you fill in the steps there for yourself.

70
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:39.790
Fairly straightforward but let's explore some of the other features of the Linked-In company page.

71
00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:46.840
And one is the updates so you can really share updates and this will go to the people who are following

72
00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:53.020
your page and then you can do it in a very simple way like that you can just come to the updates page

73
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.970
publish it.

74
00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:59.610
You can see engagement details here and metrics that Cremin cross to analytics as well.

75
00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:07.000
We can see people who followed the page the careers page the companies page satirises Fullbright break

76
00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:12.910
down in terms of the analytics and we can also get some notifications there if our company has been

77
00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:18.270
mentioned in a post and this is essentially where we would monitor that.

78
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:23.620
So already in this video learned how to create a page to publish content and then look let's look at

79
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.410
how to odd oddments to the page.

80
00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:32.190
So to do that you can just click on the Armand's tools in the top right hand corner click on page adman's

81
00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.540
and then you will just go ahead and add any Adnan's in.

82
00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.410
Now they must have set up their LinkedIn profile already.

83
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:46.030
So once they done that you can just search and search to find them and then you can go ahead and add

84
00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:46.240
them.

85
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:51.350
So let's just say you could just select somebody there.

86
00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:54.690
They're going to get the notification.

87
00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.350
I'll actually just remove that because it's just a friend.

88
00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:02.820
And then we go ahead and click save and they're going to receive a notification.

89
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:08.640
Final thing we want to cover is how to add employees to your business page on Linked-In.

90
00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:13.650
And actually it's the employees themselves who will associate it with your page.

91
00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:18.900
So you really want to tell employees to come into their own pages here.

92
00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:26.640
View that profile then you want to come down to experience add some experience and then you can put

93
00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:32.930
it in the company.

94
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:38.510
You can see it there set up a demo and then they just go ahead and on in their title and when they started

95
00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:41.130
etc. and that's going to show up on their profile.

96
00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:47.890
So what do you want to do once you've set up your page actually encourage your employees to set it up.

97
00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:54.140
You can give this information about the page name to date your departments and maybe ask them to go

98
00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:56.060
get everybody set up.

99
00:07:56.390 --> 00:08:01.970
So once again to create a business page on Linked In Quicken the work icon in the top right hand corner.

100
00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:09.140
Go ahead and create a company page and in there you can also add admins publish content and then once

101
00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:14.450
you've set up your page you can ask employees to add themselves to your page as well.

102
00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:20.330
And that is how you can really help people learn more about your business brand products or services

103
00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:24.130
and job opportunities by creating a business page on LinkedIn.
