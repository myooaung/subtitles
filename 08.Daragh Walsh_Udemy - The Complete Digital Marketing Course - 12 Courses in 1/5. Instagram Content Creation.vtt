00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:08.040
In this video you're going learn how to design an original piece of content for Instagram for free that

2
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.690
you can then go ahead and share directly on Instagram.

3
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.700
So this is something that you really do want to learn how to do if you want to create your own content

4
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.190
or content for clients or companies.

5
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.880
It's basic design skills but it's going to allow you to produce a lot of original content.

6
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.680
So how to get started.

7
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.040
Walk through the exact steps of how to create this design from scratch.

8
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:39.150
So what do you want to firstly do is go ahead and open up your browser and download the Kanva app.

9
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.610
Now Kanva is essentially Photoshop for Dummies.

10
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.040
It's free it's so simple to use.

11
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.550
And the cool thing is is that you can design on your phone and then share directly from Instagram.

12
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.530
They do also have a desktop version so that's pretty cool as well because if you're more comfortable

13
00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.090
designing on your desktop then you can just take the design from the app and then share it directly.

14
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:08.490
So you have that choice as well to design on your desktop and then just share via the app on Duret on

15
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.210
Instagram.

16
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.720
But in this example I'll show you how to actually create in a design in the app.

17
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.110
So I've download the Kanva app I'm going to open that up and then you can see here that they have templates

18
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.110
under the Instagram section and what you can do is create really any type of design.

19
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.900
There are a ton of templates here but what I've done here is what's going to come up is a lot of templates

20
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.310
like this and some of these are popular now.

21
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:39.360
You can see to that 18 except for what I'm going to do is typing in quotes and that is going to bring

22
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.060
up all the templates for quotes.

23
00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.230
Now you can search around for other ones as well if you want product promotions etc. but for now I'll

24
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:47.710
just look at this one.

25
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.740
So here is the template that I can easily use and modify and you can see this is in the format that

26
00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:55.450
I want.

27
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.280
Oscar Wilde here to live is the rarest thing in the world.

28
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.120
Most people exist that is all OK.

29
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:06.990
Great quote from Oscar Wilde but I wanted to adapt this template slightly and design the design.

30
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.020
I showed you previously.

31
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.730
So the first thing that I'm going to do is change the image so I can just tap on the image.

32
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.460
It's going to bring up my camera roll.

33
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.270
I could also take you can see my camera here my hand waving.

34
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.310
I could take a picture if I wanted but I've already got this picture on my camera roll which I'm going

35
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.230
to just click on and you can see it inserts right in.

36
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.780
So simple so easy.

37
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.830
Now I want to change the quote because obviously this guy's not Oscar Wilde.

38
00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.150
So if I double click on the text

39
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:50.830
and I can say typing the quote so I typed in the quote there don't wish it were easy.

40
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.770
Wish you were better I think great advice.

41
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.350
So I changed the text and say done

42
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.860
now I'm going to resize that taxes Rob because you can see I've got a little bit of space so I am going

43
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.870
to double click on this

44
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.220
and I'm going to change this to size 56.

45
00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:24.140
I think that should fit in every and then I clicked on.

46
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:30.350
Then I want to change the author's name and so so and double click on that

47
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.970
now I will say that it takes a little bit of getting used to me the first time that you design something

48
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.580
and mine be so simple.

49
00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.900
But after a while you're really going to get the hang of this and then make a really easy for yourself.

50
00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.100
So those pretty much by design it's pretty much already done.

51
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.590
I'm happy with the positioning.

52
00:03:53.870 --> 00:04:00.520
I think it all looks great and a good idea before you go to publish is maybe just reread it.

53
00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.040
Make sure there's no mistakes.

54
00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.850
I can actually see that I've made a mistake here.

55
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.770
So I wanted to say don't wish it were easy.

56
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:15.750
Wish you were better.

57
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.490
Now I have to reposition the

58
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.560
text underneath.

59
00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:22.720
Drag it off there.

60
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:26.400
OK.

61
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.410
Looks pretty good.

62
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:35.040
Now what I can do is just click on the image once again then I'm going to click on this button on the

63
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:40.920
top right hand corner you can see it's like the share button that's really going to finalize my design

64
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:49.800
save us and it'll enable me then to share it which I can go and head into click Import to Instagram.

65
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.120
And what I can do now is publish directly to my feed.

66
00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.800
I just don't need to crop it so I can just click next.

67
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.300
You can out a filter if you want.

68
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.300
I actually might apply this filter.

69
00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.650
Gingham just to make it look maybe slightly older slightly more wisdom.

70
00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.410
And then click next.

71
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.000
You can see that I can tie people out of location if I want to write a caption.

72
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:23.320
And for now I will just click share and there we go.

73
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.880
You can see this is how it is going to show up in people's feed.

74
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.710
So I think it looks great it looks professional.

75
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.390
And then if I come back to my cane you can see it's showing up there as well.

76
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.570
So you can see that took me less than five minutes.

77
00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.310
It was completely free to do.

78
00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.060
And it's very easy to do from your phone as well.

79
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.540
Remember that you have this app Kanva with a ton of templates in there.

80
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.990
So what I recommend you do is go ahead download the Komba app try.

81
00:05:53.020 --> 00:06:00.490
Some of these Instagram templates for yourself and start creating original content for Instagram completely

82
00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:01.600
free.

83
00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.260
It's just your imagination is the only thing holding you back.

84
00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:10.870
There's so many things you can do and you can even look at content that your competitors are doing and

85
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:16.680
put a slight twist on it and publish it yourself as original content using Kanva.

86
00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.850
