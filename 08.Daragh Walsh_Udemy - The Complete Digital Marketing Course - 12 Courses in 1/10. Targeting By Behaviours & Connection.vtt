You've already learned how to refine the audience for your ads with interest targeting.

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.810
And in this lecture we're going to cover the last two options that you have which is behavior and connections

3
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:10.960
targeting.

4
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.400
So let's jump straight in.

5
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:19.530
We're still here in the detail targeting section in our ads create tool working on the onset level for

6
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:26.920
our audience and define this behavior targeting best to click on browse here come dine TV havior is

7
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.170
when we can see certain behaviors that are available here.

8
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:36.150
Now if you want to include people who have these behaviors into your audience this is hadiah It's very

9
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:42.810
simple and the same process as our interests let's understand with some of these behaviors are so mobile

10
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:43.690
device user.

11
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.670
If you want to do.

12
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:52.230
Target is a person who uses a particular brand of mobile device or particular operating system if that

13
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.570
was important to your.

14
00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.750
Then you can see like that here and really on that end just by ticking the button as we saw for the

15
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.510
interests coming down let's have a look at some of them other ones here.

16
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.500
Travel is quite an interesting one.

17
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.210
And for example you could include people who have returned from a trip one week ago.

18
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:20.850
You know I have seen on my Facebook news feed a service that helps people to reclaim any money that

19
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.000
they're owed from canceled flights or missing baggage.

20
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.890
Now that appeared in my news feed when I just came back from holidays so probably they are using this

21
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.400
type of behavior targeting to put the ads in front of people who are most likely going to need that

22
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.140
service.

23
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.010
So that's an interesting example of how someone might be using behavioral targeting.

24
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.830
They're moving down a little bit further we're looking at Kinect connections here and this is where

25
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.650
you can target your audience based on a connection that they have with you or don't have to.

26
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.040
So you can see there are options here for the Facebook page.

27
00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.790
I can target people who like my Facebook page and only them and you'll have to maybe type in the page

28
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.140
name and you can see that my fuel gauge here has dropped right down to it.

29
00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:16.830
And so the reason is is because if I select this option people who like my page then it will apply dot

30
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.180
variable plus all of the other things that I've selected above in order to do that.

31
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.320
So that really does narrow your audience that's not a day like my page and they are the things above

32
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:35.990
that they like my page and they meet the criteria above as well so it's important to understand I want

33
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.980
to take that off because that really narrows my audience too much.

34
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.980
But you can include people who don't like your page.

35
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.650
If you're trying to reach new people.

36
00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:45.500
Exactly.

37
00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.020
And similar options for your app and events are some reason that seems a little bit hard to click.

38
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.580
But I'm sure you'll figure it out now.

39
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.280
In terms of these behavior on connections do you need to use them properly for this first campaign.

40
00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.350
They're not as important but it's just interesting to understand what those options are.

41
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.630
I would suggest that you go in have a look quickly around what those options are if there are placable

42
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:10.760
ones put them in.

43
00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.420
If not don't worry about it too much.

44
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.230
Now that really wraps up our targeting and using those core targeting options to create an audience

45
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.080
for our.

46
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.570
Coming up next we're going to set the Plaisance for that.

47
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.680
And this is really where ad appears so I'll see you in the next lecture.
