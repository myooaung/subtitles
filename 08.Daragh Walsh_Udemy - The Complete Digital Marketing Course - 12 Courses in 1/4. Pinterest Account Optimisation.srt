00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:06,240
In this video you're going learn how to optimize your Pinterest account so that you can appear at the

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,580
top of the Pinterest search engine.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:14,190
Animals are going to cover some of the key steps you need to do to set up your camps like adding a profile

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:14,910
image.

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,400
So let us get started with the profile image.

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:26,730
This is a key part of your account and let me walk show you some of the profile images from the can

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,920
that I'm following so we can look at the best practices and there are only really two options for this

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:32,530
image.

9
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:38,660
Either one is going to be you as a personal brand or the face of your business or two.

10
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,670
It's going to be a company logo.

11
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:46,440
So firstly in terms of a personal brand this is a good example here.

12
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,340
It's a close shot of the face.

13
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,120
It has a very kind of muted background there's no distraction in the background.

14
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:58,170
And I think it's instantly recognizable as that person.

15
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:04,710
If we look across here at this profile it could be better if that shot in the face was a lot closer

16
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:08,690
to the camera because it would be easier to recognize.

17
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:14,070
And also you can see the pose there it's not as easy to recognize that person.

18
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,440
And also the background is maybe a little bit distracting.

19
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:23,670
So maybe a closer image of the face there just from it on like this one here would be better.

20
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:29,460
Also down here make sure if you're uploading an image that it's high quality if you're putting your

21
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,860
business on Pinterest and you want to attract customers.

22
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:38,280
Well then I think just the high quality image looks more professional and people will take you more

23
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,020
seriously there.

24
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:48,530
So that is for kind of a personal brand for an actual company really just your simple logo you can do.

25
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:54,950
If we look at some other examples I can show you some of their examples here.

26
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:58,580
And these are companies that I think do particularly well.

27
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:06,660
So if we look at night on Pinterest you can see it's just a very simple black background with the take

28
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,460
instantly recognizable.

29
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:13,050
And of course consistent across all of their social media profiles.

30
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,460
And let's have a look at one other one.

31
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,240
HubSpot again they always do a good job at this.

32
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:23,090
Just a simple two color logo.

33
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:28,610
Very recognizable even when it's very small like it is here.

34
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,560
Now to add the image is very simple.

35
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:38,790
He can just come to your settings come to your profile change the picture choose the photo and I am

36
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:46,060
just going to choose from my desktop which is the image that I use across all of my social media profiles.

37
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,800
Now it's in here as well that I also want to optimize a couple of other things about my profile.

38
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,810
The first is the business name.

39
00:02:54,150 --> 00:03:00,480
And what we can do here is start to as you optimize this profile and we do want to be appearing at the

40
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,910
top of the search results.

41
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,770
So keeping that we can do is start to put in some keywords here in our business name.

42
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:13,590
Now we'll show you if we look at some of these profiles the top influencers and you can have a look

43
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:17,060
at the top influencers that you have followed.

44
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:22,800
You can see that they say their name and then they say a couple of keywords for the niche that their

45
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,060
ads.

46
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:29,070
Pinterest marketing content creator and that helps them appear at the top of the search results when

47
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:32,780
people are searching for people for those topics.

48
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:39,540
So while you can see digital marketing and their keyword is kind of in their business name is a marketing

49
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,510
consultant Pinterest expert.

50
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:47,790
So what I can do is just take that in a little bar and use it on my own profile.

51
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:02,940
Now what you can do even if you have a business name is say put your business name here and then say

52
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:10,620
some of the things that you do whatever that is so that could be your business name and then jewelry

53
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:14,330
e-commerce store or something like that whatever it is.

54
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,520
Now next thing that we can do is just edit our username.

55
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,260
You want to make this look professional.

56
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,400
You may have been given a user name at a random string of numbers like this.

57
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,010
So what you can do is just adjust that slightly.

58
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:32,250
You could put in the real the official or for personal brand sometimes you can just stick in your middle

59
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,810
initial and that will be available.

60
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:39,840
Now I'm actually just going to see if if my first and last name is available and if not I can change

61
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,340
that afterwards.

62
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:47,460
Now next topic we've got the about us about U.S. And once again it's a good idea to look at some top

63
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,330
profiles.

64
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:56,100
You can see Pinterest marketer again those keywords from the title are repeated in here and you can

65
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,240
see some of the things they're an expert in essentially That's your value proposition.

66
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,790
Why should people be following this it can't.

67
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,480
What are you going to help them to do.

68
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,390
And so there are some of the options there.

69
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,150
So say a little bit about it.

70
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:17,400
Again bloggers social media enthusiasts etc. you can see a community where marketers and entrepreneurs

71
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:24,990
come together to to drive traffic increase conversion boost social engagement rates etc. so that's a

72
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:30,600
good one there because it shows you know why should I join this page or follow them because I'm joining

73
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,790
a community and also a community that wants to achieve these goals.

74
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:43,070
That's a pretty good bio that I can draw some ideas out of Sudan here more like a personal brand.

75
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:49,320
You can see top 50 social media marketing influencers so some social proof that's a good idea.

76
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:55,720
How could I include that into my profile as well here where they're located.

77
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,110
Pinterest for business.

78
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:03,670
Some of those keywords again and help you scale your blog traffic using Pinterest.

79
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,350
So that's good.

80
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:10,730
Very focused then on Pinterest and giving it clear value proposition for following this.

81
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,080
We'll look at HubSpot.

82
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,850
Now go ahead and follow these guys.

83
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:19,330
You can see all in one marketing software that brings your marketing word of mouth together.

84
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:25,660
We also like to have some fun so little bit of personality coming across there in the BIOS as well.

85
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:32,680
So when you look at other topics in your niche you can really take the best from those.

86
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:39,540
Look at some of those ideas and put them together to create your own about you bio.

87
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,660
OK so I feel that my buy me I said to her that is and can be wrong.

88
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:49,280
So that's something to try and catch their attention a little bit of social proof.

89
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:55,050
So many students take my digital marketing courses there's my keyword digital marketing follow me for

90
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,750
action tips to grow your business.

91
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,180
That's a call to action.

92
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,220
Follow my Pinterest account.

93
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,300
And then why should you do that.

94
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:10,620
They get actionable tips to grow their business location then you going to stick this in Dublin Ireland

95
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:17,610
and then go ahead and click save changes and you might see this saying Oops your username is already

96
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:18,490
taken.

97
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:24,370
So you can shorten that then until you find a freezer name or change it around.

98
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,890
Maybe the other way.

99
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:35,500
So if we come to the profile now we can see that we've got our SEO optimized title we've got our SEO

100
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:42,930
optimized bio that includes our keywords and we also have a great looking profile image.

101
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,310
So that is how you as you optimize your Pinterest can see you can appear at the top of the search results

102
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:52,840
and upload a profile image that's going to look professional.

103
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,900
I want people to follow your account.
