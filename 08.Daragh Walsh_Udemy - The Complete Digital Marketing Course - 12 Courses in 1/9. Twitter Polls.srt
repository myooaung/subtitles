00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:06,850
In this video you're going to learn how to use Twitter poles to create tweets that get a lot of engagements.

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:12,440
I'll show you a couple of examples and then I'll show you how to set up a poll on your Twitter account.

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:20,680
To find some examples of successful polls on Twitter we can just come into the search bar and type in

4
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:26,940
hashtag polls and hope is going to pop.

5
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:32,700
Then some accounts that are related as polls on some actual polls down here.

6
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:35,560
So let's come then and just find an example.

7
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,360
So here's a good example of simply just a question who's going to win the election.

8
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,180
And then there's two options.

9
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,800
And then people are really just voting on this so I could select this as somebody.

10
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:55,170
And then just vote and then I can see the percentage of people who think that that is the likely outcome.

11
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:02,190
So for me as a viewer this is very engaging because I'm actually doing something and engaging with you

12
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:07,140
on Twitter and then I'm also learning a little bit about what other people think.

13
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,120
And that gives me that little bit of an incentive to click through.

14
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,280
So you can see once again when you see the poll you don't actually see the answers.

15
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,940
You can see the number of votes.

16
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:23,450
But when I select my answer then I can see the percentage of people who agree to me.

17
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:29,370
So there isn't a built in incentive there for people to respond because then they can see what other

18
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:35,850
people are seeing and that is why it's such a powerful feature and why get so much engagements.

19
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,370
Now what can you do with these polls.

20
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:46,640
Well you can do pretty much anything you could get people to vote on content that you wanted to create.

21
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,420
So here you could say what what what blog post should I write next.

22
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,400
Instagram marketing Twitter marketing and you can see where the votes are.

23
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,940
You could ask for predictions like this who's going to win the election.

24
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:03,640
You could ask for feedback on a feature.

25
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,400
So.

26
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,630
And do you use this feature on Twitter polls.

27
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,030
Yes.

28
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,110
You can react to realtime events anything that happens in the news.

29
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:20,590
You could say do you think this is a positive thing or did he get that decision right.

30
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,650
Yes or no.

31
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:28,290
And then the cool thing about these polls as well as you can actually take a poll your poll or anybody's

32
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:31,440
poll and embed them onto your Web site.

33
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:37,110
So you could put this just take the code copy it and paste through it onto your Web site.

34
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:42,210
And then this poll will appear on the Web site so you could create your own polls put them on a blog

35
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:46,640
post or put a collection of polls to really highlight.

36
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:50,060
OK well this is what some people think is going to happen.

37
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,740
And here's what I actually think is going to happen.

38
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:58,290
So there's a lot of interesting ways that you can use these polls and even there it actually is an account

39
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:04,610
on Twitter here not shares that the most important polls on Twitter brought to you by BuzzFeed so we

40
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,120
click into this.

41
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,400
We can take a look at some of these.

42
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:15,950
So 3000 243 votes that's a lot of engagements and this is now over.

43
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:19,300
You can see it that's the final results final results.

44
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:22,290
So all of these I think they're sharing them magic when they're done.

45
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:26,840
But if it wasn't the final result you're going to see like one day left to the left and that's when

46
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,350
you can see the results there.

47
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:34,280
But even if we just scroll down through these you can see that there is a lot of engagement 17 under-votes

48
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:37,900
4100 10000 votes.

49
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:40,550
So this one's just kind of funny.

50
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,950
Some can be more Seer's 3000 votes 11000 votes.

51
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:50,240
Now I think what you'll see is the consistency between all of these is it's a simple question maybe

52
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:55,300
even a couple of words and then there's maybe one or two options maximum.

53
00:03:55,310 --> 00:04:00,540
So if you want to get a lot of engagements keep it a simple question one or two answers.

54
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,680
And I think that's going to make it very easy for people to respond.

55
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,000
They don't have to think a huge amount about it.

56
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:10,400
They can just click and you can make this fun like hell yet.

57
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:15,990
And even if we scroll down a little bit I think I saw a good one down here.

58
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,960
You can put emojis in here.

59
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,370
Are you ready for this end it now.

60
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:22,770
It's over.

61
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:28,640
And scroll down even more what is the future of the U.S. look like you know it looks bad or it looks

62
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:34,020
great and you can see that that got a huge amount into engagement as well.

63
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:40,010
So let us come in and create a poll for ourselves then we can come in and click tweet at the top right

64
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,090
hand corner here.

65
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:48,850
You can select this option to add a poll and so you want to ask the questions so walk towards maybe

66
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,000
should I make next.

67
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:57,020
And then you can say something give two options

68
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:10,280
Google Analytics I can create the whole length and that's probably a good idea to leave it up there

69
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:16,860
as long as possible maybe five to seven days and then you can just go ahead and tweet that.

70
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,950
Now if we come to the profile

71
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:27,630
you can see that that's going to appear there it's going to say four days left and then people are going

72
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,070
to vote.

73
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,210
You're going to see the results straight away.

74
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:36,600
But the viewers once seen their results until they click through an answer now that you know how to

75
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:42,930
create Twitter polls come in to your account and create a poll for yourself so you can get a lot of

76
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,450
engagement on your tweets.
