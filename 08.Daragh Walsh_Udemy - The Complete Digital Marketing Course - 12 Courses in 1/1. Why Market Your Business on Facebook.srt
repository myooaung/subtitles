00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,670
Welcome to Facebook marketing in this training you are going to learn how to use Facebook as a powerful

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,160
marketing tool to grow any business.

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:14,400
And I'm going to walk you through the steps to set up a Facebook page step by step to create content

4
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:20,070
and build an audience of tens of thousands of potential customers.

5
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:26,340
But before we get into that I do want to take a minute to talk about why you should be using Facebook

6
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:33,150
as a marketing channel and how it's really different to other social networks and marketing channels

7
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:33,930
out there.

8
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,760
So we're going to get through five reasons.

9
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:42,180
First reason is simply that there's 2 billion active monthly users on Facebook.

10
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:47,400
And if we look at a chart of all the social network sites here you can see that Facebook is way out

11
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,480
in front with really over 2 billion users.

12
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:56,030
So why is this important to say a marketer or business owner.

13
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:02,610
Well Facebook is so big that really no matter what country you're in no matter what age group you're

14
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:07,880
targeting your potential customers and audience are going to be on Facebook.

15
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:13,410
It's just a fact with an audience that that big two billion people.

16
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:19,740
So if you're not sure which marketing channel you should be focusing on you can focus on facebook because

17
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,080
your audience are there without a doubt.

18
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,090
It's just that big.

19
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,350
And you couldn't really say the same about Instagram or something like that.

20
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:34,380
It's got more of a narrower age range although that is expanding at things like Twitter again is more

21
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,730
specific type of user not everybody has Twitter.

22
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,540
Not everybody has snapchat.

23
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:46,680
Not everybody has Pinterest but everybody or almost everybody has a Facebook profile so you can really

24
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,770
target them there.

25
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,560
So that's the first reason.

26
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:55,130
Second reason is that the average Facebook user has two hundred friends.

27
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,430
Now why is this important.

28
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:04,950
It's important because that allows Facebook to have a very viral effect because if two friends like

29
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:11,640
a Facebook page a Facebook post then if they have a third friend that's interested in similar content

30
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:17,400
Facebook is going to show that to them and that's what really creates this viral effect.

31
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:24,930
Very very quickly is that Facebook is able to really show content to your friends group and it just

32
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,930
expands so quickly.

33
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:33,330
Now that is not the same for something like say YouTube like I use YouTube personally all the time but

34
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:37,750
I have no idea what my Khant what my friends look at on YouTube.

35
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:40,110
I never see a video that they like.

36
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:46,990
And so it doesn't create that same viral effect between friends.

37
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:54,540
Now the third reason that you should be using Facebook is that it has real profiles and this may seem

38
00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:01,020
obvious but this is actually the reason that Facebook was able to dominate social media.

39
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:08,250
They weren't the first social media site but they were their first social media site that got people

40
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:13,470
to create real profiles and it was because they really want to connect with their friends so they obviously

41
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,090
put in their real name.

42
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,760
So why is it important for business.

43
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:20,650
Well let's say if we look down at it at a post here.

44
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,160
If I click in and I can see the people who are really engaging with my content and then I can click

45
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,590
through to their profile.

46
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:32,870
I can get a sense of who they are what they're interested in where they are what other content that

47
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:40,050
they like and that allows me to build up a very clear buyer persona for my business.

48
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:43,520
You couldn't say the same for YouTube or reddish or even Twitter.

49
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:52,050
People tend to create these pseudo profiles and not their real names because there wasn't that incentive

50
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,120
to really connect with your friends.

51
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,860
So that is something extremely unique to Facebook.

52
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:05,070
And not only does it make it good for you know seeing who your competitors audience are get a real clear

53
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:05,780
picture of them.

54
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:11,790
You can do for your own but also it's very powerful in terms of if you're looking at your analytics

55
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:17,920
and you want to see you know some analytics on your audience.

56
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:24,330
He can be very clear you can be very certain that you know their age gender their location is extremely

57
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:30,720
accurate because people have put that in themselves and also then for Facebook ads you can much better

58
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:37,740
target people based on who they are and that is an extremely powerful reason to market your business

59
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:41,400
on Facebook and because they have real profiles.

60
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:49,420
So number four and in case you weren't aware Facebook owns Facebook Messenger WhatsApp and Instagram.

61
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:57,980
And if we go back to the most famous social networks worldwide of the states you can see that one two

62
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:05,600
three four five six seven a 10 even one two three four five six in the top six Facebook owns three of

63
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,060
them.

64
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:10,280
So Facebook you know setting up their first.

65
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:15,280
It makes it much easier for you to say connect with people on Facebook Messenger.

66
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,810
That's all integrated.

67
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:23,540
Also it's much easier if you have people on Instagram or you're setting up an account there to invite

68
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:30,500
people from Facebook across Facebook ads is also integrated so you can you can even target Facebook

69
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,830
users on Instagram in ads.

70
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,140
And what's up.

71
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:38,140
You can be sure that there's more integrations and opportunities opening up there.

72
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:44,450
So again if you're not really sure to get where to get started Facebook really can just leverage and

73
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:48,820
be used to grow audiences on all these other platforms as well.

74
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:54,560
Now the final reason that you really want to market your business on Facebook is because Facebook has

75
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:01,310
a powerful platform and even if you don't have the budget or not considering advertising on Facebook

76
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:07,460
right now you need to have this in the back of your mind as a reason to really just grow a business

77
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,660
on Facebook.

78
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:17,720
And this is because you actually it's no longer possible to even create ads on Facebook without a published

79
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,960
Facebook page.

80
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,890
So that's why you'll need to set up a page if you want advertise.

81
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:29,780
But also if you have an audience built up well then I can say to Facebook Ads Hey I've got an audience

82
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,350
built up.

83
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:35,600
This is what they're like and go out and find more people like that.

84
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,300
And so with a bit of a sample you can give that to Facebook and they can really find more people like

85
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:41,880
that.

86
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:46,900
Otherwise it's going to be much harder for Facebook to really understand who are the type of people

87
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,800
engage or content.

88
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,320
You know what are their profiles like where they based.

89
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:59,210
So by building up a Facebook page and building up an audience then that would really improve your marketing

90
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,620
efforts on Facebook probably by 10 times.

91
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:10,070
So those are the five reasons why you should use Facebook as a marketing channel and how it's different

92
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,050
to other marketing channels out there.
