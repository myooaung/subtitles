00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:05,280
In this video you're going to learn how to add your first five posts to your Facebook page.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,740
So to get started what you wanted to do is make sure that if you're a brand new page you might be having

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:18,040
a couple of posts like this that show your cover image and profile that you've uploaded.

4
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:25,770
So while we want to do is actually just go ahead and delete these or hide them from the timeline because

5
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,140
we really wanted to.

6
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:33,660
The post that we show to our audience to be highly valuable so they understand why they should like

7
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:40,450
this page and why they should really want to see updates from us in their news feed.

8
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,690
So that's why it's very important.

9
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:48,480
Before you even go ahead to invite people to like your pages to create a base of content maybe three

10
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,610
to five posts that really show why somebody should follow your page.

11
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:59,430
So the first post that you could make is simply just a milestone post.

12
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:07,860
And what we want to do is select from the dropdown we can add a milestone to your page and you can just

13
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,190
say something like You know we open for business

14
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:20,980
than today's days location if that's relevant and

15
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,770
to say we're open for business.

16
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:29,470
OK.

17
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:35,720
So I've had it in a little bit of text there we're delighted to say that we're open for business.

18
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,550
Always check the spelling.

19
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:40,490
We look forward to engaging with you here on our brand new Facebook page.

20
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:46,100
Like this page to stay updated so you can say something simple like that a call to action like like

21
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:46,810
this page.

22
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:51,850
You could even include an option there to get people to go to your Web site.

23
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,040
You can upload a photo as well.

24
00:01:55,050 --> 00:02:02,020
So does this photo online come in we're open.

25
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,570
You can adjust that as you want.

26
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,150
But the point is that you create a post that's a milestone posts.

27
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:12,350
We're open for business or our Facebook pages live whatever you want it to be.

28
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:17,760
But that's a very simple first post that you can make on Facebook.

29
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:20,680
Now in terms of what else you should be adding in here.

30
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:25,100
Well you can really add maybe a link to a blog article that you've written.

31
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:30,390
And if you're struggling to get ideas for what you could put down then a great thing to do is to look

32
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,220
at some competitor pages.

33
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,750
So just having a look at some

34
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:46,480
pages here so let's just imagine that I was opening a restaurant in my city what I could do is find

35
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:53,970
a couple of Facebook pages of restaurants that are here locally that are doing well on Facebook and

36
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:58,230
you can determine that by the number of followers and engagements on their posts.

37
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:01,150
Have a look at the type of posts that they're putting out.

38
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:07,540
So here's a great example and this could apply perfectly to a new business officially opened in Belfast

39
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:13,860
from 1:00 p.m. today finace at this address and there's a picture of people queuing at the door.

40
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:20,110
So as you can see this type of post got a lot of engagements particularly for local business this is

41
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:28,060
a great idea because anybody in the city then will be likely to tag friends or share this because they

42
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:32,660
know the address of where they're opening and even the city and what time it's opening.

43
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:40,240
And that could just be a photo from almost anywhere the location that could have been from a pre-party

44
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,310
that you set up and the official opening is today.

45
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:49,570
So it's quite a clever use and actually a great example of maybe a first post that you could put up.

46
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:56,980
Here's another one like free burgers get free burgers in our new Belfast's place at 3 p.m. tomorrow

47
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:01,280
Saturday until we run out dresses five fishtailed etc..

48
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,330
So especially for local businesses.

49
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:07,930
Your first posts are actually a brilliant opportunity to get the word out quickly.

50
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:14,170
Even if you can include something like a free offering could be a free consultation might not work for

51
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:18,970
your type of business trying be creative to get that buzz going so that a lot of people are going to

52
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,600
want to share that message in 0 7.

53
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:25,180
170 people obviously want to share free burgers.

54
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,360
Who doesn't like that.

55
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:32,690
So anything you can do in those initial posts creates an excitement and is a great idea.

56
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:39,490
So looking at some competitors that are doing well on Facebook is a great place to find new ideas.

57
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:44,860
Obviously it's going to be different for every type of business that you have but for your first couple

58
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,870
of shows come in and look what's working for them.

59
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,320
Why are they getting engagement.

60
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,380
What is the type of content.

61
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:54,130
Is it a GIF like this.

62
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:57,690
Is it competition's higher or are they really doing it.

63
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,700
Here's another example of a restaurant locally as well.

64
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:05,270
We come down to the post section here.

65
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,800
We can take another love.

66
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:10,450
So give us some good.

67
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:13,560
You could team at around the season.

68
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:20,370
December is just around the corner so get get booking at this address or this e-mail address.

69
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:24,330
Hopefully we'll see you soon and see quite a lot of engagement.

70
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,690
That's just a quick video.

71
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,470
Uploaded catches the attention.

72
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:36,030
And again they're just saying the last few days to catch this special moving up again last few days

73
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,230
to catch this special.

74
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:40,320
So obviously every of every business is going to be different.

75
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,690
But really look at those successful pages in order to get ideas for your first posts.

76
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:51,690
So comedy competitions just say we're opening could be links to your blog posts but you need to put

77
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:58,200
her in a room by three to five posts here before you start to invite anybody to your Facebook page so

78
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,170
that they have a reason to hit that like button.

79
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:09,730
In order to see future posts in their news feeds you have to give them a reason in order to do that.

80
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:14,270
And if you can give them a reason to engage with your content they're even better because that will

81
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:20,630
help get the word out and get them to use their social network to spread and market your business.
