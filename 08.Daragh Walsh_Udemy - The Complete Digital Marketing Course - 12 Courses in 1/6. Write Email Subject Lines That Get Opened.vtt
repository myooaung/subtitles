00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:06.940
In this video you're going to learn how to write better email subject lines and I want to show you a

2
00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:13.450
really cool trick that you can use right away to really find nice how to write email subject lines that

3
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:14.600
get opened.

4
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.370
And that's the critical part.

5
00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:23.050
So what you should do is come into your own e-mail accounts and like I've done here I have a folder

6
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:29.080
full of all of the emails that I've signed up to and what you want to do is look down through this list

7
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.460
of emails you can see a ton of these e-mails I haven't opened at all.

8
00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:38.650
But there are certain e-mails here that I have opened and these are the ones that you really want to

9
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:39.880
focus on.

10
00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:46.510
So if you've opened the e-mails well then obviously that is a subject line that gets opened.

11
00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.570
And so you can just take the subject lines or model them and use them for yourself and you're going

12
00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.970
to have a very good chance of those getting open.

13
00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:00.520
So essentially you're looking at what is working and then you're just applying it to yourself.

14
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:06.460
That's a lot easier than talking about the 10 things you need to do because look this is proven.

15
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.590
And let's take an example of this 7 prediction trends for tech in 2018.

16
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.440
Now why did I open this.

17
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:20.050
Well number one it starts with numbers and that's a great way to spark curiosity because I really want

18
00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.660
to know water those seven things.

19
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.240
And there are also trends for tech in 2018.

20
00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.470
So if these are trends well maybe I can jump on them maybe a combine and benefit from them.

21
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:40.570
And it just sparks a lot of curiosity because I would like to maybe get ahead on these trends.

22
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.070
It's for 2018.

23
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:48.580
This was sent in the 6th of January so it's quite timely it's a well-timed D.M. and I want to open it

24
00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.090
because I want to know what seven trends are.

25
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.270
So how could you use an email subject like line like this for yourself.

26
00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.520
Well you could do the seven prediction trends for digital marketing.

27
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:06.790
There's an 18 7 production trends for yoga whatever personal finance whatever your name is.

28
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.110
You can take a subject line like that and just applied for yourself.

29
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:17.320
Again starting with the numbers is really a great thing for email subject lines because it sparks curiosity

30
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.910
and I want to open the e-mail in order to find out.

31
00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.780
Now this is absolutely critical.

32
00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.370
Email subject lines.

33
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.260
Look at all these e-mails here that I haven't Open's now for these e-mail senders.

34
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.120
They haven't gotten me to open the e-mail so they've no chance of me clicking choose their web site

35
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.940
or buying their product so read the email subject line is something you should spend a lot of time thinking

36
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:41.340
about.

37
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.720
Because if they don't open your email then everything you've done after that is just wasted.

38
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.940
So that's why coming in answer to your own e-mails seeing what you've opened is just one of the best

39
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.640
ways to see what works and if you're working in a company is going to be a pretty cool way to just sit

40
00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.760
everybody down.

41
00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:06.230
Do this exercise say hey guys open your emails let me see the emails that you've opened because I want

42
00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.720
to take in those headlines and use them for ourselves.

43
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:11.790
Here's another example.

44
00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.850
This is completely other side of the spectrum.

45
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:15.930
There's no numbers in it.

46
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.260
But again it's from this guy and he said are you there.

47
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:28.680
Dhara so I know that actually when I open the seamount not because I'd given my email in his e-mail

48
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:35.850
sign up form this is kind of an automated email but I was like oh is this how do I know this person.

49
00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.920
And he just said are you there Nera.

50
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.400
So again it's that kind of curiosity.

51
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:46.380
He addressed me personally and I opened that because I wanted to say oh is he addressing me personally

52
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.290
or you know and we really I had to open to find out.

53
00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.680
So again I had to open the e-mail to find out.

54
00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.410
And it's another way of sparking their curiosity.

55
00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.350
Just having a very casual question.

56
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.490
And the reason that he was able to address me by my name is I'd given my name in the e-mail sign up

57
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:13.150
form so that's a huge advantage of including that if you want to you can address people personally.

58
00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.140
And let's have a look at some other stuff.

59
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.570
Why do it.

60
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.910
Let's talk.

61
00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.580
Why didn't I open.

62
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.100
OK.

63
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:24.260
Well I mean there's nothing specific about it.

64
00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.030
It doesn't spark my curiosity.

65
00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.100
There's no reason for me to open the e-mail.

66
00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:35.660
I know who this company is and I'm not sure that there's anything that I want to to work with them on.

67
00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:42.530
So as well as looking at the e-mails that you've Open's it's actually great exercise and probably even

68
00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.640
more beneficial to look at the e-mails that you haven't opened.

69
00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:47.840
What did they do wrong.

70
00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.010
What could they have done better in order for you to open that e-mail.

71
00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.470
So for this one you know.

72
00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.040
Let's talk OK we'll talk about why.

73
00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.330
What benefit is going to be for me etc..

74
00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:08.450
So if they had taken one of these other approaches or I'm not sure how to do it but definitely something

75
00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:13.210
as short as no benefit no curiosity is not going to get me to open up.

76
00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:20.200
Let's keep on moving then and let's have a look at some other ones.

77
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.160
Here's a great one.

78
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.140
Linked-In experiment increase your reach by six hundred percent.

79
00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:31.220
So of course Heidi do this how do you increase your reach by 600 percent on Linked In.

80
00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.890
I want to know how to do this so as he opened the e-mail to find out.

81
00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:42.470
And actually in that e-mail he explained how to do it in a YouTube video which of course likely through.

82
00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.710
So that is a great example of an email there.

83
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.160
Is a result of benefit there.

84
00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:49.810
I want to know how to do that.

85
00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:53.260
And so obviously I open the e-mail and then I click through.

86
00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.010
So great e-mail and you could do that with anything.

87
00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.200
Instagram experiments increase your reach by 600 percent.

88
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.660
Yoga experiments increase your flexibility by 600 percent.

89
00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:11.080
So again just looking at the e-mails that you've opened is the best way to write circle and and it opens.

90
00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.450
Let's look at some other ones here.

91
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.350
Am I ok to be live.

92
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.920
Set your goals so setting goals at the start of a new year.

93
00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:23.330
It's always a tough thing to do.

94
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.130
Any help but that can be good.

95
00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:33.290
So writing emails that really appeal to people at certain times of year is a good thing to do as well

96
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.270
depending on your business.

97
00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:38.180
So keep in mind always what the customer is trying to achieve.

98
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:39.640
Different times of the year.

99
00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:42.740
So let's have a look at some other ones here.

100
00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:48.300
Here's another example of an email I didn't open last call for $10 courses.

101
00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.700
Three hours left.

102
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.970
So it's a good offer but I'm not sure what 10 like what courses are they.

103
00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:00.140
BI What is the benefit they're going to help me to achieve.

104
00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:05.400
It doesn't really spark my curiosity and so I didn't open that one there.

105
00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:07.930
Here's another one I didn't open.

106
00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:12.600
Grab any plug in our team for just 19 so you can see it was cut off.

107
00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.330
He did address me personally.

108
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:20.270
New year 2000 after offering you can see that you really want to make sure the important stuff is at

109
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:22.000
the start of the email.

110
00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:28.520
Maybe grab any theme or plug in for just $19 and then it had a limited time frame so like three days

111
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:32.680
left then that might have got me to open it up.

112
00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:40.640
Or if they said get these ten WordPress plugins for just $19 each or something like that.

113
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:46.520
Well maybe I'll be like OK what are those 10 because maybe I should get them while I can while I have

114
00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.780
the chance and while the offer is there.

115
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:54.610
So once again the best way to write email subject lines that get opened is to come into your own email.

116
00:07:54.620 --> 00:08:00.980
Look at the emails that you've Open's you can ask team members to have a look into their inboxes and

117
00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:06.020
also look at those emails you haven't opened and really understand why and avoid doing those things

118
00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:10.420
for yourself and continue to do what is obviously working on what you are opening.

119
00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:12.220
So hope you enjoy that tip.

120
00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:13.660
Go ahead and use it right now.

121
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:17.200
Write better email subject lines or buttered in your back pocket for later.
