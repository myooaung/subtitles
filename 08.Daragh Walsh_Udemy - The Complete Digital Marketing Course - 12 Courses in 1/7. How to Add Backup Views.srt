00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:05,910
In this video you're going to learn how to add an additional view to your Google Analytics.

2
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:06,910
It can't.

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:12,920
This is the best practice when you're setting up Google Analytics So you have a backup of your data.

4
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:20,960
And if we click up here on the top left corner you can see that by default you will have one view for

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,460
your Google Analytics account when you set it up.

6
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:30,500
However you're going to be adding filters segment's goals and other configurations like that to your

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,240
Google Analytics data.

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:38,540
So you want to have an unfiltered view an untouched view that you can always go back and look at just

9
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:45,330
in case anything does go wrong when you are adding those configurations on filters.

10
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:53,450
So to create an additional view you want to come into the admin section in the bottom left corner you

11
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:58,250
can see that in the view column here the options see all your views.

12
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:04,280
Right now we just have one what we're going to do is actually to rename the one view that we have right

13
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:09,670
now and we can just click into this year view settings

14
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:19,750
so as we scroll and we can see the new name and what I suggest you do here is just call it number one.

15
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:27,100
Master you now this is the view that you'll be using on a day to day basis.

16
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:34,520
So we can just say the now if we look at our views be screenings.

17
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,320
Page

18
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,350
So our master view.

19
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:46,590
Now we want to create our additional views and marketing them to create 2 new views.

20
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:53,810
We're going to call this one to test view what you can do with this test fuse.

21
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:59,350
If you're adding a filter a goal configuration you can test today in this view.

22
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:05,910
First maybe try it for a week see if all the data is being presented as you want it to be presented.

23
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,640
And then you can apply a filter or configuration to your master view.

24
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:17,700
And finally we do want that raw data view just so we always have the back of cohort data.

25
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,440
So call this number three and wrong.

26
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:28,330
The as you.

27
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,500
So there we go.

28
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:36,560
We have our three views once again are monster view is what we'll be using on a day to day basis and

29
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,660
remember a view is just a perspective.

30
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:45,470
So you get a little bit more advanced you can set up views to show the data that's only relevant say

31
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,290
to PPC manager or management in a company.

32
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:56,060
But for setup purposes you really want to use the view just to make sure that you have that raw data

33
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,480
backup.

34
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,070
So that's how you create a view.

35
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,000
It's your turn now.

36
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:04,610
Go ahead into the admin section and create a new view for your current.
