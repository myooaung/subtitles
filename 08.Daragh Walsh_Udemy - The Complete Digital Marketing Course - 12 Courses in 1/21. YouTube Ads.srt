1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,650
In this video I'm going to walk you through how to create your first ad on YouTube.

2
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:12,080
And to get started you want to head over to Edwards doc Google dot com and create your own words you

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,470
can't because Google owns YouTube.

4
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:19,640
It's inside out words where we create our ad for YouTube.

5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,200
So I've put the link to this in the description of the video.

6
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:28,690
You can click through and then create your outwards the kind of you haven't got one.

7
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:33,260
And if you do have one you can just go ahead and sign in.

8
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:40,710
Now once inside to create our advertising campaign want to click this button on campaign and then click

9
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,620
video campaign.

10
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:51,610
We can give our campaign a name so we can say test video campaign and now we need to adjust some of

11
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:54,510
the settings for our campaign here.

12
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,750
There are some options but I can walk through some of the most important things to set.

13
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,450
So daily budgets we can just put that in as take ten dollars for it daily.

14
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:11,220
But just in terms of where we want the honor to appear for this particular.

15
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:16,380
And I just wanted to appear on YouTube so I can de-select that.

16
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:20,680
So it doesn't appear on any part or web sites locations.

17
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,780
You can set the location.

18
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,510
I'm going to set it as the United States.

19
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:33,750
You can set the language that you want it to appear in English it is fine for me.

20
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,340
And then I go ahead and just click save and continue.

21
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,360
So now we create our I group.

22
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:49,770
And as I will be creating this odd were group around certain key words I'm going to name the group keywords.

23
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:56,020
It's in here now that you want to paste the your L to your YouTube video that you want to show as an

24
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:02,270
ad so you can just copy that from YouTube and paste that in.

25
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,710
We now have the option to select the format of the ad.

26
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:13,940
So I want to show it in stream out and really show over other videos that our people are watching in

27
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:14,770
YouTube.

28
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:24,210
So I can put in the URL of where I want to send people.

29
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:33,790
Now we can input our cost per view saying in a set this 15 cents an over on the right hand side here

30
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:38,780
I can get a prediction of how many views that is going to get me.

31
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:42,040
And I can raise my budget if I want to get more views.

32
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,290
It's usually good to start low and then as your campaign is live you can come back and raise this if

33
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,030
it needs to be raised.

34
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:55,750
Dan here is targeting and this is an important part of the ad campaign set up process so you can see

35
00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:01,290
by default it's going to show to any gender age parental status or household income.

36
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:10,130
So I want to narrow this down a little bit and really only show two males of my target demographic age

37
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:15,180
and show to those people who perhaps have a little bit more income.

38
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:21,690
So can a select select that in terms of narrowing down my targeting options further.

39
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:27,970
I want to do this because I want to show this video only to people who are watching content that's related

40
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,280
to certain keywords.

41
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:37,540
You can also set up and put your out insert in front of actual videos and you can paste the URL of those

42
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,060
videos right in here.

43
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,860
So your ad will show up there.

44
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:49,480
But for this group is going to set up for some certain keywords so I'm going to pop these in here.

45
00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:01,640
And if you want to find more related keywords you can click on this button down here and our words is

46
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:06,730
going to suggest some key words that you can also add to the campaign.

47
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,950
Seeking out those in if it makes sense.

48
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,680
And then out all of your key words and have them selected here.

49
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:22,390
So once you've got that tone you can go ahead and click save a group and the campaign is live.

50
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,390
So you want to.

51
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,420
And now the campaign is live.

52
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,740
So now it's your turn.

53
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:35,590
Come into our words and set up your first YouTube ad campaign following the steps in the course and

54
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:39,760
monitored success using this dashboard in it's.
