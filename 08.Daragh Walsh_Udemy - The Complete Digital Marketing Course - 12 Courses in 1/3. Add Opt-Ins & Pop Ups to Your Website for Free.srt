00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:06,200
In this video you're going to learn how to read an email sign up form to the sidebar of your web site

2
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:11,040
and also how to add a pop up form or show you how to do this for free.

3
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:17,030
And this will really help you in your goal to build up an email list and create a list of potential

4
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:20,340
people that you can sell your products or services to.

5
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:26,570
So the first step is to log into your MailChimp Keynes and then click into the list that you want to

6
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:33,350
create the son of forms for once inside then you want to click on sign up forms and it's in here that

7
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:37,400
you're going to see a couple of different types of sign of forms to create.

8
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:45,540
Now for a sign form in the sidebar of your website you can click on in bed of all forms and in sitting

9
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:50,150
here then that you can change the look and feel of your sign up form.

10
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:54,770
So for example you can change the title that appears here.

11
00:00:55,130 --> 00:01:01,340
You can also show only the required fields just the e-mail where you can show all the fields you give

12
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,810
them the option to put in the first and last name.

13
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:07,050
And you can make some other adjustments there if you want.

14
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:12,320
And then once you're ready you just need to copy and paste this code onto your Web site.

15
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:18,820
So what we need to do is paste this code onto our Web site so that when somebody signs up on our Web

16
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,380
site the information in their email address will be sent back to MailChimp here and they will be added

17
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,230
to our list.

18
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:31,150
So can just control a Control-C copy all of that.

19
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,940
Now what I'm going to show you Heidi to do is how to add this to a WordPress Web site.

20
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:40,320
But essentially the process is going to be quite similar.

21
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:45,590
And if you need to step by step guide for your type of website builder just look at the support guides

22
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,830
for your web site builder.

23
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:54,100
So what you need to do is come in to log into the back end of your Wordpress Web site.

24
00:01:54,110 --> 00:02:01,240
So I'll just do this now and then for a WordPress website you come down to appearance and widgets.

25
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:07,600
Now the layout might be slightly different depending on the team that you have for your Wordpress Web

26
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,840
site but all just walk through the steps here.

27
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,300
They're essentially going to be the same and you want to really add a widget to your side bar.

28
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:23,180
So a widget is essentially just a little feature and you can do that by adding a custom hate mail.

29
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:32,290
Then we want to copy that code paste that into the custom paged him mail widget there and click save

30
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:42,600
and then we can go ahead and do is just go open up our Web site because we want to see if this is actually

31
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,490
working.

32
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:52,470
And there we go there is our e-mail sign up form in the sidebar of our Web site now.

33
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:58,580
Now I will say sometimes it can take a couple of minutes for this to show up on your site and sometimes

34
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:02,840
what you may need to do is actually go ahead and delete your search history.

35
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:08,040
So tear your cash so that then these changes will be reflected.

36
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:14,960
So now that we have got the e-mails on a form in the sidebar of our Web site let us go back and look

37
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,310
at another type of e-mail sign up form you can include.

38
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:25,610
So we're going to come back to our list to start the process again and then we're going to come to sign

39
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:31,240
up forms and then in here we want to do subscriber pop up.

40
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,250
So we want our pop up you've probably seen them everywhere.

41
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:37,910
And so we want to put something like this on our site.

42
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:43,570
We can do that and actually can change the image here and upload that I've actually uploaded this previously

43
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,950
so you can upload an image or something similar to that.

44
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,590
You can again change where this appears on the Web site and it can give you a preview of that.

45
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,770
They'll also give you preview on mobile.

46
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:58,500
Actually if I was doing this properly I'd adjust that image.

47
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:04,210
So there's a couple of good things to check before you go ahead and you can adjust the settings.

48
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,880
Like when does this pop up show up.

49
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:12,670
For the purposes of this demonstration I'm just going to say immediately so that I can show you working

50
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,200
but you can time this after five seconds after 20 seconds.

51
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,790
They scroll to the middle of the page when they leave the page etc..

52
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:23,090
So you can just all of those things yourself.

53
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,230
And there's a lot of cool things that you can change there the font color spectra.

54
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:33,550
So now I want to view the code because again we want to put this on our Web site so that any e-mails

55
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:37,660
collected will be added to our list in Milchan.

56
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,540
So we need to copy this code.

57
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:47,050
And again we need to put this on our Web site and this will be different depending on the type of web

58
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,640
site you have maybe even the word Berstein you have.

59
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:53,200
But I'll show you how it's done with my one here.

60
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,390
So what we want to do is come to theme options.

61
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:06,130
And then I want to click after I come into perience team options come to general settings and it's in

62
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:08,980
here now that I can actually place in head or code.

63
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:15,190
This theme is great because it gives me a specific section to do just so I can just paste that in and

64
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:20,180
then I want to go and click save changes.

65
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:23,360
Now again we want to come back to our Web site to make sure that it's working.

66
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,880
You might need to make it wait a couple of minutes.

67
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,470
Go ahead and click refresh the page.

68
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:33,480
Sometimes your blog page or your home page can take quite a long time to reload.

69
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:41,130
So sometimes easier to come into a some page and you may need to click around a bit and act on that.

70
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:47,920
Now I've come into a page or blog posts and I can see this popping up immediately so I know that is

71
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:57,260
working and I can maybe go ahead and just test that I put in my email and what I'm already subscribed

72
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:57,910
to this list.

73
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,320
But you can see that it will.

74
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:05,600
You can go ahead and then what you can do is that you can go ahead sign up and what a good thing to

75
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:11,910
do is come back into your list on MailChimp to make sure that HUD has been signed up.

76
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:14,120
If you have any problems with any of the code or anything.

77
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,890
Go ahead and check out the support guides on MailChimp.

78
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:24,290
They are excellent and they have a lot of really walk True's that it will help you.

79
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:29,660
It's best if you have any problems to really check out the support guides there and they will slow to

80
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,690
support guides for different types of sites etc..

81
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:39,110
So to recap in this lecture you've learned how to build your email list faster by adding a email sign

82
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:42,770
a form to the sidebar of your web site and also a pop up form.

83
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:47,300
So come in to MailChimp get the code and put it on to your Web site.

84
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,660
Following the steps that you've learned in this video.
