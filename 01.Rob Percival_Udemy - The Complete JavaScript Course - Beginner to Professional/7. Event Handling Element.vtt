00:00.150 --> 00:00.690
Welcome back.

00:00.690 --> 00:02.610
How's your game coming along in this lesson.

00:02.610 --> 00:07.710
We're going to be adding in an event listener to the element that we're creating dynamically.

00:08.070 --> 00:13.500
So using that same div object that we've already created in the earlier lesson we're going to add a

00:13.500 --> 00:17.970
click event to that and we can do that function as well as an anonymous function.

00:17.970 --> 00:20.280
Contained within this block of code.

00:20.280 --> 00:22.710
So we want to run this block of code.

00:22.710 --> 00:24.800
So let's get our end time.

00:24.870 --> 00:27.210
We already tracked our start time.

00:27.210 --> 00:33.780
So that was set when the element was created and the end time is going to be set whenever it that element

00:33.780 --> 00:34.930
gets clicked.

00:34.950 --> 00:39.050
So it's going to give us two values to string values.

00:39.060 --> 00:39.870
And when we do date.

00:39.870 --> 00:47.760
Now what that produces this produces a UNIX timestamp in milliseconds from I believe it's January 1st

00:47.850 --> 00:49.290
1970.

00:49.290 --> 00:51.260
And on the number of milliseconds till now.

00:51.260 --> 00:52.920
So it's always going to be different.

00:52.920 --> 00:56.370
So if I do it again they see that's already incremented a little bit.

00:56.520 --> 01:02.040
There's almost a full second of incrementing here and it's going to continuously increment.

01:02.040 --> 01:03.990
So again two milliseconds.

01:03.990 --> 01:10.210
So it's always going to be a different value or almost always unless you're typing really super fast.

01:10.230 --> 01:16.810
So next we need to be able to check to see what the differences between the end time and start time.

01:16.830 --> 01:18.590
So let's create a variable for.

01:18.870 --> 01:20.230
I can just call it diff.

01:20.250 --> 01:26.730
We'll take our end time variable subtracting the div start time value.

01:26.760 --> 01:30.440
So that's the one that we set whenever the element was created.

01:30.630 --> 01:32.540
And we're going to divide it by a thousand.

01:32.640 --> 01:35.400
So we get a value within seconds.

01:35.430 --> 01:38.250
Now we can output it into the score.

01:38.250 --> 01:41.040
So we've got an element here within score.

01:41.040 --> 01:46.020
So taking that score object we can add our inner H to amount to that.

01:46.020 --> 01:48.760
And then here's where we've got our value.

01:48.760 --> 01:53.480
Second and we also want the ability to restart the game of course.

01:53.490 --> 01:56.660
So where we've hid that start button.

01:57.040 --> 01:57.540
Let's.

01:57.870 --> 02:05.700
So that start button by setting its style properties to block and we also want to remove from the container

02:05.960 --> 02:07.920
to take King that container object.

02:08.010 --> 02:12.540
We're going to remove a child and the child that we're moving is that div that we created.

02:12.540 --> 02:14.060
So I think we're ready to try that out.

02:14.100 --> 02:14.760
So save.

02:14.930 --> 02:15.600
Try it out.

02:15.600 --> 02:20.640
Wait till the element shows up and our score is not defined because we defined it a score area.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.350
So make that update and try that one more time and that's how many seconds it was clicked in.

02:25.350 --> 02:30.860
So something went wrong with our math here or we've got to get around that before we divide it by a

02:30.870 --> 02:32.760
thousand so try that one more time.

02:32.790 --> 02:37.530
Sometimes it does take a little bit of playing through just to make sure that it's functioning as needed.

02:37.530 --> 02:44.280
So we clicked it in one point zero two seconds and this time we got one point six three five seconds.

02:44.460 --> 02:49.140
So go ahead and add the click functionality into your game and you can be ready to move on to the next

02:49.140 --> 02:49.440
step.

02:49.440 --> 02:50.490
We're gonna do some improvements.
