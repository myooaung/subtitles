00:01.270 --> 00:05.890
Welcome back in I want it in this lesson add in a few different buttons here.

00:05.890 --> 00:13.390
So we wanted one for input type and button and this one is going to actually save.

00:13.630 --> 00:15.850
So given an idea of save.

00:16.300 --> 00:18.730
And then next let's do one more.

00:18.820 --> 00:20.950
And this one is going to do.

00:20.950 --> 00:21.620
Clear.

00:21.700 --> 00:26.580
So basically this will clear out our image and allow us to start again.

00:26.800 --> 00:35.230
So this one will give an idea of clear and close off.

00:35.300 --> 00:40.400
So next we also need to add some values to here so that we know what it is.

00:40.400 --> 00:44.060
So save and value.

00:44.060 --> 00:45.810
So this one is clear.

00:48.400 --> 00:49.750
So let's refresh.

00:49.780 --> 00:55.810
So there we go we've got our couple of buttons and we should start this off as black to be consistent

00:55.870 --> 01:02.210
with what's available within the color picker or we could update the value of the color picker to be

01:02.210 --> 01:05.810
black eyes or red whatever we want to do.

01:05.810 --> 01:08.540
So it's always a good idea to be consistent.

01:08.720 --> 01:15.560
So we need to add some functionality in here so we need to add an event listener to those buttons.

01:15.560 --> 01:21.440
So it's not grabbing those buttons or do the same thing here to get listeners to them.

01:23.820 --> 01:27.780
And this one is as an ID of save

01:30.950 --> 01:34.250
and we're just going to add the listener like this to it.

01:35.820 --> 01:42.690
So whenever this gets clicked then we're going to fire off the function and then whatever's in here

01:43.020 --> 01:45.150
is going to actually be what happens.

01:45.150 --> 01:49.210
So this is going to be the saving of that content.

01:49.260 --> 01:56.930
So let's first of all let's clean this up a bit and let's duplicate that.

01:56.930 --> 02:04.290
So we need one more for the clear so that Button's going to fire off the clear.

02:04.290 --> 02:06.830
So we've got save in here.

02:07.080 --> 02:09.690
And we've got clear over here.

02:10.170 --> 02:17.640
So first of all let's do save So we know that earlier we saw that we can grab

02:20.670 --> 02:22.240
the data you are L..

02:22.340 --> 02:23.730
Let's set that up.

02:23.750 --> 02:27.670
Peter you are Al and we want to do from Kansas.

02:27.850 --> 02:31.620
We want to do two data

02:34.890 --> 02:41.160
you or else so we're going to take that whole object and we're going to turn into a data Eurail And

02:41.220 --> 02:44.470
let's just make sure that we're picking that up properly.

02:44.610 --> 02:46.990
So let's add that into the con..

02:47.010 --> 02:53.540
So go back out refreshed the page and whenever we hit save and we open up the console.

02:53.580 --> 02:59.160
So there's a generated image that we generated from the canvas.

02:59.160 --> 03:05.730
So basically all of this is going to represent what we've got within the canvas as base 64.

03:05.730 --> 03:09.950
So we're ready to actually place it within our Web page if we want it to.

03:10.380 --> 03:19.700
So now let's let's add in another image so this is the image that's actually going to hold the content.

03:19.760 --> 03:21.930
So you put that down below.

03:22.520 --> 03:27.160
And this is going to be image source.

03:27.620 --> 03:29.360
So we'll give it a blank source.

03:33.600 --> 03:36.060
And I'm going to make it small so you got to give it a with

03:39.090 --> 03:41.370
of 300 pics.

03:42.690 --> 03:44.250
And give it a height

03:50.890 --> 03:56.090
so the height of 200.

03:56.270 --> 03:57.240
So there are image.

03:57.260 --> 04:04.690
And we also need to give it a name so an ID so we can identify it and this will be our holder.

04:04.730 --> 04:06.740
So now we're ready to put that.

04:06.730 --> 04:11.350
So document get element by ID.

04:11.480 --> 04:19.420
So let's put it to Holder source and we're going to equal the source to the data.

04:20.570 --> 04:23.870
So let's refresh that and see how that works out.

04:23.900 --> 04:28.030
So now let's draw something hit save is image.

04:28.340 --> 04:32.440
And if we update it if we draw something else hit save.

04:32.540 --> 04:39.990
So there's a newly created image we can open up a new tab or we can save image as.

04:40.090 --> 04:43.280
So that's how we can recreate the images that are there.

04:43.300 --> 04:48.570
And whenever we hit Save we create that brand new image from our canvas element.

04:48.610 --> 04:53.890
So the next thing that we want to do is we want to be able to clear out the canvas so no always set

04:53.890 --> 04:54.910
up this clear button.

04:54.910 --> 04:57.310
And right now it's not doing anything.

04:57.310 --> 05:04.720
So what I want you to do now is pause the video and think back to the previous last where we used clear

05:04.780 --> 05:10.680
rectangle starting at zero and zero by the height and width of the canvas.

05:10.840 --> 05:14.820
And that allows us to basically clear out the canvas.

05:14.890 --> 05:21.460
So think back to that previous lesson I want you to add in that functionality in and I'll show you the

05:21.460 --> 05:26.990
solution coming up so we know that we have CTX as our drawing object.

05:27.070 --> 05:34.960
So we know that that is in place and we saw that we use this method clear rectangle we need it in some

05:34.960 --> 05:35.860
parameters.

05:35.860 --> 05:45.520
So we need X and Y and then we also needed the canvas width and canvas height so we can add those and

05:45.520 --> 05:48.650
so canvas width and canvas height.

05:48.790 --> 05:50.890
So in case they change.

05:50.890 --> 05:56.950
So we've just got at those values in the one place so we can change the height at any time and that's

05:56.950 --> 05:59.560
all we need to do in order to clear that out.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.370
So let's try this again.

06:01.480 --> 06:10.950
Clear let's draw something and see it and notice when we save it even if we clear out our canvas and

06:10.950 --> 06:15.780
we save it again that we get that brand new newly freshly created image

06:19.490 --> 06:20.860
and save again.

06:20.860 --> 06:28.250
So this is the way that you can create images on the fly using canvas and you can also draw directly

06:28.310 --> 06:31.290
within the canvas and a whole lot more.

06:31.490 --> 06:38.070
All of this using javascript in combination with a team of five canvas element.

06:38.240 --> 06:43.130
So go ahead and take the script try it for yourself see what different updates you can make to that

06:43.130 --> 06:45.000
script to make it even better.
