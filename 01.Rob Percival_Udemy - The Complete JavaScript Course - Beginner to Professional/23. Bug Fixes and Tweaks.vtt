00:00.760 --> 00:08.110
Welcome back and in the previous lesson we set up the ability to for the user to actually guess some

00:08.110 --> 00:13.870
values and then we could detect if they were right or wrong and then we still need to do some fine tuning

00:13.870 --> 00:17.010
where we need to clean up the array and so on.

00:17.140 --> 00:20.620
So that's something that usually I do last.

00:20.710 --> 00:25.930
So at the end of the day whenever we're resetting and we're restarting we've got to clear out all of

00:25.930 --> 00:28.010
those variables that we've been setting.

00:28.180 --> 00:32.620
So that should all divert back to the original values.

00:32.620 --> 00:35.150
So we need to clear out the arrays and so on.

00:35.260 --> 00:42.400
So we're well worry about that at the end of our fine tuning of the application.

00:42.560 --> 00:47.580
So for now our next step is to be able to show the user what they've guessed.

00:47.600 --> 00:55.660
We've created a div called Guess And now let's add some divs in here for the user to be able to see

00:55.870 --> 00:57.750
what they've actually guessed.

00:57.760 --> 01:04.900
So this has to happen on the old guests within the old guest function and we can put it before or after

01:04.900 --> 01:10.030
we add in that item into the array so it doesn't actually matter the order.

01:10.330 --> 01:14.360
So first of all let's create a variable.

01:14.380 --> 01:21.260
So this is going to be my div that I'm going to create Agas call it D for now and will do document.

01:21.300 --> 01:24.100
Do do remember earlier how we looked at hand.

01:24.130 --> 01:27.340
We saw how we can create an element dynamically.

01:27.460 --> 01:32.290
So that's what we're going to do now we're going to create a dynamic Dev on the fly.

01:32.410 --> 01:36.040
So now we're ready to start working with that element.

01:36.040 --> 01:38.410
So we've created that div and

01:41.240 --> 01:47.480
let's add in a class name so we can do div and let's do a class name.

01:47.480 --> 01:54.950
So this was this is our way of adding in the class so that we can add in that same class name that we've

01:55.220 --> 01:56.360
represented there.

01:56.570 --> 02:03.120
So we're going to actually add in whatever the user guest.

02:03.170 --> 02:06.270
And so we've got that value sitting in G.

02:06.320 --> 02:09.910
So we know that we can add the class name that format.

02:10.010 --> 02:16.310
The next thing that we need to do is we need to make it clickable so we want to have an on click function

02:16.400 --> 02:22.880
to fire off and we'll just do this as an anonymous function within this function itself.

02:23.120 --> 02:29.900
So set up the On Click on these elements that word on the element that we're creating and the next thing

02:29.900 --> 02:36.640
that we want to do is we want to remove that element if the guess was wrong.

02:36.800 --> 02:45.030
So basically what that means is that we need to actually know the index value in order to remove it.

02:47.670 --> 02:54.020
So let's add in another attribute so we're going to add in an attribute we're going to put it under

02:54.030 --> 03:02.080
data set and we're going to just add in an attribute called V and the value of v will be the length

03:02.080 --> 03:03.950
of the array.

03:04.010 --> 03:06.120
So we know that if our array.

03:06.140 --> 03:10.180
Currently our guess is zero we haven't pushed anything into their array yet.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.950
So the value of v will be zero.

03:13.100 --> 03:17.780
And if we've got one item in the array when we're coming in and we're building this out then this is

03:17.780 --> 03:21.250
going to be a value of 1 and so on and so on.

03:21.260 --> 03:26.050
So we know that we can actually set up and add in that value.

03:26.090 --> 03:30.500
So now we know which item what the index value is within the array.

03:30.590 --> 03:37.070
And the next object objective is to actually get that value and be able to make use of that.

03:37.340 --> 03:42.780
So let's grab that value and I'm going to just call it I remove.

03:42.780 --> 03:54.250
So this is the value that we want it to remove out of our array and we're getting the index value that

03:54.250 --> 04:03.600
we want to remove it and we need to use the get attribute so event and we're going to use them to target

04:04.800 --> 04:10.940
and get attribute and the attribute that we're going to grab is going to be data dush.

04:13.980 --> 04:20.370
And for now let's just console log this out just to make sure that we're doing everything properly because

04:20.370 --> 04:24.260
we've done quite a bit of work and we haven't actually tried it out yet.

04:24.480 --> 04:29.020
And also I wanted to still add in the ability to append.

04:29.040 --> 04:29.570
So let's

04:32.580 --> 04:36.450
let's guess into our global variables.

04:36.450 --> 04:38.880
We could also add it there as well.

04:39.030 --> 04:41.900
But for now let's just added it globally.

04:42.030 --> 04:45.840
So I can use Guess and I can append that child there.

04:45.990 --> 04:53.320
So let's do guess and append that newly created element.

04:53.490 --> 05:03.000
So we have to do is use the append child method and then within here we need to specify D because this

05:03.000 --> 05:05.490
is the element that we created and we want to append.

05:05.790 --> 05:07.400
So now let's try it out.

05:07.410 --> 05:09.760
So no we've added quite a lot of stuff here.

05:09.870 --> 05:13.630
And this was all in the ability to make those guesses.

05:13.650 --> 05:14.660
So let's try it out.

05:18.410 --> 05:23.360
And there's actually one thing that's missing and this is the same thing that happened before where

05:23.360 --> 05:26.830
we're not actually able to see it because we don't have any contents in there.

05:26.900 --> 05:33.290
So let's go ahead and create a box and this one we're going to copy some of the parameters from here

05:33.560 --> 05:36.520
and this time we're going to make it a little bit quite a bit smaller.

05:36.590 --> 05:39.240
So make it 100 by 100.

05:42.100 --> 05:48.750
And also I wanted to add in that class that we've just created.

05:48.760 --> 05:51.670
So that was baulks so that we can actually see it.

05:51.670 --> 05:57.280
So I don't think that we actually need to know the class of what we're passing in.

05:57.280 --> 05:58.620
So let's try this again.

05:58.630 --> 06:04.140
Let's refresh let's start and this time we're actually able to create those classes.

06:04.300 --> 06:09.210
And we also have to make those inline inline blocks as well.

06:09.790 --> 06:11.390
So it falls in line.

06:11.620 --> 06:15.940
And the only thing that's actually missing is we're not actually adding in the right color backgrounds

06:16.210 --> 06:22.600
so we're adding in all of these guesses but we don't actually see that the colors are being added in

06:22.600 --> 06:23.450
there either.

06:23.470 --> 06:29.950
So we have a few options we could add them as a text notes we could add in some text in there as well.

06:29.950 --> 06:35.520
And then we can append that text to the D element that we created.

06:36.440 --> 06:43.910
So what I want you to do now pause the video and add in the style a background color and use the value

06:44.000 --> 06:46.900
of the class name from before.

06:46.910 --> 06:50.020
So go ahead and add that in and I'll show you the solution coming up.

06:53.100 --> 06:56.900
So at this point when we're creating that element we've got quite a few options.

06:56.910 --> 07:02.080
We can do in style we can add in text into it if we need to.

07:02.100 --> 07:07.650
So I'm going to just do background color so that we have these nice colorful boxes and the background

07:07.650 --> 07:08.140
color.

07:08.160 --> 07:12.560
We already have it from the class name that we've grabbed from the elements up there.

07:12.570 --> 07:19.020
So now if we go out and if we Reiff we start it we can see that we're able to add in all of the colors

07:19.020 --> 07:19.780
properly.

07:19.920 --> 07:23.060
And once we hit 4 then we actually should stop.

07:23.100 --> 07:25.640
And we're not able to add in any additional ones.

07:25.680 --> 07:31.630
So essentially the game play is over at this time so we need to reset at this time.

07:31.800 --> 07:33.100
So we see that.

07:33.210 --> 07:36.570
Let's try this one more time and hit.

07:36.990 --> 07:41.250
So we've got green red red green.

07:41.400 --> 07:43.100
And so we see that we are correct.

07:43.110 --> 07:44.610
So we've got that pattern there.

07:44.610 --> 07:50.130
We're able to see the colors that we've selected and make use of those.

07:50.140 --> 07:55.830
So the next thing that I want to do is I actually want to have the ability to remove those elements

07:56.380 --> 08:05.020
and when we added in this remove if we opened up the developer console so got that one over and over

08:05.140 --> 08:05.860
here.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.450
So opening that up.

08:08.460 --> 08:16.380
Now when I click those we can see that those are in line with our index values that we have within our

08:16.380 --> 08:17.110
array.

08:17.190 --> 08:24.810
So we know that we can go back into the code and we can't simply remove out those values so we can splice

08:24.810 --> 08:29.230
it out from our array by using that index value.

08:29.370 --> 08:35.490
So we want you to pause the video and do that where whenever we're clicking these to move it out of

08:35.490 --> 08:41.660
the array and then the second part is that we're going to have to actually remove this element.

08:41.670 --> 08:43.270
So there's two parts to this.

08:43.290 --> 08:44.710
So pause the video.

08:44.850 --> 08:51.960
I remove it from the array and then also remove it from from the display area.

08:51.960 --> 08:56.000
So those are the two parts and I'll show you the solution coming up.

08:56.160 --> 08:59.540
So the solution to it is to remove it out of the array.

08:59.550 --> 09:06.840
We can use splice and splice gives us the ability to remove it from with we have the index value we

09:06.840 --> 09:10.150
can have a starting point and we can remove a number of elements.

09:10.260 --> 09:13.210
So we'll simply remove it from that array.

09:13.350 --> 09:16.250
So now when we click it it's removed out of the array.

09:16.530 --> 09:22.990
And the second part of the challenge was that we actually want to remove that entire element.

09:23.010 --> 09:29.940
So there is a really nice trick here in order to do that so we can select itself and then we go over

09:29.940 --> 09:31.660
to the parent.

09:32.130 --> 09:38.710
So we select the parent node and then we try our spark and we do remove child.

09:38.850 --> 09:46.410
So we use the remove child method from the parent node and then within here we need to specify that

09:46.470 --> 09:47.170
object.

09:47.370 --> 09:50.150
So we can use that target once again.

09:50.160 --> 09:54.070
So let's try that 8 and click start.

09:54.270 --> 09:59.910
So you've got red red red and now when I click those I can simply remove those out.

10:00.230 --> 10:05.170
So I see that now at this point and I'm not going actually getting to 4.

10:05.280 --> 10:10.020
So we see that until I get to 4.

10:10.030 --> 10:16.730
It doesn't actually update my guess and we still need to take care of a few bugs because we shouldn't

10:16.730 --> 10:20.910
be able to continuously add in to that object.

10:21.290 --> 10:27.070
So that's the next challenge is to find out where this application has bugs.

10:27.080 --> 10:30.410
So we're going to have some bug fixing and sort that out.

10:30.410 --> 10:33.040
So that's the next part of this challenge.

10:33.050 --> 10:39.290
So what are you to do now is positivity to run the application and try to identify some of the bugs

10:39.290 --> 10:41.390
that we're having within this application.

10:42.510 --> 10:49.140
So one of the main ones is that we seem to be able to continuously click here and we need a way to shut

10:49.140 --> 10:49.940
that off.

10:50.190 --> 10:56.970
So one of the best ways that usually I like to do is I like to just a global variable and I call it

10:56.970 --> 11:00.820
something like game play and I'll set it to false.

11:01.050 --> 11:05.820
So basically if this is false then I can't do anything else.

11:05.850 --> 11:10.860
So even if I'm clicking on it I don't want any of this to happen.

11:10.860 --> 11:15.130
So this is where I can add in a condition and I can just say gameplay.

11:15.450 --> 11:17.160
So if gameplay.

11:17.250 --> 11:23.910
So if it's true then it will run through all of this and if it's not true then we're simply going to

11:23.910 --> 11:29.300
ignore all of this functionality and we're not going to actually do any anything with it.

11:29.430 --> 11:32.700
So basically all that means is the game is over.

11:32.700 --> 11:35.310
So we don't need to do anything with it.

11:35.520 --> 11:39.500
So we need a way to set the gameplay to true.

11:39.570 --> 11:42.570
And we can do that whenever we start.

11:42.630 --> 11:45.180
So the start we're going to set it to true.

11:45.420 --> 11:51.640
And now we have a controller where we can switch the game play on and off.

11:51.750 --> 11:59.370
So we know that once we hit the maximum number and we're actually doing our condition where we're seeing

11:59.800 --> 12:03.780
where the lengths are equal This is where we need to shut our game play off.

12:03.780 --> 12:06.890
So we need to go back and shut this off to false.

12:06.900 --> 12:13.710
So basically the user can't add anything else into the game play so it's not the other thing that we

12:13.710 --> 12:20.550
noticed as well is we need to reset some of this stuff because when we hit start we're building out

12:20.850 --> 12:23.470
this inner h tim l of C buttons.

12:23.550 --> 12:25.320
So we need to clear that out.

12:25.530 --> 12:29.470
So let's go ahead and let's clear out the inner east.

12:31.640 --> 12:36.200
And it's actually not the inner H.M.S. buttons that we need to clear out because we don't need to really

12:36.200 --> 12:37.390
clear those buttons.

12:37.640 --> 12:41.430
All we're doing here is we're constantly overwriting.

12:41.480 --> 12:44.830
So the other one is we need to clear out the arrays.

12:44.870 --> 12:52.100
So we've got the two arrays and we need to simply set those arrays to be blank and to set arrays to

12:52.100 --> 12:56.100
be blank you just call it to a blank array value.

12:56.390 --> 13:01.410
So just as we initialize them we can clear those and set them to be blank.

13:01.820 --> 13:06.570
So the other one that we need to do is we actually have to clear out all of these guesses.

13:06.590 --> 13:12.910
So this is all contained within that one element where we're simply.

13:13.010 --> 13:15.260
So that was my guess.

13:15.320 --> 13:18.540
So we can go over to here and we can clear out.

13:18.560 --> 13:19.050
Yes.

13:19.070 --> 13:25.060
By doing inner h him l and equaling that to just blank.

13:25.820 --> 13:28.330
So now let's do one more run of this.

13:28.370 --> 13:30.940
And just to see if things are working properly.

13:30.950 --> 13:37.350
So you've got red green yellow yellow so we get.

13:37.360 --> 13:38.390
You are correct.

13:38.650 --> 13:43.730
And I can't actually click anything else and it looks like that was working.

13:43.780 --> 13:48.490
So try it one more time and this time we're going to guess wrong where and remove out some of these

13:48.490 --> 13:53.110
items from the array and we'll just keep trying to guess.

13:53.150 --> 13:58.990
So what's happened here is that we're actually stopping the game play for some reason but we haven't

13:58.990 --> 14:07.520
guessed them all out and that's because your guess red green yellow yellow and the correct order was

14:07.550 --> 14:13.730
blue green blue green but we're only displaying so we can still click those off.

14:13.730 --> 14:16.400
So that is still functioning and

14:19.390 --> 14:27.130
that's not working right either so we need to actually prevent the ability from clicking those if the

14:27.240 --> 14:31.650
gameplay is has been removed so we still have these on clicks here.

14:31.660 --> 14:36.820
So this is another one that we have to make sure that the game play is active.

14:37.180 --> 14:41.830
So the on click game play is active before we try to remove anything out.

14:41.830 --> 14:46.900
So one more time let's go ahead and try to try to finish this one off.

14:47.050 --> 14:49.780
So now let's play around with this.

14:49.780 --> 14:52.060
We're going to add in different ones.

14:52.060 --> 14:54.160
We don't seem to be able to click off.

14:54.370 --> 14:58.090
And we see that your guess was red blue green yellow.

14:58.150 --> 14:59.080
That's correct.

14:59.080 --> 15:06.070
So that turned out right and the correct order was red yellow green red and we can't do anything else.

15:06.070 --> 15:07.840
So all we can do is start it.

15:07.840 --> 15:10.160
We have to still clear out that message there.

15:10.270 --> 15:13.620
So we need to clear out the contents of output

15:17.420 --> 15:21.550
so message and output we need to clear out the contents of both of them.

15:21.610 --> 15:27.120
We're actually putting in our guess.

15:27.210 --> 15:32.710
So when we hit start let's do message.

15:32.840 --> 15:40.310
And in our h to him out and we'll just say game started.

15:40.830 --> 15:46.850
So now one more time let's run through this and see if we need to make any additional tweaks so I've

15:46.860 --> 15:50.360
got blue yellow yellow yellow.

15:50.400 --> 15:51.780
So we were correct.

15:52.200 --> 15:55.080
So that's two incorrect.

15:55.110 --> 15:58.490
So your guess was red green blue green.

15:58.650 --> 15:59.060
Correct.

15:59.060 --> 16:00.870
Was Red Green green yellow.

16:00.930 --> 16:01.940
So we can't do anything.

16:01.950 --> 16:05.100
And when we hit start then we see game has started.

16:05.250 --> 16:10.470
So everything is working properly and we've completed all of our bug fixes.

16:10.470 --> 16:16.170
So now it's up to you to take what we've learned within the past few lessons and apply it to your own

16:16.170 --> 16:22.980
version of this game make some updates add in some additional elements into the array and also try out

16:22.980 --> 16:24.890
different functionality.

16:24.960 --> 16:30.780
You can create some scoring as well within the game so try to build out your own version of the scheme

16:31.020 --> 16:37.140
make some improvements to what we've gone through and make some updates and adjustments as needed.
