00:01.710 --> 00:07.200
As we saw before there's a number of ways to do things in javascript and this time.

00:07.230 --> 00:13.910
What I want to do is I want to be able to remove value from the from the array.

00:13.920 --> 00:20.170
Basically I want to have a button that says remove so remove that item completely out of the array.

00:20.190 --> 00:25.710
So what we need for this is we need to actually know where this is within the array.

00:25.740 --> 00:32.100
So whatever the value of the ID is with an array so that we can click that and we're using these IDs

00:32.190 --> 00:35.270
as unique values so we can remove them out.

00:35.430 --> 00:40.250
So now that what's actually going to happen is because I've got multiples of these items in here.

00:40.380 --> 00:44.730
If I click one of these removes that should remove out all of them because we're going to be using it

00:44.730 --> 00:50.850
by id and then these two as well so that give us the ability to kind of clean this up and then have

00:50.850 --> 00:52.980
our output working as it should.

00:52.980 --> 00:58.620
So right now because of previously when we weren't counting the quantity that's where we ended up with

00:58.620 --> 01:01.670
this kind of messy duplication here.

01:01.800 --> 01:03.660
So let's clean that up in this lesson.

01:03.660 --> 01:10.920
And what I want to do is within the options I want to add the ability to simply remove out of value

01:10.920 --> 01:11.650
there.

01:11.670 --> 01:19.970
So we need a container for it and I'm going to use a span so class and will give it a class of remove

01:21.440 --> 01:28.810
and also give it to a class of BT and so we've got our Remove button and I'm going to turn this into

01:28.870 --> 01:30.840
more of a button format with styling.

01:31.120 --> 01:38.350
And I get an add on click attribute and whenever it gets clicked it's going to fire off the function

01:38.440 --> 01:44.000
remove and this function we need to pass some type of value to it.

01:44.200 --> 01:48.980
We can of course pick up the idea if we traverse through the DOM.

01:49.030 --> 01:55.810
But for this instance I think it's just easier just to add this in as a value of the ID that we can

01:55.810 --> 01:57.040
pass.

01:57.040 --> 02:01.250
So let's let's just do that we're going to parse it as an argument here.

02:01.540 --> 02:10.260
So the ID value just passed that through and then X and then close off spanne and then I'm going to

02:10.260 --> 02:22.590
go up to my CSX and I'm going to do some quick updates here so I need to use this and also for Beati

02:22.590 --> 02:29.430
And so you get a button look to it and then I'm going to update the colors so we don't need green and

02:29.490 --> 02:32.430
I can do so for remove.

02:32.520 --> 02:38.000
I'll just do a background color of red.

02:38.090 --> 02:39.630
So let's see how that looks.

02:39.650 --> 02:40.720
So we refresh it.

02:40.760 --> 02:42.380
So there's our remove buttons.

02:42.440 --> 02:48.260
So we click it it's firing off and it's removing and remove is not defined yet.

02:48.260 --> 02:55.970
So that's the next step is to actually pick up and remove those items from our shopping cart.

02:56.420 --> 02:58.910
So we are passing through the ID.

02:58.910 --> 03:09.560
So what I want you to do now is pause the video and using splice from the array remove out a that have

03:09.620 --> 03:14.000
the ID that has been passed in to the function remove.

03:14.030 --> 03:16.480
And I'll show you the solution coming up.

03:16.490 --> 03:24.600
And don't forget as well that you need to update those local storage as well.

03:24.670 --> 03:26.960
And you also need to update.

03:27.610 --> 03:30.350
You need to output the new values of the cart.

03:30.520 --> 03:36.960
So you do need to run output current and you need to add that setting that item within the local storage.

03:37.060 --> 03:42.820
Which means as well that you need to string ify whatever value you've currently got in the shopping

03:42.820 --> 03:43.280
cart.

03:44.100 --> 03:50.270
So take it out take a moment pause the video open up your editor and make that update and I'll show

03:50.270 --> 03:52.010
you the solution coming up.

03:52.500 --> 03:55.600
So we know that we need to have a function called remove.

03:55.680 --> 04:01.810
We're passing through the ID of the item we want to remove from a shopping cart.

04:01.860 --> 04:07.800
So that's just being passed in there the next thing that we know we needs to actually loop through our

04:08.010 --> 04:17.920
shopping cart in order to be able to find which items which items to remove so I can copy some of that

04:17.950 --> 04:19.270
code that I had over there.

04:19.270 --> 04:20.880
Just make it look a little bit better.

04:20.880 --> 04:24.820
Clean that up and we don't actually need this part.

04:24.820 --> 04:26.950
So I got to just have shopping cart.

04:27.280 --> 04:36.580
So next thing that we need to do is we want to check to see if the value of this current shopping carts.

04:36.590 --> 04:47.710
So that's if the ID is equal to ID to equal signs so see if they're equal and if they are then we know

04:47.710 --> 04:54.730
we found the one that we need to remove So let's remove that's let's do variable R.E.M. So this is just

04:54.760 --> 04:56.960
a placeholder shopping cart.

04:57.010 --> 05:06.630
Is the array we want to use the array method splice which allows us to get a value add an index value.

05:06.850 --> 05:14.500
And so again one of the disadvantages of using for each we don't have an index of value associated with

05:14.500 --> 05:15.080
it.

05:15.100 --> 05:22.330
So I'm actually going to update this and I'm going to use the for loop because that will give us our

05:22.330 --> 05:34.470
index value and let's do X equals zero and we're going to loop while x is a sharp current length.

05:34.540 --> 05:37.060
X is less than Shakara length.

05:37.180 --> 05:44.510
And then let's increment X so that that will clean that up and that will actually give us a value of

05:44.630 --> 05:46.820
our index.

05:46.940 --> 05:51.340
So that's all of course we need to update this as well.

05:51.350 --> 06:01.700
So this is no longer that it should be x dot ID so that we need to splice it at index X and we need

06:01.700 --> 06:09.440
to replace one value and let's console log this just to make sure that we're grabbing the right value.

06:10.640 --> 06:14.970
And let's try it.

06:14.980 --> 06:19.070
So now when I click out this we see that we're actually removing it.

06:19.180 --> 06:24.790
And if I refresh it then we still got it because we've still got it within the session storage but we're

06:24.790 --> 06:32.020
actually able to remove out those values we can see that we're removing out both that have the ID 3.

06:32.080 --> 06:34.760
So those are both getting removed out.

06:35.020 --> 06:39.940
We're also removing out that one so that once we're able to remove that one out.

06:40.150 --> 06:44.140
So we're able to splice these values out of our shopping cart.

06:45.560 --> 06:55.700
So now next thing to do is to actually to update our storage or local storage.

06:55.970 --> 07:03.650
And this is the same thing that we did up here where we need to just local storage set item of that

07:03.650 --> 07:04.780
shopping cart.

07:05.060 --> 07:10.130
So now that we've removed it we've done or update we just need to take that new value of shopping cart

07:10.190 --> 07:11.450
and save that.

07:11.630 --> 07:20.040
And then lastly let's run output carts so we can rebuild our cart so we can represent it visually.

07:20.360 --> 07:20.870
So there we go.

07:20.880 --> 07:23.030
So let's try this again.

07:23.110 --> 07:28.850
And now whenever I remove them we see that we're actually removing from the shopping cart and when I

07:28.850 --> 07:36.070
add them back in they're going to add according to quantity.

07:36.150 --> 07:41.620
So we're starting out one and we're increasing the quantity and we're doing whatever the prices.

07:41.850 --> 07:47.010
And that's another thing I just notice that we're not actually putting the cost of it.

07:47.040 --> 07:49.770
So that's another thing that we need to output with.

07:49.860 --> 07:56.220
Whenever we're building it that we need to have a cost that we're expecting to charge and we do have

07:56.470 --> 08:00.290
that value here so let's output it.

08:00.330 --> 08:06.390
So we've got our image we've got our details and we've got our shopping cart.

08:06.390 --> 08:09.390
And so just under there let's add in the cost

08:13.570 --> 08:22.310
and now we know that we can use that money function to actually output it in money format.

08:22.340 --> 08:26.840
So let's do that let's add that in and let's refresh the page so there we go.

08:26.840 --> 08:32.640
So we've got the cost and we don't need that other dollar sign because are doing that within the function.

08:32.660 --> 08:36.500
So there we go so we've got all of those costs are there as well.

08:36.560 --> 08:42.720
And this is another thing that because I've updated the cost so now it's gone 2 cents.

08:42.740 --> 08:49.430
So if I want to make ad dollars I've got to add in a few extra zeroes so that now that my format is

08:49.430 --> 08:51.890
this one I refresh.

08:51.890 --> 08:54.270
So now it's proper once again.

08:54.590 --> 08:58.190
So we can see that we're updating these values.

08:58.460 --> 09:04.240
And I still need to make an update in the cart.

09:04.450 --> 09:08.940
So this way it's where we're counting cents instead of counting dollars.

09:09.040 --> 09:12.130
And I do need to remove that because that was from before.

09:12.130 --> 09:18.550
So again whatever was in that storage gets stored and then that's why we need to clean that up all the

09:18.550 --> 09:19.050
time.

09:20.610 --> 09:24.400
So what I want you to do now is pause the video.

09:24.450 --> 09:29.250
Open up your editor and build it complete out that shopping cart.

09:29.250 --> 09:31.010
You can also make it look a lot better.

09:31.010 --> 09:34.800
I know I've been running through really quick and I haven't done a lot of the styling.

09:34.950 --> 09:42.120
And you can also add in additional items and information for each item as well to be displayed out here

09:42.390 --> 09:44.510
so you can add in images.

09:44.760 --> 09:53.010
You can update the details and and more as much as you want within your output here.

09:53.100 --> 10:02.210
So go ahead and try that eight's and update the shopping cart to accommodate more details from your

10:02.210 --> 10:05.810
javascript object.

10:05.970 --> 10:12.690
And additionally because we've built the out to be dynamic we can also take the quantities and we can

10:12.720 --> 10:19.020
update those as well so it doesn't necessarily mean that we're updating by one we could update those

10:19.020 --> 10:25.290
quantities by any number and we could have an input field here that has a quantity instead of one it

10:25.290 --> 10:27.100
could be whatever number.

10:27.210 --> 10:34.230
So you can go out and you can add that in as well and then picking up the value quantity of that input

10:34.230 --> 10:35.020
field.

10:35.340 --> 10:44.480
So go ahead and try that out and make some updates to the shopping cart to improve its functionality.
