00:00.820 --> 00:04.840
Welcome back in in this lesson we're going to look at most events.

00:04.870 --> 00:10.690
So we saw earlier that we had the click event where we could click a particular element we added the

00:10.690 --> 00:16.690
On Click event and we could fire off a bunch of functions and do different things as the user interacts

00:16.930 --> 00:18.160
with that click event.

00:18.160 --> 00:23.580
So there's also mouse events and we saw also within the dorm there's quite a lot of them.

00:23.590 --> 00:29.440
So what I've done is I've set up an image I have gone over to placeholder dot com and their Web site

00:29.530 --> 00:37.150
that provides basic placeholder images that you can use when you're developing your web site and you

00:37.150 --> 00:39.980
don't have any images on hand that you want to make use of.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.820
You can update the text.

00:41.890 --> 00:44.780
You can update the color the size level.

00:44.800 --> 00:46.540
Bunch of options here.

00:46.540 --> 00:52.660
So what I've done is I've simply used placeholder dot com.

00:52.680 --> 00:54.910
I've set the dimensions of the image.

00:54.930 --> 01:02.460
I've set the background color I've set the font color and I've added in some information for the text.

01:02.460 --> 01:06.690
So basically at the end of the day we're outputting this image.

01:06.690 --> 01:11.550
So what I want to do is actually want to add mouseover to this image.

01:11.580 --> 01:16.380
I want something to happen whenever the user hovers their mouse over that image.

01:16.410 --> 01:22.230
So this one is called on mouse over and I'm going to do it as an attribute.

01:22.650 --> 01:29.520
So we know that it's going to work the same way as the On Click event where you've got and that's should

01:29.520 --> 01:31.920
be and so on mouse over.

01:31.920 --> 01:35.800
So enter in the function that you want to trigger off.

01:35.970 --> 01:45.430
So we'll just call it Change change I m g which is what we're going to do and we're going to use this.

01:45.470 --> 01:51.950
So we're going to pass over the entire element object so that we know that we can grab the source of

01:51.950 --> 01:59.570
this image and really quickly change the source just as we did changing the inner text and so on with

01:59.600 --> 02:01.990
the other ones we want to do the same thing.

02:02.270 --> 02:07.700
And we also want the user to be able to switch off when they leave.

02:07.700 --> 02:09.440
So I wanna show you that as well.

02:09.440 --> 02:11.690
So now let's set up our function.

02:11.690 --> 02:20.360
So we've going to create a function called c i m g and we're passing the value of this through there

02:20.360 --> 02:21.920
so I'm going to just use t.

02:22.070 --> 02:26.240
You can use any variable you want this just to hold that value.

02:26.570 --> 02:34.990
So what I want to do is I want to first of all let's put the value into this the wrapper.

02:35.030 --> 02:36.160
So we can do that.

02:36.240 --> 02:48.240
Get documents get element by id and we're going to grab that element and let's use inner HMO.

02:48.470 --> 02:51.890
And so how do we get the source value.

02:52.070 --> 03:01.630
So remember before when we use this we get all of that that element as an object represented as t.

03:01.670 --> 03:06.490
So we know that this element has a source attribute.

03:06.590 --> 03:13.890
So just as we got the ID just as we got information about elements before we can do the same things

03:13.910 --> 03:16.010
we can do to source.

03:16.490 --> 03:19.580
And let's try this out first so refreshed.

03:19.700 --> 03:27.260
And now when we hover over it we get the image you are l the image source being represented in there.

03:27.360 --> 03:29.850
So that's exactly what we want to happen.

03:29.870 --> 03:39.020
So next the next thing that I want to do is I want to I want to create a function that will pass a message.

03:39.020 --> 03:45.830
So we're just going to use them as the argument there and instead of having that over here I want to

03:45.830 --> 03:47.070
simply do it here.

03:47.090 --> 03:51.120
And instead of that I want to just put.

03:51.440 --> 04:00.140
So basically now I can use functions a little bit smarter clean up my code a bit and I can do to source

04:00.440 --> 04:06.350
and pass it as a message and then this message is actually going to update over here.

04:06.350 --> 04:08.320
So the same thing that we already have.

04:08.660 --> 04:13.410
So what I also want to do is I want to change the source.

04:13.940 --> 04:19.980
So remember how previously we could change the value of the button.

04:20.300 --> 04:22.670
So how do you think we could change the source.

04:22.670 --> 04:31.940
So what I want to do is I want to change the source to where you to use the same placeholder but we're

04:31.940 --> 04:34.580
going to have different background color.

04:34.700 --> 04:37.220
So update the background color so maybe

04:40.620 --> 04:42.650
and also get the text.

04:42.660 --> 04:45.200
So I want the text to say image too.

04:45.210 --> 04:49.510
So I want basically this image now to be represented there.

04:49.530 --> 04:58.410
So pause the video and open up your editor and use on mouse over to change the image when the user hovers

04:58.410 --> 04:59.040
over it.

05:00.270 --> 05:02.210
And so you how to do that.

05:02.220 --> 05:10.450
So in order to change the image we already have the source there so we have access to the source so

05:10.450 --> 05:14.290
we can change that image source really easily like that.

05:14.290 --> 05:16.390
So let's go out and refresh our page.

05:16.460 --> 05:22.150
And now whenever we hover over it now we've got our brand new image and you see the next time that we

05:22.150 --> 05:23.120
go over it.

05:23.140 --> 05:27.240
So the first time we go over it whereas we've swapped it to this value.

05:27.400 --> 05:31.470
And now when I go over it again we're actually grabbing the next value.

05:31.660 --> 05:40.420
So what I want to happen is when the user moves his mouse out I want to replace it with the original

05:40.480 --> 05:41.440
image.

05:41.440 --> 05:42.960
So let me show you how to do that.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.180
So this one is on mouse.

05:46.180 --> 05:52.080
So you see we've got a few options mouse down mouse move mouse mouse up mouse wheel.

05:52.150 --> 05:57.300
We've got a number of options to choose from and the one that I want to use on mouse.

05:57.320 --> 06:03.200
I would and I want to use that as another function so we're going to be back.

06:03.250 --> 06:04.290
I MGE.

06:04.300 --> 06:09.460
So basically we're sending the image back to what it originally was.

06:09.460 --> 06:12.050
So we've got a number of choices here.

06:12.160 --> 06:20.620
We could set a global variable and have that variable so we could set something like this where we've

06:20.620 --> 06:27.240
got variable and in case we had the same functionality on a number of images.

06:27.250 --> 06:38.590
So this one is just maybe image holder and we'll put we'll add value there.

06:38.590 --> 06:40.180
And we're also going to overwrite it.

06:40.180 --> 06:46.230
So just in case we start out and we don't have a default value we should have one in there.

06:46.420 --> 06:53.280
So we know that what we can do here is we can simply update our AMG holder.

06:53.350 --> 06:56.950
So maybe our default should be 5 or something like that.

06:56.980 --> 07:03.840
So update am Holder to be this path to the source.

07:03.900 --> 07:09.490
So now when we create our new function whenever we're coming back in.

07:09.630 --> 07:13.770
And we're swapping it back.

07:13.860 --> 07:17.570
So that's the EMG function.

07:18.210 --> 07:20.720
Let's take the value of t.

07:20.730 --> 07:23.180
So the this entire object.

07:23.340 --> 07:31.720
And now all we need to do is swap the source and we can swap the source out with AMG holder.

07:32.420 --> 07:33.290
So that's it.

07:33.360 --> 07:35.080
So that's all we have to do.

07:35.370 --> 07:38.310
So let's try this and refresh the page.

07:38.310 --> 07:43.110
So now what I want and I leave I get back to my original image.

07:43.110 --> 07:52.080
So no point over using this one that I've had for default I'm just using the value here that I'm originally

07:52.290 --> 07:54.680
sending as the source and so on.

07:54.780 --> 08:01.620
And we could even do even more where if we wanted to we could set the source of this image.

08:01.860 --> 08:07.860
So whenever the page loads so that we don't have a blank image there we can set the source whatever

08:07.860 --> 08:09.670
the holder image is.

08:09.990 --> 08:18.660
So let's let's do that and want you to pause the video and think about what we did before where we initiated

08:18.660 --> 08:21.520
a function where we could grab the source.

08:21.540 --> 08:31.050
So I want you to to update the source when the page loads when the when the page loads update the source

08:31.140 --> 08:35.090
of the image going by the ID I am g.

08:35.300 --> 08:38.390
Swap.

08:38.550 --> 08:48.930
So we had an opportunity to try that out and this is where we can use window on load and the window

08:48.930 --> 08:50.080
onload function.

08:50.100 --> 08:53.970
We could fire that off and we don't actually even need to have a function.

08:53.970 --> 08:56.840
We can just do a function in here.

08:57.240 --> 09:00.570
So an anonymous function.

09:01.190 --> 09:12.390
And then within here we can update so-what next that we need to do is document get element by id and

09:12.420 --> 09:28.220
grab the ID so IMJ swap update the source of it and equal that to I am g holder.

09:29.270 --> 09:30.670
So let's try this out.

09:31.870 --> 09:36.420
And when we refresh the page indeed we start out with I am G-5.

09:36.470 --> 09:38.390
So that's our initial image.

09:38.390 --> 09:48.590
So now I can actually get rid of this go back refreshed the page and we've got a fully functioning application.

09:48.590 --> 09:54.980
We've got a lot of the code cleaned up and we're simply loading all of the image information.

09:54.980 --> 09:57.440
So this image we can change it.

09:57.470 --> 10:03.110
So all of a sudden we don't like this image and we want to have maybe a different color or something

10:03.110 --> 10:03.870
like that.

10:05.790 --> 10:10.070
So if we want to have this color and we refresh it.

10:10.170 --> 10:12.910
Now we've got a yellow image and we're swapping it out.

10:13.050 --> 10:16.870
So it's more dynamic this way.

10:16.880 --> 10:23.540
So I also did want to mention as well that for this element the only way that we can actually have two

10:24.080 --> 10:31.280
different event handlers on it is if we use that within the attribute because if we try to grab it here

10:31.280 --> 10:34.720
within the java script we can only use one of these.

10:34.880 --> 10:41.460
So we can set on mouseover but we can't do on mouseover or we could do it on mouseover.

10:41.630 --> 10:48.140
So we can only do one and if we register one within the javascript that we're actually going to overwrite

10:48.140 --> 10:50.270
the event handlers that are already there.

10:50.270 --> 10:53.840
So let me just show you quickly how that works.

10:53.840 --> 11:00.510
So basically if I do document and we do get element by ID.

11:00.560 --> 11:09.710
So we know that we have the ID AMG swap and let's do on click.

11:09.790 --> 11:11.830
So that's one that we're familiar with.

11:11.860 --> 11:19.600
So whenever it gets clicked that we want to fire off a function so just do an anonymous function and

11:20.110 --> 11:22.120
let's do message

11:26.660 --> 11:29.250
quick and that's it.

11:29.250 --> 11:37.770
So now whenever it gets clicked let's refresh it the clicked works and whenever we hover on and off

11:38.010 --> 11:39.480
that works as well.

11:39.570 --> 11:44.020
But if we try to change this to on mouseover

11:49.020 --> 11:57.180
and we get rid of this one in here now when I refresh it I'm not able to do another mouse event so I

11:57.180 --> 11:59.940
only get that one mouse event in my on mouse.

11:59.940 --> 12:01.170
It doesn't work.

12:01.380 --> 12:04.890
So the click will work but the mouse events don't work.

12:04.980 --> 12:10.590
So you can do it within a combination like this or you could add the on click over here.

12:10.620 --> 12:16.740
But just keep in mind that you don't want you can't register more than one most of them to one of the

12:16.740 --> 12:23.210
one click event per element when you're doing it within this way within the javascript so that's a disadvantage.

12:23.520 --> 12:25.300
So do try it for yourself.

12:25.320 --> 12:26.810
Have the images swap.

12:26.910 --> 12:30.350
And keep in mind that you can't register them here.

12:30.390 --> 12:32.700
Both of the mouse over events here.
