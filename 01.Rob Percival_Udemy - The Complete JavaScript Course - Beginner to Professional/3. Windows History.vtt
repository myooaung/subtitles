00:00.960 --> 00:05.190
Welcome back and in this lesson let's create a link to another page.

00:05.190 --> 00:11.160
So just to a regular h him l h Raphe am I going to link to index 3.0 h him.

00:11.190 --> 00:15.470
And then we're going to create that sort of index three.

00:15.810 --> 00:19.110
And then let's duplicate this one and we'll have another link.

00:19.110 --> 00:25.650
Going back to index 1 and then we can also have one going back to index 2 as well.

00:25.740 --> 00:27.450
So let's set all of these up.

00:27.480 --> 00:28.970
So index 2.

00:29.370 --> 00:34.110
So now we've got three links on our Web page and we're going to let the user

00:36.890 --> 00:43.250
click the link and that will give us the ability to create some type of history for these for these

00:43.250 --> 00:44.130
links.

00:44.150 --> 00:48.650
So when we refresh it we've got kind of a mini menu up there at the top.

00:48.800 --> 00:53.670
So let's set up one more here where we're going to actually fire off.

00:53.810 --> 00:58.140
So do an input type will be button.

00:58.280 --> 01:03.410
So set up an input button and this one on click.

01:03.410 --> 01:08.210
So we're going to use that on click event that we looked at earlier and we're actually going to do quite

01:08.210 --> 01:11.310
a bit more with the On Click event coming up as well.

01:11.480 --> 01:15.890
So we know that we can fire off and we can link it and fire off a function.

01:15.980 --> 01:18.360
So we're going to do that.

01:18.620 --> 01:24.190
So let's set up a default function and this one will be Goldbach.

01:24.200 --> 01:29.930
So basically when we click this button it's going to actually take us back.

01:30.020 --> 01:31.210
So we'll be back.

01:31.400 --> 01:35.590
And let's close this one off.

01:37.490 --> 01:42.410
And then go into our script so we know now we need to create a function that's going to link to go back

01:42.880 --> 01:48.460
and we're going to look more about what we can do with these on clicks as well in upcoming lessons.

01:48.470 --> 01:53.060
So there's going to be quite a lot that we're going to be doing with these these are that listeners

01:53.120 --> 01:55.160
and event handlers.

01:55.250 --> 02:00.980
So let's use the window object that we were looking at previously and this time we're going to connect

02:00.980 --> 02:02.750
to Windows history.

02:02.750 --> 02:09.730
So this is a method that's contained within there and it's got its own set of methods that are contained

02:09.730 --> 02:11.660
within this object as well.

02:11.740 --> 02:16.340
So we're going to go windows history and we're just going to do a minus one.

02:16.480 --> 02:20.830
So basically what will happen is this will give us the ability to go back.

02:21.040 --> 02:22.720
So let's try this.

02:22.750 --> 02:32.760
And of course we do need to save this so let's save this as index to HVM mail and then I'm also going

02:32.760 --> 02:37.910
to save it as index three aged hymnal so save it as index 3.

02:37.940 --> 02:40.080
Tim it's all on the same directory.

02:40.140 --> 02:43.140
So that's where we don't have to have the absolute past.

02:43.140 --> 02:49.300
We can just use these relatives pass large or window and refreshed us.

02:49.430 --> 02:54.400
Now let's go to index 3 so we see that we're in index 3 will go to index 2.

02:54.410 --> 02:56.420
So this is just regular H-2 mail.

02:56.540 --> 03:03.050
But if we click back see it already takes us back to index 3 If we click back again then we go back

03:03.050 --> 03:04.550
to our starting point.

03:04.550 --> 03:08.840
So we can actually move through the different pages simply by clicking on it.

03:08.900 --> 03:13.620
And then we can have access to history within our Javascript.

03:13.700 --> 03:18.710
So open up your console and you can actually find out even more information.

03:18.710 --> 03:21.380
So there's window and history.

03:21.380 --> 03:28.190
So the history object has quite a bit of information with it and it is it does have a length.

03:28.280 --> 03:34.360
So you can see that currently there is nine items that are being stored within the history.

03:34.370 --> 03:41.030
So basically what that means that within the window history all of that information so all of our clicks

03:41.030 --> 03:42.450
have already been stored in.

03:42.530 --> 03:48.860
So if we click through some of the pages and then we can actually type in the window so we can do window

03:48.890 --> 03:53.150
history and do that same function that we're doing with the back button.

03:53.210 --> 03:58.160
We can go back one and we see that it takes us back one page as well.

03:58.310 --> 04:03.290
There's quite a lot you can do with this and this is just one of the things that's contained within

04:03.380 --> 04:07.820
the window object that you can make use of within your javascript.

04:07.820 --> 04:13.520
So the next lesson we're going to look at the on click and we're going to look at some even more methods

04:13.520 --> 04:15.550
that are available within the Windows object.

04:15.590 --> 04:17.120
So all of that is coming up.
