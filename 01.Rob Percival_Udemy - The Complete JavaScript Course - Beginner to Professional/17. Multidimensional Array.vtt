00:01.100 --> 00:07.550
Welcome back in in this lesson where you look at multi dimensional arrays so they're also known as nested

00:07.550 --> 00:11.450
arrays but multi-dimensional does sound a whole lot better.

00:11.450 --> 00:18.800
So basically what a multi dimensional array does is essentially arouse you to contain multiple values

00:19.100 --> 00:25.230
within an array and have multiple arrays within that tree as well.

00:25.240 --> 00:27.360
So let's set up our array.

00:27.620 --> 00:36.080
And for this one let's start with something familiar where we set up our typical array and then we're

00:36.080 --> 00:39.770
going to actually turn this one into a multi dimensional array.

00:40.030 --> 00:43.350
So I've got our basic array here all ready to go.

00:43.480 --> 00:47.860
I go back out here refreshed and we can see our array.

00:47.870 --> 00:55.000
So let's turn it into a multi dimensional array and all we have to do is to wrap around that.

00:55.010 --> 01:02.360
So now when I refresh it and if I do array I see the returned response is actually an array with an

01:02.360 --> 01:03.140
array.

01:03.140 --> 01:10.250
So if I wanted to get access to the contents of the first array or the first item in the array.

01:10.250 --> 01:19.130
So just as if I was returning back any one of these values in just a single dimensional array we would

01:19.130 --> 01:20.820
use the index value.

01:21.050 --> 01:27.670
So this one has an index to retrieve back that first array and then it retrieves that back.

01:27.770 --> 01:35.550
So in order to get cat dog or fish I need to specify the next index value that we want to look for.

01:35.570 --> 01:41.380
So let's pull back fish and we can see that this way we can return the value of fish.

01:41.390 --> 01:47.950
So essentially all this is is just multiple arrays one inside of the other.

01:47.990 --> 01:49.850
So nested within each other.

01:49.880 --> 01:56.840
So maybe this one can be a numeric one just having a bunch of numbers and we can go back.

01:56.850 --> 01:58.920
It will refresh the page.

01:58.970 --> 02:00.700
We'll see what it looks like.

02:00.700 --> 02:07.820
Now within the console and we can see that we're turning back all the contents of array and we see that

02:07.820 --> 02:14.210
we've got two arrays within that array and we can see that each one of them pretty much functions as

02:14.210 --> 02:15.530
an array on its own.

02:15.740 --> 02:24.440
And basically you can type in other different data types as well and that doesn't actually affect anything

02:24.440 --> 02:27.300
that's happening within the multi dimensional array.

02:27.500 --> 02:33.470
So we have the ability to have these multi dimensional pieces to the array and we can still call back

02:33.800 --> 02:35.610
a part of the array.

02:35.630 --> 02:41.050
So if we want to get back 50 We know that the index is three and we can call those back but if we want

02:41.050 --> 02:48.890
to get deeper into those existing arrays that we have to specify additional index values in order to

02:49.040 --> 02:51.080
be able to pull back those values.

02:51.220 --> 02:58.940
So if we want to pull back dog we need to specify first the index in the main array where it's located

02:59.030 --> 03:06.290
which is at index 0 and then next we need to look at that array that's contained within there.

03:06.410 --> 03:11.830
And this one is has three items in there and we can pull back the value of dog.

03:11.980 --> 03:20.390
So we press our our bracket zero bracket one so we can retrieve back the value of dog.

03:20.760 --> 03:28.110
And initially it does take some more time to start working and to be able to visualize these multi dimensional

03:28.110 --> 03:28.830
arrays.

03:29.010 --> 03:33.480
But once you do start working with them there's quite a lot of power behind there because you have the

03:33.480 --> 03:40.590
ability to store multiple levels of information all contained within the array and all contained within

03:40.590 --> 03:41.880
that one variable.

03:41.880 --> 03:47.490
And this is the only one that we need to remember in order to access all this wonderful information.

03:47.490 --> 03:54.870
So what I want you to do now as an exercise is to create your own multi dimensional array and set it

03:54.870 --> 04:02.460
up as an array and then add in a list of people so maybe create a collection of friends list out all

04:02.460 --> 04:13.480
of your friends and then have another value within that array corresponding to when you first met them.

04:13.480 --> 04:17.430
So the order that we're the maybe the last time you saw them.

04:17.460 --> 04:22.240
So the last one that you saw might be a one and then two three and so on.

04:22.480 --> 04:26.420
So try that out and I'll show you how to do that solution.

04:27.340 --> 04:28.660
So welcome back.

04:28.690 --> 04:33.430
And in this lesson I'm going to show you how to create that challenge.

04:33.610 --> 04:40.070
So initially it was said to create an array that has a bunch of friends in it.

04:40.210 --> 04:41.300
So let's do that.

04:41.320 --> 04:45.880
And then within that arrays so this is a multi dimensional array so we're just going to do those two

04:45.880 --> 04:48.190
square brackets right off the bat.

04:48.230 --> 04:51.630
So let's give put some names in there.

04:52.150 --> 04:53.980
So do some typical names

04:57.340 --> 05:06.010
and so we've got three names in there and then we want the next array to correspond with when we first

05:06.010 --> 05:06.780
met them.

05:06.790 --> 05:15.950
So if we met Larry first and John Mike second and then John third.

05:16.010 --> 05:18.510
So let's do it within that order.

05:19.310 --> 05:22.230
So we just got some numbers that are corresponding there.

05:22.370 --> 05:34.580
And now if we watch retrieve back information for Mike we can set a variable of Q Or maybe we can do

05:34.580 --> 05:38.130
a prompt here and it's.

05:41.060 --> 05:46.150
And the question will be which friend.

05:46.150 --> 05:48.110
So we just get a numeric value.

05:48.270 --> 05:56.780
So Mike John and Larry we'll get a response back there and we'll console log the value of the response

05:56.990 --> 06:02.540
from the prompt so we can return back the contents of our friends array.

06:02.690 --> 06:06.890
And both of these are going to be the same value.

06:06.980 --> 06:12.120
So we're going to look for a value of Q and this one also is going to be the Q.

06:12.650 --> 06:15.410
So it's open up our browser and try this out.

06:15.410 --> 06:17.600
So which friend do we want to look at.

06:17.690 --> 06:25.210
And we're going to find out the order that we're able to able to see them as well.

06:28.440 --> 06:35.340
It actually before I finish this up there is an error here because we need to specify that this is the

06:35.340 --> 06:43.620
first array and then that second array is action so the first one is where we're achieving by our friends

06:44.640 --> 06:52.440
and then next we're going to say when you met them order

06:56.340 --> 07:02.520
and this time we need to specify the secondary because we've got the first array the second array.

07:02.550 --> 07:09.950
So we do need to specify and then the queue is just specifying what index we want in that multidimensional

07:10.080 --> 07:17.040
array and I just saw an error there so let's add that comma in there because we do need to comma separate

07:17.040 --> 07:18.710
out those arrays.

07:18.930 --> 07:20.160
So let's try this.

07:20.190 --> 07:22.500
So which friend do we want to take a look at.

07:22.560 --> 07:27.570
We'll look at friend number one and John when you met them.

07:27.570 --> 07:31.720
Order number three so we can try that again.

07:31.920 --> 07:37.170
And this might actually be better if they were actually dates or years or something like that.

07:37.200 --> 07:38.880
So let's do 1980

07:40.950 --> 07:44.390
1990 and let's do this one.

07:44.420 --> 07:47.700
Two thousand and 16.

07:48.390 --> 07:59.780
So when you met them do you hear when you might get rid of that order.

08:03.680 --> 08:07.750
And we can also start with you Matt.

08:08.150 --> 08:08.660
You met

08:12.290 --> 08:12.830
John

08:15.500 --> 08:16.740
Dean.

08:17.680 --> 08:18.730
So do it like that.

08:18.730 --> 08:23.820
So this is going to give us some more details about content within our race.

08:23.820 --> 08:25.790
Let's go back out and refresh it.

08:25.930 --> 08:28.480
So let's see which friend who want to take a look at.

08:28.600 --> 08:31.690
So you met Mike in 1980.

08:32.080 --> 08:39.320
You met John in 1990 and you met Larry in 2016.

08:39.820 --> 08:47.740
So this is how you can work and use multi-dimensional arrays to retrieve and hold multiple values all

08:47.740 --> 08:51.020
contained within one variable.

08:54.190 --> 08:59.830
So the next lesson I'm going to quickly show you how you can loop through the values of the array so

08:59.830 --> 09:06.330
that we don't have to actually go and do one by one and show you how to do that.

09:06.370 --> 09:09.910
And there's a really simple trick to looping through the values of an array.

09:09.940 --> 09:11.360
So that's coming up in the next lesson.
