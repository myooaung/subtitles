00:00.870 --> 00:06.950
Come back and this lesson let's do some replacing of the word that we've got up there so we don't actually

00:06.950 --> 00:09.020
have to have too.

00:09.070 --> 00:11.020
We're going to use the input that we used before.

00:11.030 --> 00:18.680
So the my string value and instead of guess or even to say please and we're going to use the string

00:18.680 --> 00:22.980
method in order to replace the contents that we've got up here.

00:23.060 --> 00:28.130
So we're going to replace javascript whatever word We've got within this input.

00:28.130 --> 00:33.470
And this one we can just call that are heading.

00:33.530 --> 00:36.050
So that will basically replace the heading.

00:36.290 --> 00:37.910
So let's set up a function.

00:37.940 --> 00:40.200
So our heading.

00:40.910 --> 00:47.040
You don't need to pass any promotors and we're just going to use the javascript method.

00:47.270 --> 00:51.050
We need to grab the value of my string.

00:51.230 --> 01:01.550
So we just give it a value of m and document get element by Id grab the object my string or the element

01:01.740 --> 01:07.000
string place it into the object and we need to also add value.

01:07.040 --> 01:08.740
So you can actually get the value.

01:08.750 --> 01:14.310
So now we've got a string value of whatever was added into the input field.

01:14.750 --> 01:20.580
So the next to that we need to do is we need to update.

01:20.660 --> 01:31.100
So what's let's set up another variable so this one I'm going to call C and in this case what we're

01:31.100 --> 01:35.500
going to be doing is we're grabbing whatever is contained within message

01:40.100 --> 01:41.210
and inner.

01:41.240 --> 01:45.700
So make sure that we grab that inner text that's contained within message.

01:45.710 --> 01:47.610
So this is our string.

01:47.690 --> 01:48.740
And now let's update it.

01:48.740 --> 01:57.050
So we want to grab C and we're going to rewrite C so we've got our C value and now let's replace that

01:57.050 --> 02:02.440
value that's within C with whatever value was passed in with an M.

02:02.570 --> 02:08.170
So replace requires two parameters there and the parameters that we require.

02:08.210 --> 02:11.710
The first one is going to be what we're replacing.

02:11.840 --> 02:19.400
So we're replacing the word javascript and the value or the string that we're going to replace javascript

02:19.400 --> 02:23.850
with and that one is contained within an.

02:23.990 --> 02:24.530
So there we go.

02:24.530 --> 02:33.800
So now we've rewritten that message and now we can update it so we can do message and her text and we

02:33.800 --> 02:37.780
can simply equal that to see.

02:37.790 --> 02:43.710
So let's try to say it go back it refreshed the page and let us type in something there.

02:45.400 --> 02:53.070
Hit replace and we can see that we were able to replace the content there in the heading.

02:53.340 --> 02:57.470
So we can also type in whatever we want and hit replace

02:59.960 --> 03:03.080
and we notice that it's not firing off again.

03:03.080 --> 03:04.930
So it's not actually updating it.

03:05.060 --> 03:06.180
We can add it in.

03:06.200 --> 03:12.830
So but if we go back and if we refresh it and if we type in a value then it works solely works the one

03:12.860 --> 03:14.690
time and it's not working.

03:14.690 --> 03:15.620
The second time.

03:15.650 --> 03:18.410
So now it's time to do a little bit of debugging.

03:18.470 --> 03:21.100
So we're going to use console within the debugging.

03:21.260 --> 03:30.690
And we want to make sure that we're actually logging out something and let's let's do this.

03:30.740 --> 03:38.220
So let's do a console and we'll do see so we can make sure that we're actually grabbing that inner tax.

03:38.270 --> 03:42.540
So go back out refreshed and type in a value so test.

03:42.650 --> 03:43.670
So we're grabbing it.

03:43.820 --> 03:45.010
We click it again.

03:45.050 --> 03:46.060
We're grabbing it.

03:46.190 --> 03:49.820
So let's let's see if we get that updated value.

03:49.820 --> 03:54.860
So we see that right now what's happening is that it's still grabbing that value.

03:54.860 --> 04:02.330
But for some reason it's not doing the Replace of C so it's not replacing C with Javascript.

04:02.330 --> 04:03.860
So do you know why that is.

04:03.890 --> 04:11.970
And if you said that well this particular string this is no longer javascript this now says test.

04:12.050 --> 04:12.770
You're correct.

04:12.890 --> 04:16.800
So basically because we've updated javascript we're trying to replace.

04:16.910 --> 04:20.900
And we're looking for this character string of Javascript.

04:20.900 --> 04:24.170
So what I want you to do now is fix the problem.

04:24.170 --> 04:30.560
So write some javascript in order to fix this problem that we're having that we're no longer able to

04:30.560 --> 04:36.800
update this parameter even though we want to update this and we don't want to update anything else.

04:36.950 --> 04:40.790
And we're updating it with whatever that input is here.

04:40.910 --> 04:41.550
So go ahead.

04:41.550 --> 04:43.340
Pause the video and I'll show you the solution.

04:43.340 --> 04:47.220
Coming up so if you had an opportunity to try that.

04:47.310 --> 04:51.770
And there are a number of ways that you can do this and you can accomplish this.

04:51.810 --> 05:01.640
So the probably the easiest way to do this is to create a variable and this variable so global variable.

05:01.740 --> 05:11.980
And now we know that we're replacing it with the value that's contained within m.

05:12.070 --> 05:14.920
So let's do holder equals M

05:17.540 --> 05:26.820
and next we know that if we place it before the replacement then we're simply overwriting the value

05:26.820 --> 05:29.260
of AMZ we need to place it afterwards.

05:29.310 --> 05:34.160
And that basically means that we need to put our default value within holder.

05:34.260 --> 05:40.280
So right off right in the beginning and now we know that we can use holder in place of it.

05:40.320 --> 05:46.110
And when the function runs through that the value of Holga is actually going to change to whatever the

05:46.110 --> 05:47.700
current value of m is.

05:47.820 --> 05:49.930
And that we've actually replaced our string.

05:49.980 --> 05:52.630
So let's go back out and try this out.

05:53.130 --> 05:55.490
So complete javascript.

05:55.530 --> 05:57.540
Let's do a test replace.

05:57.720 --> 06:00.160
And now let's do something else.

06:00.180 --> 06:05.910
So learning replace and test again.

06:06.020 --> 06:13.130
Test test and we can see now because of the fact that we're using variables and we're actually holding

06:13.220 --> 06:14.710
values globally.

06:14.750 --> 06:20.180
We know that every time we're running through this function we can simply call back to this value and

06:20.180 --> 06:22.860
we can do the replacement of that content.

06:24.280 --> 06:27.880
And there were a number of other solutions as well.

06:27.880 --> 06:32.090
So you could have as well grabbed the current value here.

06:32.170 --> 06:37.570
You could have cut it off you could it cut it off at the first space and then grab the last space and

06:37.570 --> 06:43.540
then update it replaced the substring there with the current string.

06:43.570 --> 06:47.170
So that would have taken a little bit more time but you could have done it that way as well.

06:47.170 --> 06:48.850
And that would have been cracked as well.

06:48.850 --> 06:54.460
So even though there is a number of ways to accomplish the task we always try to look for the simplest

06:54.760 --> 07:00.400
and easiest solution to implement to accomplish our goals using javascript.
