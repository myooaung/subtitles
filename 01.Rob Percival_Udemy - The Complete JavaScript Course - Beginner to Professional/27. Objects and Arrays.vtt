00:00.710 --> 00:01.620
Welcome back.

00:01.640 --> 00:07.520
And in this lesson we're going to be looking at how we can place objects within other objects.

00:07.520 --> 00:14.870
So we saw earlier we can set up an object and we can create that was the curly brackets and then we

00:14.870 --> 00:20.450
can list a number of objects in there and everything has to have a name for it.

00:20.510 --> 00:28.850
So let's say we've got a number of our friends so let's update this to friends and each one of our friends

00:29.060 --> 00:30.810
is a person.

00:30.890 --> 00:37.590
So we've got to give us one a name of Bob and then Bob.

00:38.120 --> 00:43.870
So Bob has an age and he's 30.

00:43.930 --> 00:51.650
He's got a hair color codes call it hair and his hair color is brown.

00:51.650 --> 00:58.940
His eyes are blue.

00:59.570 --> 01:07.010
He's got he works so he works.

01:07.010 --> 01:10.700
So let's say he is a developer and so on.

01:10.700 --> 01:21.710
So this person can have some information and we can list them out so we can do friend friend once our

01:21.730 --> 01:26.920
first friend and this friend is going to be.

01:27.320 --> 01:34.150
So let's see how this works out and go back to here refreshed and let's see what we have within France

01:34.150 --> 01:34.830
right now.

01:35.020 --> 01:40.570
So we'll see that we've got our first friend and our first friend has a whole bunch of information associated

01:40.570 --> 01:44.890
with them so he can do this for other ones as well.

01:44.890 --> 01:51.410
And we don't actually necessarily need to do it outside so we can do something like friend to sort a

01:51.410 --> 01:52.750
second friend.

01:52.750 --> 01:56.890
And here we can specify additional information.

01:56.890 --> 02:02.700
So this is essentially an object within an object and we can do the same information.

02:02.800 --> 02:07.780
We can do different information again depending on what we want to do.

02:07.780 --> 02:09.720
So let's make this goes here.

02:09.730 --> 02:12.600
BLOCK And so on and so on.

02:12.820 --> 02:21.220
So now when i log what my friends are my friends see that I've got multiple friends.

02:21.280 --> 02:27.160
Each one of these friends has its own set of properties and information contained within their saying

02:27.230 --> 02:29.990
to beautify this quickly so it's more readable.

02:30.220 --> 02:35.650
So this is another way that you can write the object information because remember again the way javascript

02:35.890 --> 02:42.550
treats the whitespace is that it doesn't it doesn't take that into consideration.

02:42.550 --> 02:47.440
So that's where we can have all this additional whitespace especially when you do it within this type

02:47.440 --> 02:49.500
of format it's more readable.

02:49.510 --> 02:58.180
We see that though the format is that we've got a value here that the the name and the value and then

02:58.180 --> 03:04.540
the name and the value or comma separated and it's all held within a bracket and we can just as easily

03:04.540 --> 03:11.140
take that object and place it within this object or we can create a separate object directly within

03:11.140 --> 03:12.170
that object.

03:12.190 --> 03:14.330
And as long as we give it a name.

03:14.350 --> 03:21.010
Basically what this means is that a lot of difference but this one is operating on its own whereas this

03:21.010 --> 03:22.870
one is contained within here.

03:22.900 --> 03:27.940
So if we ever needed to pull these people out if we had a bunch of friends and we they all had their

03:27.940 --> 03:32.650
separate names it might be a little bit harder to pull it out if we're doing it within this format.

03:32.650 --> 03:37.480
So always think about your structure and how you can actually use this data.

03:37.480 --> 03:43.090
And that's how you actually end up structuring your data so you could just as easily say we have friend

03:43.090 --> 03:45.360
one 2 and so on.

03:45.370 --> 03:50.450
So maybe my list of friends might be better suited as an array.

03:53.730 --> 04:02.030
So this this time let's set this up as an array so we know with an array we've got those square brackets.

04:02.170 --> 04:06.720
And the first item and our rate is going to be Bob.

04:07.180 --> 04:13.540
And then the second item within our array is just going to be this unknown person.

04:13.540 --> 04:18.400
We don't have a name for them and it's going to be sitting within that array.

04:18.400 --> 04:20.500
So let's bring this back in here.

04:20.620 --> 04:22.920
It's all self contained on one line.

04:23.110 --> 04:30.570
And now let's go back and refreshed and see what we get as a result for friends when we see that.

04:30.580 --> 04:33.220
Now we've got an array.

04:33.250 --> 04:39.310
It contains an object in within each one of the items within the array.

04:39.460 --> 04:43.320
And basically we have access to all of this information.

04:43.330 --> 04:46.570
So what happens if you want to write some of this information.

04:46.780 --> 04:48.930
And this is where the challenge is.

04:48.940 --> 04:55.120
So what I want you to do is to get the information from Bob.

04:55.150 --> 04:59.680
But using the friends object so get hit where he works.

04:59.680 --> 05:06.630
So right out into the console and then next using frames 1.

05:06.790 --> 05:15.230
So using friends returned back Bob's information of where he works and then using friends one returned

05:15.230 --> 05:20.380
back the age of the person

05:23.470 --> 05:26.120
so paused the video and try this out.

05:26.420 --> 05:33.200
And this is a great exercise to really get use to retrieving the data that's being held within objects

05:33.260 --> 05:34.370
and arrays.

05:35.920 --> 05:37.240
So welcome back.

05:37.240 --> 05:42.020
And this one this challenge was to retrieve the information contained within friends.

05:42.190 --> 05:44.240
So we've got friends.

05:44.240 --> 05:51.650
Next we've got the item friend one and we know that the information contained within here is Bob.

05:51.850 --> 05:54.500
And we want to find out where he works.

05:54.820 --> 05:57.250
So we know that he works as a developer.

05:57.390 --> 06:03.940
So it's as easy as that using the dot notation just separating out each level of the object until we

06:03.940 --> 06:10.330
get to the item that we want to take a closer look at and we can see that we've got all of this information

06:10.540 --> 06:12.880
contained within here as well.

06:12.880 --> 06:15.670
So we don't necessarily even need.

06:15.940 --> 06:23.260
So we've got it in friends one and in friends we see that all we're doing is we're following the flow

06:23.260 --> 06:23.720
here.

06:23.770 --> 06:30.330
So we've got friends we've got friend one and that information from Bob has been actually copied into

06:30.340 --> 06:36.580
Friend 1 and all we're doing is just specifying that path to get to where he works.

06:36.580 --> 06:45.190
So the next part of the challenge was to use friends one so need to spell out rate so friends one.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.140
So this was an array.

06:47.290 --> 06:55.480
And we saw that when we output this Bob's information is in the first item and the other person's was

06:55.480 --> 06:56.540
in the second one.

06:56.560 --> 06:58.790
So we need to access the second one.

06:58.840 --> 07:01.020
So we need to specify that array.

07:01.270 --> 07:04.860
And then what we wanted to do was retrieve back the age.

07:04.870 --> 07:10.970
This is a combination of retrieving back that array information as well as the object information.

07:11.020 --> 07:17.110
And this is how we can get the age of that particular person if we want to see the age of the first

07:17.110 --> 07:17.920
person.

07:17.980 --> 07:19.370
We can just change that.

07:19.540 --> 07:22.040
And Bob was actually 30 as well.

07:22.090 --> 07:26.650
So we see that we can access it within that type of format.

07:26.650 --> 07:33.350
So it's great to be able to combine arrays and objects together in order to store and retrieve data.

07:33.400 --> 07:37.340
But again it's you have to do it in a way that makes sense.

07:37.450 --> 07:43.790
And then also remember that you've got to retrieve that data in some type of format as well so this

07:43.790 --> 07:50.720
lesson the end of the lesson challenge is going to be to retrieve information from each one of these

07:50.780 --> 07:53.820
objects and or a race.

07:53.870 --> 08:01.370
So we've got our friends object that contains multiple values and we've got our friends one array that's

08:01.370 --> 08:02.960
got some objects in there.

08:03.200 --> 08:10.160
So what I want you to do now is to retrieve back and to update some of the information that's contained

08:10.250 --> 08:11.040
within there.

08:11.210 --> 08:19.010
So try updating the age in friends and then also try updating the both the ages in friends 1 and I'll

08:19.010 --> 08:20.560
give you a quick hint.

08:20.600 --> 08:26.100
So much like what we've seen earlier once we can retrieve that information.

08:26.480 --> 08:35.760
So if I do friends and if I do friend one and if I do page we see that we get 40 return back.

08:35.990 --> 08:40.350
So we know that we can access the information that way.

08:40.460 --> 08:43.570
So now it's up to you to update that information.

08:43.700 --> 08:44.600
So go ahead.

08:44.630 --> 08:45.830
Pause the video.

08:45.830 --> 08:48.440
Give it a go and I'll show you the solution.

08:48.440 --> 08:53.760
Coming up so I hope you had the opportunity to give that one a try.

08:53.840 --> 08:56.430
And the hit was really there.

08:56.430 --> 09:04.010
That what we need to do is we need to specify the value the new value of age so we can do it just as

09:04.040 --> 09:07.100
easily as that where we can make the update.

09:07.100 --> 09:13.760
So just as we can retrieve the information we can update the information and the same thing goes for

09:13.850 --> 09:15.020
the array.

09:15.020 --> 09:19.030
So we know that we had an array with friends one.

09:19.250 --> 09:27.020
And as let's update maybe the first item in the array and we know that we had age.

09:27.140 --> 09:33.560
So we see that this person's age is 50 and notice the interesting thing here that's happened here is

09:33.620 --> 09:43.250
that this Bob because we're pulling information about Bob and when we updated Bob's information over

09:43.310 --> 09:47.440
here that it actually changed within the array.

09:47.750 --> 09:54.180
And that's the interesting thing about it is that we're able to change the value of Bob.

09:54.380 --> 09:56.820
So let's let's try that as well.

09:56.840 --> 10:06.280
And if we do Bob's age and let's make him 70 this time let's take a look at friends and we'll take a

10:06.280 --> 10:08.480
look and we'll see if not updated the age.

10:08.500 --> 10:09.650
And in fact it did.

10:09.670 --> 10:12.970
So everything is in fact tied together.

10:13.120 --> 10:20.140
And when I take a look at friends one we see that it should be updated as well because everything is

10:20.140 --> 10:22.120
tying back to that variable.

10:22.270 --> 10:28.940
And from the earlier lesson we saw that variables can change and they're expected to change.

10:29.080 --> 10:34.870
And that's one of the reasons that we would use a variable within these objects to make it more flexible

10:34.960 --> 10:36.190
and easier to change.

10:36.190 --> 10:41.860
So this challenge was a little bit of a trick question because all we really had to do is go into Bob

10:41.890 --> 10:46.230
and change his age and that would have changed everything.

10:46.240 --> 10:52.350
So also just to finish up let me show you how to change friends one.

10:52.600 --> 11:00.790
So just as we're able to recall the age of friends one we can also take that value and we can assign

11:00.880 --> 11:02.310
a new value to it.

11:02.350 --> 11:05.370
So let's make this guy 10 and we can see that.

11:05.380 --> 11:14.200
Now when I list friends one I can see that that change has also taken place.

11:17.080 --> 11:29.390
And lastly let's update the value of Bob's age and we'll set them to be 10 within friends 1.

11:29.410 --> 11:33.480
So we know that that takes place we're able to change it to 10.

11:33.520 --> 11:42.640
Let's take a look in friends and we'll see that his age is 10 as well.

11:42.670 --> 11:45.580
Within this one within the friends.

11:45.610 --> 11:50.720
And then lastly let's go take a look at Bob and we see that his age is 10 as well.

11:50.720 --> 11:52.630
So they're all connected.

11:52.680 --> 11:53.640
You update one.

11:53.680 --> 11:55.240
It's going to update all of them.

11:55.420 --> 12:03.220
And that's the real beauty of using variables and really being able to create some dynamic capabilities

12:03.220 --> 12:07.170
with the connections of the variables between these different objects.
