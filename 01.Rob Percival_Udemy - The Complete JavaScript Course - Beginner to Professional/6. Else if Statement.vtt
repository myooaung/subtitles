00:00.800 --> 00:09.380
Welcome back in this lesson we're going to look at what else if and if statements using ELSE IF.

00:09.770 --> 00:15.050
So first of all let's set a variable and we'll just call it my time.

00:15.200 --> 00:18.580
Let's say this is working off of a 24 hour clock.

00:18.660 --> 00:21.800
It was started at 11 a.m..

00:21.920 --> 00:30.150
So what I want to do now is I want to check this value and return back depending on what time it is.

00:30.170 --> 00:33.950
I want to return back a different message to the user.

00:34.310 --> 00:38.600
So again we're going to grow up in that content element there.

00:38.840 --> 00:48.420
So using documents get element by ID and that one is put so that we can put the content into the interface

00:48.450 --> 00:51.410
Jamelle and we can get rid of this console part here.

00:51.920 --> 00:55.510
So I can refresh that and we see we just got that statement there.

00:55.760 --> 01:04.190
So now we're going to actually do or if statements and let's check to see if the value of my time and

01:04.280 --> 01:11.270
we know that if it's before noon then we're going to say morning.

01:11.450 --> 01:19.710
And then if it's in the afternoon or evening say welcome to the afternoon.

01:19.730 --> 01:24.890
So now let's update output.

01:24.930 --> 01:30.240
And this is the H2 mail and we're going to equal that to

01:33.560 --> 01:36.980
wake wake up this morning

01:40.510 --> 01:44.110
so let's first try to make sure that it's working.

01:44.430 --> 01:51.890
So what happens if we come back at fifteen hundred hours and we don't get any type of response.

01:51.900 --> 01:53.170
So this is where we could use.

01:53.170 --> 01:54.270
Else.

01:54.750 --> 01:57.240
And we can say that house

02:01.540 --> 02:03.050
we can say now

02:05.800 --> 02:07.830
it's evening

02:10.600 --> 02:15.570
go to sleep so we can set some instructions for the user refresh.

02:15.760 --> 02:17.340
It's evening go to sleep.

02:17.590 --> 02:21.280
So we know that depending on what the value of my time is.

02:21.310 --> 02:25.750
So if it's really early in the morning 4:00 a.m. wake up its morning.

02:25.840 --> 02:32.680
So hopefully you don't have to get up at 4:00 a.m. But this is our basic evaluation here of the time.

02:32.920 --> 02:35.280
So let's take this one step further.

02:35.380 --> 02:44.260
So what if we want to add in some additional check to see if maybe we had lunchtime or something like

02:44.260 --> 02:44.860
that.

02:44.860 --> 02:48.550
So we want to add in some additional checks here.

02:48.640 --> 02:52.180
So let's let's end with javascript.

02:52.180 --> 02:59.680
The way that we can do that is we can use the else if statement and that gives us another option to

02:59.770 --> 03:04.800
apply another condition and check to see if this condition is true.

03:04.900 --> 03:11.260
Before we just simply evaluate to the default here the else.

03:11.260 --> 03:18.220
So basically we're checking to see if this is true and if it is then we run the code that's between

03:18.220 --> 03:19.510
the curly brackets.

03:19.540 --> 03:31.580
Next we're going to check to see if my time is greater than 12 and my time is less than 1.

03:31.720 --> 03:39.720
Then we're going to say would put and in our HMO and we are on a 24 hour clock.

03:39.730 --> 03:42.670
So we need to make sure that it's 13

03:45.380 --> 03:47.820
and we'll say go to lunch

03:50.620 --> 03:59.810
so let's refresh this and we'll update our time so update our time to be twelve point five so now it's

03:59.810 --> 04:07.940
telling us to go to lunch and we can apply as many outs ifs as we want and make sure that you leave

04:07.940 --> 04:15.080
the space in there because Javascript the way that the LCF works is that there's no key word for that

04:15.500 --> 04:22.310
that you do need to make sure that you are providing the spacing in there in order to allow it to accommodate

04:23.430 --> 04:24.340
the else.

04:24.720 --> 04:29.220
So you could also add a bunch of other ones if you want to as well.

04:29.220 --> 04:31.450
So let's let's do one more here.

04:35.080 --> 04:49.880
So else if and this time let's check to see if the time is greater than four and maybe less than 8 say

04:49.900 --> 04:50.610
dinnertime

04:54.200 --> 04:56.290
and let's save that refresh.

04:56.460 --> 05:06.090
And of course we need to set and keep working off of so 4 o'clock would be sixteen hundred hours and

05:07.100 --> 05:09.770
eight o'clock would be 20 hours.

05:09.770 --> 05:12.930
So let's let's pick a time in between there.

05:13.520 --> 05:16.880
Let's do 17:00 hours which should be 5 o'clock.

05:17.050 --> 05:20.700
So it's dinnertime and everything else.

05:21.010 --> 05:21.800
It's evening.

05:21.800 --> 05:22.870
Go to sleep.

05:23.360 --> 05:26.070
So let's let's do even more here.

05:26.180 --> 05:29.570
So we don't want to wake up really early.

05:29.990 --> 05:39.240
So now let's update this to accommodate a time of more reasonable time for getting up.

05:39.250 --> 05:43.060
So what I want you to do now is to pause the video

05:46.020 --> 05:47.640
and update the code.

05:48.700 --> 05:57.010
Checking to see if the person if the time is between 8:00 a.m. and 12 so eight hundred hours or twelve

05:57.010 --> 06:04.810
hundred hours and if it is that we know it's time to wake up and if it's between thirteen hundred and

06:04.840 --> 06:08.830
sixteen hundred hours then we know that it's time to go to work.

06:08.980 --> 06:12.880
So just check to see if it's equal to 13:00.

06:12.880 --> 06:15.160
So you've got to be right on time to work.

06:15.160 --> 06:24.220
So 13:00 hours 1:00 p.m. and you know that it can be up to 16 hundred and then set the time to 13:00

06:24.220 --> 06:27.650
hours and also update that last statement.

06:27.790 --> 06:36.670
So another else if to see if it's past your bedtime so check checking to see if it's over 22:00 hours

06:36.910 --> 06:39.870
and then basically that means that it's time to go to sleep.

06:40.210 --> 06:43.780
So make those updates and I'm going to work through them as well.

06:43.780 --> 06:49.640
Coming up plus a video give it a go and I'm going to show you how to do that coming up.

06:49.690 --> 06:54.480
So he did say that one of the first things that we want to do is add another statement in here.

06:54.610 --> 07:01.260
So we're going to check to see if my time is greater than or equal to eight.

07:01.390 --> 07:05.350
So he didn't need to add in those equal signs.

07:05.600 --> 07:13.340
And the reason that we're using and is that we want to land it between these is different times.

07:13.490 --> 07:22.370
So we want to check to see if it's less than or equal that equal to 12 then we know that this is our

07:22.370 --> 07:22.870
morning.

07:22.910 --> 07:25.710
We've got to get up we've got to get going get to work.

07:26.970 --> 07:34.920
So next we know that we've got a lunchtime here so we're going to check to see if it's greater than

07:35.010 --> 07:40.990
or equal to and less than or equal to 13

07:43.970 --> 07:46.900
and actually I should get rid of this one here.

07:46.910 --> 07:53.480
So we know that we're going right away to lunch and if we're falling between those times then we know

07:53.480 --> 07:54.840
that it's lunchtime.

07:55.100 --> 08:03.260
And also did say that we need to make sure that the user gets to work at 1:00 p.m. So it's not a condition

08:03.260 --> 08:08.000
for her.

08:08.100 --> 08:17.000
So we're going to check to see if the time is above 1300 or if it's less than equal to 16:00.

08:17.250 --> 08:19.740
So that's where we can add an equal sign.

08:19.740 --> 08:24.600
And over here we need an equal sign because if it's one then they need to be at work.

08:24.630 --> 08:29.800
So this one will tell the user to go to go to work.

08:30.240 --> 08:34.130
And then we've got our dinner time and we need to add in one more.

08:34.130 --> 08:39.230
And I know there's quite a lot of them going on here and I'm going to show you a better way to do this.

08:39.240 --> 08:41.850
Coming up as well using the switch statement.

08:41.850 --> 08:50.070
But for now let's stick with our statement and we can see that we can add as many as we like and always

08:50.250 --> 08:53.700
checking to see if this condition is evaluated true.

08:53.850 --> 08:58.770
And if it is then we run the code between the curly brackets and if it's not that we just move on to

08:58.770 --> 09:00.180
the next statement.

09:00.240 --> 09:10.200
So we want to check to see if the time is greater than or equal to twenty two hundred then we know that

09:10.750 --> 09:13.330
time to go to sleep.

09:15.680 --> 09:23.210
And everything else is if you should be sleeping.

09:23.450 --> 09:31.310
And now let's do this so there is more of a variable within my tought time and all of this to a prompt

09:32.060 --> 09:35.820
and we'll see what our is.

09:38.780 --> 09:41.390
So now let's refresh this.

09:41.430 --> 09:43.970
So it's asking us what our IT IS.

09:44.110 --> 09:52.990
So let's say it's 8 a.m. in the morning wake up it's morning next let's see that right now it's noon.

09:52.990 --> 09:56.060
So time to go to lunch after that.

09:56.230 --> 09:57.480
It's 1 p.

09:57.550 --> 10:02.950
1 p.m. So 13:00 hours and we always have to be right on time for work.

10:03.100 --> 10:05.130
So time to go to work.

10:05.440 --> 10:13.690
Next we know that we've got home from work and roughly around 6:00 p.m. So 18:00 hours we're going to

10:13.690 --> 10:15.780
be eating dinner next.

10:15.820 --> 10:22.910
Let's refresh it ands let's say it's twenty three hundred hours and it's time to go to sleep.

10:23.320 --> 10:25.020
And then another one.

10:25.060 --> 10:28.380
So let's say it's 3:00 in the morning you should be sleeping.

10:28.630 --> 10:30.950
So everything looks like it's working great.

10:31.000 --> 10:39.430
And in the next lesson I'm going to show you a better way to create this using the switch statement.

10:39.440 --> 10:40.360
So that's coming up.
