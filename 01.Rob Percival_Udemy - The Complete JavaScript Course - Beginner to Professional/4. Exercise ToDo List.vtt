00:00.930 --> 00:06.540
Welcome back in in this lesson we're going to do an exercise we're going to create an interactive task

00:06.540 --> 00:10.720
list so this one I want you to follow along as well.

00:10.740 --> 00:12.300
Within this lesson.

00:12.390 --> 00:15.030
So go ahead and open up here Ed..

00:15.090 --> 00:17.890
And let's start writing some Javascript code.

00:18.120 --> 00:22.800
So the first thing that we want to do is set up our task array.

00:22.860 --> 00:26.150
So let's start out by creating a variable.

00:26.190 --> 00:32.400
So we're going to create an array and where you listo a bunch of our favorite tasks with the in this

00:32.490 --> 00:33.360
array.

00:33.360 --> 00:36.070
So go ahead and set up that array.

00:36.240 --> 00:42.610
Pause the video and go ahead and add in some tasks within that task.

00:42.720 --> 00:49.890
So just anything that you would be typically doing the day Duree doing during the day and next we're

00:49.890 --> 00:52.880
going to look at the progress of those tasks.

00:52.920 --> 00:53.580
So go ahead.

00:53.640 --> 01:00.800
Set up that task array and then come back and we're going to continue building out this exercise.

01:01.650 --> 01:04.950
So we had the opportunity to set up the task.

01:04.950 --> 01:13.500
And now let's do some tasks so one of the tasks might be take out some garbage.

01:13.980 --> 01:18.810
Another task in the array maybe we might want to read a book.

01:19.320 --> 01:30.270
So that was a task and another one might be great javascript that will be another task that we want

01:30.270 --> 01:36.900
to do within a day and then maybe also go to work or something like that so that we have a wide variety

01:36.900 --> 01:40.510
of different tasks that we can work on throughout the day.

01:40.830 --> 01:46.640
So next we need to specify our progress on these tasks.

01:47.070 --> 01:49.800
So let's set up another array.

01:49.950 --> 01:55.810
And we're going to have some progress that we want to specify within this task

01:59.330 --> 02:11.150
so let's go ahead and add in this one another array and this one we're going to call it progress.

02:11.610 --> 02:21.930
And then within here let's add in some progress where it's we've got one done and next one in progress

02:23.310 --> 02:27.530
and not start it.

02:27.960 --> 02:31.770
Or you can maybe just call it to do because this is a To Do list.

02:31.800 --> 02:39.180
So let's just call it to do so that's good enough so now we've got three options here that we can be

02:39.180 --> 02:43.530
doing for any one of the tasks that we have listed above.

02:43.530 --> 02:48.930
So that's what I want to do is I want to ask and specify

02:51.680 --> 02:58.970
We want to specify Within up prompt and ask the user questions so we've got our variable.

02:58.970 --> 03:04.590
So this is going to be a response back from the promise that this is the same thing that we doing earlier.

03:04.670 --> 03:07.780
We're creating that interaction with the user.

03:08.060 --> 03:12.700
So we've got our prompt popping up there and now we need to format a question.

03:12.710 --> 03:24.130
So let's ask them which task and we're going to just do one two three I them which Tasco shoes should

03:24.130 --> 03:36.460
be 3:59 I ask them what task they want to mark their progress on or specify where they are with the

03:36.460 --> 03:39.010
task and then the second question.

03:39.010 --> 03:40.870
So question number two.

03:40.900 --> 03:45.340
So we just call this one question one and this one can be Question 2.

03:45.490 --> 03:56.430
And the prompt is going to cost status and also maybe what I want to do is I want to copy this down

03:56.430 --> 03:59.000
here so I can do something like.

03:59.080 --> 04:08.460
1 2 is in progress and three is equal to two.

04:09.060 --> 04:15.280
And I'll just update these to equal science so I want you to pause the video here.

04:15.580 --> 04:22.660
Open up your editor and add in another variable for another array for the progress.

04:22.720 --> 04:25.770
You can just copy the same values that I have here.

04:25.810 --> 04:30.150
So basically maybe even you might want to only stick to two.

04:30.160 --> 04:38.890
It also depends on how much how in-depth you want your task list to be and then next set up the questions

04:39.370 --> 04:47.440
first one asking what tasks we want to tackle and then next is asking what the status is that we want

04:47.440 --> 04:50.480
to specify for that particular task.

04:50.500 --> 04:51.350
So go ahead.

04:51.490 --> 04:52.530
Plus the video.

04:52.720 --> 04:55.210
And in the next lesson I'm going to show you

04:58.510 --> 05:02.040
how we can pull this all together and make use of it.

05:02.080 --> 05:06.450
And I'd put some results within our consul.

05:06.880 --> 05:14.250
So welcome back and I hope you had an opportunity to add this into your editor and try it out.

05:14.260 --> 05:17.500
Go ahead and see that refreshed the page.

05:17.500 --> 05:22.740
So we see that we're getting asked for the questions and so everything is working properly.

05:22.840 --> 05:25.200
And let's also put a task there.

05:25.270 --> 05:29.370
So we've got all of our array values that are contained within that task.

05:29.530 --> 05:37.460
And I believe that you might have different ones and me depending on what what you thought was needed

05:37.460 --> 05:39.770
to get done during the day and then next.

05:39.800 --> 05:41.860
We've gone to progress as well.

05:41.870 --> 05:47.420
So it's always a good idea to go into your console just to make sure that those values are there and

05:47.420 --> 05:52.580
that there's nothing wrong with your script that everything is functioning properly and everything looks

05:52.580 --> 05:53.770
to be proper.

05:53.870 --> 05:57.080
And so now we're able to actually create a result.

05:57.230 --> 05:59.330
So we've asked that two questions.

05:59.330 --> 06:02.150
First one has got to ask which task we want to tackle.

06:02.210 --> 06:06.610
The second one is asking what status we want to enter in.

06:06.620 --> 06:10.850
How far of the progress we want to specify for that task.

06:10.880 --> 06:17.660
And so lastly let's just add this into the console because we've got the console opened up here and

06:17.720 --> 06:20.410
will console log the results.

06:20.630 --> 06:24.980
So let's say that for

06:28.240 --> 06:28.870
today

06:31.810 --> 06:33.700
you will.

06:33.700 --> 06:36.500
And let's add in string value.

06:36.640 --> 06:45.110
So remember we have to recall the value of the task and with that number here within the question.

06:45.130 --> 06:48.100
So let's go ahead and put that within the brackets.

06:48.130 --> 06:49.660
So this is the same thing.

06:49.660 --> 06:54.370
First I'll show you if we're just going to use some defaults of one and then I'll bring in the values

06:54.460 --> 06:55.880
of the questions.

06:55.900 --> 06:56.680
So next

07:00.810 --> 07:11.720
you have status or you just put status of task and will put an equal sign there.

07:11.880 --> 07:21.610
And then next we need to concatenate in some additional information into this return result.

07:21.610 --> 07:27.940
So we're going to put progress and we're going to use the default of one as well.

07:27.940 --> 07:32.550
So this is just a default console message and go ahead.

07:32.590 --> 07:33.860
Try this out.

07:34.270 --> 07:35.560
We're going to refresh it.

07:35.560 --> 07:37.830
So which tasks do we want to tackle.

07:37.870 --> 07:39.570
And we haven't linked in the questions yet.

07:39.580 --> 07:40.930
So it actually doesn't matter.

07:40.930 --> 07:45.930
Today you will read a book status of the task is in progress.

07:46.180 --> 07:56.050
So next thing that I want you to do is to pause the video and create a dynamic response from the prompts

07:56.470 --> 07:57.990
into the console.

07:58.180 --> 08:06.850
So dynamically allow the user to pick one of the tasks and then also pick the status of the task and

08:06.850 --> 08:09.690
see the result within the console.

08:09.700 --> 08:17.230
And one thing to note that that the arrays do start with zero.

08:17.410 --> 08:19.040
So this one is zero.

08:19.060 --> 08:22.950
That one is one that's two and that's three.

08:22.960 --> 08:28.840
So there's a bit of a challenge in there that you've got to make sure that the user is only picking

08:28.840 --> 08:31.890
one to four because there's four items in here.

08:31.990 --> 08:40.400
But we want to make sure that the user can actually select the correct one the corresponding task.

08:40.420 --> 08:46.980
So take a look at the code plus the video and I'm going to show you the solution coming up.

08:49.010 --> 08:56.870
So you got an opportunity to try that out and we know that our products are returning values here so

08:56.870 --> 09:01.560
we can put the value of question 1 and Question 2 in there.

09:01.670 --> 09:09.420
And one thing to note that these values are not going to correspond with the items there.

09:09.500 --> 09:16.280
We do need to be more specific that we want to actually return a task value.

09:16.540 --> 09:21.020
So let's update the return value of the prompt and we're going to do.

09:21.020 --> 09:26.950
QUESTION And we're going to subtract one from the value of question and the same thing we need to do

09:27.190 --> 09:32.700
as well for the question to we need to subtract a value of 1 from that.

09:32.700 --> 09:36.780
QUESTION So try that out.

09:36.800 --> 09:43.800
Open up your browser refresh the page and let's see if this works.

09:43.820 --> 09:48.610
So what's TASC and we've got our Taso one two three four.

09:48.650 --> 09:52.190
Not to get confused with the index values with an array.

09:52.190 --> 09:53.920
So let's take the first task

09:56.830 --> 10:01.680
which is take out the garbage and then the second one for progress.

10:01.780 --> 10:04.870
Let's see that this one is to do.

10:04.900 --> 10:06.480
So we're going to give it a 3.

10:06.730 --> 10:11.920
So today you will take out garbage status of task is to do.

10:12.100 --> 10:14.220
So everything is working properly.

10:14.380 --> 10:18.410
And this was important to know that we always need to start.

10:18.430 --> 10:20.770
We started zero with the index values.

10:20.860 --> 10:26.230
And when we were calling the array items we need to use the index value.

10:26.360 --> 10:31.420
So that's where we've got that negative one that we needed to add in there just to be sure that we're

10:31.690 --> 10:37.260
just to be correct in correct selecting that correct index value.

10:37.510 --> 10:43.830
So the next lesson we're going to look at some Are rate properties and to make this even more dynamic.

10:43.840 --> 10:45.630
So that's coming up in the next lesson.
