Come back in in this lesson we're going to look at the window object navigator.

00:05.200 --> 00:11.920
So basically this gives us more information we can get geolocation and basically that means that we

00:11.920 --> 00:14.890
can determine where the user is located.

00:14.890 --> 00:19.810
So let's set that up and we're going to do a window on load.

00:20.950 --> 00:24.180
And we're going to launch our a function called NIIT.

00:24.200 --> 00:27.210
So let's set up that function set up a function.

00:27.210 --> 00:33.010
So basically whenever the window loads that we want to run this function and this is one of those key

00:33.010 --> 00:39.700
things that we do need to do because we are going to be loading a map within our page and we definitely

00:39.700 --> 00:46.050
want the map to load ahead of time before we try to access and position it.

00:46.150 --> 00:51.340
So within the navigator there's already options for geo location.

00:51.340 --> 00:59.440
So if you do a console and if you do navigator or we can do console directories so that we can see all

00:59.440 --> 01:03.360
the different pieces of what's available within the navigator.

01:03.400 --> 01:05.630
So it's just called Navigator.

01:06.130 --> 01:13.550
Now let me get rid of that extra and the one that we're going to look at is geo location.

01:13.940 --> 01:15.160
So let's add that in.

01:15.170 --> 01:22.400
So basically let's launch the page and let's open up our console and we can see that we've got our geo

01:22.400 --> 01:30.950
location here and within the geo location we've got some information here so we can run a method called

01:30.980 --> 01:32.370
Get current position.

01:32.540 --> 01:38.540
And this is actually going to return back our current position our latitude and longitude and a bunch

01:38.540 --> 01:39.690
of information.

01:39.710 --> 01:41.620
So let me show you how to do that.

01:41.660 --> 01:45.150
And let's set that up within our console.

01:45.380 --> 01:51.170
So within the console directory We saw that we can get geo location and it had a method that's attached

01:51.170 --> 01:53.730
to it called Get current position.

01:53.750 --> 02:00.710
So if you place the one in this basically gives us the ability to call a method and basically we can

02:00.710 --> 02:04.260
return back on the call back the data that we're returning there.

02:04.310 --> 02:07.640
So let's pass the over into a brand new function.

02:07.640 --> 02:13.130
We're going to call it place VAP and we're going to pull that data into our place map and this is actually

02:13.130 --> 02:15.800
where we're going to do our Konsole directory.

02:15.800 --> 02:22.120
So now we're passing in the data object and we're going to make use of that within this function.

02:22.280 --> 02:26.250
And this is basically how you can actually this should be placed up.

02:26.270 --> 02:27.260
So let's.

02:27.470 --> 02:35.030
And it will automatically pass the parameters from current position into the function plate SMAC place

02:35.030 --> 02:40.580
map and pass it as an argument here that we can pick it up within the function.

02:40.730 --> 02:43.580
So it's good and try the suits go first.

02:43.650 --> 02:48.880
Make sure received go and refresh and you see that now it's actually asking.

02:48.980 --> 02:54.560
It wants to make sure that know your location so you can allow or block it if you block it.

02:54.560 --> 03:00.380
Then this method won't actually work if you allow it then it's actually been able to pick up your coordinates

03:00.650 --> 03:05.190
and your position within within the Javascript.

03:05.240 --> 03:10.190
And then of course you can make use of these coordinates within your javascript coding so you're going

03:10.190 --> 03:14.480
to have a lot of tude in the Londa tude and some other additional information.

03:14.480 --> 03:17.510
So what I want you to do now is try this out for yourself.

03:17.510 --> 03:19.060
So pause the video.

03:19.160 --> 03:28.730
And create a window onload launch the function I NIIT and then use navigator geo location get current

03:28.730 --> 03:34.700
position so this is camel case current position and create a function to pick up the data that's being

03:34.700 --> 03:41.570
passed and then pick up that data and coming up I'm going to show you how we can pull back the latitude

03:41.630 --> 03:46.230
and longitude and make use of it within Google Maps.

03:46.250 --> 03:50.890
So that's coming up in the next.

03:50.890 --> 03:51.910
The next lesson.

03:51.960 --> 03:57.330
But for now just make sure that you can pull back the position you can get your latitude and longitude

03:57.390 --> 04:01.980
where you're currently located and you're ready to use that in the next lesson we're going to be making

04:01.980 --> 04:06.430
use of that where we're going to show you your location on Google Maps.

04:06.430 --> 04:07.080
That's coming up.
