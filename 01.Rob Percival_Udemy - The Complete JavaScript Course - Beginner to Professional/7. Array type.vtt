This lesson we're going to be going over more details about arrays.

00:05.490 --> 00:12.030
So previously we saw that there was a number of data types that are in javascript and noticed that array

00:12.030 --> 00:13.920
actually isn't a data type.

00:14.010 --> 00:22.650
So if we do our type of method and we specify task which is our array from our code and we see that

00:22.740 --> 00:25.890
we get return back that it's actually an object.

00:25.980 --> 00:29.900
So it's not actually an array type.

00:29.990 --> 00:33.070
It's an object but it's a special type of object.

00:33.140 --> 00:37.990
And we're going to be looking at objects in more detail in the upcoming lessons as well.

00:37.990 --> 00:44.450
There is another built in method that I want to take a quick look at and this one is called array is

00:44.540 --> 00:51.850
array and this actually lets us check to see if a value of an array is an actual or an array.

00:51.860 --> 00:57.140
So all we need to do is answer the phone I re between the rounded brackets.

00:57.260 --> 01:02.420
So passing it as a value within this method and we can see that it gets returned back.

01:02.420 --> 01:03.680
That this is true.

01:03.830 --> 01:05.840
So this is an actual array.

01:05.900 --> 01:14.000
If we take an item from that array we can get returned back and we see that this is actually false because

01:14.060 --> 01:21.470
that item within that array is not an array of itself and we can also when it comes to race we can actually

01:21.470 --> 01:23.960
put arrays within themselves as well.

01:24.020 --> 01:27.640
And then I was showing you that as well coming up in the upcoming lessons.

01:27.650 --> 01:37.640
So next let's go back to Type of and task and we'll specify that we can actually see the different items

01:37.730 --> 01:41.020
in the array and we can see all of their data types.

01:41.180 --> 01:44.150
So we can specify that when we select typeof.

01:44.360 --> 01:51.410
So we see that all of those items are treated as separate values and they've got their own properties

01:51.410 --> 01:52.620
associated with them.

01:52.760 --> 01:54.770
So I know that this one is a string.

01:54.770 --> 02:00.260
And obviously this is a string because we've got the quotes around it and we can have multiple different

02:00.260 --> 02:03.500
data types contained within the array.

02:03.500 --> 02:12.770
So the array is just a collection of items that we can use to store multiple values within one variable.

02:12.770 --> 02:15.620
The next lesson has another exercise coming up.
