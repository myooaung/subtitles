00:02.610 --> 00:07.180
Won't come back and in the last lesson we left off building out our game board.

00:07.340 --> 00:15.640
So you know we need to set up a function called build in order to output our gameboard and our gameboard

00:15.700 --> 00:18.270
is going to be built from a loop.

00:18.520 --> 00:24.160
So we know that the loop is going to be based around the length of our array values.

00:24.190 --> 00:34.840
So let's say X equals zero and we're going to loop through X while my array length is greater than the

00:34.840 --> 00:36.080
value of x.

00:36.340 --> 00:38.190
And then just increment x.

00:38.230 --> 00:42.650
So this is our basic foundation for building out this loop.

00:42.940 --> 00:45.340
We also need a holder for.

00:45.340 --> 00:53.720
So I'm going to set up some H2 Himmel and I can start that off by I'll call it the name game.

00:58.700 --> 01:04.010
So I want to create a default value because within here all I'm going to be doing is I'm going to be

01:04.010 --> 01:12.680
just incrementing each Tamal so I'm going to be adding concatenating even more and more to it as we

01:12.680 --> 01:14.880
build out that object.

01:14.900 --> 01:25.730
And then lastly I'm going to do the document get element by id and then select our output area and then

01:25.790 --> 01:33.100
update the inner h to M-L with h m l value from the variable.

01:33.230 --> 01:35.060
So that's what we're going to be building out.

01:35.330 --> 01:40.650
So next what we need to do is we need to populate some type of values in here.

01:40.820 --> 01:45.060
And usually when I'm generating these dynamically I use the single quotes.

01:45.080 --> 01:50.960
This is because I usually like to keep the double quotes within my H-2 him else a div and give them

01:51.050 --> 01:52.830
a class of box.

01:52.850 --> 01:56.010
These are those box elements that we created.

01:56.480 --> 02:03.120
And we also we need to add a string value in there.

02:03.230 --> 02:04.550
So I was going to call it

02:08.120 --> 02:14.450
I've got to put hidden in it for now so that this is because we don't want the users to be able to see

02:14.450 --> 02:21.350
the contents of this as of yet and we're going to use the mouseover and so it and the mouse click as

02:21.350 --> 02:22.790
well as

02:25.380 --> 02:27.770
event handlers for this exercise.

02:27.900 --> 02:28.620
So hidden.

02:28.650 --> 02:36.630
And I'm going to just do the value of x or maybe I can do X plus 1 so that we're not starting at zero

02:36.660 --> 02:40.860
because we know that arrays do start at zero.

02:41.070 --> 02:43.410
So so will incremented oats.

02:43.460 --> 02:46.080
And let's let's see where we are right now.

02:46.190 --> 02:49.460
So we start we build out all of the elements.

02:49.460 --> 02:50.570
So right now it's hidden.

02:50.570 --> 02:53.050
And right now not much is happening.

02:53.150 --> 02:59.680
So we need to add in the mouseover But we also need to add in that string value.

03:01.050 --> 03:07.890
So I'm going to just create a holder here called string and it's going to take the value of my array

03:07.980 --> 03:08.490
x

03:12.080 --> 03:17.430
and I'm also going to show you a quick way to scramble the letters.

03:17.510 --> 03:27.380
So this is a combination of what you can do with strings that string method and we are going to be looking

03:27.380 --> 03:33.470
at this later on in the course so I don't want to go into too much detail but basically what this does

03:33.470 --> 03:36.630
is similar to the function that we have up here.

03:36.650 --> 03:44.240
So this will randomize the Basically we're splitting off so we're splitting the strings then we're sorting

03:44.240 --> 03:49.180
them and then we're randomizing them and then we're joining them all back together again.

03:49.190 --> 03:56.510
So basically what's going to happen is that we get shuffled value of that string value.

03:56.510 --> 04:02.600
So what I can do temporarily I can put it here underneath that hidden.

04:02.840 --> 04:05.740
So let's let's do that so we can actually see it.

04:15.330 --> 04:19.160
So let's refresh the browser it's start.

04:19.320 --> 04:24.860
So now we've got the scrambled names and you can see that every time it's scrambling them differently.

04:24.870 --> 04:28.710
So this is just adds an added element into the gameplay.

04:28.710 --> 04:30.740
So this does not need to be there.

04:31.050 --> 04:36.720
It's just adding that scrambled effect so that these names are not as easy to read and that you can't

04:36.720 --> 04:41.310
click on it and sometimes you can even make a mistake with it if you're trying to go too quickly.

04:41.310 --> 04:44.700
So that gives a little bit more added benefit into the gameplay.

04:45.860 --> 04:54.780
All right so we wanted to use the mouse over on mouseover an on mouse out in order to show the text.

04:54.780 --> 04:58.740
So we want to show the shuffled value and then we want to hide it again.

04:58.740 --> 05:06.300
So let's add those event listeners so on mouse over.

05:07.460 --> 05:15.960
And we also want to add on most so that we can actually reset on most out.

05:16.350 --> 05:20.580
So this will actually reset it back to what it was.

05:20.580 --> 05:24.750
So basically this should say that same value that hidden X plus one.

05:25.200 --> 05:33.980
So what I want to do is I actually want to pass these values up so let's create some functions so I

05:33.980 --> 05:36.950
create a function to update the text.

05:36.950 --> 05:40.110
So basically this is going to be updating the text as we move out.

05:40.220 --> 05:48.580
So we need to pass in the values that we want to update and I want to pass in this as well as passing

05:48.670 --> 05:49.390
the value.

05:49.400 --> 05:51.570
That was the shuffled value.

05:53.210 --> 05:58.210
And this is actually going to get a little bit tricky because of the quotes.

05:58.280 --> 06:05.060
So we've got the double quotes we've got the single quotes and in here we need to break out of the double

06:05.060 --> 06:05.950
quotes.

06:06.050 --> 06:14.610
So we do have our way to break out of the quotes so we can break out of that quote and we can do our

06:14.610 --> 06:16.050
actual single quote.

06:16.050 --> 06:18.030
So that's just two of them in a row.

06:18.180 --> 06:19.840
Let's add that value.

06:19.860 --> 06:25.050
That was the shuffled value because this is what I want the text to actually say.

06:25.200 --> 06:32.320
And let's finish off that and then break out of the escape character as well.

06:32.340 --> 06:34.060
So we're keeping that single quote.

06:34.320 --> 06:37.870
So basically we're able to escape the single quote that way.

06:38.130 --> 06:43.010
And the other one is going to actually pass that same same function.

06:43.080 --> 06:44.670
So we're going to pass it up to you.

06:44.680 --> 06:52.860
Text and it's going to pass this and this time instead of the shuffled value it's going to pass and

06:53.430 --> 06:53.980
hit.

06:54.010 --> 07:00.610
So it's going to say the same thing that it already says hit him and we need to pass in the value of

07:00.640 --> 07:07.340
x plus 1.

07:07.430 --> 07:09.180
So the function for this one.

07:09.190 --> 07:17.450
Now I want you to pause the video and create a function called the you text to take in these parameters

07:17.720 --> 07:25.250
and update the values that are available within that element that's been selected and we're passing

07:25.490 --> 07:28.970
this over so we can retrieve it as well.

07:28.970 --> 07:34.690
On the other end and we could also not pass over this so we could use the target.

07:34.760 --> 07:36.980
So that's optional as well.

07:36.980 --> 07:41.680
So what we need to do now is we want to update the inner text of this.

07:41.780 --> 07:43.280
So let me show you how we can do that.

07:43.280 --> 07:46.970
Suppose the video give it a try and I'll show you the solution.

07:47.470 --> 07:54.390
It's a solution is picking up those both as parameters and we're going to do t.

07:54.390 --> 07:56.430
So that's this object.

07:56.430 --> 08:03.030
So basically the current object we're just picking that up then there and then the message is simply

08:03.630 --> 08:05.850
the content that we're sending over there.

08:05.850 --> 08:10.080
So let's go back and we'll refresh the plage click.

08:10.170 --> 08:16.430
And now whenever we hover over it we see that we get it we can hover in and hover.

08:16.620 --> 08:20.440
And we get a quick glimpse at the name that's being hidden there.

08:20.880 --> 08:26.820
So there was one more event listener that I want to add in here and that's going to be the on click.

08:27.060 --> 08:29.250
So we're going to do it within that same format.

08:34.290 --> 08:41.440
And this one we need to have a way to remove the element and check if it's right.

08:41.460 --> 08:43.890
So we'll just call it our al.

08:44.160 --> 08:49.000
So this will be removing the element and we're going to pass over the same parameters.

08:51.170 --> 08:59.120
And instead of you text Let's pass this over and instead of passing over shuffled we're going to pass

08:59.120 --> 09:05.570
over the actual string value so the unscrambled string value is what we're going to pass over there.

09:05.570 --> 09:06.830
So that's on click.

09:06.860 --> 09:09.580
And we still need to create the function for that.

09:09.890 --> 09:16.160
So what I want you to do now pause the video create the function for this to pick up this information

09:16.220 --> 09:22.670
that's contained within here and then the next thing that we need to do is we need to create a condition

09:22.730 --> 09:29.540
in order to match and check to see if the users selected the right value.

09:29.550 --> 09:31.920
So let's go ahead and create that function.

09:31.920 --> 09:39.960
So this function is the one that we're going to launch when the users making their guess to see if they've

09:39.960 --> 09:41.790
actually selected the right person.

09:41.790 --> 09:48.450
So we're passing in this object and we're also passing in the correct string value.

09:49.320 --> 09:56.770
So we know that we want to place the the key that we're looking for within the global key value.

09:56.790 --> 10:03.580
So we know that we can do a quick check to see if S is going to be equal to key.

10:03.840 --> 10:07.540
And if it is then we know that they've got it correct.

10:07.560 --> 10:09.650
So this is correct.

10:10.050 --> 10:13.460
And Else they got it wrong.

10:14.340 --> 10:17.790
So we need to create some type of actions for that as well.

10:18.900 --> 10:23.080
So again if you could pause the video and add in the messaging.

10:23.190 --> 10:29.770
So just as we did before where we could send messages to one of the elements we've got two of them now.

10:29.910 --> 10:35.610
So we need a message one and a message to function in order to send and retrieve messages so that we

10:35.610 --> 10:37.730
don't have to comment them in here.

10:37.740 --> 10:41.290
We can actually output them visually to the player of the game.

10:41.310 --> 10:46.180
So pause the video and add those in and I'll show you how to do that as well.

10:46.200 --> 10:55.350
So message so message one and we're picking up our message within this function and what we're doing

10:55.350 --> 10:56.910
is we're simply outputting.

10:56.940 --> 11:03.720
So we're doing document get element by id and then we've done this a number of times but it's always

11:03.720 --> 11:12.690
good to practice this up because this is really important to just get really familiar with all of the

11:12.690 --> 11:15.770
selection process and so on.

11:15.780 --> 11:22.230
So this one is message so it's going to output the message to the top 1 and then we're going to duplicate

11:22.230 --> 11:25.230
it and do a second one here at the bottom.

11:26.870 --> 11:30.820
So that sets up both of our message messaging functions.

11:31.850 --> 11:34.730
So let's go back up to our start game function.

11:34.730 --> 11:37.730
So we've got build build us taken care of.

11:37.940 --> 11:43.640
And lastly we need to create a function in order to find the users name.

11:43.760 --> 11:45.910
So we need to initiate that.

11:45.920 --> 11:48.640
So this one we're just going to call it find person

11:52.000 --> 11:53.490
and we'll launch that one.

11:53.500 --> 11:59.710
And what about this one just underneath here.

11:59.800 --> 12:07.000
So basically this is where we're actually going to do our randomiser for the key value.

12:07.210 --> 12:14.500
So let's set that key value here and add in a random value and then we're going to put it in message

12:14.590 --> 12:21.680
one that find this name.

12:22.930 --> 12:30.440
So find this name and then let's add in the value of.

12:30.500 --> 12:37.950
So what I want you to do now as well is to pause the video and go back to one of the earlier lessons

12:38.220 --> 12:42.830
where we found a random value from the array.

12:42.850 --> 12:48.320
So remember we're using math floor and math at random and we're multiplying it by the railings.

12:48.480 --> 12:55.160
And that basically gave us a random index value from the items in the array.

12:55.320 --> 12:57.920
And then we could return back a random value.

12:58.170 --> 13:06.210
So pause the video and put that value into key here to grab a random item from the array and I'll show

13:06.210 --> 13:07.050
you how to do that.

13:09.220 --> 13:15.890
So first of all we're going to just need the array so I'm going to do it within all within one statement.

13:16.030 --> 13:18.420
And these were the math statements.

13:18.460 --> 13:25.180
So math floor because we know that we're going to return back of value that's going to have a big decimal

13:25.180 --> 13:27.790
point list attached to it.

13:28.060 --> 13:29.180
So let's do math.

13:29.200 --> 13:30.520
Random.

13:30.790 --> 13:40.080
And when we multiply math random by a number that gives us a random value from 0 to that number.

13:40.240 --> 13:47.550
So if we multiply it by the array length then we get a random value from 0 to the length of the array.

13:47.680 --> 13:52.050
And that's exactly what we need to produce a random value.

13:52.420 --> 14:03.290
So now let's let's refresh the page and click start and it says find Lawrence and it still looks like

14:03.290 --> 14:05.350
I forgot one of the quotes here.

14:05.480 --> 14:12.190
So let's let's refresh start again and hopefully this time it builds the name so spline Mike.

14:12.290 --> 14:14.600
So now we've got our auction.

14:14.630 --> 14:16.030
We've got Mike down here.

14:16.190 --> 14:22.400
And the next part of the game is to finish off this function where we can click it and we can check

14:22.400 --> 14:24.800
to see if the values are matching.

14:25.220 --> 14:27.340
So that's coming up in the next lesson.
