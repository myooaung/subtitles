00:01.170 --> 00:06.170
Come back in this lesson we're going to do a quick exercise where we're going to build a shopping list

00:06.380 --> 00:10.990
where we can dynamically add to our shopping list using javascript.

00:11.030 --> 00:15.290
So we're going to take some of the code that we had previously and we're going to make some updates

00:15.290 --> 00:17.270
to it so instead of adding a friend.

00:17.300 --> 00:27.190
We're adding an item and instead of this one to list so we can keep that one the same as well.

00:27.350 --> 00:35.990
And instead of having output we're going to have a bunch of listed items so we'll start by doing an

00:36.000 --> 00:36.500
H1

00:39.160 --> 00:42.080
and this will be the shopping list.

00:44.590 --> 00:49.630
And instead of using a table we're going to use an unordered list.

00:49.690 --> 00:57.640
So an unordered list and we're going to give this one an ID of S list.

00:57.710 --> 01:02.900
So this is going to be our shopping list and all of the elements that we're going to creating are going

01:02.900 --> 01:04.700
to be added into the shopping list.

01:04.730 --> 01:07.710
Nascent neatly into a list format.

01:09.950 --> 01:16.070
So what I want you to do now is pause the video and take what we learned from the previous lesson and

01:16.160 --> 01:18.470
build out this shopping list.

01:18.500 --> 01:20.930
So there's a number of steps that we need to take.

01:20.930 --> 01:29.480
So the first thing that we need to do is we need to click to add new and then from there we need to

01:29.480 --> 01:33.800
get the value of the new item.

01:33.800 --> 01:40.130
So get the value of the new item and we need to simply we need to create.

01:40.520 --> 01:44.730
So we have to create a new new list item.

01:44.780 --> 01:50.470
So create a brand new list item and within that list item.

01:50.470 --> 02:01.330
So we have to add text to new list item and then we need to append that list item to the ordered list.

02:01.630 --> 02:05.620
So those are the steps that we need to take in order to accomplish this.

02:05.620 --> 02:06.670
So what I want you to do.

02:06.730 --> 02:12.250
Pause the video take what we've learned from the previous lessons and apply it to build out the shopping

02:12.250 --> 02:12.790
list.

02:12.790 --> 02:14.790
And I'm going to show you the solution.

02:14.830 --> 02:20.410
Coming up so hope you had an opportunity to try that.

02:20.680 --> 02:25.240
So now this lesson we want to build out a shopping list.

02:25.240 --> 02:32.810
So let's go ahead and we're going to get element by ID in order to create that element and make it clickable

02:33.010 --> 02:43.150
so documents and get element by id and the ID that we had here is new and new and we'll use the On Click

02:43.900 --> 02:47.580
handler and from here we're going to set up a function.

02:47.740 --> 02:52.300
And then what's going to happen within this function we're going to call to another function.

02:52.300 --> 02:58.300
So this function is going to call out and it's going to call to another function where we're actually

02:58.300 --> 03:00.150
going to add an item to the list.

03:00.310 --> 03:05.680
So we're going to have any information within there because we don't need to handle this or anything

03:05.680 --> 03:06.330
like that.

03:06.490 --> 03:11.240
And if we need a tool we could always pass it within this type of format as well.

03:11.230 --> 03:17.700
So this is how you can connect anonymous function to an actual named function.

03:18.070 --> 03:20.290
So click on one.

03:20.320 --> 03:21.950
So now we need to.

03:22.090 --> 03:26.490
So basically we've taken care of the first item.

03:26.530 --> 03:33.220
So we've added a click event and just to always make sure it's always a good idea when you add a click

03:33.220 --> 03:37.180
event just to make sure that it's actually connected and working.

03:37.180 --> 03:44.130
So sometimes when you're writing out your script and you it's not working and then you go to debug.

03:44.230 --> 03:47.090
You're not going to be sure what's actually gone wrong or what's happened.

03:47.110 --> 03:48.930
So always take it step by step.

03:48.940 --> 03:53.520
Run it through your console make sure that your first step is done.

03:53.620 --> 03:57.950
And you can actually check this part off now and let's move on to the next one.

03:58.000 --> 04:03.000
So the next one is we need to get the value of the item.

04:03.210 --> 04:11.090
So we have a text item called new item and this is we need to get the actual value of it.

04:11.340 --> 04:14.250
So let's do and let's just set up a variable.

04:14.250 --> 04:20.090
Call it a and document get element by ID.

04:20.230 --> 04:26.080
And this is definitely the most popular one that gets used most often because it's really the easiest

04:26.080 --> 04:31.600
one to make our selection because we know that within our age to Mel we only have one with that ID.

04:31.660 --> 04:35.660
So that's why most popular one gets used so that's it.

04:35.680 --> 04:37.790
We're able to grab the value.

04:37.830 --> 04:44.580
And again it's always a good idea to use your developer console to make sure that you're actually picking

04:44.580 --> 04:45.590
up that value.

04:45.720 --> 04:47.430
So let's enter in test.

04:47.460 --> 04:50.220
We see that we're picking it up within our function.

04:50.310 --> 04:51.450
So we're ready to go.

04:51.450 --> 04:53.340
To move on to the third step.

04:53.550 --> 04:59.160
So the third step is to create a brand new element so let's create that one and we're going to do it

04:59.160 --> 05:03.770
within the same format as we did earlier so we'll create it within a variable ally.

05:03.930 --> 05:13.540
And this one is documents and this time we're doing creates elements.

05:13.720 --> 05:20.950
So basically it allows us to create an element and element that we're creating is a list item Elyot.

05:21.430 --> 05:27.820
So now we've created a brand new list item and there's really not much we can do to test the site.

05:27.940 --> 05:36.040
So the next thing that we need to do is we need to take this list item and we need to add in the text

05:36.040 --> 05:36.600
value.

05:36.730 --> 05:38.570
So remember how we did it last time.

05:38.590 --> 05:39.160
So go ahead.

05:39.160 --> 05:41.560
Pause the video if you haven't already done so.

05:41.830 --> 05:47.920
And add that brand new tech into the list item.

05:47.930 --> 05:54.290
Now there were a number of answers to this and well last time we also saw we could use enraged him to

05:54.290 --> 05:58.150
add in some text or enter text so we could do that as well.

05:58.190 --> 06:02.730
But we're going to do it within the methods that are provided within Javascript.

06:02.750 --> 06:09.100
So let's do it list item and we're going to append child and then within the child.

06:09.140 --> 06:12.010
This is where we're going to create a brand new text node.

06:12.230 --> 06:22.140
So this again is document and create and we're creating a text not so text no.

06:22.160 --> 06:28.520
And basically this is gives us the ability to create a brand new text node and the value of the text

06:28.520 --> 06:32.730
node is going to be what we're picking up from this input field here.

06:32.750 --> 06:33.290
So that's it.

06:33.290 --> 06:37.010
So now we've got a text node in there so let's save that.

06:37.040 --> 06:41.550
And let's before we go on to our last step.

06:41.850 --> 06:45.280
Just make sure that everything is working so do test.

06:45.300 --> 06:47.070
We see that we've got the list item.

06:47.130 --> 06:56.210
We've got test inside of it and now the last thing that we need to do is add our ally to our list.

06:56.280 --> 06:57.350
So go ahead.

06:57.360 --> 07:02.940
Pause the video if you haven't already found the solution and try it out for yourself.

07:03.070 --> 07:09.650
Add in that newly created a list item into the ordered list that we have within our H.T..

07:09.690 --> 07:11.140
Remember this ordered list.

07:11.160 --> 07:12.320
We gave it an I.D..

07:12.390 --> 07:14.900
So it's really easy to identify.

07:14.910 --> 07:19.720
So go ahead and add that item and I'll show you the solution.

07:19.890 --> 07:28.700
Coming up so the solution to it is that we all have to do is to append child so documents get element

07:28.700 --> 07:35.030
by id and we know that this one is really easy to identify because we already have an ID for it.

07:35.030 --> 07:37.910
So we had given an ID of S list.

07:37.910 --> 07:46.610
So let's grab that one S list and next we need to do the math that append child to it and the child

07:46.610 --> 07:47.740
that we're spending.

07:47.780 --> 07:50.070
So that goes with those rounded brackets.

07:50.240 --> 07:52.350
And that's the ally.

07:52.820 --> 07:53.980
So basically that's it.

07:53.990 --> 07:56.710
We can get rid of our cons..

07:56.780 --> 08:00.880
And lastly let's try this just to make sure it's works.

08:00.890 --> 08:11.890
So this is our shopping list so it's out and I pull out in an orange let's add in our banana and so

08:11.890 --> 08:12.040
on.

08:12.040 --> 08:14.270
So everything is working properly.

08:15.320 --> 08:18.070
And we can create a shopping list on the fly.

08:18.110 --> 08:19.820
All via javascript.
