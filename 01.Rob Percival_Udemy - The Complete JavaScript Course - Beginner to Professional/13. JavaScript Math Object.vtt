00:02.020 --> 00:02.750
Welcome back.

00:02.770 --> 00:08.800
And in this lesson we're going to look at math and we've already seen what we can do with math.

00:08.830 --> 00:10.270
We're creating random.

00:10.270 --> 00:12.040
We were rounding it down.

00:12.040 --> 00:16.150
So let's show you some more that you can do with math so going to set a variable.

00:16.150 --> 00:21.090
I'm going to call it am and we're going to do math and we're going to.

00:21.220 --> 00:25.920
So we've got a number of options for math and there's quite a few of them there.

00:25.930 --> 00:32.360
So basically if we do math PI this is going to return back into our con..

00:32.440 --> 00:35.670
And I got to do a lot of the math functions within the con..

00:35.800 --> 00:39.590
So we're starting out with a value of m and this is pi.

00:39.610 --> 00:49.420
So we can set the value of pi using math and we also saw with math we can do math floor.

00:49.420 --> 00:55.330
So basically what math floor on em what do you think the the value is going to be here when we do math

00:55.330 --> 00:55.940
floor.

00:56.050 --> 01:00.490
We see that value of n now becomes 3.

01:00.520 --> 01:07.080
We also have even more options so other than floor we've got a number of other ones as well.

01:07.120 --> 01:12.400
And you can see that here that there's just a ton of options here within math.

01:12.420 --> 01:20.050
So most of them they're very useful but unless you're actually doing some math it's not going to be

01:20.110 --> 01:22.870
something that you're going to be using quite often.

01:22.870 --> 01:27.300
There's math around so often times you just need to round numbers.

01:27.430 --> 01:32.020
So this will round it to the lowest or the highest depending on what it is.

01:32.020 --> 01:36.000
And if I'm rounding em what do you think my value is going to be.

01:36.130 --> 01:38.010
And if you said three you're correct.

01:38.050 --> 01:45.090
So we have the ability to random round it to the nearest whole number.

01:45.320 --> 01:47.110
We've also got cieling.

01:47.120 --> 01:54.780
So if we wanted to do math and instead of round we can do ceiling.

01:54.810 --> 01:58.590
So what do you think the value of m is going to be when I do ceiling.

01:58.650 --> 02:03.680
And if you said four you're correct because this round set up to the nearest integer

02:06.690 --> 02:09.670
we can also do math absolute.

02:09.720 --> 02:16.050
So what math absolute does is this gives us the ability to return a positive value.

02:16.050 --> 02:18.290
So sometimes this is useful as well.

02:18.330 --> 02:19.830
When you do end conditions.

02:19.830 --> 02:29.340
So if I have a value and it's negative 5 or negative five point whatever we do abs and basically that

02:29.340 --> 02:37.090
turns it into a positive number so we can return back a numeric value and keep it positive.

02:37.200 --> 02:43.390
We've also got a few other ones as well so there's some math where we can do a square root.

02:43.410 --> 02:45.750
So this is square root.

02:46.110 --> 02:49.080
And basically we can get a square root of a number.

02:49.080 --> 02:53.790
So if we do 100 We know that ten times ten is one hundred.

02:53.820 --> 02:56.820
We can also do the opposite where we do math.

02:56.880 --> 02:57.600
Pow.

02:57.810 --> 03:02.580
So basically this multiplies it to the power of whatever.

03:02.580 --> 03:08.460
So if we want to do 10 to the power of 2 then that returns back 100

03:11.330 --> 03:18.230
so with math it's just important to know that you have the ability to grab numbers and manipulate those

03:18.230 --> 03:22.870
numbers using the built in math object in Javascript.

03:22.910 --> 03:27.010
And now what I want to do is so we've already done this before.

03:27.020 --> 03:35.620
But what I want you to do is pause the video and create a random number anywhere from 1 to 100.

03:35.630 --> 03:42.650
So go ahead and try that out and I'll show you the solution coming up soapie had an opportunity to try

03:42.650 --> 03:45.580
that out and I'll show you the solution.

03:45.590 --> 03:53.000
So this is going to be a random number so we can do random number or just who are our number.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.680
So a random number.

03:54.860 --> 03:59.540
And we want to make it from from 1 to 100.

03:59.540 --> 04:05.210
So this basically means that we can do a random number and we know that when we do floor we round it

04:05.210 --> 04:10.180
down to the closest numbers so we've got.

04:10.490 --> 04:12.780
We round down all those decimal places.

04:12.810 --> 04:18.040
So if we do math seeling that will actually round it up.

04:18.060 --> 04:19.540
So do math the ceiling.

04:19.560 --> 04:23.120
And then in here we do that math random.

04:23.250 --> 04:25.650
So this is the one that we had done before.

04:25.650 --> 04:26.760
So math random.

04:26.790 --> 04:31.740
And then we just need to multiply it by the number that we want to bring it to.

04:31.740 --> 04:35.450
So math random and then multiply by 100.

04:35.670 --> 04:41.370
But because we want a number from from 1 to 100 when we round up.

04:41.400 --> 04:47.210
So if we get ninety nine point whatever one two or whatever we want to round that up.

04:47.250 --> 04:49.030
So that will bring us to 100.

04:49.050 --> 04:55.760
So if we end up with a number of zero dot whatever and we use cieling that will bring us up to 1.

04:55.770 --> 05:01.430
So essentially giving us a random number from 1 to 100.

05:02.190 --> 05:08.930
So you can go out and try the soat so refresh the page and we'll take a closer look and we'll see what

05:09.230 --> 05:11.350
the value of our number is.

05:11.350 --> 05:16.410
So click on that and refresh it and then let's see what's being returned for our number.

05:16.490 --> 05:23.090
So we've got 83 we can do our number again and we need to refresh the page.

05:23.090 --> 05:27.310
So in order to get that random number so are numb.

05:27.500 --> 05:29.060
And now this time it's 6.

05:29.090 --> 05:30.690
So we're getting that random number.

05:30.830 --> 05:36.130
And with math it's just important to understand that there there's a lot of options with math.

05:36.210 --> 05:39.620
Analysts are doing some really heavy duty calculations.

05:39.620 --> 05:42.210
Most the time you're not going to need the math.

05:42.620 --> 05:44.750
Sometimes for graphics you will need it.

05:44.750 --> 05:51.200
So become familiar with what's available within math and then when you do need to use those more complex

05:51.440 --> 05:56.790
mathematical formulas than you've got you know that you got them available in javascript.
