WEBVTT

00:01.160 --> 00:07.070
This is where the fun begins because now we've got access we were Siebel to successfully connect to

00:07.070 --> 00:11.060
YouTube and retrieve back information from YouTube.

00:11.060 --> 00:17.570
So basically this gives us the ability to work with all this information that we've retrieved back and

00:17.570 --> 00:21.530
then make use of it and output it into our web page.

00:21.530 --> 00:27.800
So we see that we've got items and we could loop through the different items and we can get information

00:27.800 --> 00:30.060
here contained within snippet.

00:30.080 --> 00:36.350
So we've got our thumbnails we've got a description we've got a title and we've got an ID so let's add

00:36.350 --> 00:41.160
in all of this information within the results that get returned back.

00:41.300 --> 00:47.150
So this really is the fun part because once you've made that connection that what you want to do with

00:47.150 --> 00:48.870
this data it's really up to you.

00:48.890 --> 00:50.230
It's just open.

00:50.480 --> 00:57.460
You can be created creative as you like presented at a number of different ways within your web page.

00:57.590 --> 01:02.070
So all about are the most important thing is that you establish that connection.

01:02.150 --> 01:04.660
So let's build out a function here.

01:04.700 --> 01:07.510
And let's just call it schul results.

01:07.670 --> 01:12.920
So this is the one where we're going to loop through that data and we're going to make use of the content

01:13.010 --> 01:14.180
of the results.

01:14.180 --> 01:16.140
Now we have a number of options here.

01:16.190 --> 01:20.270
We can just simply do data items if we want.

01:20.270 --> 01:28.970
So this is completely optional because we're only going to make use of the items if we had some pagination

01:29.180 --> 01:32.340
where we've got the next page Tolkin and Page and full.

01:32.510 --> 01:37.760
And if we want to get that information and put it that we could just pass in those data and pick that

01:37.760 --> 01:38.150
up.

01:38.270 --> 01:41.230
Either way it's the same thing.

01:41.270 --> 01:46.400
So this time what I'm going to do is data items because only thing I want to focus on I want to output

01:46.430 --> 01:48.940
all 20 of those items on the web page.

01:48.980 --> 01:51.730
So that's what I really want to do within this lesson.

01:51.770 --> 01:56.930
And again this is optional once you've made that connection once you've got that data it's up to you

01:56.930 --> 01:58.610
how you want to present it.

01:58.620 --> 02:08.250
So let's do show results and let's we can just call this results so we're treating back all of those

02:08.310 --> 02:16.080
results and first saying let's build out let's create a holder for H Tim L because we're going to build

02:16.280 --> 02:20.580
this h him content so create a basic folder for that.

02:20.580 --> 02:24.270
And we know that the results are all of these items.

02:24.300 --> 02:30.720
So the next thing that we can do is let's loop through those so let's do a for loop and we're going

02:30.720 --> 02:43.010
to do for variable value in results so we have a loop through and we're going to get all of those values

02:43.010 --> 02:44.900
that are contained within the results

02:48.580 --> 02:54.130
and next let's just console log to make sure that we're pulling that information in properly.

02:54.160 --> 02:59.820
So we know that we've got all of those entries are in the results.

02:59.830 --> 03:05.010
And let's put the value index so let's try this.

03:05.010 --> 03:09.010
So refresh test and see.

03:09.100 --> 03:11.690
So we're able to pull back all of those results.

03:11.710 --> 03:18.050
So now it's just a matter of picking out what we want and presenting it how we want within our age to.

03:18.310 --> 03:25.930
So let's set up HMO and maybe what we want to do we'll pull this information out separately so set up

03:25.930 --> 03:27.110
some variables.

03:27.250 --> 03:31.600
So to title and we'll do another one.

03:31.600 --> 03:38.110
So variable description usually this is the way that I like to pull out that content because then I

03:38.110 --> 03:40.600
can really grab it and make use of it.

03:40.660 --> 03:47.560
So I know that it's and this is also where the console can come in useful because you can see what you're

03:47.620 --> 03:53.560
returning back here and we know that that content is sitting and snippet that we want to have access

03:53.560 --> 03:54.300
to.

03:54.730 --> 03:57.610
So the title is a value snippet.

03:57.790 --> 04:00.230
And lastly title.

04:00.490 --> 04:09.790
So I want you to do now pause the video and create a variable for the description for the title we already

04:09.790 --> 04:10.540
have one.

04:10.660 --> 04:19.880
And also grab that first thumbnail so grab at least one image thumbnail so pause the video and maneuver

04:19.910 --> 04:25.600
through the returned results and get all of that information and I'll show you the solution coming up.

04:26.490 --> 04:31.100
So we did need that description such as GRABBE description out there.

04:31.110 --> 04:34.890
And lastly let's do one and we're going to call it image.

04:34.890 --> 04:39.960
So this is the thumbnail and we do have a number of different thumbnails so we can just take that default

04:39.960 --> 04:40.570
if we want

04:44.750 --> 04:52.090
so it's a description snippet and we got to make sure we go into thumbnails next.

04:52.100 --> 04:55.280
So this one is pretty deep that we have to go into.

04:55.490 --> 05:03.680
So thumbnails and let's do default Anne's next you are l.

05:03.680 --> 05:06.890
So that will actually give us the URL of the image.

05:07.070 --> 05:08.200
So that's great.

05:08.200 --> 05:11.680
So it looks like we're ready to go to build out our HMO.

05:11.750 --> 05:15.540
So next thing is just to add to our h t m l.

05:15.620 --> 05:21.570
And then lastly we're going to output the results the H to Mel that we've built with this function and

05:21.670 --> 05:23.320
output it into our page.

05:23.480 --> 05:25.790
So maybe for the title.

05:25.790 --> 05:31.820
So let's just say that this all in a div and we're going to wrap it in a div So opening and closing

05:32.180 --> 05:36.770
tags and div So opening and closing divs

05:41.340 --> 05:43.500
and just do the colon there at the end.

05:43.530 --> 05:49.130
So first of all for title let's do an H-3 and we'll break out of it.

05:49.470 --> 05:51.780
So put that the title value in there.

05:51.990 --> 05:56.730
So this is just all really how you want it to look and how you want to present it within your page.

05:56.730 --> 06:01.620
So I've got the title and I'll do a description next.

06:01.690 --> 06:03.640
Let's maybe do a paragraph there.

06:08.940 --> 06:10.600
So that's a description.

06:13.520 --> 06:17.730
And you can get really creative with the CSSA and so on.

06:17.810 --> 06:20.350
In order to present it in a number of ways.

06:20.570 --> 06:23.210
And then lastly let's do the image.

06:23.210 --> 06:25.130
So source for the image

06:28.150 --> 06:34.850
and the source for the image is going to be that you are all so that I am JE

06:40.500 --> 06:42.600
and close off that image tag.

06:43.140 --> 06:48.700
And then lastly let's put that content so document to get element by ID.

06:48.960 --> 06:56.220
And where were outputting it sort out putting it into output 1 the div with the ID of I would put one

06:56.340 --> 07:04.700
so get element by id enter h t Mal and it's going to equal that each time now that we've just built.

07:04.880 --> 07:08.090
So let's refresh it and it looks like there is an error.

07:08.270 --> 07:10.210
So it's probably the courts here.

07:10.790 --> 07:15.570
And yeah it looks like I forgot to add plus there to concatenate it.

07:15.730 --> 07:17.040
So let's try that again.

07:18.100 --> 07:20.690
To test and search.

07:20.740 --> 07:21.540
So there we go.

07:21.580 --> 07:30.010
So we're able to pull back all of those results and we can see them being output on our Web page so

07:30.010 --> 07:39.790
we can also make the videos playable so as long as we get the video I.D. we can add it into our YouTube

07:39.820 --> 07:40.780
to play it.

07:40.780 --> 07:46.730
So there's a number of different options now and we can present it however we want on our page.

07:46.730 --> 07:55.550
So as long as we've got access using AJAX we can simply create this type of stuff within our Web page.

07:55.700 --> 07:59.840
One other thing that I did want to add in and that's within this Querrey.

07:59.840 --> 08:01.610
So right now we're only querying test.

08:01.640 --> 08:03.440
So we need to update that.

08:03.470 --> 08:06.590
So it's actually getting the actual results that we're putting in.

08:06.590 --> 08:08.720
So let's let's update that variable.

08:08.720 --> 08:17.500
So that's variable and Querrey document get element by ID.

08:17.730 --> 08:24.910
Let's go back up and search YouTube is the input value there that we need to grab oh we're already grabbing

08:24.910 --> 08:26.040
it within the search term.

08:26.050 --> 08:27.460
So that was a duplicate there.

08:27.580 --> 08:33.510
So let's grab search term and let's place that in here within our string.

08:35.280 --> 08:42.600
Now the other thing too that I wanted to do is I wanted to encode it in and we saw this earlier where

08:42.600 --> 08:44.650
we encode you our component.

08:44.850 --> 08:48.780
So let's go ahead and do that as well.

08:48.780 --> 08:51.240
So we have an option here we can just do a search term

08:54.120 --> 08:59.450
and let's do you are a component in code and that search term again.

08:59.490 --> 09:03.410
So we just start keeping it within itself so that way we're in coding it.

09:03.450 --> 09:08.420
So that takes care of if we've got any odd characters spaces or whatever.

09:11.850 --> 09:16.100
So let's try test test something like that.

09:16.170 --> 09:22.650
We can also include javascript if we want.

09:22.670 --> 09:29.500
So if one search javascript was law different javascript on their Does go back to test there.

09:29.540 --> 09:36.710
So a lot of really cool things that you can do with in when you grab that information from YouTube.

09:36.740 --> 09:43.640
And when you grab the power that's available within API and using AJAX within your web page so you can

09:43.640 --> 09:48.950
literally look at this content and if you actually go to the source code you can see that all of this

09:48.950 --> 09:52.160
content is actually written on your page.

09:52.400 --> 09:57.260
So that's another really great thing about it is that you're not framing it you're not bringing it in

09:57.860 --> 10:02.900
you're actually you actually have it physically on your page and that means that you can manipulate

10:02.900 --> 10:10.040
how it looks and you can present it in any number of ways using CSSA because this is directly on your

10:10.040 --> 10:11.440
page itself.

10:11.570 --> 10:15.510
And then of course you can select it from the returned results.

10:15.590 --> 10:18.440
What you want to present on your page as well.

10:18.500 --> 10:24.350
So what I want you to do now is take what you've learned in this lesson in the previous one with connecting

10:24.350 --> 10:27.010
to YouTube and try it for yourself.

10:27.230 --> 10:34.010
Get an application working where you can search and also update it so you can change the different number

10:34.010 --> 10:37.190
of results that you are returning and also update it.

10:37.190 --> 10:41.150
So you actually have a link to the YouTube you are l.

10:41.150 --> 10:48.420
So this is all just by using this idea the video ID and linking it to YouTube you can get that ID.

10:48.440 --> 10:49.770
So a number of options.

10:49.790 --> 10:58.280
So go ahead try it out and get familiar with retrieving this information back from Jaison and utilizing

10:58.280 --> 10:59.500
it within your web page.
