00:00.650 --> 00:06.260
Welcome back in in this lesson we're going to be looking at the deep object in javascript so we can

00:06.350 --> 00:12.530
grab the current time at any point within our javascript by calling to the Date object.

00:12.530 --> 00:16.330
So due date and we do the rounded brackets and we can grab date.

00:16.370 --> 00:25.970
So what this does is this actually returns back the data from your computer's time and it's based on

00:26.030 --> 00:30.470
whatever your current system has as the current date and time.

00:30.470 --> 00:38.060
So if you're looking at always looking at that as being accurate it's not always going to be 100 percent

00:38.150 --> 00:39.060
accurate.

00:39.110 --> 00:43.940
So there's a number of ways to actually set dates and get dates.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.350
And one of the ways that so we're using date.

00:47.390 --> 00:57.370
So if we want to output the date here within message we can do that by getting the current date.

00:57.520 --> 01:04.300
So just set up a variable and we'll just call it D and this one let's grab the date.

01:04.330 --> 01:08.680
So we're going to just do new date creating a brand new Date object.

01:08.920 --> 01:13.840
And then with message we're going to add it to the inner h t m l.

01:13.990 --> 01:20.850
So we're going to concatenate to the inner h t m l and we're going to just simply add in will add in

01:20.860 --> 01:26.190
a line break and then we'll add in deep.

01:26.230 --> 01:29.230
After that let's go take a look and we'll see what this looks like.

01:29.230 --> 01:29.770
So there we go.

01:29.770 --> 01:35.980
So now we basically have our current date that is within our system time.

01:35.980 --> 01:43.540
So we can also set a date so we don't have to actually we can initiate a date but we can also set a

01:43.540 --> 01:44.220
date.

01:44.230 --> 01:53.830
So if for instance we want it to set the date of the previous year we can enter that in as part of the

01:53.830 --> 01:54.720
date string.

01:55.790 --> 01:58.990
And there's a number of formats that we can enter in.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.870
So this here is what's known as the full date format.

02:02.870 --> 02:06.650
So basically it provides all of that information for a date.

02:06.650 --> 02:13.610
So if for instance instead of grabbing the data like this I want to actually set a date and I put that

02:13.610 --> 02:14.920
within the Javascript.

02:15.050 --> 02:16.550
So let's do that now.

02:16.880 --> 02:18.190
We can set a date.

02:18.210 --> 02:26.360
So going by year first there is a specific syntax that we need to use and this one it requires that

02:26.420 --> 02:28.910
we have a year.

02:29.120 --> 02:33.640
So that would be four characters for a year.

02:33.650 --> 02:35.950
Next we can set a month.

02:36.080 --> 02:37.480
So that's the two for the month.

02:37.580 --> 02:44.210
So notice that if one of the months is just the single digit then you do need to set a zero in front

02:44.210 --> 02:46.250
of it in order for it to be correct.

02:46.490 --> 02:49.150
And then next let's set a 10.

02:49.790 --> 02:52.100
So go back out and refresh it.

02:52.100 --> 02:58.210
So we see that the date is Saturday January 9th 2010.

02:58.490 --> 03:07.970
So notice that I've got a 10 here as the date and what's actually happening here is why we've got a

03:07.970 --> 03:09.140
nine over here.

03:09.170 --> 03:13.530
And while we're setting 10 this is reflective of the time zones.

03:13.550 --> 03:18.680
So depending on what the time zone that you're in you may or may not have it working properly.

03:18.710 --> 03:25.460
You can also just do a format where you're not actually including the day you could do something like

03:25.460 --> 03:30.080
this where we're simply grabbing the year and the month.

03:30.350 --> 03:36.800
And notice again that there's been an adjustment here so if I update this too for save it go back and

03:36.830 --> 03:37.710
refresh.

03:37.850 --> 03:40.390
We notice that we get March.

03:40.640 --> 03:48.620
And again we got an adjustment here that's helping happening because of the time zones.

03:48.620 --> 03:55.030
We can also just put a year on its own and this will just pick up a default time.

03:55.130 --> 03:57.410
So the year just before we hit.

03:57.470 --> 04:02.240
So basically it's returning back January 1st 2010.

04:02.330 --> 04:06.890
And because of the time zones that's why things are getting a little bit messed up there because of

04:06.890 --> 04:08.810
those timezones.

04:08.870 --> 04:20.930
So you can also add in the date so we can do something like January 1st 2010 and we can use the U.S.

04:21.620 --> 04:24.160
value by doing CTT.

04:24.380 --> 04:26.260
So this is a US time stamp.

04:26.300 --> 04:30.830
So this way we can format it and it actually comes back as January 20 10th.

04:30.830 --> 04:34.410
So again depending on the browser that you're using it may or may not differ.

04:34.430 --> 04:37.120
You can also set in time.

04:37.220 --> 04:45.700
So it's 1 pm so it's a 24 hour clock and we'll set 1 p.m. and 55 seconds so refresh.

04:45.830 --> 04:46.450
So there we go.

04:46.460 --> 04:51.460
So we can update the date and we can really fine tune that date value as needed.

04:51.740 --> 04:58.740
So the thing that we wanted to add in is that you can set the date in various formats so I can set up.

04:58.760 --> 05:05.510
So I'm going to just use very bold D again and this time I'm going to set the date so I'm going to do

05:05.600 --> 05:10.590
new date and I can specify a date within here.

05:10.850 --> 05:16.880
So we've got a number of ways that we can do this.

05:16.880 --> 05:19.640
We can specify the date by

05:22.240 --> 05:27.980
just typing it in so we can do a short format and we can do April 10th 2011.

05:28.450 --> 05:34.840
So let's go back out and refresh it and we can add in commas as well so that doesn't matter.

05:35.050 --> 05:37.700
So those are not those are disregarded.

05:37.810 --> 05:42.790
So that's good news if you're trying to format your date properly that you can have commas in there

05:42.790 --> 05:44.290
and it actually doesn't matter.

05:44.290 --> 05:46.930
You can also do the full date value.

05:46.930 --> 05:50.470
So instead of that short format we can do uppercase.

05:50.570 --> 05:53.030
So upper case lower case doesn't matter.

05:53.050 --> 05:58.450
You can add in commas all of that doesn't matter go back and refresh and it doesn't actually change

05:58.450 --> 05:59.340
anything there.

05:59.590 --> 06:07.840
So the other thing that we wanted to do so lot to add in another variable and let's do variable t.

06:08.080 --> 06:10.690
And I'm going to add that here to the bottom.

06:10.750 --> 06:18.340
So let's duplicate this part and add it to the bottom so we can get the number of milliseconds from

06:18.400 --> 06:22.530
January 1st 1970 in conjunction with the date.

06:22.540 --> 06:31.450
So if you want to know how many milliseconds from January 1st 1972 April 10th 2010 then we can use date

06:31.750 --> 06:32.850
the date object.

06:33.040 --> 06:37.360
And we can use the method get time.

06:37.600 --> 06:46.180
So basically this returns back a universal time value so let's go back and refresh it and we can see

06:46.180 --> 06:49.020
that we've got our universal time value.

06:49.270 --> 06:50.720
So since that date.

06:50.860 --> 06:54.590
And if we want to comment this one out.

06:58.800 --> 07:08.960
And get the amount of seconds from now until from now till January 1st 1970 we can do this and we can

07:08.960 --> 07:11.730
see that this is constantly changing as well.

07:11.750 --> 07:18.430
So every time I refresh the page the amount of seconds is increasing from that initial start date.

07:18.560 --> 07:21.600
And this is used quite often with programming as well.

07:21.620 --> 07:26.520
So it's another useful value that you can make use of within your javascript code.

07:27.170 --> 07:34.520
So also within javascript we have an option to set time so we can get the time and we can set a date

07:34.610 --> 07:35.440
as well.

07:39.920 --> 07:48.750
So what I want you to do now is pause the video and calculate out how many milliseconds since your data

07:48.770 --> 07:56.630
birth and work that out and return back using the date object using your birthdate whatever your birth

07:56.630 --> 08:04.760
date might be and then applying the get tie method to your birth date to calculate out how many milliseconds

08:04.820 --> 08:06.490
since your birth date.

08:06.590 --> 08:10.650
And if you're before 1970 Let me show you what's going to happen.

08:10.700 --> 08:18.530
So let's say for instance we set a date before 1970 because we know that this is starting on 1970.

08:18.530 --> 08:26.840
So if you're born in nineteen sixty let's refresh it and we see that all that happens is we go to negative.

08:26.840 --> 08:27.860
So that's all that happened.

08:27.860 --> 08:33.770
So if you do get a negative if you're born before the 1970s then you will have a negative value there

08:33.770 --> 08:34.420
for that.

08:34.670 --> 08:36.020
So go ahead and try that 8

08:39.290 --> 08:48.080
and if you want to add dates to your current time so let's say that this is April 10th 1980 and all

08:48.080 --> 08:52.250
of a sudden you want to add 50 or 100 days into it.

08:52.250 --> 08:55.550
This is going to be really easy using javascript.

08:55.550 --> 09:03.650
So let's do that now and we're going to take the deep object and we're going to use set a date so we

09:03.650 --> 09:10.150
know that within set date we can actually set a different date there for her.

09:10.190 --> 09:19.490
So if we wanted to all of a sudden instead of April and now let's do November and refresh it.

09:19.490 --> 09:20.210
So now

09:26.920 --> 09:32.660
and with the date object we can also set values so we can set a time.

09:32.680 --> 09:38.090
We can set a date as well and we can set a year we can set ours.

09:38.140 --> 09:46.970
So if we want to change this date object to another year we can use the set year.

09:47.710 --> 09:50.440
And this one is set for a year.

09:50.710 --> 09:57.070
So basically what this does is this allows us to set a brand new value for the year.

09:57.070 --> 09:59.830
So let's go back out and when we refresh it.

09:59.920 --> 10:02.860
Now we've got to 2017 as the year.

10:02.860 --> 10:08.720
We could also set the date so the date is actually a day.

10:08.860 --> 10:11.770
So this is a number from 1 to 31.

10:11.860 --> 10:15.790
And this is going to update April 10th to whatever number we're choosing.

10:15.790 --> 10:24.640
So we can do something like 25 and we can set to April 2015 2017 and we can also do the minutes we can

10:24.640 --> 10:25.720
change the month.

10:25.900 --> 10:33.490
And let's show you to do the month as well so the month is a little bit tricky because this is a number

10:33.520 --> 10:36.590
that starts at 0 and ends at 11.

10:36.700 --> 10:42.780
So if you want to get December the month is going to be 11.

10:42.820 --> 10:44.510
So go back and refresh it.

10:44.650 --> 10:52.180
And that's how we get December and if for instance we want to add 50 days to our current date we can

10:52.180 --> 10:57.930
do we can return back the current date by do a DE get date

11:01.190 --> 11:07.280
so returning back and we're getting the current date and then we're setting it because we're incrementing

11:07.280 --> 11:07.710
that.

11:07.730 --> 11:13.710
So if we want to add a 100 days to whatever date that we're specifying here we can refresh it.

11:13.760 --> 11:20.510
And now we've added 100 days to our April original value.

11:20.630 --> 11:23.870
And I'm going to just comment that because we're resetting the month.

11:24.170 --> 11:33.640
So let's refresh that and we can see that when we add a 100 days to April 10th we end up with July 19th.

11:33.770 --> 11:41.480
So go ahead and try it for yourself and take your birthdate and add a hundred days to it and output

11:41.480 --> 11:42.990
that within javascript.
