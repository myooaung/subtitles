WEBVTT

00:00.950 --> 00:02.070
It's Welcome back.

00:02.080 --> 00:05.660
And in this lesson we're going to add our clickable buttons.

00:05.710 --> 00:15.190
So let's start by creating a div and I'm going to give this div an ID for see buttons and then within

00:15.190 --> 00:18.860
that div we want and deposit all of our colors.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.130
So we want to make this as dynamic as possible.

00:22.240 --> 00:29.040
So we want red green blue and yellow to simply be able to be built within see buttons.

00:29.050 --> 00:30.310
So I say I have to do that.

00:30.340 --> 00:36.960
And next I want to have another active here and I'm going to give this one an ID of guess.

00:37.000 --> 00:43.870
So this is going to be whatever the user has guessed the output to be that this is what the user is

00:43.870 --> 00:47.310
going to be able to see as their guess.

00:47.320 --> 00:57.090
So add in all of the gas elements in here as well and we'll add those dynamically with Javascript.

00:57.190 --> 01:03.520
So now we need to build out see buttons dynamically and we have got a number of places where we can

01:03.610 --> 01:04.780
build this out.

01:04.870 --> 01:06.260
So maybe the first way.

01:06.310 --> 01:10.680
The first part to build because we've actually got our array sitting under start.

01:10.780 --> 01:14.260
So this is actually the place where we need to build those.

01:14.530 --> 01:18.750
So we know that we've got we're looping through four items here.

01:18.820 --> 01:21.430
So we're not looping through all the values in the array.

01:21.520 --> 01:26.310
So unfortunately we need to create another loop in order to accommodate this.

01:26.320 --> 01:31.560
So let's set up a second loop here and this loop is the one where we're actually going to build out

01:31.630 --> 01:32.810
our buttons.

01:33.130 --> 01:38.220
And so for this one we know that we've got this element here.

01:38.260 --> 01:39.220
See buttons.

01:39.340 --> 01:44.690
And this is where we're we want to append our brand new elements or brand new age to melt into.

01:44.920 --> 01:52.150
So what we can do we've got a number of different options and this one should now actually be looping

01:52.210 --> 01:57.590
for the length of the colors so that we have all of those buttons available to us.

01:57.640 --> 02:04.760
So let's add those in and set up another variable in order to hold it.

02:04.770 --> 02:11.940
So I just do h t m l and from here we're going to just append h to M L and then afterwards we're going

02:11.940 --> 02:15.530
to add h tim L into the C buttons element.

02:15.840 --> 02:20.000
So we need to build out our h to Mel.

02:20.190 --> 02:26.380
And let's set those up as divs we'll give them a class so that we can pick up the class.

02:26.400 --> 02:30.770
So the class will simply be whatever value is within the array.

02:30.990 --> 02:34.110
So let me add those in.

02:34.350 --> 02:41.550
So this is going to be color array and whatever the index the current index value is for x.

02:41.640 --> 02:47.060
So we'll add those ones in and then do the double code.

02:47.070 --> 02:52.590
So that's a single that's a first starting out with a double quote and then a single and then then a

02:52.590 --> 02:58.950
single court to break back into the string and then a double quote because we need this an r h t m l

02:58.950 --> 02:59.750
formatting.

03:00.000 --> 03:07.980
So setting up that class and next let's do the same thing where we're going to grab this value and just

03:07.980 --> 03:12.680
simply put it in there so that the user can actually also read those values.

03:14.360 --> 03:18.370
So we know that we need to grab see buttons so we can do document.

03:18.680 --> 03:22.080
And let's get element by ID.

03:22.340 --> 03:28.840
And this one is called See buttons that's lowercase c uppercase buttons.

03:29.380 --> 03:34.510
And now let's add in our inner h t m l so we can do Page 2 male.

03:34.550 --> 03:36.290
So let's go and try this out.

03:36.320 --> 03:38.130
So refresh it.

03:38.310 --> 03:41.160
And now we build out all of our elements.

03:41.340 --> 03:45.240
And the one thing that we notice that we get this undefined up here.

03:45.690 --> 03:52.690
So in order to remove that let's set a value for each mental.

03:52.860 --> 03:56.320
That's because we don't have a value and we're just simply appending to it.

03:56.340 --> 03:58.190
So we're concatenating into it.

03:58.500 --> 04:03.810
So the next thing that we need to do is we need to set up some styling for these because they're not

04:03.870 --> 04:05.550
really looking that great.

04:05.550 --> 04:09.040
And we need to add in some styling for those.

04:09.090 --> 04:13.650
So there is something that we can do as well so we can add in the style.

04:13.770 --> 04:15.890
And these are all background colors.

04:15.930 --> 04:23.000
So let's go ahead and do background color and we're just going to add the background colors.

04:23.130 --> 04:30.290
And within this type of format and then close that off go back and refreshed.

04:30.390 --> 04:31.610
And now when we hit start.

04:31.680 --> 04:36.660
So now we've got the background colors so we have to do go back into hairstyling and do a little bit

04:36.660 --> 04:43.740
of styling for see buttons and we know that these are all divs that are directly under seat buttons.

04:43.740 --> 04:49.140
So let's add some styling to these divs and let's set them up to be.

04:49.350 --> 04:57.360
Well give them a set with so little with can be 100 picks and we'll display them so display

05:00.180 --> 05:02.430
and we're going to display them inline block

05:05.510 --> 05:07.180
also give them a height.

05:07.640 --> 05:14.470
So 50 picks for height text align so line the text center

05:18.930 --> 05:21.010
and add in a border.

05:21.270 --> 05:26.020
So one pick solid block border it's there we go.

05:26.020 --> 05:29.450
So now let's refresh it and see what it looks like now.

05:29.650 --> 05:35.980
So now we've got a really nice kind of area where we can click and this is all fully dynamic.

05:36.220 --> 05:43.630
So now we've given the user the ability to see these buttons but we haven't made them clickable.

05:43.730 --> 05:49.100
So now what we need to do is add the on click event because these buttons they're not actually buttons

05:49.100 --> 05:49.330
yet.

05:49.340 --> 05:54.370
They're just a bunch of divs with colors in the background colors all nice and be presented.

05:54.590 --> 05:57.460
So we have several different ways that we can do this.

05:57.620 --> 06:05.110
And because we've gone this far with building out as HD M-L I get to simply add it as an on click attribute.

06:05.300 --> 06:08.390
But of course you could have done it another way as well.

06:08.390 --> 06:11.030
And that's creating the div element.

06:11.030 --> 06:18.260
Adding the class to it adding the background color to it and then adding the on click event listener

06:18.320 --> 06:18.870
to it.

06:19.010 --> 06:20.670
So that was another option.

06:20.780 --> 06:29.890
But for now let's just stay on click and when it gets clicked then what we want to do is we want to

06:29.890 --> 06:33.030
fire off to a function.

06:33.050 --> 06:37.160
So this is going to be where the user is actually going to submit their guess.

06:37.190 --> 06:41.780
So I'm going to just create a function called old gas that's going to be the guess that's going to be

06:41.780 --> 06:42.980
passed through.

06:43.160 --> 06:52.050
And I also want to pass through a value into this guess and we don't actually have to pass an argument

06:52.050 --> 06:59.520
because we can't pick up either from the class name or from the inner h him all the color that the user

06:59.520 --> 07:00.530
has selected.

07:00.570 --> 07:03.020
So we don't actually have to worry about any of that.

07:03.090 --> 07:05.880
And we can go ahead and create that function all guess.

07:06.000 --> 07:14.560
So what I want to do now pause the video and create all guess and then output into the message area.

07:14.640 --> 07:17.090
The color that the user clicked.

07:17.130 --> 07:18.280
So that's the challenge.

07:18.300 --> 07:21.840
Try that and see the solution coming up.

07:21.840 --> 07:25.770
So we know we need to pick up the color that the user is guessing.

07:25.890 --> 07:30.900
And now we've got these on click events that are going to old gas.

07:30.940 --> 07:39.750
So we've got a number of different ways that we can pick up that information so we can do this and we

07:39.750 --> 07:42.770
can get class name we can get in or h t m l.

07:42.810 --> 07:47.520
So let's do class names so that we've only set up we've set up that one class name and of course if

07:47.520 --> 07:53.510
you add more class names then this way is going to breaking you could divert back to the inner text.

07:53.550 --> 07:55.550
But for now let's grab this.

07:55.550 --> 07:56.520
Class theme.

07:56.610 --> 08:00.070
So we want to update that message area.

08:00.180 --> 08:02.000
So a number of different options.

08:02.070 --> 08:07.310
What I usually like to do is because I'm probably going to be calling on it more than once.

08:07.320 --> 08:14.820
So let's let's just set that up as a global variable and message and then we can grab it with an output

08:14.840 --> 08:15.250
there.

08:17.730 --> 08:25.540
And now go back into the class name and in our text and we're going to equal it to the class name.

08:25.590 --> 08:32.220
So now whenever the button gets clicked then what should happen we should see the color that was selected

08:32.310 --> 08:33.310
into the class.

08:33.480 --> 08:39.240
So let's refresh hit start and now when we click it we're actually getting undefined.

08:39.240 --> 08:40.450
So there is a problem there.

08:40.470 --> 08:43.280
And now we need to figure out what happened.

08:44.660 --> 08:48.010
So we see that we're not actually picking up the class name.

08:48.170 --> 08:52.660
And let's look into this function and see what's gone wrong.

08:52.670 --> 08:59.570
So we're trying to call out to this and we're not actually able to pick up this properly within the

08:59.570 --> 09:01.190
Old guess function.

09:01.190 --> 09:08.660
So the other default and the one that is always going to work is that target so default and divert back

09:08.660 --> 09:10.130
to event target.

09:10.340 --> 09:14.600
And this time we're looking at that object.

09:14.600 --> 09:21.980
So whatever triggered this function to be initiated and that's the that that we're going to listen for.

09:21.980 --> 09:28.610
So we know that clicking was the last event that triggered it and that's how we got to that function.

09:28.640 --> 09:36.320
So we know that event target is more of our fail safe way to pick up and we can then grab that proper

09:36.320 --> 09:39.090
element and then we can grab the class name.

09:39.110 --> 09:43.140
So basically now we know what the user is trying to guess.

09:43.220 --> 09:47.920
And now we can actually push it into our guessing array.

09:47.960 --> 09:54.320
So we've picked up that value and let's set up a variable and let's call it g.

09:54.320 --> 09:55.220
For the users.

09:55.230 --> 10:00.130
Guess so first thing that we want to do is push it into the array.

10:00.410 --> 10:03.680
So let's push G into the users array.

10:03.680 --> 10:07.640
So now we've built the users and we've got their guess.

10:07.790 --> 10:18.040
So the next thing that we need to do is we need to show the users I guess some way so we can do it in

10:18.040 --> 10:23.980
a way where we can just simply put the letters or the words and then have them output there but we want

10:23.980 --> 10:31.340
to have it a little bit more dynamic and user friendly so we saw that we can push it into the array

10:31.340 --> 10:36.920
easily and then we can also do a check to see if the array lengths are the same.

10:36.920 --> 10:41.870
And then at that point we know that we can tell if the user is correct or not.

10:41.870 --> 10:43.750
And then we can do something with that.

10:43.760 --> 10:50.360
So the one thing that we need to do so that we can add that in first and we can check if array length

10:50.720 --> 10:54.870
is equal to the array one length.

10:55.040 --> 11:02.170
And if it is then we know that the user's done therefore it guesses and we need to check to see if while

11:02.180 --> 11:08.390
the game is going to be over and we need to check to see if the user is correct.

11:08.390 --> 11:11.350
So let's let's do that check.

11:11.690 --> 11:16.880
And the way that we can do the check we're going to use the string method where we're going to take

11:17.000 --> 11:21.330
our array and we're going to convert it into a string.

11:21.710 --> 11:26.130
So we can convert it to a string using the two string method.

11:26.450 --> 11:31.020
And then that way we can check to see if both arrays are going to be the same

11:35.110 --> 11:43.740
so if if the array as a string if if they're the same then basically we know that at this point the

11:43.790 --> 11:46.020
user guessed correctly.

11:46.510 --> 11:54.580
So we can output you were and that should be an equal sign and that should actually be a message in

11:54.600 --> 12:00.730
our text to enter text and we're going to write out to the user that you were correct

12:03.400 --> 12:05.120
and we'll put a happy face there.

12:05.320 --> 12:12.730
And if it's not it's so if they're not equal and we've come to the end of the game then we can write

12:12.730 --> 12:14.610
out you are not correct.

12:16.690 --> 12:17.530
So you were

12:20.660 --> 12:21.480
wrong.

12:22.460 --> 12:34.280
And we can also output the guesses you your guess and let's put the value of the array there at that

12:34.280 --> 12:34.780
point.

12:35.840 --> 12:39.160
So let's concatenate array one

12:43.380 --> 12:53.520
and actually that should be array to array 2 is the user's guess and correct order was.

12:53.520 --> 13:01.670
And then we can have the players guess or the this is the actual rate combination.

13:01.680 --> 13:08.050
So now let's let's save this and go back and we'll quickly try this out.

13:08.280 --> 13:14.370
So basically we can put in the four guesses and we say we can see you are wrong and this should be actually

13:14.390 --> 13:16.470
enraged you know.

13:16.860 --> 13:24.690
So let's go back refreshed one more time and now we see that I can guess and I can see your guess red

13:24.690 --> 13:25.680
green blue yellow.

13:25.680 --> 13:28.810
Correct order was yellow blue green blue.

13:29.160 --> 13:30.330
So there we go.

13:30.330 --> 13:40.410
So let's go in the line break so this is more readable and add that in on that side of the court.

13:40.420 --> 13:41.020
So there we go.

13:41.020 --> 13:44.420
So now we've got our condition that ends the array.

13:44.560 --> 13:48.150
And the only thing that we need to do is we need to display to the user.

13:48.150 --> 13:54.840
There are guesses and I also want to make their selections removable as well.

13:54.840 --> 14:02.130
So go ahead and add that into all guess and I'll show you the solution coming up.
