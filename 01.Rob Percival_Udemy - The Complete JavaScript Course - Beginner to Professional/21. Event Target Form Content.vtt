00:00.860 --> 00:04.550
Welcome back in in this lesson we're going to look at forms.

00:04.550 --> 00:10.840
So let's go ahead and create an h t l form and this will give us something to work with with him our

00:10.850 --> 00:12.000
Javascript.

00:12.050 --> 00:23.420
So we've got our form here and let's ask for a first name and we'll do an input set and put the equals

00:24.140 --> 00:30.150
text and we'll give it an ID.

00:30.450 --> 00:32.820
So this one will be the one

00:35.790 --> 00:37.720
and we'll give it a default value.

00:37.720 --> 00:48.510
So it's got a default value there and do a line break and we'll also do last name

00:53.190 --> 01:04.860
so just uppercase that and this one will be a last name so this will be e to and we can put a last name

01:04.860 --> 01:05.990
into there.

01:06.900 --> 01:17.110
And then lastly let's do one more thing and let's add an input button type equals button.

01:17.220 --> 01:22.980
And what I want to happen is when the user clicks the buttons so on click

01:28.640 --> 01:40.180
so on click we want to send in full and we're going to create a function in order to send in full and

01:40.240 --> 01:42.040
value is going to be

01:45.210 --> 01:52.420
something that we can close that off and we can also close off the form.

01:56.120 --> 02:03.770
So now let's go into our script and what we want to do is we need to make a function that fires off

02:03.800 --> 02:06.280
whenever we're trying to send information.

02:06.350 --> 02:07.190
So function

02:10.790 --> 02:13.720
and this one is called Send in full

02:16.350 --> 02:26.680
and let's output our information into over here so we want to output the first name and the last name

02:26.740 --> 02:29.620
and output it into the ID wrapper.

02:31.820 --> 02:36.440
So let's set up another function and this one will be called message.

02:36.440 --> 02:43.280
So this will take in one argument and this is basically the output message and documents get element

02:43.280 --> 02:44.530
by D.

02:44.840 --> 02:52.670
And so we're going to deposit that information into our in our aged hymnal.

02:52.790 --> 02:59.410
So whatever gets passed in to this function we're going to simply deposit it within that age to a male.

02:59.480 --> 03:06.140
So let's do a message and let's test at first.

03:06.140 --> 03:10.800
So just make sure that everything's working go back refresh the page submit.

03:10.820 --> 03:12.440
So everything is working.

03:12.440 --> 03:20.870
So what we want to do is we want to grab the values of that element and we want to input it within our

03:21.240 --> 03:22.110
to him.

03:22.460 --> 03:28.730
So what we wanted to do is introduce you to another default so we saw that we can pass this and we get

03:28.730 --> 03:36.840
information about this particular element but we also saw a console log out or a console directory.

03:37.040 --> 03:40.310
And we've got an event object.

03:40.340 --> 03:44.190
So this is automatically triggered as an event.

03:44.210 --> 03:50.510
So depending on if a button gets clicked or some type of event happens within the window we can pick

03:50.510 --> 03:52.930
it up as the event object.

03:53.180 --> 03:55.320
So let me show you what gets put.

03:55.340 --> 04:04.970
So go back refreshed the page and open up our console and then now when I submit it we have a mouse

04:04.970 --> 04:06.600
event that's been triggered.

04:06.740 --> 04:12.950
So we see that within this mouse event we've got a ton of information and we also know that element

04:13.040 --> 04:21.320
that we're actually actually firing this event off so we can get that information from Target.

04:21.320 --> 04:31.760
So if I was to update the code and instead of just event I did event target go back refreshed the page

04:32.120 --> 04:33.290
and let me show you what happens.

04:33.290 --> 04:37.730
Now when I click it we actually get that input element.

04:37.730 --> 04:45.380
So now we can actually make use of that and we can traverse through here and I can get that information

04:45.500 --> 04:50.090
that's contained within the rest of the forum because I know that it's got some siblings.

04:50.240 --> 04:57.200
I know that it's got a parent and it's got a shared parent to those first two elements.

04:57.280 --> 05:00.900
So let's go down and we see that we've got the parent element.

05:01.090 --> 05:06.550
So this will bring us up one level and within that parent we see that we've got the two children.

05:06.550 --> 05:08.480
So we've got the children.

05:08.520 --> 05:08.910
No.

05:08.920 --> 05:10.630
So we've got the two children.

05:10.630 --> 05:13.580
So you've got the two inputs within there as well.

05:13.630 --> 05:19.530
So we can go back down and we can grab that information when we go up to the parent element.

05:19.680 --> 05:21.750
So let me show you how to do this.

05:21.760 --> 05:24.250
So going into your editor.

05:24.580 --> 05:30.900
So if I do parent element and one more time will refresh it and will open up the console.

05:30.910 --> 05:32.070
And when we submit it.

05:32.140 --> 05:33.940
So now we're getting the form.

05:34.090 --> 05:41.530
So just as we saw before we actually can traverse down and we've got a number of children there so we've

05:41.530 --> 05:43.910
got e one and eat two.

05:44.050 --> 05:50.230
So if I want to get the value from each one I can simply do the one

05:53.040 --> 06:02.260
and as we saw earlier that we can do the value so save that refresh the form.

06:02.260 --> 06:09.190
And now when I submit it we're actually grabbing that first elements information.

06:09.190 --> 06:17.770
So what I want you to do now is pause the video and grab all of this information from both elements

06:18.070 --> 06:25.700
without having to do get element by ID or anything like that just traverse through what's available

06:25.810 --> 06:27.530
using the advanced target.

06:27.530 --> 06:33.880
So notice that we're not passing anything here either that this is just an event that we know that has

06:33.880 --> 06:37.240
just been triggered and this information is being sent.

06:37.360 --> 06:41.330
So we can pick up that event information as it just got triggered.

06:41.620 --> 06:50.030
And what I want you to do is put it within that div the ID wrapper with the ID wrapper.

06:51.460 --> 06:56.520
So take a few minutes open up your editor and try it out and I'll get to show you a solution.

06:56.530 --> 07:01.150
Coming up sopan an opportunity to try that.

07:01.230 --> 07:02.560
So usually what I want.

07:02.610 --> 07:10.050
What I like to do is I like to create a variable in order to hold all of this information and that way

07:10.050 --> 07:14.870
it just makes it look a lot simpler to be able to get that information.

07:14.940 --> 07:19.110
So we know that this is a parent element.

07:19.140 --> 07:25.530
So now I can traverse down and I can go to each one and I can do value.

07:25.650 --> 07:30.570
So that's my first value and leaving a space there.

07:30.810 --> 07:36.840
And then I know I can grab my easy to value and place that afterwards.

07:38.700 --> 07:42.690
So to and this is going to be wrong.

07:42.810 --> 07:53.780
So just maybe just get rid of the console there and generate welcome.

07:53.800 --> 07:56.990
So now let's try it out and refresh the page.

07:57.030 --> 07:59.230
And now we've got welcome.

07:59.250 --> 08:08.640
So if I change the name it updates as well so we can put whatever value we want in there and we can

08:08.670 --> 08:16.880
always grab that information without actually having to to grab it from that particular element.

08:17.070 --> 08:23.490
So if we had another form and this one was the exact same thing

08:27.430 --> 08:29.800
and there's one other change that I do want to make.

08:29.830 --> 08:37.840
So we know that with IDS we can't have we can't have more than one form with the same ID.

08:37.930 --> 08:42.700
So let's add this and change it to name and the same thing here.

08:42.730 --> 08:49.280
So name and let's use the same function for this one as well.

08:52.370 --> 08:54.830
And update both of them to be name.

08:55.100 --> 08:55.970
Save it.

08:56.090 --> 08:59.840
And we're happy to do anything different with our function.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.540
So let's let's try this.

09:01.550 --> 09:11.480
So when we test it we can have one name here and we can have another name appear and we can do all of

09:11.480 --> 09:16.020
this by simply just having that one function that we could call.

09:16.040 --> 09:21.650
We don't need to have any additional information in there and it's as easy as that to add this type

09:21.650 --> 09:28.640
of functionality was just that one function that can carry all of this load and by traversing through

09:28.700 --> 09:34.340
the selected element that element that triggered off the event we don't even need any additional information.

09:34.370 --> 09:40.250
Of course we could have used this we could have passed this within the function parameters and picked

09:40.250 --> 09:42.800
it up there and we could have done the same thing.

09:42.890 --> 09:48.170
But sometimes it's just easier to go with event target because that's going to be the same thing as

09:48.170 --> 09:49.390
passing through this.

09:49.430 --> 09:55.050
But you don't actually have to pass any parameters through that event handler.
