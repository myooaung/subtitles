00:01.740 --> 00:05.700
Come back in this lesson I'm going to show you why we needed the callback.

00:05.700 --> 00:12.570
So initially when we were creating this we actually created a callback and we were returning that response

00:12.570 --> 00:14.490
information in the callback.

00:14.730 --> 00:19.700
And the reason that this is important is because of the way that the file loads.

00:19.740 --> 00:23.340
So when we do load Jaison it immediately goes to the function.

00:23.370 --> 00:28.650
Fires this off and we can only make use of the data when it's actually returned.

00:28.650 --> 00:35.230
So basically what that means that if we want to place that within party we'd have to do it within here.

00:35.280 --> 00:38.190
And this makes this not dynamic.

00:38.190 --> 00:41.650
So really you can do it this way.

00:41.810 --> 00:45.000
But the better way is to make use of the callback.

00:45.210 --> 00:50.280
So that's what I want to do in this lesson is basically I want to do a callback of that value.

00:50.400 --> 00:53.090
And we're not going to do a whole lot different.

00:53.090 --> 01:00.260
Here is we're just going to simply return back that response text and use the callback.

01:00.510 --> 01:03.270
So we saw this before that we've got a function.

01:03.270 --> 01:05.280
Am I going to get rid of this part here.

01:05.370 --> 01:11.310
So this function is going to fire off and it's going to expect a callback within the response we've

01:11.310 --> 01:14.310
got the callback within the function.

01:14.310 --> 01:18.010
And basically we're passing it as a parameter there.

01:18.090 --> 01:20.680
So that means that we can make use of it within the function.

01:20.700 --> 01:26.330
So all we have to do is do callback and I'm going to do the JS on Parse.

01:26.490 --> 01:28.270
On the other end as well.

01:28.290 --> 01:35.430
So let me get rid of that and copy and paste it into there so that we can make use of that response

01:35.430 --> 01:36.860
information here.

01:39.660 --> 01:40.280
So there we go.

01:40.280 --> 01:44.170
So we've got our response text so we still need that.

01:44.280 --> 01:52.840
And this were happening in the callback so response text basically we send them the callback because

01:52.840 --> 01:55.140
remember this is a synchronous.

01:55.150 --> 02:02.060
And if we get any types of errors or problems we're going to just simply return back false to this so

02:02.110 --> 02:07.320
that we just basically returned back false into that function essentially.

02:07.660 --> 02:08.290
So there we go.

02:08.290 --> 02:17.740
So now we can try this another time and we see we get the same output here in the console but this time

02:17.770 --> 02:21.560
we're actually mobile to make use of it here within this function.

02:21.640 --> 02:28.230
And this is actually making this Jaison a loader a whole lot more dynamic which is exactly what we wanted.

02:28.240 --> 02:31.820
I'm going to also get rid of the console lugs because we no longer need that.

02:31.950 --> 02:39.370
And if we ever need to load that Jesus on file and if we want to do something else with it then we can

02:39.370 --> 02:43.040
always load it in at any time because of the callback function.

02:43.060 --> 02:50.530
So now that we've got it this far the next step is to add it into our party array.

02:50.530 --> 02:57.970
So instead of where we had our script we need to load this dynamically so I don't want you to do is

02:57.970 --> 03:04.210
go back a few lessons and we're going to copy and paste some of the code in and we're actually not going

03:04.210 --> 03:07.590
to do the one where we're little local storage.

03:07.690 --> 03:13.420
We're not going to include that part into this because we want to have the ability to make some updates

03:13.480 --> 03:17.080
and pull different file information from online.

03:17.080 --> 03:22.750
So that's one of the reasons why I'd rather not load it into the local storage because that's going

03:22.750 --> 03:24.350
to get a little bit confusing.

03:24.450 --> 03:28.720
We're not going to be able to pick up and differentiate the information on the file and when we make

03:28.720 --> 03:30.820
changes we want that to show up.

03:30.820 --> 03:32.410
So that's the reason why.

03:32.440 --> 03:40.020
So let's go back a few lessons and we're going to add in the rest of that code that we used in order

03:40.020 --> 03:41.150
to build out.

03:41.610 --> 03:47.610
So we still have the CSI us we've got Asynchronous JavaScript we still have that output.

03:47.660 --> 03:50.740
So all the H T model that hasn't changed.

03:50.790 --> 04:02.260
We need to load in so initially what we can do is just bring in all of that content that we had earlier.

04:02.510 --> 04:07.490
And we're just going to make the updates and changes and fixes as we go through it.

04:07.490 --> 04:10.410
So let's bring that information in.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.190
So we had initially we had Party.

04:16.200 --> 04:20.180
And then whenever we the window loaded we build the list.

04:20.220 --> 04:22.810
So this time we've got this chase on function.

04:22.830 --> 04:25.080
So we're going to keep the function the same.

04:25.080 --> 04:28.430
And the thing that's changed is this window is on load.

04:28.440 --> 04:30.050
So we're doing I in I.T..

04:30.150 --> 04:31.800
So let's move this up a bit.

04:31.950 --> 04:34.930
So remember I'm keeping it low chase on in here.

04:35.040 --> 04:42.830
So that's going to allow me to make use of that and sort of build list I'm going to do a few things

04:42.830 --> 04:44.730
where I'm going to move things around.

04:45.230 --> 04:51.050
So instead of window on low build list Let's update that window on Long Island I-T

04:54.690 --> 04:56.820
so that we're going to launch this one.

04:57.120 --> 05:04.530
And now what we do need to know is we need to make sure that this Jason File has loaded before we actually

05:04.530 --> 05:06.500
attempt to build the list.

05:06.660 --> 05:13.000
So that was one of the reasons why we need to wait for that callback to fire off.

05:13.180 --> 05:21.400
And then also let's look at this into party is going to equal to whatever that response back from Jaison

05:21.430 --> 05:22.270
is.

05:22.810 --> 05:26.020
And now let's let's try that out.

05:26.320 --> 05:27.550
So we did have a problem there.

05:27.550 --> 05:32.560
So let's take a quick look and see what's happened because we're still trying to parse that data in

05:32.620 --> 05:33.490
the build list.

05:33.550 --> 05:34.630
We don't need that anymore.

05:34.630 --> 05:36.280
So let's refresh.

05:36.470 --> 05:44.410
And so it looks like that worked properly and we did have some changes within our outputs here so we

05:44.410 --> 05:53.170
lost our checkmarks because I'd saved it in I had saved it into a text file and the text file didn't

05:53.170 --> 05:54.560
keep my checkmarks.

05:54.730 --> 05:55.750
That's what happened there.

05:55.750 --> 05:57.430
So that's active.

05:57.460 --> 06:05.560
So we do some updates and it also didn't keep my exes so amusing these fancy A-S see character X's.

06:05.620 --> 06:09.250
So the drop them basically.

06:09.250 --> 06:11.280
So everything is still working.

06:11.320 --> 06:16.240
And now what I want you to do is create a brand new case on file.

06:16.450 --> 06:19.810
So go ahead and create another one and we're going to link to it.

06:19.810 --> 06:27.340
So add some additional people update the file and make it even more content that the juice on file and

06:27.340 --> 06:29.900
then pull that into the application.

06:29.920 --> 06:36.110
So go ahead and try that out pause the video and I'll show you a solution coming up you had an opportunity

06:36.110 --> 06:41.780
to try that out and with my son you can't actually update it.

06:42.050 --> 06:45.970
You can go in here and you have no option to update it.

06:45.980 --> 06:49.450
So basically you have to create a new case on file every time.

06:49.450 --> 06:54.070
So I know it's not ideal but this is one of the challenges.

06:54.080 --> 06:59.300
And of course if you had the data coming off of your server it would be a whole lot easier to pull that

06:59.300 --> 06:59.770
out.

06:59.780 --> 07:01.240
So we'll keep the same people.

07:01.250 --> 07:07.460
And just to show you that it works just updates some of these values.

07:07.670 --> 07:11.700
And of course you can have as many values as you want here.

07:15.930 --> 07:22.300
And this one will be seven and save that.

07:22.340 --> 07:23.800
So we get a new you are l.

07:23.810 --> 07:29.280
So you got to take that you are l bring it into our file and actually we can close off this Jason one

07:29.330 --> 07:31.040
because we don't need that one any more.

07:31.130 --> 07:32.810
We're not making use of that.

07:33.050 --> 07:39.740
Go back down into where your file is located and you can update that.

07:39.770 --> 07:45.920
So and this is also where we can do some pretty cool things with Jason because we don't have to only

07:45.920 --> 07:46.850
do the callback.

07:46.850 --> 07:53.230
We can pass in a U or L so he could do something like this where we get even more dynamic.

07:53.300 --> 07:56.400
And so the callback What do you are l.

07:56.450 --> 07:59.500
And instead of this let's update this.

07:59.570 --> 08:03.880
So now we're going to be fully dynamic whenever we load this value.

08:03.890 --> 08:06.170
So let's try it out and see if it loads.

08:06.170 --> 08:06.850
So there we go.

08:06.890 --> 08:08.560
So we've got our new entries.

08:08.560 --> 08:10.640
Everybody's working within the list.

08:10.760 --> 08:17.210
And I can also update people dynamically within the list and they just spotted one more bug there that

08:17.270 --> 08:21.850
I don't have those Xs there within my initial set.

08:21.860 --> 08:24.250
So let's let's update that.

08:24.260 --> 08:26.300
So back to those question marks.

08:26.300 --> 08:29.070
And that was just the way that I'd saved the file.

08:29.090 --> 08:29.840
So there we go.

08:29.840 --> 08:35.140
So every time we load we get our list and we're ready to work with that.

08:35.170 --> 08:42.940
So we had an opportunity to try that out and also do some practice with pulling in those Giese on files

08:43.600 --> 08:47.820
using AJAX and then loading that content within your web page.

08:47.950 --> 08:50.680
And you can even do things where you can have a button.

08:50.680 --> 08:55.120
So something that would actually trigger the loading of the on so it doesn't have to be right off the

08:55.120 --> 09:01.060
bat unless you want to use that data right off the bat so you can actually put this into an event listener

09:01.330 --> 09:09.400
and instead of having it lowered you can have a trigger within a page maybe the load data button which

09:09.400 --> 09:12.440
you could click and it would load all of that data in.

09:12.640 --> 09:16.590
So go ahead and try that out and add that into the application.

09:16.870 --> 09:19.920
And then next lesson I'm going to show you even more you can do with Ajax.
