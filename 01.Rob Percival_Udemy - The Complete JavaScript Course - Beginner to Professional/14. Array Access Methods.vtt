00:01.230 --> 00:02.050
Welcome back.

00:02.070 --> 00:06.660
And in this lesson we're going to we're looking at access methods within arrays.

00:06.700 --> 00:09.200
There's a whole bunch of functionality within arrays.

00:09.210 --> 00:15.050
We saw some of the default methods that were already available within arrays in the previous lesson.

00:15.060 --> 00:20.010
So now we want to take this one step further and we've got our arrays set up here.

00:20.010 --> 00:22.060
We've got a bunch of items in the array.

00:22.200 --> 00:29.390
And in this one we're going to return some information or some representation of that array.

00:29.400 --> 00:35.160
So instead of actually modifying the array we need some information out of that range so we can find

00:35.160 --> 00:45.390
out what our position position of the index by using a built in method called index of a new folder.

00:45.510 --> 00:58.010
And this is my real name and next index of index of will return back if there is a value of cat.

00:58.430 --> 01:01.430
So let's try this and refresh it.

01:01.680 --> 01:08.400
And now if I do position and x to get that value we see that cap is at zero.

01:08.430 --> 01:14.760
We can also do we can pick up values so we can do index of.

01:14.820 --> 01:19.890
And we can see that we've got a bird.

01:20.850 --> 01:24.340
So a bird is an index number three and so on.

01:24.480 --> 01:30.750
And this could be really useful actually for our previous exercise where we're guessing the index value

01:31.440 --> 01:33.970
of the particular item in the array.

01:34.320 --> 01:42.030
So what actually happens if I say something that I'm looking for and it doesn't actually exist in memory.

01:42.060 --> 01:46.330
So if I go for horse and in this particular array I don't have a horse in it.

01:46.470 --> 01:49.400
We get a return value of negative one.

01:49.620 --> 01:58.500
So this can actually also be really useful because we can use this in order to detect if a value is

01:58.560 --> 02:00.080
in the array.

02:00.150 --> 02:08.160
So what I want you to do is pause the video and create a solution that's going to actually prompt the

02:08.160 --> 02:17.880
user for for a response and then it's going to look for and check to see if that respondent value in

02:17.880 --> 02:26.610
the prompt is within our array and then reply back to the user whether that is that item is exists in

02:26.610 --> 02:28.140
the array or not.

02:28.140 --> 02:31.610
So no that's quite a few things that are within this challenge.

02:31.710 --> 02:37.300
So let's pause the video and I'm going to show you the solution coming up.

02:37.290 --> 02:38.310
So welcome back.

02:38.310 --> 02:40.820
I hope you have an opportunity to try that out.

02:40.950 --> 02:42.690
So you know that we need a prompt.

02:42.720 --> 02:44.830
So first one is going to be.

02:45.030 --> 02:46.920
So maybe you can just do I just do.

02:46.930 --> 02:50.740
Q Question And this time we're doing prompt.

02:51.270 --> 02:58.670
And what did you want to look for.

02:58.770 --> 03:03.960
Because we're here to look for something within this array and then we're going to return back and we're

03:03.960 --> 03:07.000
going to check to see if it's actually an array.

03:07.140 --> 03:13.980
And we know we need to set up a variable for a message and we also need our console log where we can

03:14.160 --> 03:18.360
put that message so that it's readable within the console.

03:18.360 --> 03:25.380
So next let's set message and this is where we can do a condition value.

03:25.380 --> 03:32.670
So we've got a number of options here and I can actually copy this one sheet a little bit and I'm going

03:32.670 --> 03:36.600
to use what I just use p.

03:37.100 --> 03:45.260
So we're going to check to see if the query that they had entered into the prompt is available in there.

03:45.470 --> 03:49.990
And if it's not we're going to return a negative one.

03:50.180 --> 03:57.930
And if it is then we know that we're going to have a value that's over not negative 1 so 0 or higher.

03:58.280 --> 04:05.210
So let's do our ternary operator here so we know that if p is

04:07.960 --> 04:18.480
greater than negative 1 then what we're going to do is we're going to return back found.

04:18.880 --> 04:25.350
Otherwise we're going to go not there in the message.

04:25.660 --> 04:34.940
So let's try this so it opens up and let's go let's do horse and not there.

04:34.940 --> 04:37.110
So let's try this again this time with Stu.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.020
Can't we see that it's found.

04:39.230 --> 04:46.100
So we see that this index can be used in a number of ways and this was a simplified format to quickly

04:46.100 --> 04:50.830
search and check if the item exists within the array.

04:51.720 --> 04:58.370
So there's actually another method that's available built in within javascript arrays where we can actually

04:58.370 --> 05:04.460
check to see if it's included in this is that includes method so much like what we did with the index

05:04.460 --> 05:06.880
here where we check to see if it exists.

05:07.070 --> 05:09.170
We can get a boolean response.

05:09.170 --> 05:10.760
Let's do new holder.

05:10.880 --> 05:14.360
And this time we're going to use includes.

05:14.900 --> 05:22.790
So this is a built in method within the within javascript and we need to specify what we want to include.

05:22.790 --> 05:26.820
So let's try dog this time and we see that we get a true value.

05:26.930 --> 05:32.540
So if we do a dog with two keys we're going to get false because that's actually not included within

05:32.540 --> 05:33.160
the array.

05:33.290 --> 05:37.550
So that's another way to produce the same results using another method.

05:37.700 --> 05:46.550
And there are quite a lot of methods that are available for arrays within javascript so earlier we had

05:46.550 --> 05:49.920
sought slice and or splice.

05:49.940 --> 05:56.030
And we've got another one that we want to show you before we finish up this lesson and this one is called

05:56.210 --> 05:57.350
splice.

05:57.380 --> 06:04.480
So this actually gives us the ability to slice a part of the array and return that information back.

06:04.620 --> 06:09.020
So let's grab that array and let's do a slice on it.

06:10.380 --> 06:17.100
And slice basically it returns a part of the rate so different then splice because splice allowed us

06:17.100 --> 06:19.280
to actually modify that array.

06:19.290 --> 06:25.320
This is a method that only allows us to pull information from the array.

06:25.470 --> 06:32.340
So we need to specify our STARTING POINT our ending index value and we can see that we can return back

06:32.610 --> 06:41.710
dog and rabbit which is starting from index 1 and ending out before it hits index three.

06:41.790 --> 06:44.340
So just returning back these two items.

06:44.340 --> 06:50.100
So we don't have to specify how many but we've got a starting and a completing point in order to complete

06:50.160 --> 06:53.080
our slice.

06:53.090 --> 06:57.890
So this lesson I wanted to finish off by giving you some homework.

06:58.010 --> 07:05.210
And this is to go over to the Mozilla Developer Network and take a look and see all the different things

07:05.300 --> 07:10.460
you can do with the race because literally this will take me a whole bunch of lessons to kind of work

07:10.460 --> 07:11.320
through all of these.

07:11.420 --> 07:15.450
I've worked through some of the more common ones I've showed you how they work.

07:15.470 --> 07:20.300
So now it's up to you to go over to the Web site and do some research on your own.

07:20.360 --> 07:27.090
Find out a little bit more about what's available in arrays and what more you can do with arrays past

07:27.140 --> 07:32.860
what we've already shown and within this lesson and the previous lessons.

07:32.960 --> 07:39.710
So the next exercise next lesson we're going to be doing another exercise where we're going to be removing

07:39.800 --> 07:45.470
a specific element from the array so whatever element that we're going to be asking and we're going

07:45.470 --> 07:48.470
to remove that specific element out of the array.

07:48.620 --> 07:50.100
So I got to show you how to do that.

07:50.120 --> 07:50.630
Coming up.
