00:00.690 --> 00:09.680
Welcome back in this exercise we're going to be building out a quick prompt asking users what the array

00:09.690 --> 00:17.730
index value is of a particular item that is going to be randomly selected and show within the prompt.

00:18.000 --> 00:26.570
So I need to introduce you to math and math is another built in object that is contained within Javascript.

00:26.640 --> 00:31.570
So it's all ready to go and there's not nothing else additional that you need to do for math.

00:31.800 --> 00:39.120
So let me first let's open up our consul and I'll show you a little bit more about math and math has

00:39.210 --> 00:46.050
a few built in methods that we can do so we can do one called random and we can see that every time

00:46.050 --> 00:53.040
we do math random we get this random number it starts out with 0 it's a decimal number and it's got

00:53.040 --> 00:55.120
a whole bunch of numbers after that.

00:55.350 --> 01:00.780
So basically it gives us the ability to generate a random value.

01:00.780 --> 01:06.980
And at this point it's not really that useful because all of them are decimal something or other.

01:07.110 --> 01:15.210
So we need to actually do something with this random math value and the way that we can do this we can

01:15.270 --> 01:24.720
multiply it by numbers so if we do something like multiplied by 10 we can see that we get a random value

01:24.990 --> 01:32.110
which is going to come in from anywhere from zero to nine point nine nine nine nine nine.

01:32.340 --> 01:34.770
So anywhere within that number.

01:35.130 --> 01:41.370
So we see that we can use math in order to generate this random number but we still have all of this

01:41.370 --> 01:42.770
decimal place.

01:42.990 --> 01:45.090
The rest of those characters.

01:45.090 --> 01:48.630
So within math we also have the ability to round it.

01:48.750 --> 01:51.290
We can round it to the floor.

01:51.300 --> 01:57.710
We can round it to the ceiling and we are going to look more at math in the upcoming Lodder lessons.

01:57.870 --> 02:03.990
But for now what I need it to do is I just want to demonstrate how he can get a random number depending

02:03.990 --> 02:09.030
on how many items we have in the array so we can use math.

02:09.030 --> 02:14.700
Floor and then we can use the math random that we were looking at earlier.

02:15.300 --> 02:25.590
And we can multiply this by 10 and we see that when we use my floor it actually rounds down that number.

02:25.590 --> 02:29.360
So this previously would have been eight point something or other.

02:29.490 --> 02:35.500
And what we're doing with the math floor we're getting rid of all that decimal all those decimal numbers.

02:35.520 --> 02:42.840
So one other last thing that we do want to take care of is that we want to add one to this equation

02:43.080 --> 02:48.500
because we want to start out with 1 to 10 instead of 0 to 9.

02:48.600 --> 02:50.390
So it just makes more sense.

02:50.520 --> 02:55.590
And this is how you can get a random number from 1 to 10.

02:55.590 --> 03:02.730
So now that we saw how math works and math is really super useful whenever you're creating some applications

03:02.960 --> 03:05.670
and you want to have this randomizer effect.

03:05.940 --> 03:08.290
So this is very useful for games.

03:08.520 --> 03:14.220
So let's jump back into our editor and we're going to create an array with a bunch of animals in it

03:14.640 --> 03:21.490
and then we're going to ask the user to guess which index value this.

03:21.570 --> 03:28.320
This animal is appearing at and of course because we're actually the ones that are writing up the array.

03:28.340 --> 03:31.040
We're going to know that we're going to be able to see that.

03:31.140 --> 03:37.140
And this is where having that random value is going to be really interesting because it's going to make

03:37.140 --> 03:43.450
this interaction for the user a lot more interesting so that we don't always have that seems static.

03:43.650 --> 03:50.070
QUESTION So it could be something like maybe we're even ranking our favorite animals and we're starting

03:50.310 --> 03:54.170
with our most favorite which is a cat than a dog and a rabbit.

03:54.300 --> 03:55.510
And then a bird.

03:55.800 --> 03:59.190
And then maybe lastly we could even do a fish.

04:00.120 --> 04:02.710
So we've got an array of animals.

04:03.180 --> 04:06.900
And next we need to select one of those randomly.

04:07.200 --> 04:11.240
So what I want you to do is to pause the video.

04:11.250 --> 04:19.140
Think back to the last previous lesson where we know that animals has a length to it and see if you

04:19.140 --> 04:30.360
can get a random number generated from using the math value if you can get a random index value for

04:30.450 --> 04:34.800
this particular array and then going to show you how to do that coming up.

04:34.800 --> 04:38.290
So pause the video give it a shot and I'll show you the solution.

04:38.310 --> 04:38.750
Coming up

04:41.630 --> 04:49.160
welcome back and I hope you had the opportunity to try the set for yourself and let's just go back out

04:49.160 --> 04:55.970
here will refresh the page and we know that we've got our animals array and every array has a length.

04:55.970 --> 05:03.530
We know that there's five items within that array so we can actually use this to generate a random number.

05:03.530 --> 05:08.040
So let's just do random index.

05:08.030 --> 05:10.280
And this is where we're going to use math.

05:10.280 --> 05:16.670
So this is not built in object that has a bunch of properties and methods attached to it and we are

05:16.670 --> 05:21.880
going to look closer at that later on in the upcoming lessons as we progress through this course.

05:22.010 --> 05:28.850
But for now it's just important to see that we do have ability to generate some random numbers and that

05:28.850 --> 05:32.310
basically makes our javascript a little bit more interesting.

05:32.540 --> 05:38.360
So what we want to do here is we want to multiply it by animals length.

05:38.360 --> 05:45.310
So this is actually going to give us a random index value and then let's just Konsole lockdown for now.

05:45.380 --> 05:50.540
And in the next part we're going to make use of that within our prompt.

05:50.540 --> 05:52.880
So we see that we've got a random index.

05:52.910 --> 05:54.570
And now let's refresh it.

05:54.610 --> 05:59.520
We see that we've got zero or gone all the way up to for some just refreshing it a bunch of times.

05:59.600 --> 06:01.540
So everything looks to be working.

06:01.580 --> 06:07.240
And now we can actually select out a random item from our array.

06:07.250 --> 06:14.840
So what I want you to do now again is to pause the video and set this up so where console logging out

06:15.060 --> 06:17.370
our random item from this array.

06:17.370 --> 06:19.690
So we've got five items in that array.

06:19.740 --> 06:22.950
Our able to pick a random one using math.

06:23.180 --> 06:25.640
So try it out and I'm going to show you the solution.

06:25.640 --> 06:34.390
Suppose the video and I had the opportunity to try to save it for yourself and the solution is to use

06:34.540 --> 06:41.050
the random index variable as our index value that we want to find.

06:41.050 --> 06:50.290
So now when we go back and we refresh it we get a random collection of values coming out of the array.

06:50.350 --> 06:58.740
So now the next step is to simply put that value out into the prompt.

06:58.750 --> 07:01.930
So let's let's create our prompt.

07:01.930 --> 07:04.640
So this is our message to the user.

07:04.810 --> 07:07.720
And here we want it to prompt them.

07:07.900 --> 07:22.860
So we get a prompt and the question is which index value is and maybe what we can do here instead of

07:22.870 --> 07:24.800
canceling it out.

07:25.020 --> 07:32.180
Just call it random random animal.

07:33.570 --> 07:39.570
And this makes it a little bit easier when we're using variables to place that into here and it also

07:39.570 --> 07:47.460
makes it more reusable so that you can pick up this random value and use that anywhere within our Code

07:48.180 --> 07:51.360
Switch index value is the random animal.

07:51.480 --> 07:59.330
And next what we need to do is we need to check to see if the users value is correct.

07:59.340 --> 08:02.340
So let's let's take a look at this as well.

08:04.280 --> 08:09.200
And here we're going to use that Teron ary operator that we looked at earlier which actually is going

08:09.200 --> 08:17.560
to give us the ability to compare what the result is and provide either wrong or correct response.

08:17.570 --> 08:26.750
So this will be response and this one we're going to take a look at the response back here to the message.

08:26.780 --> 08:30.800
So this should be a numeric value for the index value.

08:31.040 --> 08:35.720
And next we need to compare it to the random index value.

08:35.720 --> 08:42.200
So we need to see if it's equal to this random index value and you can bracket around that so it's more

08:42.200 --> 08:43.220
readable.

08:43.640 --> 08:45.900
So just do those rounded brackets.

08:45.950 --> 08:49.810
In next we're going to provide the solution.

08:49.850 --> 08:55.220
So if that condition is true then we're going to put correct.

08:55.220 --> 08:57.610
Otherwise we're going to have put wrong.

09:00.590 --> 09:04.310
And we can also even add to it wrong.

09:07.050 --> 09:17.810
It was and put a space there and concatenate that together and then maybe we can even supply that answer

09:17.820 --> 09:23.390
so that this would be the correct response that we were expecting from the user.

09:23.400 --> 09:30.120
And lastly let's let's alert that out.

09:31.410 --> 09:37.420
So we're just going to alert out the response and let's try to say it.

09:37.530 --> 09:47.490
So now we're ready to try it to ask the user what index value is this random animal and we can see if

09:47.490 --> 09:50.620
the user gets the correct response.

09:50.670 --> 09:55.050
So go out refresh your browser which index value is rabbit.

09:55.080 --> 09:57.330
So we see that it's 0 1 2.

09:57.330 --> 09:59.110
So the correct answer should be two.

09:59.250 --> 10:02.090
But let's put three and we see wrong.

10:02.130 --> 10:02.910
It was two.

10:03.030 --> 10:04.680
So let's try this again.

10:05.050 --> 10:07.980
What index values Ravitz already got that one.

10:08.220 --> 10:13.430
So let's try it again and for some reason it seems like we keep getting Robert.

10:13.720 --> 10:15.260
So let's try this again.

10:15.270 --> 10:16.870
Which index value was fish.

10:16.980 --> 10:21.410
So that was just some random chance that we kept getting rabbit three times in a row.

10:21.410 --> 10:24.580
So now we've got which index value is fish.

10:24.870 --> 10:27.970
So we need to specify which item it is in the index.

10:28.080 --> 10:31.460
So let's give it a value of four and we see that we are correct.

10:31.470 --> 10:33.290
So are you going to have some fun with this.

10:34.330 --> 10:41.220
And you see how much more interesting random makes things as we don't know which item from that array

10:41.220 --> 10:42.570
is going to be popping up.

10:42.720 --> 10:49.050
And we were able to use it in a combination with the prompt and the terror and every operator in order

10:49.050 --> 10:55.670
to return back a response checking to see if the user answered correctly or not.

10:56.370 --> 11:01.060
So the next lesson we're going to be looking at how we can modify our raise.

11:01.110 --> 11:04.870
So right now we've been working with a fairly static static array.

11:04.890 --> 11:09.840
We've done some modifications within the console but I'm going to show you how to do that within the

11:09.840 --> 11:10.760
code as well.

11:10.770 --> 11:11.680
So that's coming up.
