00:01.260 --> 00:05.130
In this first lesson we're going to be showing you how to write javascript.

00:05.130 --> 00:07.950
So what I've got open right now is brackets.

00:07.950 --> 00:13.320
This is the editor that I'm going to be using with in this course and this is the first tool that you're

00:13.320 --> 00:17.400
going to need in order to write javascript and you can use any editor.

00:17.400 --> 00:19.610
There's a lot of different editors out there.

00:19.620 --> 00:21.290
This one is called brackets.

00:21.300 --> 00:23.900
It's free to use it's available at bracket's I O.

00:23.970 --> 00:28.830
It's an Adobe product and I am going to be using it within this course if you're interested in using

00:28.830 --> 00:30.050
the same one that I'm using.

00:30.050 --> 00:31.540
It's available at brackets.

00:31.690 --> 00:37.970
And you can go out and download it and do the basic install and that'll get you started with an editor.

00:38.010 --> 00:44.110
The next tool that we need to render out Javascript is a browser and for this course the browser that

00:44.110 --> 00:51.030
I'm going to be using is chrome chrome comes with dev tools and basically with dev tools This gives

00:51.030 --> 00:55.680
us an opportunity to write and see javascript directly within the browser.

00:55.680 --> 01:01.530
So it's really important when it comes to editing and working with javascript and especially if you're

01:01.530 --> 01:02.490
developing.

01:02.490 --> 01:04.800
This is a great resource to have.

01:05.130 --> 01:10.410
If you don't have chrome Chrome is also free to download it's available at Chrome dot com.

01:10.410 --> 01:16.420
And if you will find out more about dev tools that's available at developer dot chrome dot com dev tools.

01:16.530 --> 01:18.780
And in order to access dev tools.

01:18.780 --> 01:20.050
So I'm on a Windows machine.

01:20.070 --> 01:23.450
But if you're on a Mac it's control it's command Opt..

01:23.490 --> 01:24.700
And a Windows machine.

01:24.710 --> 01:26.760
It's Control shift.

01:26.970 --> 01:33.690
And what that does is that opens up this little menu at the bottom and the main tab that we're going

01:33.690 --> 01:37.570
to be looking out for most of this course is the console tab.

01:37.590 --> 01:43.150
So if you do have chrome and if you're watching this video on Chrome go ahead and open up dev tools

01:43.150 --> 01:50.510
that's installed on every version of chrome and go over to the console area of the developer tools tape

01:50.520 --> 01:54.090
in alert and hello.

01:54.150 --> 01:57.800
You can also do hello world if you want and close it off.

01:57.900 --> 02:04.680
So with the alert the rounded brackets quotes and then pass yourself a message so you can do hello world

02:04.770 --> 02:09.300
as well and hit enter and you're going to see that the browser is going to pop up.

02:09.300 --> 02:12.780
This little message alert message to you that says Hello world.

02:12.780 --> 02:17.100
So whatever you're typing in to here is actually what's going to get displayed here.

02:17.160 --> 02:23.790
And this is javascript so you can actually run and write your javascript directly within your browser

02:24.060 --> 02:26.700
and see on any web page.

02:26.730 --> 02:27.700
Try it out.

02:27.720 --> 02:28.890
Pause the video.

02:28.980 --> 02:30.920
Open up your browser.

02:30.940 --> 02:36.430
If you don't have chrome open up chrome and type in alert rounded bracket Hello world.

02:36.510 --> 02:38.360
And that's your first Javascript code.

02:38.460 --> 02:41.410
And the next lesson we're going to dive deeper into javascript.
