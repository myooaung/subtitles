00:00.680 --> 00:03.760
This lesson we're going to continue to build out our party list.

00:03.800 --> 00:11.930
And previously we left off the last lesson where we're able to add users into our list but we don't

00:11.930 --> 00:13.810
have are at least initially being displayed.

00:13.820 --> 00:17.600
So we actually don't know who is in that list right off the bat.

00:17.600 --> 00:23.600
So let's add in some colors and we're also going to add in creating an active one so the active ones

00:23.600 --> 00:26.270
are going to be the ones that we've already checked off.

00:26.420 --> 00:28.450
So let's set up.

00:28.510 --> 00:33.410
We know that we set up the class toggle so they're all going to be holding within that class toggle.

00:33.500 --> 00:37.790
So it's Add in some padding and padding of 10 picks.

00:37.820 --> 00:39.680
Let's do a background color.

00:39.920 --> 00:41.370
So the background color.

00:41.540 --> 00:48.780
So this is going to be for the ones that are not active maybe do Alice blue.

00:48.920 --> 00:53.840
And this is also optional so whatever color you pick is perfect.

00:53.840 --> 00:57.020
I want to make this big so one point three.

00:57.110 --> 00:58.500
Let's do margin.

00:58.760 --> 01:03.860
And so we got a little bit of spacing between the different cells and I'm running through this really

01:03.860 --> 01:07.280
quickly because I don't spend a whole lot of time on the CSX.

01:07.310 --> 01:12.470
So again I want to keep the focus of the Course to be on Javascript.

01:12.560 --> 01:18.170
So that's why a lot of this stuff how it looks is this is really optional.

01:18.190 --> 01:20.730
So let's set that up as white.

01:20.930 --> 01:23.510
And this is just so that I can distinguish.

01:23.510 --> 01:28.110
So whenever I do add in a value I can really easily see it there.

01:28.130 --> 01:34.310
So the objective from the last lesson was to build out our list and we know we've got this function

01:34.370 --> 01:42.830
build list so let's add an event listener so we can add it in here and we'll just do window we'll do

01:42.830 --> 01:50.520
this one the window onload and whenever the window loads and we'll build list.

01:50.600 --> 01:52.890
So launch build list function.

01:52.940 --> 01:55.370
So over here is the build list function.

01:55.380 --> 02:00.450
So the first things that we know is that we need to actually.

02:00.470 --> 02:09.000
So we've loaded in the party values there and we can also set up a blank Hooray for a party and then

02:09.000 --> 02:12.660
we could parson load that data in if we wanted to as well.

02:12.660 --> 02:20.140
So maybe that would probably be a better way to do that where now it's a set up party to load in that.

02:20.160 --> 02:25.860
So whenever the window is ready and it's loading that we know we can add value in there.

02:25.860 --> 02:29.140
So next that we want to do is we want to loop through Party.

02:29.160 --> 02:34.310
So as we've seen in the earlier lessons there's a number of ways to do the loop.

02:34.320 --> 02:41.340
I'm going to do a standard for loop and if you did it within another loop and that's working then that's

02:41.340 --> 02:42.440
fine as well.

02:42.690 --> 02:49.380
And as we've seen with javascript there's a number of ways to do things and sometimes something is suited

02:49.470 --> 02:51.410
better suited than others.

02:51.420 --> 02:58.230
The reason that I wanted to do the for loop is that I believe we probably need to get the ID.

02:58.290 --> 03:03.600
And this is probably the easiest way to grab the ID when we're looping through.

03:03.830 --> 03:15.030
So lastly let's also add in a class so this will just call C and by default we're just not we're not

03:15.030 --> 03:22.170
going to pass any values into it over here so just leave it blank and I'll show you what I want to do

03:22.260 --> 03:23.730
with this.

03:23.760 --> 03:34.160
So as we loop through I want to add in a value for the active users so we're looping through and I want

03:34.160 --> 03:38.200
to also keep that same type of format that we have here.

03:38.210 --> 03:43.140
So let me grab a message and we do have two options.

03:43.180 --> 03:45.960
So we know that this is where we need a condition.

03:46.000 --> 03:52.900
So we need to check to make sure as we're looping through Party sort of the value of party X is we're

03:52.900 --> 04:00.000
going to check to see the status and if the status is true then we know that we're going to pass on

04:00.100 --> 04:01.900
a message where it's going to be true.

04:02.080 --> 04:06.640
And if the status otherwise we're going to pass in the message where it's false.

04:06.640 --> 04:09.760
So this is OK for false and for true.

04:09.840 --> 04:15.250
Let's set a check mark there and we're also going to pass in the class active

04:18.110 --> 04:23.740
and now let's go down to here and let's add in those classes.

04:23.890 --> 04:28.000
So let's try this so let's refresh the page and say.

04:28.030 --> 04:31.230
We do have a problem there because we don't have a g value.

04:31.450 --> 04:34.420
So this is the party status value.

04:34.420 --> 04:36.910
So party status.

04:37.000 --> 04:41.810
So we know that ads were looping through here that it's not party status.

04:41.920 --> 04:46.560
It's going to be the name and this this variable is the same.

04:46.570 --> 04:49.210
So let's create a variable to hold it.

04:49.210 --> 04:53.020
So basically this is the person or the message whatever we want to call it.

04:53.020 --> 04:57.270
So as we're building that vote I'm going to just take those values.

04:57.320 --> 05:05.540
They're And this actually isn't going to be party length either.

05:05.560 --> 05:08.950
So let's let's leave a space there for that one.

05:08.960 --> 05:14.860
And the party length is going to be the value of x.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.830
So this is basically giving us the index of value.

05:18.150 --> 05:23.460
So person and this is what we're just going to pass through because this message is actually going to

05:23.460 --> 05:24.530
be the same thing.

05:24.540 --> 05:29.140
So it's just the number of it's the name of the person.

05:29.200 --> 05:31.140
So let's update this.

05:31.180 --> 05:36.190
It's inside value but it's party X and that's a name.

05:36.400 --> 05:41.800
And then we're adding in how many additional people so this is the guests.

05:41.800 --> 05:47.180
So party guests and let's close that off.

05:47.200 --> 05:48.700
So let's try that again.

05:49.300 --> 05:56.440
So now when we are refreshed so we're getting that data that's loading again from Jason Jason and I

05:56.440 --> 06:02.860
promise you in upcoming lessons we are going to transform this into an actual Jaison file and make use

06:02.860 --> 06:04.690
of that within our application.

06:04.690 --> 06:07.120
So for now let's just keep it as this.

06:07.210 --> 06:08.110
And there we go.

06:08.110 --> 06:14.300
So we've got our list and whenever we add people to the list we can add people down at the bottom.

06:15.930 --> 06:19.230
And we can continuously add people into the list.

06:19.230 --> 06:23.280
So the next part is to actually make these clickable.

06:23.520 --> 06:28.740
So this is going to be another challenge that in order to make these clickable.

06:28.740 --> 06:34.110
Now of course we know that we could loop through all of the toggles But then we're adding you toggles

06:34.440 --> 06:36.980
and it can get quite complex.

06:37.020 --> 06:44.320
So probably one of the easiest ways to do is to add an event listener to that entire element output.

06:44.340 --> 06:49.440
So this entire elements and we know that we've got all of these values contained within here and we

06:49.440 --> 06:51.970
know that we have output already created.

06:51.990 --> 06:57.030
So let's go ahead and add an event listener to that entire element and then it doesn't actually matter

06:57.060 --> 07:02.490
as we add new values because the listeners on the entire output area.

07:02.790 --> 07:04.270
So let's do that.

07:04.410 --> 07:10.890
So document and we do have output I believe we already have put set here.

07:11.000 --> 07:16.050
So this is going to be a little bit easier where we can just add in the listener to hear.

07:16.050 --> 07:22.430
So as a listener and the listener is going to be click and we'll just do the function within here as

07:22.430 --> 07:23.040
well.

07:23.060 --> 07:25.380
PONSON the event object.

07:25.730 --> 07:27.820
And so now we're all ready to go.

07:27.820 --> 07:30.440
So let's grab a value

07:34.130 --> 07:37.360
and I'm going to set a default holder here for it.

07:37.400 --> 07:46.850
I call it E-L and whenever we click that we're going to set the L is equal to event target or target

07:47.630 --> 07:54.920
because we're remember here we're passing through a event as valuable he lets console log whatever the

07:54.920 --> 07:57.720
value of L is.

07:57.770 --> 08:06.590
So refresh so we click it we can see we get this data information here so we're getting that entire

08:06.590 --> 08:07.990
element when we click it.

08:08.060 --> 08:11.690
And this is actually going to be true even if we add new values.

08:11.720 --> 08:13.320
So there we've got the data.

08:13.370 --> 08:20.730
We've got the person data person so we can grab that information directly from our element.

08:20.750 --> 08:26.750
So let's let's add in the next part where we're going to pick up the value we're going to update it

08:27.050 --> 08:28.400
and we're going to

08:31.160 --> 08:33.050
toggle the class.

08:33.050 --> 08:42.080
So going back into the earlier lessons when we looked at the dorm How would you toggle the class.

08:42.100 --> 08:47.590
How would you add and remove a class depending on if it's got gotten clicked and we know that we can

08:47.590 --> 08:52.740
grab that element because it's the target and we get that element.

08:52.840 --> 08:57.490
So we don't get output we don't get the whole output we get the element that actually triggered it.

08:57.490 --> 09:00.400
So that's the really nice thing about this format.

09:00.760 --> 09:10.000
So going back into what we saw earlier we can do a class list and we can simply toggle the value and

09:10.000 --> 09:13.840
that basically remove set or adds in a class.

09:13.840 --> 09:15.690
So let's get active.

09:15.760 --> 09:23.380
And this is a really easy way to set this type of thing so basically we click it and we can update the

09:23.380 --> 09:24.190
colors.

09:24.370 --> 09:26.130
So that was the first thing that we need to do.

09:26.230 --> 09:30.580
And the other thing we need to do and this one is a little bit more difficult is we need to change these

09:30.640 --> 09:38.650
Xs to check BARCS because it's not exactly formatting and that you could as well do these values as

09:38.650 --> 09:39.480
classes.

09:39.490 --> 09:42.590
So if you wanted to you could already set that up in classes.

09:42.670 --> 09:46.520
But we've gone this far and we've set them up as elements.

09:46.660 --> 09:55.780
So we need to identify the children of this one and we did place them all in as span's.

09:55.780 --> 09:59.710
So we need to see whatever that inner H-2 himself value is.

09:59.890 --> 10:05.700
And we need to toggle it and we can achieve this actually with a tear unary operator.

10:05.980 --> 10:07.770
So let's set that up.

10:07.810 --> 10:16.760
So E-L and we know that this is children so we know that each element has children and it's got an h

10:16.760 --> 10:17.560
t m-L.

10:17.620 --> 10:22.270
So that first child is going to be the only child that we see in there.

10:22.270 --> 10:25.800
The only element that's in there is going to be the spam.

10:25.810 --> 10:26.980
There are always first.

10:26.980 --> 10:28.860
So it's the first child there.

10:28.900 --> 10:33.620
So by default it's just the way that we've set up the order that we can identify it this way.

10:33.790 --> 10:38.590
So let's grab that first child and we're going to set that each to m-L.

10:39.010 --> 10:41.950
And this is where the territory operator comes in.

10:42.190 --> 10:47.120
So we need to do a check of that current element that we're looking for.

10:47.140 --> 10:54.080
So that inner h to M L and we're checking to see if it's actually equal to a checkmark.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.880
And if it is true.

10:56.890 --> 11:04.090
So if this is true that we know we need to flip it into an X and if it's not true.

11:04.150 --> 11:13.480
So just to the alternative that we know that if it's an X or if it's not if it's not x then we know

11:13.480 --> 11:15.560
we need to turn it into a checkmark.

11:15.910 --> 11:16.840
So let's do that.

11:16.840 --> 11:18.360
So let's try this one.

11:18.400 --> 11:19.110
No.

11:19.120 --> 11:20.620
So let's refresh.

11:20.640 --> 11:23.780
And so now we've got the checkmark in the x.

11:23.800 --> 11:25.480
So everything is working.

11:25.510 --> 11:30.520
So there's actually one other thing that we need to flip and we can do this within the territory operator

11:30.610 --> 11:31.720
as well.

11:31.720 --> 11:38.270
So this is actually within the array because our party array is not updating yet.

11:38.320 --> 11:42.860
So even though we've been clicking it it's not updating the status isn't updating.

11:43.090 --> 11:48.990
And remember we can grab that information via dataset.

11:49.000 --> 11:54.780
So if we wanted to we could do variable d s.

11:54.940 --> 12:00.930
So this is for the data set we can grab L and grab data set.

12:00.940 --> 12:07.330
So this grabs all of the dataset information of that element and we know that we're passing through

12:07.390 --> 12:11.470
the values here as data ID data person and so on.

12:11.560 --> 12:18.250
So we can pick up that information within the data set so what I want you to do now is create a terrine

12:18.250 --> 12:24.810
every operator just like we did over here but it's actually going to flip the value within the party

12:24.940 --> 12:25.450
array.

12:25.490 --> 12:27.950
So go ahead and try that out and I'll show you the solution.

12:29.260 --> 12:32.260
So you had an opportunity to try that one out.

12:32.350 --> 12:33.790
And what we need to do.

12:33.790 --> 12:39.870
We needed to toggle sort of toggling the classes where toggling the checkmarks and this access.

12:39.880 --> 12:45.640
This is a great exercise and terrine area operators as well toggling that we're flipping them back and

12:45.640 --> 12:46.290
forth.

12:46.300 --> 12:53.340
So what we need to do is we need to check the dataset and we know that we can do D.S..

12:53.380 --> 12:56.790
So this is going to contain the data set dataset.

12:56.790 --> 12:59.930
ID is going to have that ID value of it

13:02.580 --> 13:07.100
and can get rid of this stuff because we're actually looking at the party.

13:07.500 --> 13:10.950
So D.S. ID and it's on each to.

13:10.980 --> 13:14.030
Its status.

13:14.040 --> 13:24.120
So this is how we can identify the status and lets check to see if the status is true and if its true.

13:24.120 --> 13:30.330
So we don't need any of this because it's going to simply check to see if it's true and if it is true

13:30.630 --> 13:32.830
then we're flipping it to false

13:36.760 --> 13:38.160
because we're toggling it.

13:38.290 --> 13:42.400
And if it's false then we're flipping it to true.

13:42.440 --> 13:44.060
So let's try that.

13:44.120 --> 13:47.510
And also let's put party into there.

13:47.900 --> 13:48.630
So let's try this.

13:48.670 --> 13:51.330
So refresh and toggle.

13:51.350 --> 13:54.590
So hopefully when we go down here we see it's true.

13:54.590 --> 13:58.730
When I click it again we go down and we see that it's false.

13:58.730 --> 14:05.600
So if you didn't have an opportunity to try this and it's a great practice exercise for ternary operators

14:05.660 --> 14:07.240
and toggling values.

14:07.310 --> 14:12.800
So we've got a number of things we're toggling here as they get clicked and this can be used in a number

14:12.800 --> 14:13.920
of different ways.

14:13.940 --> 14:17.600
So go ahead and try that out and in their next lesson.

14:17.600 --> 14:19.430
So the last thing that we need to do.

14:19.700 --> 14:22.700
So this part is working and we can toggle this one.

14:22.790 --> 14:29.120
And if we can add in guests so it doesn't actually matter how many elements we have there they're all

14:29.120 --> 14:31.140
going to have that shared functionality.

14:31.160 --> 14:36.810
So everything is targetable and this is actually going to be great for building out our party list.

14:37.040 --> 14:44.780
So the next thing that I want to do is one last thing and the party list going back a few lessons.

14:45.020 --> 14:47.450
Let's start to local storage.

14:47.450 --> 14:55.030
So this time we need to set the item and we need to string a fire do that Chase string ify.

14:55.220 --> 15:04.620
And then if that is already set then instead of loading the value from the Jasen data file we can adding

15:04.620 --> 15:09.380
in party from the data file wherever we do that when we're doing the build list.

15:09.380 --> 15:10.650
So over here.

15:10.650 --> 15:15.550
So instead of getting it from the data file Let's get it from the local storage.

15:15.560 --> 15:22.310
So go ahead and add that into the application and I'll show you the solution coming up on the next lesson.
