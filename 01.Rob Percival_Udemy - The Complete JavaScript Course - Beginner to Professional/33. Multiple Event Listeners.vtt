00:00.860 --> 00:01.720
Welcome back.

00:01.730 --> 00:06.910
And earlier we saw well we're using the mouse event listener that we could get.

00:06.900 --> 00:11.720
Actually the position within the listener of where the mouse is located.

00:11.960 --> 00:16.420
So let's set up a div and this div will act as a container.

00:16.550 --> 00:22.010
So let's give it a class and we're going to give it as a class of Holder.

00:24.580 --> 00:31.030
And then inside of here I'm going to create another div and I'm going to give this one an ID of output

00:32.020 --> 00:37.940
so I can identify both divs and I also want to add some styling to those divs.

00:38.110 --> 00:41.910
So let's go up here and let's apply some styling.

00:42.130 --> 00:53.740
So let's grab that Holder element or all the holder elements and let's do a display and inline block

00:53.740 --> 00:55.450
is the one that we want to use.

00:55.870 --> 00:59.080
So inline block and give it a with.

00:59.140 --> 01:03.360
So I want to make it nice and wide and also I want to make it nice and high.

01:03.370 --> 01:10.130
So do 300 pics by 300 pics and let's add in a border so we know that where it's positioned.

01:10.150 --> 01:19.230
So one pick a solid block and let's add some padding around it saying 10 pics of padding around it.

01:19.300 --> 01:19.900
So there we go.

01:19.900 --> 01:25.450
So now we've got that Holder and there actually is going to be one other class that I want to add in

01:25.450 --> 01:26.080
here.

01:26.080 --> 01:27.860
And this is going to be the active one.

01:27.970 --> 01:31.720
So whenever it's active I want to change the background color.

01:31.810 --> 01:32.940
So lets make it red.

01:32.950 --> 01:35.830
So it really stands out and pops out.

01:35.860 --> 01:44.650
So within this lesson what I want it to do is use javascript and whenever the user is on top of this

01:44.650 --> 01:50.740
element I want to pick up where the positioning of the mouse is and I want to output that information

01:50.800 --> 01:52.280
into output here.

01:52.510 --> 02:01.000
So whenever they hover over holder we're going to fire off the vent and we're going to pick up and output

02:01.360 --> 02:04.970
where the element is located.

02:06.300 --> 02:15.470
So now what I want you to do is to I don't event listener to Holder.

02:15.810 --> 02:22.990
So I want to be able to detect whenever there is a mouse over the holder element within here aged him

02:23.000 --> 02:23.590
out.

02:23.820 --> 02:24.630
So go ahead.

02:24.630 --> 02:34.210
Pause the video and create that class there holder and then at an event listener within your javascript

02:34.210 --> 02:38.080
to be able to tell when the mouse is on top of that element.

02:39.230 --> 02:42.960
So pause the video try to show you the solution coming up.

02:42.980 --> 02:49.630
So first thing that we need to do is we need to grab the element so let's do document and get.

02:50.120 --> 02:57.560
Or we can actually let's do query selector so know that there's a number of different ways to to select

02:57.560 --> 02:57.730
it.

02:57.740 --> 03:02.570
And it actually doesn't matter because all we're trying to do is just make a selection.

03:02.600 --> 03:08.460
So however you're selecting that element in any way that you're selecting it is fine.

03:08.510 --> 03:13.100
So this time we're using Querrey selectors so that we have a little bit of variety in the way that we're

03:13.100 --> 03:19.310
doing our selection and we're not always using get element by id and so on we can also use by class

03:19.610 --> 03:25.510
and just simply select the first one there because we know we only have one but query selector will

03:25.510 --> 03:26.410
do the trick.

03:26.410 --> 03:31.900
So the next thing that we need to do is add the listener so that the listener and the listener that

03:31.900 --> 03:34.710
we're listening for is mouse over.

03:34.750 --> 03:38.960
So whenever the mouse is over we want to fire off a function.

03:39.100 --> 03:42.360
And within this function we want it to

03:45.140 --> 03:47.030
trigger something to happen.

03:47.030 --> 03:53.540
So for now let's just log it out in the console that we're actually on top of the cell.

03:53.540 --> 03:56.780
So let's get it ready.

03:56.780 --> 03:59.160
So now let's go in and refresh.

03:59.360 --> 04:04.970
And we see that now whenever we're on top then it's firing off and it's triggering that event.

04:05.000 --> 04:11.900
So we're ready to do the next part and the next part of it is to go back a few lessons where we looked

04:11.900 --> 04:21.830
at class list and where we found that we can add and remove different elements different classes into

04:24.690 --> 04:25.890
an element.

04:25.890 --> 04:29.670
So what I want to do is I actually want to add.

04:29.670 --> 04:34.440
So whenever we're over I want to add the active class to the element.

04:34.560 --> 04:39.120
So pause the video and update that Sunstone of console log.

04:39.240 --> 04:44.800
I want you to add to the element that the mouse is on top of it.

04:44.940 --> 04:45.870
So let's do that.

04:45.900 --> 04:50.890
So let's do we're going to use this and it's class list.

04:51.030 --> 04:55.370
So class list and we are within the class list.

04:55.380 --> 04:57.170
We're using the method of ADD.

04:57.330 --> 05:01.810
So we're simply adding in a class whenever the mouse is on top.

05:01.920 --> 05:04.050
So let's go out and try this out.

05:04.080 --> 05:05.950
So we see that it's working.

05:06.450 --> 05:12.300
So now there is a second challenge that we need to do because we've added active but whenever we're

05:12.300 --> 05:15.250
going off it's actually being removed.

05:15.270 --> 05:16.780
So we need to take care of that.

05:16.800 --> 05:23.700
So what I want you to do again pause the video and do the mouse out and for the mouse out.

05:23.820 --> 05:30.020
What I want you to do is remove that active class.

05:30.060 --> 05:30.930
So go ahead.

05:30.930 --> 05:34.700
Plus a video and update the code to remove the active class.

05:34.710 --> 05:39.100
Whenever we're out of that element so show you the solution.

05:39.510 --> 05:45.190
So the solution is simply that instead of hard work in to remove.

05:45.270 --> 05:50.290
And instead of mouse over we're going to do most.

05:50.310 --> 05:56.830
So now let's refresh the page and try to add a mouse over red it's active mouse out.

05:56.850 --> 05:58.230
We're removing that element.

05:58.380 --> 06:03.150
So that's how we can really get really effective with what we can do within the dorm because we can

06:03.150 --> 06:04.740
add and remove classes.

06:04.830 --> 06:12.180
So we have a number of all of these different pieces of functionality working together in order to accomplish

06:12.180 --> 06:16.850
the results that we want happening within our within our code.

06:17.220 --> 06:22.830
So the next thing that I wanted to do is I actually want it to pick up where the mouse is located and

06:22.830 --> 06:26.670
I want it to output that within that output element.

06:26.670 --> 06:31.630
So this one is another event listener and this one is.

06:31.740 --> 06:33.770
So we're doing as a listener.

06:34.050 --> 06:37.120
And this one is called Most move.

06:37.320 --> 06:44.310
So basically whenever the mouse is moving and we're on top of the particular element that we want it

06:44.310 --> 06:47.710
to fire off and we want to launch one of the functions.

06:47.820 --> 06:56.130
So instead of having an anonymous function I'm going to just call this going to actually get the coordinates

06:59.390 --> 07:04.370
so we just call it cord and so that's the function.

07:04.370 --> 07:08.540
And this one is going to fire off and it's going to go to another function.

07:08.540 --> 07:11.660
So we're not going to do it within the same format which we could.

07:11.930 --> 07:16.850
But just to be different and to show a little bit of variety let's create a brand new function here

07:18.260 --> 07:21.850
and Cordone is the name of the function.

07:21.860 --> 07:28.070
And now this one needs to pick up where we're located.

07:28.070 --> 07:35.220
So first of all let's log it will do a console log and whenever we're over it let's log out.

07:35.250 --> 07:37.580
That oven that's firing this off.

07:37.640 --> 07:42.710
So just to make sure that we're still getting that event object and we are still getting that event

07:42.770 --> 07:49.640
object and we can see within the event object we've got client X and if we scroll down a little bit

07:49.640 --> 07:51.110
we've got client y.

07:51.170 --> 07:53.410
So that's the mouse location.

07:53.500 --> 07:57.780
And we see once we go right up to the corner it's going to be pretty much zero and zero.

07:57.860 --> 08:03.770
And as we move down through that element we get to two larger numbers.

08:03.770 --> 08:08.350
So basically those are the coordinates that I want to log in to the output.

08:08.690 --> 08:16.640
So what I want you to do now is once again pause that video and update this element output with these

08:16.640 --> 08:19.550
coordinates as the users move in the mouse.

08:19.550 --> 08:27.530
So basically it will show up the client X. So you can just say X and Y output that over here and output

08:27.530 --> 08:29.510
them as the user moves the mouse.

08:29.510 --> 08:35.260
So pause the video and remember that this is an object.

08:35.270 --> 08:40.410
So we already have this and we already have all of this information sitting within the event object.

08:40.430 --> 08:43.950
So all you have to do is output it within that output element.

08:44.090 --> 08:48.860
So pause the video and try that out and I'll show you the solution coming up.

08:48.980 --> 08:55.710
So the solution for it is that first of all let's hook up to our output.

08:56.000 --> 09:05.420
We can actually get rid of the console log and let's do document a document get element by id and we're

09:05.420 --> 09:12.160
going to grab output and with it output we're going to do it for each A now.

09:12.410 --> 09:18.740
So we're going to set that age to a male and let's set up a brand new variable will register a brand

09:18.740 --> 09:24.450
new variable called H.E. and now and then within here let's create our output stream.

09:24.650 --> 09:32.270
So we know that we want to get the value of x and we want to do whatever to get the value of x and then

09:32.300 --> 09:34.970
also we want to do the value of y.

09:35.030 --> 09:41.270
So we can put a pipe there in the middle and then over here is going to be the value of y.

09:41.660 --> 09:47.420
So now we need to be able to find those values and the good thing about it is we already have access

09:47.420 --> 09:49.250
to them within the event.

09:49.460 --> 09:51.590
And we can use client

09:55.640 --> 09:58.840
so it's client X that we're looking for.

09:58.850 --> 10:02.210
So when we do that then we're going to get the value of client X..

10:02.450 --> 10:05.510
And at this time we need client y over here.

10:05.510 --> 10:08.480
So let's go back to refresh the code and try to.

10:08.480 --> 10:14.060
So now whenever we're over we can actually see the coordinates of where the mouse is located and as

10:14.060 --> 10:14.890
we drag out.

10:14.930 --> 10:21.130
And then once we leave we get it go it doesn't go red and we're not picking up the coordinates anymore.

10:21.170 --> 10:23.860
And then when we come back in we're getting those coordinates again.

10:25.640 --> 10:31.910
So that's how you add multiple event listeners to the same element and you can do a number of different

10:31.910 --> 10:32.660
things with those.
