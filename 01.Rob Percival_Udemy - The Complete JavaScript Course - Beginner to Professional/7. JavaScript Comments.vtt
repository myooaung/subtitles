00:00.840 --> 00:04.870
Earlier we saw how we can use the console for debugging.

00:04.980 --> 00:13.230
And now let's look at some more ways to pass some information to other web developers or even to ourselves

00:13.470 --> 00:18.930
for debug debugging or for just documenting and commenting purposes.

00:18.930 --> 00:24.880
So we see that within our editor we've got a couple lines of code here so we've got document right.

00:24.900 --> 00:30.240
We've got alert and let's say for instance I don't want to keep showing up.

00:30.240 --> 00:34.220
So I find this little pop up box every time I load my page.

00:34.260 --> 00:35.760
It's getting really annoying.

00:35.790 --> 00:40.690
And I want to simply I don't want to run this particular statement.

00:40.920 --> 00:42.600
So the easiest way to get rid of it.

00:42.630 --> 00:48.870
But also keep it within my code because you never know just in case later on I might want to have that

00:48.870 --> 00:53.910
back in my code so I don't want to completely just delete it and then have to figure out how to write

00:53.910 --> 00:54.630
it again.

00:54.750 --> 01:01.440
I'm just wanted to comment that and so now when I refreshed my page we see that the document right writes

01:01.440 --> 01:04.560
the page and I am refreshed in that page.

01:04.620 --> 01:09.650
So what's happening right now is that not alert simply isn't firing off.

01:09.720 --> 01:13.290
And if I do the same thing here for that document right.

01:13.380 --> 01:19.830
So this is just two forward slashes and that gives me the ability to comment out the code and bracket's

01:19.830 --> 01:26.760
is doing a great job here of bringing out that information because basically what this means is that

01:26.760 --> 01:30.030
we're not actually writing out that information.

01:30.190 --> 01:36.330
So let's say for instance I've got quite a bit of code so I've got a bunch of these little worlds and

01:36.450 --> 01:42.960
all of a sudden I realized well I don't need five Hello worlds repeating and I want to get rid of some

01:42.960 --> 01:43.530
of them.

01:43.590 --> 01:50.920
So there is a way to commentate multiple lines so I could just as easily go like this commented out

01:51.150 --> 01:52.640
but there's another way to do that.

01:52.680 --> 01:57.780
And that is with the same four slash but doing the asterisks.

01:57.900 --> 02:04.290
And then once you've gone through and you're satisfied that this is the chunk of code that I want to

02:04.390 --> 02:10.060
commentate then you just do it in backwards format where you do the Asterix and the forward slash.

02:10.170 --> 02:13.650
And we see that brackets grees this information out.

02:13.650 --> 02:17.820
And actually what I'm probably going to do is me that can move it even on top there.

02:17.850 --> 02:25.470
So this gives us an easy way to block chunks of code and you'll see this used as well for multiple comments

02:25.560 --> 02:27.070
or instructions.

02:27.240 --> 02:38.020
So I want to give myself credit it's about something or I want to add I don't want to forget.

02:38.020 --> 02:49.560
So don't forget to say hello or maybe we can say don't forget to say good bye.

02:49.590 --> 02:55.790
So this would just be some additional information within our code that we can be going through.

02:55.830 --> 02:58.640
And all of a sudden where we see that.

02:58.660 --> 03:03.870
OK well we've added this here and there's a reason that we've added this and that we should say don't

03:03.870 --> 03:05.090
forget to say goodbye.

03:05.090 --> 03:06.110
So I said hello.

03:06.210 --> 03:07.870
And we also want to say goodbye.

03:08.010 --> 03:12.140
So another way to add comments in is to do it after the statement.

03:12.210 --> 03:16.850
So you see this as well so if it's pertaining for a particular line of code.

03:16.860 --> 03:22.790
So over here we want to say good bye change to good bye.

03:23.010 --> 03:25.230
So you can make notes about your code.

03:25.440 --> 03:31.310
And this gives you the ability when you revisit it later to see what you were thinking at the time.

03:31.320 --> 03:38.340
And if you are going through a bunch of logic sometimes it's not beneficial to jump to something else

03:38.370 --> 03:41.170
and then go back to what you want to do as quickly.

03:41.190 --> 03:42.290
Comment something.

03:42.360 --> 03:47.730
Make note of that and be able to retrieve that same line of thinking later on.

03:47.730 --> 03:55.140
So now I know that even if I was to close the file up if I came back a week a month two years later

03:55.290 --> 03:59.400
I know that I still had to do to change this tune goodbye.

03:59.550 --> 04:02.260
So I've got multiple messages here to myself.

04:02.400 --> 04:08.520
And this again this is not showing up within the browser so it's not going to be visible within the

04:08.520 --> 04:09.220
browser.

04:09.390 --> 04:15.440
And now when I open this up two years later I know that I can change it to goodbye

04:18.870 --> 04:20.880
and I can refresh the code.

04:20.880 --> 04:23.020
And now it's been changed to good bye.

04:23.160 --> 04:28.550
And at that point if I've already completed the changes the way that I usually do this is that if I've

04:28.560 --> 04:33.870
made a note and if I want to make a change after I've made the note I can get rid of that so I can get

04:33.870 --> 04:38.180
rid of those comments and continue on with my code.

04:38.280 --> 04:39.630
So that's usually how I do it.

04:39.630 --> 04:46.250
And you can use these comments in a number of different ways to benefit within your programming.

04:46.440 --> 04:53.910
So what I want you to do now is to open up your javascript file and create some comments.

04:53.910 --> 05:02.310
So all you have to do is either slash it or slash Asterix or strict slash and add in some information

05:02.790 --> 05:09.570
maybe write down your thoughts of what you want to do within the application so let you know that next

05:09.570 --> 05:13.350
time you open up that file you know what you want to do within that code.

05:14.130 --> 05:19.320
So the next lesson we're going to be working through what we've learned in the previous lessons what

05:19.440 --> 05:25.230
a javascript exercise where we're going to create an HTML page and we can add some javascript to that

05:25.230 --> 05:25.840
page.

05:25.860 --> 05:27.880
So that's coming up in the next lesson.
