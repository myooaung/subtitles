When to L5 came along javascript got a real boost to how it can present content to web users.

00:07.970 --> 00:14.870
We got the canvas and canvas really makes users happy because you can create some really nice visual

00:14.870 --> 00:15.500
effects.

00:15.590 --> 00:19.180
And this is all done and rendered through Javascript.

00:19.340 --> 00:26.930
So javascript is the one that gives us all of these amazing capabilities so of h tim L5 We also got

00:26.930 --> 00:30.190
the coordinates so we could get latitude and longitude.

00:30.200 --> 00:36.680
So I'm going to show you how you can bring this into a Google map and map it out visually where the

00:36.680 --> 00:38.630
latitude and longitude is.

00:38.720 --> 00:46.250
Also looking at local storage how we can save information and data within the local storage of the browser.

00:46.290 --> 00:54.410
JS on parsing out that data so that we can save it as a one string value into the local storage in this

00:54.500 --> 00:57.970
exercise we're also building out a shopping cart.

00:58.040 --> 01:04.310
So the shopping cart is going to get content as a javascript object and you're going to be able to create

01:04.370 --> 01:08.480
a shopping cart all just by using javascript.

01:08.750 --> 01:16.010
And we're also going to look at the aged him of five canvas and how we can draw on the canvas how we

01:16.010 --> 01:20.410
can add words on that canvas how we can bring images into the canvas.

01:20.480 --> 01:26.800
And then last but not least how we can output that content as a saved image.

01:26.990 --> 01:30.160
So we're going to draw on the canvas what the most.

01:30.380 --> 01:33.140
And so be able to save that image.

01:33.140 --> 01:40.310
Also be able to clear that image also show you how you can draw and create animations using canvas.

01:40.460 --> 01:45.950
So this is going to be an exciting section because each team of five has a lot to offer and when it

01:45.950 --> 01:50.240
comes to canvas there's a lot that can be done with Javascript.

01:50.240 --> 01:55.280
So this girl is creating some amazing things with javascript and Tim L5 canvas.
