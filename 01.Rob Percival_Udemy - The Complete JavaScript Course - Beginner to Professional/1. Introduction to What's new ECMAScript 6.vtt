00:01.400 --> 00:06.710
In this section we're going to be looking at what's new with ECMAScript 6.

00:06.800 --> 00:11.260
So this is one of the versions of javascript that got recently updated.

00:11.330 --> 00:13.310
And it was a major update.

00:13.340 --> 00:21.290
There is a lot of new advanced functionality short forms for writing code and just better ways and better

00:21.290 --> 00:25.820
ways to structure your content in your code using javascript.

00:25.820 --> 00:32.420
So it's a major advance but unfortunately not all of the browsers have caught up yet with this update.

00:32.570 --> 00:40.700
So this is why we've left it at the end here because this is something that's maybe not possible on

00:40.730 --> 00:47.130
every single browser and I'm going to show you how to check compatibility for us as 6.

00:47.210 --> 00:51.110
So S6 gives you some really cool functionality.

00:51.110 --> 00:55.190
We get to go beyond just VAR for setting variables.

00:55.190 --> 01:02.150
We get introduced to let and Konst that work on a block level so that block level variables give us

01:02.210 --> 01:06.170
more flexibility and control over setting variables.

01:06.170 --> 01:09.840
We're also going to show you how you can convert ESX.

01:09.950 --> 01:16.490
So if you watch right E6 code now you can convert it to earlier versions of javascript so that you have

01:16.490 --> 01:20.390
more compatibility within older browsers.

01:20.420 --> 01:27.580
We're also going to look at better ways to loop through data handling data objects arrays and then back

01:27.580 --> 01:29.000
ticks back ticks.

01:29.000 --> 01:36.740
Give us the ability to write multiple lines within strings fat arrows and how they streamline functions

01:37.160 --> 01:44.090
and how we can deconstruct and get data from arrays and objects even more options of what we can do

01:44.150 --> 01:45.260
with our data.

01:45.260 --> 01:52.640
So you've got a lot more data control with ESX and this is what it's all about being able to break your

01:52.640 --> 01:56.170
code more efficiently using javascript.

01:56.180 --> 02:02.660
So also how we can find items in the array constructing classes and Javascript now.

02:02.780 --> 02:09.620
So we've got a constructor method how we can handle promises and we're going to be building out an AJAX

02:09.620 --> 02:12.150
call using promises.

02:12.200 --> 02:18.350
There's a lot of really neat things within this section and the one thing to keep in mind is that some

02:18.350 --> 02:25.070
of this stuff it's better to have a fairly good understanding of javascript before you try to tackle

02:25.070 --> 02:31.850
it because it's going to be more complex and more advanced formats for Javascript.

02:31.910 --> 02:38.060
So get comfortable with using javascript and then take a look through ESX and see all of the really

02:38.060 --> 02:43.850
cool things that have been introduced in javascript to make javascript coding better.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.220
So let's check this out.
