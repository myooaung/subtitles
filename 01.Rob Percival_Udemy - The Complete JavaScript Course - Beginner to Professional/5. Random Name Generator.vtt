00:00.920 --> 00:07.440
One of the great things about functions is that we can call to them when we need them and we can really

00:07.440 --> 00:15.960
make use of them within our user interaction so we can actually have a user be the trigger to invoke

00:16.020 --> 00:16.980
a function.

00:16.980 --> 00:23.160
So what I'm doing is setting up a typical age to Mel button and they are going to give it a value and

00:23.160 --> 00:28.190
this value is going to just say click me.

00:28.440 --> 00:30.720
So we go back we refresh the page.

00:30.720 --> 00:31.240
There we go.

00:31.260 --> 00:32.500
We've got a button.

00:32.700 --> 00:38.820
So what I want to do is I actually want to attach this button and I want something to happen when the

00:38.820 --> 00:46.800
button gets clicked and we've got just built in javascript attributes that actually let us fire off

00:47.870 --> 00:56.240
events and these events can be ones like on click and then you go into more detail about these later

00:56.240 --> 00:57.260
on in the course.

00:57.380 --> 01:04.100
But for now it's important to understand that we can set up a clickable auction on the bottom which

01:04.410 --> 01:07.540
is going to invoke a function from our Javascript.

01:07.880 --> 01:16.590
So let's call this one my fun and whenever this gets clicked we're going to actually invoke that function.

01:16.660 --> 01:18.350
It's now it's set up a function.

01:18.410 --> 01:20.610
And this is my fun.

01:21.380 --> 01:28.550
And then within this function what I want to do is set up a variable and I'm going out of question and

01:28.550 --> 01:38.470
within the question I'm going to equal that to a prompt and say What is your

01:43.110 --> 01:43.900
and that's it.

01:43.950 --> 01:51.660
So let's refresh it we click it we get the function and we're able to then make use of that information

01:51.750 --> 01:53.160
within the code.

01:53.400 --> 02:01.920
So what I want you to do now is add in this button use on click attribute within your age to smell and

02:01.920 --> 02:08.370
create a function with the same name that you're invoking here so that whenever the button gets clicked

02:08.580 --> 02:11.150
that you can run the code here within the function.

02:11.520 --> 02:19.480
And as a next step I actually want you to ask the user what their name is and then update that output.

02:19.650 --> 02:27.650
So the element with the ID out output and up to start with the response within the question.

02:27.660 --> 02:31.660
So go ahead try that and I'll show you the solution coming up.

02:33.450 --> 02:39.780
So we get to set up the input with a button on click my fun we could click it and it would invoke a

02:39.780 --> 02:47.310
function and then within the function we are grabbing the return value of the product into a variable

02:47.310 --> 02:48.140
question.

02:48.270 --> 02:53.560
So the last part of this was to update the interface to a model of output.

02:53.760 --> 03:03.420
So let's let's use the object in an HMO and from here once update and add in our response from the question.

03:03.420 --> 03:10.080
So now whenever it gets clicked and asks What is my name so I can type in the name and it simply gets

03:10.170 --> 03:15.480
out there and we can continue to add in multiple values.

03:15.480 --> 03:24.840
Let's update our age to now so that routing in a bunch of responses to the question so whatever we're

03:24.930 --> 03:29.590
adding here is going to continuously get added into the page to mail.

03:29.730 --> 03:36.900
And this is one of the great uses of functions is because we can set this code up to run at any time

03:37.170 --> 03:45.240
and invoke and actually do something with the input that's being entered into our into into our screen

03:45.240 --> 03:45.720
here.

03:46.950 --> 03:50.220
So that's an exercise for this lesson.

03:50.220 --> 03:57.740
I want to create an array and to use what we've done earlier in this my find function where we take

03:57.770 --> 04:01.100
him the user's name and we're going to add.

04:01.620 --> 04:04.870
So an array of adjectives.

04:05.040 --> 04:09.920
So this was just going to be a typical array and I'm going to put in some words here.

04:09.960 --> 04:14.670
And then what I want to do is I ask the user their name.

04:14.790 --> 04:23.030
Pick a random value from our array and then return that into our inner h t m l.

04:23.040 --> 04:28.410
So we've got super we've got wonderful We've got bad

04:31.540 --> 04:33.150
we've got angry

04:35.420 --> 04:38.890
and careful.

04:39.230 --> 04:39.870
Thank you.

04:39.920 --> 04:41.580
So words to work with.

04:41.780 --> 04:51.350
And so now what I want you to do plus the video and within the function select one of each is random

04:51.460 --> 04:58.280
as random and attach it to the user's name so that just before the users names one of these descriptors

04:58.490 --> 04:59.990
before the user's name.

04:59.990 --> 05:08.300
So every time they click this button they can randomly generate a combined word from the array with

05:08.480 --> 05:11.700
their value that they're entering in here so that should be their name.

05:11.930 --> 05:18.020
So go ahead and take what we've learned in the previous lessons with not random and the math floor where

05:18.020 --> 05:25.480
we can get a random value from the array and then return not within the inner H-2 amount of output element.

05:25.760 --> 05:28.530
So try that out and I'll show you the solution coming up.

05:30.560 --> 05:35.000
So let's let's set up our random value from the array.

05:35.090 --> 05:42.950
So we know that we can select math floor that's actually we to have a variable so this will be

05:46.510 --> 05:52.730
name tells us we're going into math floor.

05:53.620 --> 06:02.540
And then if your mouth random and we multiply it by the length of the array.

06:02.540 --> 06:10.950
So length so HGJ length and that will give us the length of the array.

06:13.490 --> 06:18.040
So now all we need to do is use this one here.

06:18.200 --> 06:27.120
So the incentive and then have that random selected array you we've out in this space as well.

06:27.200 --> 06:30.490
And then the response to the questions on this one.

06:30.500 --> 06:36.440
And here this is our random value which will return back a random item from the array.

06:36.440 --> 06:40.220
So now let's try this so bad.

06:40.220 --> 06:51.370
Lawrence angry Larry and we have in a number of different names and we get all of these random values

06:51.380 --> 06:53.570
being returned back so wonderful John.

06:53.930 --> 07:02.090
So by doing this we can invoke that function and make use of it at any time with our code and we can

07:02.090 --> 07:08.030
also make use of some of the variables the global variables the array variables that we've been using

07:08.030 --> 07:11.780
here with in our script outside of the function.

07:11.840 --> 07:17.350
So the next lesson we going to see even more examples of what you can do with functions and creating

07:17.360 --> 07:23.740
this type of interaction where the function actually gets invoked by the user from your age to melt.

07:23.750 --> 07:25.530
So that's coming up in the next lesson.
