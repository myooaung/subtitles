00:00.700 --> 00:05.060
Welcome back in in this lesson we're going to be looking at the tear and unary operator.

00:05.200 --> 00:09.160
So basically we saw that it allows us to apply a condition

00:11.810 --> 00:18.320
evaluate the condition and depending on what that condition is we can see that it evaluates to TRUE

00:18.320 --> 00:19.020
or FALSE.

00:19.130 --> 00:21.700
And we're able to assign a value to it.

00:21.800 --> 00:22.980
So let's not

00:25.710 --> 00:30.920
output our content into the ID here the element with the ID output.

00:30.920 --> 00:39.330
So you set up a variable first calling it output and we'll do document and we'll grab that element to

00:39.380 --> 00:46.490
document element by id and then we just need to identify the element that we want to grab and we can

00:46.550 --> 00:53.050
identify it with the ID output Next let's up another variable.

00:53.120 --> 00:55.710
And what do we call it log in.

00:55.820 --> 00:58.830
So for now let's logon to false.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.440
And this is the one that we're going to switch to either true or false.

01:02.490 --> 01:09.790
And I'll show you how we can create that input and update the content here within our output element.

01:09.800 --> 01:16.640
So next let's do outputs and this one we're just going to hold a value so basically it's going to be

01:16.880 --> 01:19.230
our ace T.M. value for output.

01:19.370 --> 01:21.770
And for now let's just leave this blank.

01:22.340 --> 01:27.410
So this is where we're going to use our territory operator and we're going to set another variable with

01:27.410 --> 01:38.050
the territory operator and we're going to check to see if the user is OK and we're evaluating the value

01:38.110 --> 01:39.320
of log in.

01:39.520 --> 01:45.800
So with that conditional ternary operator there is one condition and then two expressions.

01:45.940 --> 01:52.570
So these are all you need to include all three of these in order to make it work properly.

01:52.570 --> 01:59.320
So let's take log in and we can do if log in equals true.

01:59.620 --> 02:06.040
And we know that we saw earlier when we were evaluating conditions that we can really simplify this

02:06.100 --> 02:09.710
and we can simply check to see if log in is true.

02:09.880 --> 02:13.930
So this is going to be the same thing we could remove out the two equal signs.

02:13.930 --> 02:14.600
True.

02:14.860 --> 02:19.800
Maybe we'll leave it there for now and then I'll show you that exact same thing and we'll remove it.

02:19.880 --> 02:20.370
OK.

02:20.710 --> 02:26.530
So next we include the question mark and the question mark and the condition.

02:26.620 --> 02:32.740
So javascript reading this will know that this is the condition and we've got a question mark.

02:32.830 --> 02:39.240
So basically the first expression is going to be true and I can update.

02:39.460 --> 02:44.410
I would put the value for output holder and.

02:44.840 --> 02:45.920
Okay.

02:45.970 --> 02:50.870
Or we could just say true for now and then we can update those values later on.

02:51.040 --> 03:01.500
So just put true and otherwise we're going to create a value for output holder and let's set it to false.

03:02.170 --> 03:02.950
And these can.

03:02.980 --> 03:06.400
They don't have to be true or false because these are strong values.

03:06.460 --> 03:11.610
We've got the quotes around them so they are different from the bully value we've got log in coming

03:13.110 --> 03:13.680
next.

03:13.720 --> 03:17.630
And lastly let's update our inner H-2 now.

03:17.680 --> 03:25.210
So two outputs and in our HMO and we're going to update this to whatever value is contained within the

03:25.210 --> 03:26.640
variable of user.

03:26.650 --> 03:27.330
Okay.

03:27.490 --> 03:29.730
So let's go ahead refresh and try it.

03:29.920 --> 03:31.660
And we see that we get false.

03:31.840 --> 03:37.070
And if I update this we can see that it's should be true and it is true.

03:37.450 --> 03:46.420
So basically this is how the conditional operators work is they give us the ability to actually evaluate

03:46.420 --> 03:47.270
something.

03:47.350 --> 03:56.380
And basically if a choice needs to be made then we can make that choice and spit back and output our

03:56.380 --> 04:00.800
response back to that choice by beaking not condition.

04:00.820 --> 04:06.370
So the other thing with territory operators we don't actually need to set it as a variable.

04:06.370 --> 04:11.860
Now I know earlier we've been setting them all as variables but we don't even need to do that.

04:11.890 --> 04:16.600
We can take some type of action we can have an alert or something else pop up.

04:16.600 --> 04:20.640
So there's a number of different options for us in this case as well.

04:20.860 --> 04:25.670
So let's try one of those as an example where we're not going to use that user.

04:25.690 --> 04:26.440
Okay.

04:26.530 --> 04:35.950
And we're just going to simply evaluate it and do the response spot for it directly within this within

04:36.040 --> 04:37.720
the expression.

04:38.020 --> 04:39.770
And that's this part over here.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.210
So let's let's do that condition.

04:42.250 --> 04:49.060
So do log in ANS remember again we don't need to have this the two equal signs.

04:49.060 --> 04:49.620
True.

04:49.720 --> 04:55.990
So this will check this anyway so we can really simplify the code by removing those out.

04:56.260 --> 04:59.750
So let's take a look and we'll see if loggin.

04:59.980 --> 05:02.330
And then do the question mark.

05:02.830 --> 05:08.830
And basically here is where we can update and change our content for output.

05:08.830 --> 05:18.390
So we did say that we want to launch an alert and I'll just say okay this time and we separate it with

05:18.390 --> 05:23.820
the coal and and otherwise we're going to go alert and we'll do it tonight.

05:25.980 --> 05:31.490
So let's see how this works so we're refreshed and we see that it's OK and we can click it.

05:31.560 --> 05:39.960
And then over here let's update this to the false and we see it's denied.

05:39.960 --> 05:48.870
So what I want you to do now is pause the video and create an array of bunch of usernames so create

05:48.960 --> 05:50.440
an array of usernames

05:53.310 --> 06:04.140
create a prompt asking for a user name and then check to see if the user name is within the array.

06:04.200 --> 06:10.390
And if it is then we put ok within the output area.

06:10.500 --> 06:14.240
And if it's not then we say that it's denied.

06:14.430 --> 06:18.840
And this has to go into this element the output element.

06:18.960 --> 06:20.570
And I'll give you a hint.

06:20.580 --> 06:30.090
Use index of when you're doing your ternary operator and check to see if there is a value within that

06:30.420 --> 06:31.060
array.

06:31.170 --> 06:40.210
So that way you can see that if this value is sitting within that array username and this one has a

06:40.210 --> 06:41.020
prompt.

06:41.140 --> 06:42.060
So go ahead.

06:42.190 --> 06:50.670
Pause the video and I'm going to show you the solution coming up so we had an opportunity to try that.

06:50.920 --> 06:54.820
So we had a number of steps that we wanted to take with in this exercise.

06:54.910 --> 06:57.550
And the first one is to create an array.

06:57.700 --> 07:04.420
So just create an array and call it user names and then within here we need to populate some values.

07:04.480 --> 07:12.790
So we'll do my and we'll do Sean and we get out in as many user names as we want.

07:12.850 --> 07:15.010
So I'm going to keep that out to for now.

07:15.130 --> 07:18.250
But we know or maybe I'll add one more.

07:18.450 --> 07:20.080
I'll do something like Larry.

07:20.350 --> 07:22.810
So you've got three user usernames in there.

07:23.020 --> 07:32.530
So now what we want to do is make a check and evaluate if those users are those usernames are valid

07:32.560 --> 07:34.780
usernames within the array.

07:34.780 --> 07:36.650
So I'm going to use.

07:36.790 --> 07:46.140
I'm going to refresh this page am I going to open up the console and just to make sure that we do have

07:46.210 --> 07:47.440
user names here.

07:47.730 --> 07:49.420
So we do have them in here.

07:49.590 --> 07:55.440
And remember earlier when we were using index of.

07:55.680 --> 08:01.890
And we can we need to specify the array so we can say index of.

08:01.890 --> 08:06.580
And we can check to see if the value is in there.

08:08.560 --> 08:11.380
So let's say I did a value to Mike

08:14.920 --> 08:17.510
and I actually should be user names.

08:19.530 --> 08:25.800
So if the value is in there then it's going to return by the value of where Mike is located.

08:25.800 --> 08:32.220
So the index value of where Mike is located so we can do the same thing for other usernames.

08:32.490 --> 08:37.350
So just go to make sure that we are grabbing the right case and we see that

08:40.330 --> 08:45.360
upper case Larry is not there but lower case Larry will be there.

08:45.550 --> 08:52.150
So always be careful about those cases and we can see that when we try to find one that actually wasn't

08:52.210 --> 08:55.070
in the army then it returned the negative one.

08:55.240 --> 09:01.450
So this is what we can use within our operator.

09:01.460 --> 09:06.540
So let's let's do that check check user.

09:07.030 --> 09:11.380
And here is where we're going to apply our usernames.

09:11.390 --> 09:18.230
So just as we did here within the console index of.

09:18.840 --> 09:21.480
And then now let's put that user name.

09:21.520 --> 09:23.600
So try out Mike for now.

09:23.740 --> 09:27.190
It's always a good way to try things first.

09:27.250 --> 09:29.570
And if this comes back.

09:29.740 --> 09:39.280
So we actually apply conditions so we need to check to see if it's greater than negative 1.

09:39.330 --> 09:47.780
So that means that the user is there and we can return back a value of true.

09:48.380 --> 09:52.200
Otherwise let's do false.

09:52.210 --> 09:59.260
So basically we've got our condition here and we can see that if Mike is in there that user check come

09:59.810 --> 10:03.820
and valuated to true otherwise it's going to evaluate to false.

10:03.820 --> 10:04.920
So let's try that.

10:04.990 --> 10:10.220
And I'm actually going to come into these alerts go back and refresh it.

10:10.300 --> 10:14.240
And now let's let's see what check user evaluates to.

10:14.350 --> 10:15.860
And we see that it is true.

10:16.120 --> 10:20.980
So now we can use that and we can update our output.

10:21.190 --> 10:31.420
So let's let's keep this one in here so that puts a value can to keep it within the code so that we

10:31.420 --> 10:33.150
can grab back the output.

10:33.160 --> 10:40.090
We don't need some of the other statements here and last part of the exercise was to output it with

10:40.300 --> 10:41.910
the output HMO.

10:42.020 --> 10:44.060
So I'm going to just do it like this.

10:44.140 --> 10:50.950
And then here is where I'm going to use my 10 unary operator and I get a check to see if this one is

10:50.980 --> 10:51.720
true.

10:51.970 --> 10:57.340
And of course I could have done I could've saved myself maybe some trouble by just bringing this one

10:57.400 --> 11:04.660
into the username so let's do it this way first so that we get even more practice with the Turner operators

11:04.900 --> 11:07.840
and then we're going to remove that and simplify the code.

11:09.540 --> 11:13.150
And I still need to add one more value there.

11:13.210 --> 11:17.740
So before I actually check to see I need to find out who it is.

11:18.040 --> 11:31.690
So user input and this is where I'm going to use the prompt and I ask what is your name.

11:34.660 --> 11:43.950
And update this to check for the user input in here and then also over here so I can do something like

11:43.960 --> 11:44.650
welcome

11:47.950 --> 11:50.910
and otherwise we'll do tonight.

11:51.890 --> 11:56.690
So this value will be denied or welcome and then

12:00.450 --> 12:07.320
let's go to the HMO the username.

12:07.480 --> 12:14.420
So we're going to add to it's a comma separate that concatenated together with the input and the rest

12:14.420 --> 12:17.400
of the stuff here we can actually get rid of.

12:18.290 --> 12:20.820
So now let's let's try our code.

12:20.930 --> 12:23.510
So refresh the page what is your name.

12:23.540 --> 12:27.700
So in the tape and Mike for now and then we get Welcome Mike.

12:27.770 --> 12:35.180
If I type in a name that nobody will hit and we see tonight.

12:35.490 --> 12:41.130
So as I said we can actually simplify this that we can get rid of one of these terrorist statements

12:41.130 --> 12:45.660
where we could go directly and have the message here.

12:45.690 --> 12:47.340
So let me show you how to do that.

12:47.490 --> 12:49.670
And let's simplify the code.

12:50.070 --> 12:52.410
So do you know how we could simplify the code.

12:52.500 --> 12:59.070
So basically we can just do walk home or tonight and we can get rid of the line altogether because we're

12:59.070 --> 13:02.360
not going to be using that variable so we have no need to set it.

13:02.550 --> 13:08.310
And let's refresh and we'll try that just to make sure everything is working refreshed again.

13:08.310 --> 13:17.140
So that was my misspelling of Mike and this time Baulkham Mike Zun the next lesson I assure you.

13:17.960 --> 13:22.750
The tarrier operator and we're going to get introduced to the if conditional statement.
