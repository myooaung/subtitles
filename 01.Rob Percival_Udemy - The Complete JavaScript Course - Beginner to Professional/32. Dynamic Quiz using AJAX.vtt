00:01.250 --> 00:02.960
We'll come back in in this lesson.

00:02.960 --> 00:09.080
We're going to be using a pre-built Jaison quiz format file and we're going to be building out a quiz

00:09.110 --> 00:10.190
dynamically.

00:10.490 --> 00:16.080
So this quiz is available at my house on dot com forward slash bin's 12.

00:16.070 --> 00:23.450
Q S. AF and basically So it's got some questions it's got the answers to the questions and it tells

00:23.450 --> 00:25.430
us which answer is correct.

00:25.580 --> 00:26.680
So correct one.

00:26.690 --> 00:32.710
And that's the format so the question answers and possible answers and then whichever one is correct

00:33.020 --> 00:34.260
and so on and so on.

00:34.260 --> 00:36.080
Let's go to a series of questions.

00:36.110 --> 00:44.420
So the challenge is going to be to generate this randomly from a file pull it into our javascript within

00:44.420 --> 00:48.250
this format and then have it actually function as a quiz.

00:48.410 --> 00:52.200
And then we're going to actually calculate the results the correct answers.

00:52.220 --> 00:57.330
And we're going to produce a summary of how the user performed on the quiz.

00:57.380 --> 00:58.660
At the end of the quiz.

00:59.150 --> 01:01.750
So let's go ahead and build this out.

01:01.970 --> 01:10.220
So open up your editor and we're going to use that and get Jason format that we saw earlier and this

01:10.300 --> 01:15.410
is the format that we can use in order to pull back that quiz information.

01:15.440 --> 01:23.600
So let's I've already got it set up so I've got a window onload I indictees So whenever our window loads

01:23.660 --> 01:27.420
we run this function where we've got the Einheit.

01:27.710 --> 01:34.130
So what we want to do is we want to get Jason information right off the bat and we want to build our

01:34.130 --> 01:35.850
quiz from it.

01:36.230 --> 01:40.070
So we have an option here to pass in the U r l.

01:40.160 --> 01:46.050
So let's do that and we're going to do that same format where we're going to do get Giese on so we're

01:46.050 --> 01:48.860
going to make use of this file once again.

01:48.860 --> 01:54.650
And this is a great file to have within your library because you could always just simply utilize it

01:54.650 --> 01:55.830
whenever you need to.

01:57.140 --> 01:59.400
So let's set that up.

01:59.690 --> 02:01.610
And then with within

02:07.100 --> 02:10.530
here first thing we need to pass is that parameter.

02:10.550 --> 02:16.460
So then we go and grab that you Earl and place that into the get Jason.

02:16.730 --> 02:22.130
So first thing we're doing is loading via the L and then the next thing that we do is we need to set

02:22.130 --> 02:24.550
up the load function.

02:24.550 --> 02:33.510
So let's create that function and this function we're going to take back that response.

02:33.750 --> 02:40.050
So whatever that response data is and then within the function itself let's make use of that response

02:40.050 --> 02:40.830
data.

02:40.830 --> 02:46.670
So for now let's just console log out whatever we're getting as a response.

02:49.900 --> 02:55.250
And that's always the first thing just to make sure that you're able to properly pull that information

02:55.310 --> 02:57.340
into your javascript.

02:57.410 --> 02:59.600
So now save it refresh it.

02:59.750 --> 03:00.680
And there we go.

03:00.680 --> 03:03.430
So nice and a readable format.

03:03.440 --> 03:06.920
Thanks to our consul and javascript objects.

03:06.920 --> 03:16.160
So it's all ready to go now and next thing that we need to do is we can make use of it within our javascript

03:16.160 --> 03:18.080
and we need to build this quiz.

03:18.260 --> 03:19.880
So this is going to take.

03:20.120 --> 03:27.930
This is going to take looping through all of these and basically loading it into the javascript so that

03:27.930 --> 03:29.470
we can run the quiz.

03:29.550 --> 03:35.340
So we load the data into our javascript application and then we make use of that data as the user goes

03:35.340 --> 03:35.990
through there.

03:36.120 --> 03:38.940
So at the end of the day it's not going to really matter.

03:38.940 --> 03:44.580
This all has to be dynamic enough that it doesn't matter how many questions there are here how many

03:44.580 --> 03:47.250
answers as long as we know which ones are correct.

03:47.280 --> 03:52.320
As long as we know the question and as long as we know the total length and once we've finished moving

03:52.320 --> 03:57.100
through those then we know that the quiz is over and we have to provide the summary.

03:57.240 --> 04:01.340
So we need to track all of that information in the black in the back as well.

04:03.700 --> 04:09.130
So first of all let's load this into a global object because we want to make use of it at any point

04:09.130 --> 04:10.250
within our script.

04:10.420 --> 04:11.990
So let's set up a variable.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.470
And we're going to call it my data.

04:14.860 --> 04:17.850
And so this is just going to be an empty object.

04:18.070 --> 04:24.430
And then once we get that information let's get my data and we're going to equal it to whatever the

04:24.430 --> 04:25.450
responses.

04:25.600 --> 04:32.290
So that way whenever the page loads that whenever we want to access that information we can just use

04:32.380 --> 04:33.130
my data.

04:33.310 --> 04:40.960
So even after the Jasons done we're all ready to go and we're all ready to access it within Javascript.

04:40.960 --> 04:43.440
So first of that we need to do is we need a starting point.

04:43.450 --> 04:46.450
So let's add in a function here.

04:46.450 --> 04:51.760
So this function is going to build out the page build up to quizz page.

04:51.880 --> 04:57.730
So let's call it build page.

04:58.130 --> 05:04.850
And we're also going to use some other global variables as to what page we're on and how many are left

05:04.850 --> 05:05.620
and so on.

05:05.720 --> 05:09.650
So let's set those up so page by default will be 0.

05:09.800 --> 05:14.750
And then as we move through to the next question we're going to know what content we need to output.

05:14.900 --> 05:19.520
So Page is going to dynamically change as we loop through the values.

05:19.520 --> 05:23.560
So what we need to do is we need to first present a question.

05:23.750 --> 05:25.380
So let's do build page.

05:25.400 --> 05:30.630
So after we load Jaison we've got the response in the data we build the page.

05:30.740 --> 05:37.340
And this is all dependent on whenever we get the response information back and we can't do building

05:37.340 --> 05:39.410
the page before we have the data.

05:39.440 --> 05:45.560
And that's why order is really important when working with Ajax and Jaison because sometimes you do

05:45.560 --> 05:49.640
need to wait in order for that data to load.

05:49.670 --> 05:52.010
And in order to make use of it in your page.

05:52.010 --> 05:59.270
So always make sure that you're looking at the order of the content and as it's loading into your page.

05:59.270 --> 06:04.720
So build page so we know that we need to access that information.

06:04.730 --> 06:08.630
So let's set up a variable and we'll call it we'll just call it piece.

06:08.630 --> 06:14.180
So this is going to be all of the contents that we need within this page.

06:14.210 --> 06:24.340
So this is my data and we know that we're going to page it let's just console log that for now just

06:24.340 --> 06:25.570
to make sure that.

06:25.570 --> 06:31.510
So this is where I really do use console log a lot because I want to make sure that I've got everything

06:31.540 --> 06:32.330
correct.

06:32.560 --> 06:38.470
So we know that we've got our page there and we're building the page.

06:38.590 --> 06:41.430
So let's let's update output here.

06:41.470 --> 06:44.350
So I'm going to create another variable.

06:44.350 --> 06:51.670
Call it output and we'll do a document get element by id and output one.

06:51.710 --> 06:54.900
So I'm going to grab that output one content.

06:58.500 --> 07:08.900
As object output and let's build out our page so each to M-L And so that blank blanket first and say

07:08.900 --> 07:13.440
let's build out our h team L So h him out equals h to male plus.

07:13.460 --> 07:15.910
So first of all we know we need that question.

07:15.950 --> 07:20.300
So let's set up a div and the first div is going to be the question

07:23.270 --> 07:30.440
asking him to do it with single quotes so as to div and let's add in the question.

07:30.440 --> 07:40.450
So basically we know that if we do the question we'll output the question value there.

07:40.730 --> 07:45.950
So it's close that off a quarter around there's one.

07:46.140 --> 07:46.680
So there we go.

07:46.670 --> 07:49.920
So we've got our first question showing up.

07:50.100 --> 07:52.480
Let's just make sure that that's working properly.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.450
And we need to output it still.

07:57.530 --> 08:04.100
So lastly let's do output inner h t m l and we are going to use h t m l and we're going to put that

08:04.100 --> 08:06.260
h tim l object that we're building.

08:06.290 --> 08:06.800
So there we go.

08:06.800 --> 08:11.060
So we've got our questions so what color is an apple.

08:11.060 --> 08:14.030
So after this question let's add a question mark there.

08:16.190 --> 08:19.980
So the next thing that we know we cut a loop through the possible answers.

08:19.980 --> 08:24.820
We've got three possible answers and this also has to be or should be dynamic.

08:24.950 --> 08:29.150
So as we're building up this h to M L we need to loop through these.

08:29.150 --> 08:36.590
So what I want you to do now pause the video and add in three postes or add in a loop to output the

08:36.590 --> 08:42.000
possible answers to the question and then afterwards.

08:42.020 --> 08:46.210
I also want you to add event listeners to those and I'll show you how to do that.

08:46.220 --> 08:52.280
So one of the best ways that we might want to do is we just might want to a click event to output one

08:52.550 --> 08:55.470
and then grab that object as we did earlier.

08:55.520 --> 08:57.260
So good puzzle video.

08:57.260 --> 08:59.800
Try that out and I'll show you the solution coming up.

09:02.480 --> 09:09.430
So let's go ahead and create a for loop so set we'll use X as a variable and we're going to loop while

09:09.490 --> 09:14.190
x is less than p and that value was answers.

09:14.210 --> 09:21.930
So P answers so I know that we've got an array and answers and that means that we also have a link there.

09:21.990 --> 09:30.850
So let's do that loop increment X and now let's update each team Mel so we can do the same thing that

09:30.850 --> 09:31.930
we have here.

09:32.020 --> 09:37.150
We've done a number of choices here because the thing that we need to make sure is that the user gets

09:37.210 --> 09:38.350
the correct one.

09:38.470 --> 09:44.890
So we could do it within a block here and as long as we can identify which question it is that they're

09:44.890 --> 09:47.950
selecting that we can also identify the answer.

09:47.950 --> 09:50.370
There's a number of ways to do this.

09:50.440 --> 09:57.430
We can also as we loop through here we can add in ID of correct or incorrect.

09:57.460 --> 09:59.470
So that is probably the easiest way to do that.

09:59.470 --> 10:00.400
So let's do that.

10:00.400 --> 10:06.940
So two data ID and we're going to either do that it's true or false.

10:06.970 --> 10:13.730
So that basically means we need to turn the operator for answer.

10:13.920 --> 10:23.990
And let's check to see if the value of x is equal to the value of correct.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.450
So we need to make sure that p.

10:27.810 --> 10:29.000
Correct.

10:29.400 --> 10:37.240
So if these are true then we know that we're going to have a value of true.

10:38.010 --> 10:40.110
Otherwise it's going to be false.

10:42.040 --> 10:48.240
So no we've got our answer there and we can add that into the data ID or data answer or whatever we

10:48.240 --> 10:52.160
want to call it.

10:52.310 --> 10:53.120
And there we go.

10:53.120 --> 10:57.570
So let's let's quoter around there so I need that double quotes around there.

10:58.040 --> 11:03.200
So let's double one single single double quotes.

11:03.230 --> 11:06.440
So next we need to have the answer value.

11:06.440 --> 11:14.400
So we've got P and answers and the value that we're getting is X..

11:14.420 --> 11:19.970
So whatever the value of x is we want to just put it simply there and always use.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.680
I always use this as a guide what's available in the console

11:29.040 --> 11:32.680
and so also we did want to add in an event listener.

11:32.970 --> 11:39.690
So let's go ahead and update that and add in a listener and we said we could add that in for output

11:39.900 --> 11:42.370
because we already have output set up there.

11:42.420 --> 11:47.730
So let's add to that listener for output and the listeners going to be click.

11:48.120 --> 11:55.740
And if it gets clicked then we can do the function within here or we could just call it over to a function.

11:56.010 --> 11:58.240
So it's actually just do the function in here.

11:58.410 --> 12:05.700
So if it gets clicked then we're going to fire off our function and console log.

12:05.830 --> 12:07.200
We'll get them to target

12:10.160 --> 12:11.050
so I get that data.

12:11.050 --> 12:18.610
So let's see what happens so let's refresh it and whenever we click these we get false true and false.

12:18.860 --> 12:22.380
So what color is an apple and red.

12:22.430 --> 12:23.660
So red is true.

12:23.660 --> 12:26.000
So we know that this value is true.

12:26.180 --> 12:28.670
And this is the one that we want to grab.

12:28.670 --> 12:31.610
We can also set it by class if we want to.

12:31.610 --> 12:36.980
So there's a number of different ways we don't have to do data I.D. So we know that if the user selects

12:36.980 --> 12:41.220
a sensor This one is correct.

12:41.230 --> 12:49.200
So what I want you to do now is to update the code so take the source code and pick out that data ID

12:49.210 --> 12:52.240
value and check to see if it's true.

12:52.280 --> 12:57.260
We also need to have a variable for score so let's add that in.

12:57.340 --> 12:59.800
So score is going to start out at zero.

12:59.950 --> 13:06.460
And we also might want to just track what we got right and what we got wrong where the user what the

13:06.460 --> 13:07.880
user is picking up.

13:08.020 --> 13:10.330
So we might want to do that as well.

13:13.430 --> 13:15.410
So let's set up an array.

13:15.410 --> 13:19.980
So this is going to be the user answers 3.

13:20.180 --> 13:25.040
So whatever they're answering we're going to simply drop that answer into the array.

13:25.130 --> 13:30.350
And this is going to give us the ability to kind of do the scoresheet at the end and do the entire tracking

13:30.350 --> 13:30.890
of it.

13:30.890 --> 13:36.540
And this is also going to give us the ability to kind of go back and let the user make updates as needed.

13:36.800 --> 13:43.550
So for the next lesson go ahead and grab that data ID and I'm going to show you how we can do that and

13:43.550 --> 13:47.620
how we can move to the next question afterwards after this one has been answered.

13:47.780 --> 13:49.410
So all of that is coming up.
