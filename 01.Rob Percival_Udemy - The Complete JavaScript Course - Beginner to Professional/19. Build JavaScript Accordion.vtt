WEBVTT

00:00.650 --> 00:05.870
Work that and in this lesson we're going to take what we learned previously where we can add and remove

00:05.870 --> 00:08.600
classes and we're going to build an accordion.

00:08.760 --> 00:15.350
So accordion basically allows us to show content and hide content by having a title and then clicking

00:15.350 --> 00:21.170
that title and it allow us to show the additional content.

00:21.170 --> 00:22.870
So let's create some device.

00:23.090 --> 00:28.520
And the first div that we have is this is going to be that Chordia and so it's the Chordia and heading

00:28.550 --> 00:29.220
area.

00:29.390 --> 00:38.600
So this is actually what gets seen by the user and information about javascript.

00:38.690 --> 00:43.120
And then once they click that it's going to open up the content below it.

00:43.400 --> 00:51.210
So this content we're going to give it a class and let's call this class the content.

00:51.240 --> 00:55.590
So we call it CNN for Conde.

00:55.750 --> 01:01.890
And then here is where we've got some content so I'm going to add in some dummy content.

01:02.080 --> 01:04.540
And I'm also going to add in an image.

01:04.540 --> 01:09.070
So this was from that placeholder IMC that we saw earlier.

01:09.190 --> 01:10.760
So let me just add that in there.

01:10.960 --> 01:13.900
So let's go back to our page and refresh it.

01:14.200 --> 01:19.100
So what I want to do first is I want to set some parameters so for Con.

01:19.120 --> 01:25.540
So basically this is all of the content within accordion and I want this one to kind of show up when

01:25.630 --> 01:26.980
we click the title.

01:26.980 --> 01:29.250
So let's add some padding around there.

01:29.260 --> 01:38.440
So do border one pick solid black and some padding

01:41.970 --> 01:50.280
and do 20 pics of potting and we'll also change the font size so the font size of this one will be a

01:50.280 --> 01:54.870
lot smaller and we'll make the font size of the top one quite a bit bigger.

01:54.870 --> 01:57.060
So now go back and refresh it.

01:57.060 --> 01:57.690
So there we go.

01:57.690 --> 02:06.060
So the idea is that we click this up here and this pops open so let's create a few more.

02:06.060 --> 02:07.770
So create one more for now.

02:07.830 --> 02:15.900
And information about javascript and more read Javascript.

02:15.930 --> 02:22.640
And then in here we've got just some dummy content and maybe we can have another image.

02:22.640 --> 02:28.820
So this one is quite a bit smaller so let's try it out again.

02:28.830 --> 02:29.400
So there we go.

02:29.400 --> 02:37.170
So we've got basically what we need for our console where we can have it we can click the titles and

02:37.200 --> 02:39.330
we know that we can hide and show those.

02:39.600 --> 02:45.910
So next thing that we want to do is we want to maybe set something different for this.

02:45.930 --> 02:51.110
So do font size and I don't want to spend too much time on the CSA us.

02:51.480 --> 02:54.120
So just make that a little bit bigger.

02:54.630 --> 03:00.810
So that stands out and we can also add in a background color so that it stands out so that we can really

03:00.810 --> 03:07.710
differentiate and the whole idea here is that we want to differentiate from the background the background

03:07.710 --> 03:08.610
content.

03:08.610 --> 03:10.680
So let's go back and refresh it.

03:10.680 --> 03:11.280
So there we go.

03:11.280 --> 03:15.120
So the idea is that these would open and close as we click it.

03:15.390 --> 03:20.650
So what we need to do is we need to have one set is active.

03:20.940 --> 03:29.820
So the active one is going to also be the one that's open and for the active one let's do display.

03:30.060 --> 03:36.540
So we're going to use the display properties and we're going to add active and whenever one is active

03:36.800 --> 03:39.730
that we want to display block on it.

03:39.750 --> 03:46.120
So let's go over to here and hear what we're going to do now is we're going to show we're going to do

03:46.120 --> 03:46.770
a display.

03:46.800 --> 03:47.290
None.

03:47.310 --> 03:48.670
So we're going to hide those.

03:48.780 --> 03:50.760
Going back refreshed.

03:50.760 --> 03:55.330
So now we need to make these headings clickable so we have given them the same class.

03:55.350 --> 03:57.300
They're ace A.S.C..

03:57.330 --> 04:05.250
So now let's go into our variables and we know that this is our accordion title.

04:05.250 --> 04:10.140
So A.S.C. title or it could just call it a title to be short.

04:10.230 --> 04:15.690
And this is where we're going to do a document and query selector.

04:15.720 --> 04:16.380
All

04:19.020 --> 04:20.320
so do query selector.

04:20.340 --> 04:24.000
All and we're going to grab the class A.S.C..

04:24.630 --> 04:27.020
So grab that within our array.

04:28.210 --> 04:33.440
And now we can make use of those where we can add those those event handlers.

04:33.440 --> 04:37.220
So what I want you to do now is to create your own version of this.

04:37.220 --> 04:42.490
Open up your editor and add to the title object.

04:42.500 --> 04:45.710
So add those event listeners so those on CLECs.

04:45.770 --> 04:47.670
So making these clickable.

04:47.810 --> 04:50.240
And then I'll show you what to do after that.

04:50.450 --> 04:56.600
So go ahead and add that into your script and pause the video and I'll show you the solution coming

04:56.600 --> 04:57.500
up.

04:57.500 --> 05:02.140
So it will want to do is we want to grab simply grab that content.

05:02.570 --> 05:04.200
So let's do the four.

05:04.310 --> 05:07.400
So we already did this earlier within the last lesson.

05:07.460 --> 05:15.750
So starting at zero we always need a loop here so we can iterate through all of that a title values

05:15.830 --> 05:23.260
and we know we need to keep keep looping until we complete our length of that particular array.

05:23.540 --> 05:33.960
And then within here so we know that we've got a title and if we do X then we're grabbing that object.

05:34.090 --> 05:39.960
So let's attach the on click onto that and we'll do an anonymous function again.

05:39.970 --> 05:45.610
So this function whenever it gets clicked that we know we want to take some type of action.

05:48.250 --> 05:55.480
And we know that we can use this to get the current selected object and we also saw earlier how we can

05:55.480 --> 05:57.110
traverse through the dawn.

05:57.220 --> 05:59.770
So we know that this is the current object.

05:59.860 --> 06:03.370
And then the next one as long as we keep the structure the same.

06:03.370 --> 06:05.730
The next one is going to be a class called.

06:05.860 --> 06:08.090
And this one is going to be the hidden one.

06:08.110 --> 06:11.470
So what we want to do is we want to show all of these.

06:11.500 --> 06:18.090
So let's go through this and we're going to use next element sibling.

06:18.090 --> 06:20.910
So this is going to grab the next Stiv.

06:21.690 --> 06:32.740
And now let's grab a class list and within the class list we saw earlier as well that we can toggle

06:33.010 --> 06:36.260
and let's toggle active.

06:36.800 --> 06:43.310
So now we can go out to our page refresh it and you can see that now.

06:43.320 --> 06:48.390
So when I click these they do open up and when I click it again they close up.

06:48.660 --> 06:49.850
So this is pretty good.

06:49.860 --> 06:55.050
And this is kind of what we want it to do where we can click and hide and click and hide.

06:55.150 --> 06:58.590
But it's basically hiding that next element content.

06:58.860 --> 07:05.450
So the other thing that is typical within accordions is that if you click one then the other ones close.

07:05.460 --> 07:12.420
So what I want you to do is take what we learned in the previous lesson and close all of the Remove

07:12.510 --> 07:19.240
out all of the already active ones that are contained within Conne class.

07:19.470 --> 07:23.340
So go ahead and do that and I'll show you the solution coming up.

07:25.430 --> 07:27.980
So if you had an opportunity to try that out.

07:28.010 --> 07:32.340
So what we want to do is we don't want the ability to open up multiple ones.

07:32.360 --> 07:35.810
We want them to close down after one has been selected.

07:35.810 --> 07:41.840
So if I select this one then what I want to happen is I want the rest of them to disappear and to shut

07:42.060 --> 07:42.770
closed.

07:42.860 --> 07:45.750
So we only want to have one with active.

07:45.950 --> 07:52.100
And the way that we can do this is we know that we saw earlier where we can do a loop and we can loop

07:52.100 --> 07:59.120
through all those elements and we can simply remove out that class list.

07:59.130 --> 08:02.960
So let's go ahead and we're going to create a function in order to do this.

08:03.120 --> 08:05.310
So this one is going to be close.

08:07.180 --> 08:08.420
KHON.

08:09.200 --> 08:13.880
So basically what we want to do is we want to loop through all the variables.

08:13.880 --> 08:23.160
So we're going to use Querrey selector and we're going to use C for this one and don't forget to add

08:23.160 --> 08:24.040
in the dot.

08:24.090 --> 08:30.210
If you're selecting a class so dot com in order select all of those and now we're ready to loop through

08:30.210 --> 08:30.500
it.

08:30.600 --> 08:36.430
So I can copy what we've done over here where we can copy and loop through this within the function.

08:36.540 --> 08:43.850
And instead of the title length we're going to just see length.

08:43.910 --> 08:47.590
So I want to simply loop through it as we're looping through it.

08:47.600 --> 08:51.430
I want to remove it.

08:51.730 --> 08:53.180
Actually it's going to be c..

08:53.190 --> 08:56.440
So C is the object x is the index value.

08:57.540 --> 09:01.240
And then next we've got a class list.

09:01.380 --> 09:03.930
So a class list and we're going to remove

09:07.250 --> 09:10.050
and the one that we want to rule out is active.

09:10.380 --> 09:16.710
So basically this will give us the ability to remove out all of the octaves and all we have to do is

09:16.830 --> 09:24.780
run this function before we actually add or actually whenever it's been clicked we want to close off

09:24.810 --> 09:26.050
all of the other ones.

09:26.190 --> 09:32.790
So basically this one will close off all of the cons and give us the ability to have only one open at

09:32.790 --> 09:33.520
a time.

09:33.540 --> 09:35.430
So we go back and refresh it.

09:35.430 --> 09:41.030
So open up that one open up that one and we can see that now we've only got one open at a time.

09:41.190 --> 09:43.190
And even if we toggle it.

09:43.260 --> 09:45.780
So we've got only that one open at a time.

09:47.570 --> 09:52.670
And I have lost the ability to toggle it opened and closed.

09:52.670 --> 10:00.050
So now what I want you to do is take a look at the code and apply a condition to see if we need to launch

10:00.050 --> 10:03.710
this function or not and close off all the other ones.

10:03.830 --> 10:10.820
So we need to make sure do a quick check to see if it's if it's active and if it is active that we want

10:10.910 --> 10:12.750
this one to remain active.

10:12.950 --> 10:18.080
So what I want you to do is apply the code in order for us to have the ability to kind of click and

10:18.080 --> 10:20.010
toggle as we're able to do before.

10:20.210 --> 10:23.780
So pause the video and I'll show you the solution come up.

10:23.780 --> 10:29.560
So the solution really is to pass this object so we can take a look and we can see this.

10:29.570 --> 10:31.990
So we're just passive in as t.

10:32.030 --> 10:36.740
And that basically gives us the ability to write a condition.

10:36.740 --> 10:39.670
So for now we don't want to.

10:39.680 --> 10:46.680
So if the current one is the one if t is equal to see x.

10:46.850 --> 10:51.880
So if the object is the same then we don't want to remove the class.

10:52.070 --> 10:59.840
So the way to do this is we him add that explanation mark there so that we know that if it's not equal

10:59.900 --> 11:04.950
to see then we're going to remove that clause so save it and try it out.

11:05.060 --> 11:10.220
So now we should be able to toggle but we're still not able to toggle it opened and closed.

11:10.350 --> 11:12.790
So there's one thing missing within the script.

11:12.830 --> 11:14.220
Can you spot the error.

11:14.450 --> 11:19.370
So take a look through and there's actually something that we're actually passing the wrong variable

11:19.370 --> 11:22.260
the wrong value into corn.

11:22.280 --> 11:25.180
So can you determine what the right value is.

11:25.370 --> 11:31.700
And we're looking to add active and remove active and I'll give you a hint that it's within the Khan

11:31.700 --> 11:34.870
class and not the one that was actually clicked.

11:35.650 --> 11:39.970
So take a look at the code and I'll give you a few minutes and then I'll show you the solution.

11:39.970 --> 11:48.670
So what we're doing here is we're passing this and this refers to a CC so doesn't refer to the next

11:48.670 --> 11:53.230
sibling which is actually the element that's getting that active class.

11:53.230 --> 11:59.850
So in order to get to the right one we need to make sure that we're passing this next element sibling.

11:59.850 --> 12:02.170
So now let's go back and refresh it.

12:02.230 --> 12:07.840
And now we can't actually open and close and toggle open and close and we can see that we've got the

12:07.840 --> 12:11.390
ability to toggle open and close elements.

12:11.560 --> 12:17.320
And now we can add in other ones as well.

12:17.320 --> 12:25.090
So use this for format our code is going to be very dynamic that we can then any number of additional

12:25.090 --> 12:28.630
elements can go back out here and refresh it.

12:28.630 --> 12:35.040
So now we have a nice accordion and we could only have one of these open at a time.

12:35.050 --> 12:41.320
So go ahead and try it for yourself and add additional content into the Chordia and and then also use

12:41.320 --> 12:44.440
this same format to create additional elements.

12:44.530 --> 12:49.290
So following that format where A.S.C. immediately followed by the content.

12:49.300 --> 12:52.810
So another div that has that content that we're displaying.

12:52.810 --> 12:59.360
So go ahead try it for yourself and build your own accordion and have the functionality via javascript.
