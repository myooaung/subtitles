Welcome to our section on the dorm the document object model where we're going to show you the basics

00:07.660 --> 00:10.020
to start interacting with the dorm.

00:10.060 --> 00:16.840
Javascript is all about creating some dynamic interaction and when it comes to web pages this is where

00:16.840 --> 00:24.950
the dorm rules you need to be able to access content within the dorm in order to update your HVM pages.

00:25.030 --> 00:31.660
And we're going to show you exactly that how to interact with your HDMI elements by accessing values

00:31.660 --> 00:38.710
and objects contained ready built within your browser when your browser loads up it reads through the

00:38.710 --> 00:46.600
code and it builds a document object model basically a tree of information that's contained within your

00:46.600 --> 00:47.460
web page.

00:47.470 --> 00:54.100
So this is all of the elements that are contained within the age to meld page even down to every little

00:54.100 --> 00:54.610
node.

00:54.700 --> 01:00.480
So where the text is located attributes styles and a whole lot more.

01:00.550 --> 01:07.630
So everything is contained within the dorm and Javascript can connect to the dorm pull those values

01:07.630 --> 01:11.160
out select those elements and make updates to it.

01:11.200 --> 01:16.960
And this is one of my favorite parts about javascript having the ability to update and make your web

01:16.960 --> 01:18.790
pages really come to life.

01:18.850 --> 01:25.330
And this really illustrates the power that Javascript has under the hood because Javascript can grab

01:25.420 --> 01:29.440
all of that information and make use of it through code.

01:29.470 --> 01:37.030
So that's creating dynamic content interactive content selecting and updating content manipulating what's

01:37.030 --> 01:39.030
being output within each team.

01:39.220 --> 01:41.070
And a whole lot more.

01:41.290 --> 01:47.010
So this section is meant to introduce you to the dorm and what's available within the dorm.

01:47.140 --> 01:53.860
So that coming up in the latter part of the course our content can be made more interesting and we can

01:53.860 --> 02:01.180
make it more interactive and show you how to interact with it with your web pages using javascript and

02:01.180 --> 02:08.320
you're going to learn about all the document object model and what it can do and how javascript can

02:08.320 --> 02:10.510
be used to connect to those elements.

02:10.510 --> 02:16.900
You can see what can be done with the dawn and using the dorm you can update elements even without refreshing

02:16.960 --> 02:17.910
the web page.

02:18.010 --> 02:25.990
So those elements get dynamically updated through javascript and they update immediately as what's being

02:25.990 --> 02:28.060
presented for the web user.

02:28.060 --> 02:33.400
So you're going to learn how to make that dynamic content interact and manipulate with elements all

02:33.400 --> 02:35.830
done dynamically via javascript.

02:35.830 --> 02:42.610
You can also see how all the different elements that update them and update the inner h to Mehl output

02:43.270 --> 02:49.870
connect with your users and their input and get those values right back into your javascript code where

02:49.870 --> 02:53.630
you can make use of them using your javascript.

02:53.680 --> 03:00.790
You get those values from input fields and utilize that information in javascript create visual interactions

03:00.790 --> 03:07.430
for your web visitors select elements and power them up just by using javascript.

03:07.570 --> 03:13.210
So there's a lot that we're going to be covering in the next few lessons and this is going to be really

03:13.210 --> 03:18.340
important to creating really nice interactions with your web pages.

03:18.730 --> 03:23.590
And I do have to warn you there is a lot of information contained within the dorm so we're going to

03:23.590 --> 03:29.980
be touching on it lightly within this section and in an upcoming section we're going to dive into more

03:29.980 --> 03:32.330
detail as to what's contained within the dorm.

03:32.470 --> 03:39.580
So this section is just a simple introduction to using the dorm and starting to access those elements

03:39.790 --> 03:41.650
that are contained within your age to Mel page.
