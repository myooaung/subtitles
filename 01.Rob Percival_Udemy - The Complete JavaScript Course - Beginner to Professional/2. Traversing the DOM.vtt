00:00.870 --> 00:06.250
Welcome back in in this lesson we're going to look closer at traversing through the dawn.

00:06.360 --> 00:11.370
So this portrait part of when you're working with content that's available within your aged him all

00:11.580 --> 00:17.220
that you have the ability to properly make your selection of the elements and sometimes it does take

00:17.250 --> 00:24.150
a little bit of maneuvering through the hierarchial representation of our age Tim Page.

00:24.300 --> 00:28.090
So first of all let's go ahead and build it on each Tim Page.

00:28.110 --> 00:31.990
So start with the form and we're going to give it a name of my form

00:37.960 --> 00:39.270
so just call it my form

00:42.490 --> 00:50.460
and next let's add some input fields and there so I'm going to go ahead and create inputs and this one

00:50.760 --> 00:51.170
maybe will.

00:51.200 --> 00:58.020
First of all do type you or else we can input a you are l will give it an ID and we'll give it id of

00:58.020 --> 00:59.360
you or L as well.

00:59.520 --> 01:02.530
And let's give it a name as well of you.

01:02.880 --> 01:07.810
So we've got one input field there and let's create a few other input fields.

01:09.500 --> 01:11.600
So this one will instead of you.

01:11.630 --> 01:16.410
Let's do a text here and let's let's just do first here.

01:16.430 --> 01:22.720
So this will represent another option here to enter an input and let's do one more.

01:22.760 --> 01:33.020
So to call this one last so that we have a variety of inputs that we can work with as well.

01:33.020 --> 01:39.950
So in this as well let's add a text area so we have a larger variety of different inputs and we'll give

01:39.950 --> 01:41.510
it a name and for this one.

01:41.540 --> 01:42.470
Let's call this one.

01:42.470 --> 01:45.160
I would put and then that's it.

01:45.160 --> 01:47.390
We're not going to assign any ID's to there.

01:47.620 --> 01:56.720
And then also I want to create a div and I'm going to give it an ID of another.

01:57.010 --> 02:00.850
And then this will give us some where to maneuver through.

02:00.850 --> 02:02.440
So just call this parent.

02:02.590 --> 02:09.580
So enter in some age to melt some text there calling it parent and let's create some divs nested in

02:09.580 --> 02:15.130
there so we can really get down into maneuvering through what's available within the dorm.

02:15.280 --> 02:19.420
And I'm just going to call these I guess create a series of them and I'm going to have one two three

02:19.420 --> 02:20.100
four.

02:20.410 --> 02:25.860
So just call them test 1 and then I'm going to duplicate this and create a bunch of them.

02:25.900 --> 02:31.150
So they're all going to be nested within this parent which is nested within the form and which is nested

02:31.150 --> 02:38.200
within the body and then all we need to do is go through the document object and we can maneuver through

02:38.260 --> 02:40.550
and pick out the ones that we want to utilize.

02:40.720 --> 02:44.230
So I'm going to update these ideas so that they're all unique.

02:44.230 --> 02:49.120
So they're all going to have unique ideas and I'm just going to update them here numerically so I've

02:49.120 --> 02:56.710
got one two three four so it's easier to understand once we're looking through and maneuvering through

02:57.100 --> 03:01.380
which one we're actually looking at within within the dorm.

03:01.870 --> 03:06.760
And this is where naming your elements is important as well because you want to have the ability to

03:06.760 --> 03:12.600
really easily maneuver and traverse through the door in order to pick out those elements as needed.

03:13.490 --> 03:17.740
So I want to have a bunch of siblings here so basically this is the parent.

03:17.780 --> 03:20.150
And then we've got a bunch of children here.

03:20.180 --> 03:22.010
And these are all siblings to each other.

03:22.010 --> 03:27.050
And this is important to understand the relationship of the nodes one to the other.

03:28.770 --> 03:36.100
And then lastly I wanted to add one more element here and I want to add this in as a button.

03:36.450 --> 03:40.440
So I'm going to give it an idea of beauty in one.

03:41.160 --> 03:45.790
And then we'll do an on click event here for this one.

03:46.260 --> 03:53.520
And whenever this gets fired off it'll run the function and we need to add in some type of functionality

03:53.520 --> 03:55.180
for the function itself.

03:57.860 --> 03:58.880
So let's update that.

03:58.920 --> 04:01.290
And the value will be click here.

04:01.440 --> 04:05.130
So let's go back to our page refresh the page.

04:05.130 --> 04:13.260
So we've got a bunch of H Tim L here and now when Livre we go into our document we can see that when

04:13.350 --> 04:19.680
we maneuver through it we can see we've got all of the elements they're listed and we can now begin

04:19.680 --> 04:26.480
to traverse through the document object so they clear that console and to make it a little bit bigger.

04:27.460 --> 04:33.640
So what I want you to do now is open up your editor and create some h t m l and ideally if you do the

04:33.640 --> 04:39.610
same type of structure that I have where we've got a form we've got a bunch of inputs and we've got

04:39.610 --> 04:45.700
our dibs and then we've got several divs nested with an apparent div because this is going to be important

04:45.700 --> 04:51.880
to understand the relationship between all of the different siblings and how this works when we're maneuvering

04:51.940 --> 04:52.920
through the dorm.

04:53.020 --> 04:54.000
So let's begin.

04:54.040 --> 05:03.070
And the way that we want to start is we actually want to use document and pick up where one of these

05:03.130 --> 05:09.210
divs is located so what the value is of the inner text of one of these device.

05:09.310 --> 05:18.060
So go ahead and build this out and then try out maneuvering to get to div id for.

05:18.280 --> 05:26.380
So not by selecting the ID not by using get element by ID but simply maneuver down through the DOM making

05:26.380 --> 05:34.270
that selection and pull back the value of test for and update that to updated test for.

05:34.270 --> 05:38.920
So go ahead and try that out and I'll show you the solution coming up.

05:38.920 --> 05:42.290
So I hope you had an opportunity to try this out for yourself.

05:42.400 --> 05:45.820
So now let's go do some maneuvering through the door.

05:45.820 --> 05:50.300
So first thing we need to know that we start a document and we go to a body.

05:50.590 --> 05:57.040
So within document body we've got access to all of this information and we know that it's contained

05:57.100 --> 06:00.740
within form so we can maneuver down to the form.

06:00.790 --> 06:06.250
And if you want to see the structure a little bit better you can always go console directory and from

06:06.250 --> 06:17.290
there we can do document body and this will give you a more object formatted view of the different content

06:17.290 --> 06:19.010
that's available within the body.

06:19.030 --> 06:22.630
So the next step is to be able to pick out that element.

06:22.660 --> 06:27.220
So we go by the parent so we know that the parent of it is another.

06:27.250 --> 06:30.200
And then the parent of another is my form.

06:30.310 --> 06:34.360
So we know that the Dom builds that within this higher curial approach.

06:34.360 --> 06:40.360
So in order to get to the children we need to start at the parents so we need to start at the root level.

06:40.390 --> 06:47.110
We started with document body and now we know we need to go down a little bit and we can go into the

06:47.110 --> 06:53.120
different child nodes and notice that there is a difference between child nodes and children.

06:53.200 --> 06:59.680
So the difference between the two is that the child loads include all of the different nodes and there's

06:59.680 --> 07:03.430
a number of different nodes that are available within the dorm.

07:03.430 --> 07:09.670
I believe that there's probably over 10 different types so I'm not exactly sure how many but there are

07:09.670 --> 07:10.330
quite a few.

07:10.330 --> 07:15.930
So we know we've got text form script and we've got a few of them listed here.

07:16.090 --> 07:21.100
So usually the way that I do it you can you can do it in either way you can maneuver through the child

07:21.130 --> 07:25.870
nodes and that will get you to the form or you could go through the children and then you could get

07:25.870 --> 07:32.620
to the forum that way or because this forum actually has a name we can use the my form value.

07:32.920 --> 07:34.300
So either way.

07:34.330 --> 07:38.320
So there's a number of basically paths in order to get to it.

07:38.470 --> 07:46.480
And I'm going to use the named Poth and I do need to include the children for there because this is

07:46.880 --> 07:48.030
one of the children.

07:48.410 --> 07:52.250
So let's update that.

07:52.300 --> 07:53.630
So we've got children.

07:53.650 --> 07:56.940
And then within the children we're going to look for them my form.

07:56.950 --> 08:02.410
So when we output the children we've got this h t m l collection and there we've got them lifeform.

08:02.470 --> 08:09.810
So sometimes it can get fairly long and again it depends on where you're trying to traverse through.

08:09.850 --> 08:15.120
Sometimes it's easier just to make that selection but it's always good to know the different relationships

08:15.130 --> 08:20.740
so now we're going to grab my form and now we've got the form object here.

08:20.830 --> 08:22.290
So now we can go down.

08:22.300 --> 08:30.610
So we've got the parent here and we can go down into the element the div here with the ID of another.

08:30.730 --> 08:36.980
So let's go down in the children and you can see that because we've got an ID we can simply go in to

08:37.000 --> 08:40.450
another and this isn't available when you do child nodes.

08:40.570 --> 08:43.900
You can also do it by the number here within child nodes.

08:43.900 --> 08:48.970
So if you know that it's node number nine then you can move her maneuver into that.

08:48.970 --> 08:53.330
So let's let's try it with child nodes this time.

08:53.530 --> 08:54.670
So next.

08:54.670 --> 09:02.110
So we've got that path and we'll do child nodes and there is a difference.

09:02.200 --> 09:04.960
And it also depends on what you're trying to select.

09:04.960 --> 09:07.170
So you can do it within this type of format.

09:07.300 --> 09:10.850
So now we've gotten into this parent the death of another.

09:11.020 --> 09:12.570
So now we've got access to it.

09:12.640 --> 09:16.440
And again we're presented with a number of different paths that we can take.

09:16.450 --> 09:22.490
So going through this hierarchal process we can go through the child nodes we can go through the children.

09:22.510 --> 09:26.790
So usually I usually prefer to go through the children because it's a little bit easier.

09:26.920 --> 09:32.590
So let's do that now as well because we've got the names there and we've got ideas assigned to it and

09:32.590 --> 09:36.430
if we didn't have the ideas we can always use the numeric representation.

09:36.430 --> 09:39.510
So we know that the numeric representation is three.

09:39.550 --> 09:46.090
So we can grab it via the three or we can just use the object values here and grab child node number

09:46.120 --> 09:47.130
four.

09:47.170 --> 09:53.680
So let's close this off and update this one more time.

09:53.890 --> 09:57.450
So let's do so we were going to do children within this statement.

09:58.180 --> 10:00.880
And I know it's it's getting really long there.

10:03.310 --> 10:09.520
So if we do children that means we've got the collection here of H.T. M-L and the one that we're going

10:09.520 --> 10:10.920
for is for.

10:11.110 --> 10:12.730
So let's update that again.

10:12.730 --> 10:20.320
So children for and let's refreshed that again so now we've got access to the child that we're trying

10:20.320 --> 10:21.990
to maneuver down to.

10:22.120 --> 10:25.580
And now we can make changes to this one as well.

10:27.450 --> 10:30.480
So let's now go ahead and update the inner h team.

10:30.510 --> 10:39.790
Or we could update the inner text and we now need to just enter in some text so type and updated test

10:40.060 --> 10:47.430
for so there we go so now we've updated test for it within that age.

10:47.430 --> 10:54.710
Tim L So once you've made that selection and you've maneuvered down to the element that you want to

10:54.710 --> 11:00.800
look out I want you to set it up in a variable so basically so that we can hold that element information

11:00.830 --> 11:02.110
within a variable.

11:02.150 --> 11:02.780
So there we go.

11:02.780 --> 11:09.200
We've got that particular element and now we can do some more maneuvering and maneuver to the other

11:09.200 --> 11:09.720
ones.

11:09.830 --> 11:15.370
So we're going to be using some built in methods that are available in order to maneuver through.

11:15.380 --> 11:23.260
So let's go ahead and go into selecting the next sibling and this one so we can select a.

11:23.300 --> 11:27.630
Now because we've got that object being represented within the value of a.

11:27.830 --> 11:30.520
And we've got next element sibling.

11:30.530 --> 11:33.020
Next sibling and next element sibling.

11:33.080 --> 11:38.210
And this is the same thing that we were looking at between the node list and the children that we can

11:38.210 --> 11:43.830
select either one and element sibling will represent the number 5.

11:44.000 --> 11:52.640
So if we do next element sibling ID we can see that the ID is number five and we can also do the previous

11:52.640 --> 11:53.810
one as well.

11:53.840 --> 12:00.860
So we don't have to do next to just remove that and we've got another value where we can do previous

12:02.880 --> 12:06.930
elements sibling so we can grab the ID of the previous elements sibling.

12:06.930 --> 12:08.240
So that's three.

12:08.250 --> 12:15.060
So once you've picked out the element you can also maneuver to its siblings and you can get information

12:15.120 --> 12:16.830
from the sibling as well.

12:16.830 --> 12:18.850
So let's go back out to the parent.

12:19.080 --> 12:24.150
And we've seen this one already before where we go out to the parent element.

12:24.210 --> 12:31.020
So if I want to maneuver back up and get content of the parent we see that we can maneuver back up to

12:31.020 --> 12:31.820
the parent.

12:32.100 --> 12:36.750
So once we've gone in to the parent there's a few others that I wanted to show you.

12:36.870 --> 12:44.080
So let's take a look at first child so we've got an option to select the first child so what do you

12:44.080 --> 12:45.910
think is going to get returned there.

12:45.910 --> 12:50.590
If I do first child I.D. and we see that

12:53.330 --> 12:54.560
we get an undefined.

12:54.560 --> 13:00.720
So let's take a closer look at the first child and see what element we're actually selecting.

13:00.750 --> 13:06.560
So there isn't the first child actually is going to be this content here where we're seeing parent.

13:06.570 --> 13:08.370
So there's no element there.

13:08.370 --> 13:10.590
So we're actually selecting the first

13:13.590 --> 13:18.840
node and if we want to select the first element we need to do first element child.

13:18.930 --> 13:21.110
And that's going to grab that first one there.

13:21.120 --> 13:26.170
So now let's grab the ID of that one and we see that now we were able to select that.

13:26.430 --> 13:30.450
And the same thing we can do we can automatically grab the last one.

13:30.570 --> 13:36.000
So just so we grabbed the first one we can do last element child ID.

13:36.030 --> 13:39.190
So what do you think is going to get returned here for the ID.

13:39.300 --> 13:42.980
We see that we're able to grab that last element that's available there.

13:43.140 --> 13:45.270
And again we can traverse through them.

13:45.300 --> 13:50.760
So if we want to get 5 again we could go to the last one and then we could go to the previous sibling

13:51.060 --> 13:59.640
and we could build out this huge long path in order to get to the particular element that we're looking

13:59.640 --> 14:00.250
for.

14:00.600 --> 14:02.770
So go ahead and try do it yourself.

14:02.820 --> 14:09.300
Use the console and challenge yourself to get various values within your aged him El and then make updates

14:09.300 --> 14:10.700
to those values.

14:12.340 --> 14:19.010
Even picking up values from various inputs and updating the values that are contained with it within

14:19.010 --> 14:20.140
the inputs as well.

14:21.280 --> 14:26.710
So once you get really familiar with traverse in the dorm and understanding that hierarchial structure

14:26.920 --> 14:32.530
where they've all got parents and children then you can go down and up and maneuver through them then

14:33.130 --> 14:39.070
you'll be able to really easily select out any element that you want and understand the relationships

14:39.280 --> 14:42.180
within the DOM between the various elements.
