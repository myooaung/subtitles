00:01.150 --> 00:06.040
Welcome back in this lesson we're going to do some more fun stuff with canvas.

00:06.100 --> 00:13.210
So go ahead and create your canvas tag give it an idea of canvas and now let's create some interaction

00:13.210 --> 00:16.850
with it using javascript so window onload.

00:16.870 --> 00:21.240
And whenever we load them we're going to launch the function.

00:21.490 --> 00:22.680
So let's create that.

00:22.860 --> 00:28.510
And we saw earlier that it's always better that the dorm has loaded before we always try to interact

00:28.510 --> 00:29.380
with it.

00:29.440 --> 00:32.130
So therefore let's set that up first.

00:34.440 --> 00:38.730
And they also want to set those up those canvas items as global.

00:38.730 --> 00:41.100
So we're going to do the same thing that we did before.

00:41.100 --> 00:51.240
So variable canvas document get element by id and we're going to grab that canvas element and then next

00:51.330 --> 01:00.720
let's do CTX So for our context and we're going to bring in the canvas object and we're going to do

01:00.720 --> 01:03.350
the get context

01:06.060 --> 01:08.870
so that we can draw into our canvas.

01:08.900 --> 01:09.650
So Tuti

01:13.740 --> 01:20.260
And now let's set a height and width of canvas so do canvas height.

01:20.350 --> 01:28.480
So we're going to set our canvas height to 600 and we'll set our canvas with and maybe let's set that

01:28.480 --> 01:29.850
one to 500.

01:31.790 --> 01:33.630
And I need to create another function.

01:33.630 --> 01:39.110
So within here is this is where I want to initiate the draw.

01:39.110 --> 01:41.570
So it is going to create a function called draw.

01:41.780 --> 01:50.230
So I go down and create a function called Drost so function and give it a name of draw and then within

01:50.230 --> 01:50.590
here.

01:50.600 --> 01:52.510
This is where animation will go.

01:53.470 --> 01:56.940
So let's also set up a few other global variables.

01:56.950 --> 02:05.470
So we're going to have position and we'll set the value of x to equal zero and we'll set the value of

02:05.470 --> 02:07.310
y to equal 50.

02:07.330 --> 02:13.390
So that's where our starting point is going to be that's where our initial circle or whatever we're

02:13.390 --> 02:20.660
going to be creating is going to start at so save that go back out here and refresh it.

02:20.670 --> 02:24.730
So there we go so we've got a nice big canvas all ready to go.

02:24.870 --> 02:28.160
And to create some type of movement within draw.

02:28.500 --> 02:38.700
So first thing that we need to do is let's take position X and let's take position X and incremented

02:38.820 --> 02:40.350
by 5.

02:40.380 --> 02:46.890
So position X plus position X equals plus 5 and that will give us some type of movement.

02:46.950 --> 02:55.800
And we also need to check to make sure that position X does not exceed the width of canvas so it doesn't

02:55.860 --> 03:04.840
exceed the canvas width and if it does then we're going to reset position X back to a value of zero.

03:05.370 --> 03:12.060
So this way whenever we get to the end it's like it's going to basically start again and we can do this

03:12.060 --> 03:14.620
for position Y as well.

03:14.640 --> 03:22.740
So just in case we do decide to go with why we don't want to have that one running off the end as well.

03:22.740 --> 03:25.160
So let's set that one up as well.

03:25.170 --> 03:34.320
So this one is going to be position Y and we're going to check to make sure that position Y is not greater

03:34.320 --> 03:36.220
than the height of the canvas.

03:36.240 --> 03:40.330
And if it is then we're going to set position y at zero.

03:40.560 --> 03:47.580
So basically now we can position our canvas image.

03:47.580 --> 03:50.720
So next we need to actually draw it.

03:50.910 --> 03:59.390
So let's go ahead and do CTX so because this is global we can access that within our function.

03:59.510 --> 04:01.410
We're going to begin path.

04:01.610 --> 04:08.030
So that's going to give us the ability to have a starting point brand new path and we want to add in

04:08.120 --> 04:18.310
that arc so to CTX arc and we're going to set it at position X because now we've got dynamic values

04:18.580 --> 04:24.880
within javascript and javascript's is going to be doing some of the controls of where we're positioning

04:24.940 --> 04:35.180
our content so position x position Y and now we need to set a circle size so we can set it at 50.

04:35.300 --> 04:40.940
And also let's set that math value.

04:40.940 --> 04:43.410
So math and you can also do.

04:43.640 --> 04:48.620
So again we're setting that angle to be zero because we don't need to angle it.

04:48.680 --> 04:51.540
We can set math pi times too.

04:51.740 --> 04:55.460
So we saw earlier that that actually builds us our circle.

04:55.460 --> 04:58.790
And then what's the other thing that we need to do with the circle.

04:58.790 --> 05:05.300
We need to either do the stroke or we need to do a film so in this case we're just going to do fill

05:05.510 --> 05:12.770
through and fill out that circle and whenever we do fill it so it is a good idea to have a fill style

05:13.280 --> 05:17.330
and the fill style can be whatever color we want it to be.

05:17.330 --> 05:19.420
So I'm going to just make it red for now.

05:19.790 --> 05:20.520
So there we go.

05:20.520 --> 05:29.060
So we've got our position of our circle and now let's refresh it.

05:29.630 --> 05:34.230
So we don't see anything happening yet and that's because we need to set a timeout.

05:34.550 --> 05:43.440
So it's the window searched so we can set an interval or we can set a time out and if we set the time

05:43.440 --> 05:46.490
that we can call the function within itself.

05:46.760 --> 05:53.640
So basically this will allow us to continuously call that function using set time out.

05:53.780 --> 05:54.780
And so there we go.

05:54.800 --> 06:00.890
So we've got our circle it's moving but it actually looks more like a line because we're not actually

06:00.920 --> 06:04.080
erasing what's within the canvas already.

06:04.160 --> 06:12.050
And this is where we need to actually clear out the content of the canvas in order to be able to redraw

06:12.050 --> 06:13.310
our circle.

06:13.310 --> 06:15.980
So that's the first that we need to do coming in here.

06:15.980 --> 06:19.660
We need to clear that out and we can do that as well.

06:19.880 --> 06:32.230
So this is a clear rectangle and this one is starting at zero starting zero and canvas with so basically

06:32.500 --> 06:38.680
where drawing a clear rectangle across the entire canvas.

06:38.680 --> 06:43.040
So the whole height and width starting at point zero zero.

06:43.330 --> 06:46.240
So now let's refresh it and there we go.

06:46.240 --> 06:51.750
So we've got a circle moving across our screen if we want to speed it up.

06:51.910 --> 06:54.110
I can update this to 50.

06:54.490 --> 06:56.190
So be twice as fast.

06:56.500 --> 06:59.690
So now we've got a little bit of a smoother motion as well.

07:02.170 --> 07:06.120
And one of the thing that I want to show you so we've got the begin path.

07:06.160 --> 07:09.060
And I also want to close off that path.

07:09.220 --> 07:10.990
So we've got piggin path.

07:11.020 --> 07:16.450
And then whenever we stop drawing that particular item we can do close Potthast it's actually not going

07:16.450 --> 07:19.860
to look any different because by default it was already closing it.

07:20.020 --> 07:26.920
But we need to do that in case we want to add in any additional items that might be moving within our

07:26.920 --> 07:27.540
path.

07:27.760 --> 07:31.120
So what I want you to do now is pause the video.

07:31.270 --> 07:39.050
Draw the moving circle and I want you to add in a second one that's actually going to go down.

07:39.190 --> 07:41.680
So moving on the position why.

07:41.770 --> 07:44.520
And I want this one moving downwards.

07:44.710 --> 07:47.030
So go ahead and try that.

07:47.110 --> 07:50.050
So a second circle moving down.

07:50.050 --> 07:55.040
Add that into the project and I'll show you the solution coming up.

07:57.600 --> 07:58.440
So welcome back.

07:58.520 --> 08:04.290
Hope you had an opportunity to try out creating some animation within your canvas.

08:04.420 --> 08:07.710
And we said that we wanted to add a second circle.

08:07.830 --> 08:12.840
So we need to duplicate some of the content that we have here and was actually not a whole lot that

08:12.840 --> 08:14.390
we have to duplicate.

08:14.940 --> 08:16.800
And this one is moving down.

08:16.800 --> 08:27.900
So what I can do is I can make some updates there and instead of why incrementing by 5 let's do on X

08:27.900 --> 08:35.980
incrementing by 5 let's do pause one y and increment that by five.

08:35.990 --> 08:36.500
So there we go.

08:36.500 --> 08:44.750
So we've basically got our premolars for our second circle and now it's just a matter of drawing it

08:45.050 --> 08:46.880
so we can do it whatever color we want.

08:46.880 --> 08:48.660
So let's make this one blue.

08:49.250 --> 08:55.710
And this time it's going to be position x position Y and maybe this one's a bigger circle.

08:55.730 --> 08:59.140
So it may cut 70 and then fill close.

08:59.180 --> 09:00.430
So let's try that out.

09:00.680 --> 09:03.660
So now we see we've got one circle moving to the right.

09:03.710 --> 09:11.930
We've got one circle moving down and we should actually update this position of X because it's not very

09:11.930 --> 09:16.320
centered so let's give it a value of 100.

09:16.330 --> 09:17.110
So there we go.

09:17.110 --> 09:18.690
So we've got several.

09:18.700 --> 09:25.150
Moving circles and you can go in and you could add as many as you want we can just simply add that within

09:25.150 --> 09:29.280
that same draw function because this is where all the drawing happens.

09:29.440 --> 09:33.650
And this one here is what allows us to clear the content.

09:33.790 --> 09:41.360
And basically if we didn't have this all we would be doing is drawing a line so we can see that that

09:41.440 --> 09:46.480
in this case all we're doing is drawing lines because we're not actually clearing out the content.

09:46.480 --> 09:53.110
So just like if you were doing an animation in real life you need a completely clear screen and then

09:53.170 --> 09:59.410
that way you can create those animations where you're clearing out the screen blocked back to blank

09:59.710 --> 10:08.430
and then drawing in the next location of the image as to illustrate animation within your canvas.
