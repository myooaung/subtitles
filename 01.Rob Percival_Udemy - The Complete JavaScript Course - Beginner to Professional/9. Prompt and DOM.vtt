In this lesson we're going to take what we learned and update some content dynamically using javascript

00:08.370 --> 00:11.140
as we get input from the user.

00:11.340 --> 00:19.420
So what we need to do is create a pop up prompt asking for the user's name and then update this div

00:19.510 --> 00:26.220
here with the ID output to have a welcome message and include the users name.

00:26.490 --> 00:31.960
So what I want you to do now pause to open up your editor and try it for yourself.

00:31.990 --> 00:33.500
I'm going to show you the solution.

00:33.570 --> 00:38.910
Coming up so we got the opportunity to try it.

00:39.100 --> 00:48.100
And we saw earlier when we could get so you get the user name and we could utilize prompt.

00:48.100 --> 00:54.940
So this was a build method that's really cool with javascript and what it does is it has this pull up

00:54.940 --> 01:03.180
message and we can put whatever we wanted in there so we can say something like What is your name with

01:03.200 --> 01:04.330
the question mark.

01:04.510 --> 01:11.830
And we know that user name now will capture whatever the user's response was to our question.

01:11.830 --> 01:18.310
So we should be able to pick up the user's name and so the next part of this challenge was actually

01:18.310 --> 01:27.330
to update that output with the brain you use her name and use her information.

01:27.420 --> 01:34.480
So let's do the next step and where you were set up I would put and where you equal that two document's

01:36.200 --> 01:45.560
and use element by NTD grab that output element just place the object for now and then what I'm going

01:45.560 --> 01:52.310
to do next is I'm going to update that are taxed and I'm going to equal up to the username.

01:52.360 --> 01:53.650
So let's try this.

01:53.720 --> 01:57.190
So refresh the page what is your name.

01:57.190 --> 01:58.550
So type in the name.

01:58.570 --> 02:01.150
Hit OK and we see that that it.

02:01.160 --> 02:03.100
Now it's dynamically created.

02:03.200 --> 02:07.890
So we need to just finish up and update the rest of our welcome message.

02:07.940 --> 02:11.020
So this can be just regular stream.

02:11.270 --> 02:22.430
So welcome to my page and we'll comma separated and concatenate it together so refresh and whatever

02:22.700 --> 02:25.410
name or input the user places there.

02:25.440 --> 02:34.670
Now we can see it being generated put within our H-2.

02:34.870 --> 02:41.140
So now what I want you to do as well is to go and try to free yourself up to some of the messages.

02:41.160 --> 02:48.310
Update some of the output information and we are going to be revisiting the dawn in more detail within

02:48.400 --> 02:49.950
a latter part of his course.

02:50.110 --> 02:54.100
But for now take what you've learned in the previous lessons.

02:54.100 --> 03:01.840
Try it for yourself and get familiar with using Dawn and getting the information with your javascript.

03:01.840 --> 03:04.290
And we're going to have a lot more examples coming up.
