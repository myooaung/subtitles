00:00.850 --> 00:02.670
Work come back in in this lesson.

00:02.670 --> 00:07.030
We're going to build an exciting game which I like to call hit the computer.

00:07.030 --> 00:12.100
So it's similar to whack a mole but you're going to be whacking some old computers.

00:12.100 --> 00:15.230
So first of all let's build out our game.

00:15.250 --> 00:19.070
We need to build out our h t m l.

00:19.100 --> 00:21.280
So I wanted to set up the score.

00:21.380 --> 00:25.930
So score we're going to be doing within this game we're going to include it within a span.

00:26.120 --> 00:29.390
And we're going to give this span a class of score.

00:29.390 --> 00:29.930
So let's go.

00:29.980 --> 00:35.080
Give us the ability to select it and update it within the game.

00:35.090 --> 00:39.290
So next thing that I want it to do is I want it to set up a START button.

00:39.470 --> 00:42.350
So this is going to be type button

00:45.780 --> 00:47.180
input type button

00:49.780 --> 00:57.520
and let's add on click and whenever it gets clicked we're going to fire off start and give it a value

00:57.610 --> 01:01.260
of start game.

01:01.270 --> 01:04.190
So this is we always need a starting point for the game.

01:04.190 --> 01:09.130
So let's we're going to set that up and then also we're going to build out a game board.

01:09.160 --> 01:14.620
So let's give it a class and this is where all of the action is going to happen within our game.

01:14.670 --> 01:17.770
It's going to all happen within the game board.

01:18.220 --> 01:22.660
And I'm going to get rid of the message of.

01:22.770 --> 01:23.220
So that's it.

01:23.220 --> 01:24.170
We're ready to go.

01:24.180 --> 01:30.060
And next let's add in some styling so much like last time.

01:30.210 --> 01:36.900
I want to have the ability to actually see my game board with for the game board and right now let's

01:36.900 --> 01:41.010
set a width of the game board and we'll do 600 picks.

01:41.370 --> 01:44.730
And next let's set a height for the game board.

01:44.790 --> 01:49.790
So we'll do 500 picks for the height and we're going to center this.

01:49.830 --> 01:51.890
So to margin.

01:51.900 --> 01:53.130
0 auto.

01:53.180 --> 01:55.200
So the center left to right.

01:55.200 --> 02:01.100
And also I wanted to add in a board or someone pick solid and are going to have a really really light

02:01.130 --> 02:05.370
water so this is SO WE CAN BARELY kind of see what the game board looks like.

02:05.550 --> 02:06.060
So there we go.

02:06.060 --> 02:07.390
So there are game board.

02:07.400 --> 02:08.710
There's our start button.

02:08.820 --> 02:16.090
And next we need to be able to fire off that starting of the game.

02:16.340 --> 02:22.610
So let's set up the start of the game and we've got a function start and that's where we're going to

02:22.670 --> 02:24.880
contain our start information.

02:25.130 --> 02:30.110
So there's a few other things that we still need to build out and we need to actually build our game

02:30.110 --> 02:30.760
board.

02:30.770 --> 02:33.540
So let's go ahead and build our game board.

02:33.710 --> 02:36.210
So we're going to do window on load.

02:36.650 --> 02:43.240
And the window on load will launch our build function and build is going to allow us to build out our

02:43.250 --> 02:45.300
gameboard.

02:45.410 --> 02:52.800
So the game is going to be structured with several different divs and within the divs we're going to

02:52.800 --> 02:56.550
have a pit area for the computer to be able to hide in.

02:56.610 --> 03:01.740
And then one computer will pop up at a time and you have to guess where it's popping up and actually

03:01.740 --> 03:02.250
hit it.

03:04.000 --> 03:10.450
So let's build out our gameboard So this function is just called Build and we're passing any parameters

03:10.450 --> 03:11.600
arguments into it.

03:11.830 --> 03:14.370
And let's set up a variable to.

03:14.440 --> 03:24.760
So local variable and let's have some nice h to Mellin here hit the computer so not your actual computer

03:24.790 --> 03:29.050
but the computer images that we're going to have on the screen.

03:29.320 --> 03:35.080
So next you need to loop through create a loop and this loop is going to be what's going to allow us

03:35.080 --> 03:37.020
to build out the game elements.

03:37.060 --> 03:42.770
So we've got variable starting at zero and we want to loop through while x.

03:42.820 --> 03:48.580
So this is where we can enter in a value for the number of computers we want to show up.

03:48.670 --> 03:52.940
So let's start out with six and let's increment X by 1.

03:53.290 --> 03:57.000
So we know that we can't add to h Tamal.

03:57.460 --> 03:59.960
So let's add to it and concatenate to it.

04:00.100 --> 04:07.240
And we're going to add in a series of divs we're going to give a class of.

04:07.430 --> 04:10.610
So we can call it maybe the desk or something like that.

04:10.640 --> 04:17.780
So that's going to be where the computers are going to be housed or where actually we'll call it we'll

04:17.780 --> 04:21.010
call it our office.

04:21.170 --> 04:23.070
So that's where the computers our houses.

04:23.080 --> 04:28.440
A bunch of little offices there and the computers are going to be hiding behind desks.

04:28.460 --> 04:34.050
So do class and this is where we're going to set up a class of desk.

04:34.520 --> 04:36.590
And this one is just going to be blank.

04:36.590 --> 04:39.330
So we're going to make colorful div there.

04:39.470 --> 04:45.480
And next let's add in our class and this one is where the computers actually sit.

04:45.470 --> 04:53.400
So give to a class of computer close off and close off that div and then close off that div.

04:53.720 --> 04:58.570
So the next thing that we need to do is add it to our age to a male.

04:58.640 --> 05:04.250
So let's use queery selector and we'll grab our class gameboard.

05:04.280 --> 05:05.120
So go ahead.

05:05.120 --> 05:11.840
Pause the video and add in that h him out to the gameboard.

05:12.020 --> 05:13.390
So I'll show you how to do that.

05:13.430 --> 05:19.730
And this is something that we've done many times before so document and still get element by Adey this

05:19.730 --> 05:20.050
time.

05:20.070 --> 05:28.180
Let's use Querrey selector and what query selector does is it allows us to select by different parameters.

05:28.180 --> 05:37.050
The same thing as CSSA and we need to select our gameboard and then let's add that H to Maol using inner

05:37.140 --> 05:42.720
h to Mel and we'll add in our age to my object that we've just created.

05:42.750 --> 05:48.420
So we also need to set up some styling so we know that we set some styling for the gameboard but we're

05:48.420 --> 05:54.420
not going to be able to see any of the computers at the desks unless we actually add in some styling.

05:54.420 --> 05:57.510
So let's go ahead and do the styling for the desk.

05:57.510 --> 06:04.660
So the desk itself is going to take up for 100 percent with the available space and next.

06:04.680 --> 06:07.200
Let's do our height.

06:07.350 --> 06:15.030
So let's set up 50 pics of height and we probably will have to adjust that position for it is going

06:15.030 --> 06:16.050
to be absolute

06:18.330 --> 06:22.410
and let's give it a background color.

06:22.860 --> 06:28.710
So the background color of it is we can pick a color so maybe it's two brown

06:31.480 --> 06:35.300
or would say that one is a nice interesting color.

06:35.440 --> 06:38.640
And also I want to set the Zad index of it.

06:38.650 --> 06:39.980
So this is where we can.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.060
That's the stacking order in CSX.

06:43.600 --> 06:49.420
So I ultimately I do want the desk to show up above the computer because this is where the computer

06:49.420 --> 06:50.800
can hide behind.

06:50.800 --> 06:56.650
So now let's set up a background image and grow background.

06:56.710 --> 07:05.060
And so you are all for the image and the image is actually I've got it right on my computer.

07:05.080 --> 07:14.950
So I've got comp PMG And let's set it up at the bottom center and no repeats so we only have one background

07:14.980 --> 07:15.930
image.

07:16.470 --> 07:17.680
Let's position that.

07:17.750 --> 07:20.820
So the position for it is absolute.

07:20.920 --> 07:26.700
So that way we can move it around top is 100 percent

07:29.810 --> 07:33.830
and with well set the width to 100 percent.

07:33.830 --> 07:37.770
So it's going to allocate all of the available space that it has.

07:37.880 --> 07:40.370
And height is 100 percent.

07:40.460 --> 07:45.350
So this is going to be 100 percent of the parent element which is the office so we're going to have

07:45.350 --> 07:46.470
to set those.

07:46.760 --> 07:52.070
So now next let's set the office area.

07:52.640 --> 08:00.090
So this is where we're going to contain our computer and our desk.

08:00.190 --> 08:02.770
So we're just going to simply float these.

08:02.770 --> 08:05.050
So they'll float to the left of each other.

08:05.110 --> 08:06.730
So we're all going to float in line.

08:06.730 --> 08:08.080
We need to set a width.

08:08.080 --> 08:10.670
So I might just set 150 picks.

08:10.750 --> 08:12.790
We might have to make it smaller.

08:12.880 --> 08:17.120
We also need to set a height because we've got 500 pics to work with.

08:17.440 --> 08:19.260
So let's do 200 picks.

08:19.300 --> 08:22.100
And again this might be something that we might want to adjust.

08:22.260 --> 08:28.850
I want to do the overflow so overflow we should highlight any of the overflow so keep it hidden hidden

08:32.180 --> 08:35.070
and let's position it.

08:35.150 --> 08:42.360
So this one is going to be position and it's actually going to be relative.

08:42.410 --> 08:44.980
So now let's go ahead and try this.

08:45.020 --> 08:47.910
So go ahead and save the application.

08:48.020 --> 08:51.080
Go out and let's see if we build the game board.

08:51.200 --> 08:58.730
So we do have the game board being built out but we can't actually see the difference from the different

08:59.300 --> 09:01.200
borders of the offices.

09:01.370 --> 09:02.670
So let's add that in.

09:02.810 --> 09:06.650
And I have a feeling that we probably need to make some adjustments.

09:06.860 --> 09:11.280
So make it slightly smaller refresh it again.

09:11.300 --> 09:15.680
And also I want to add in some margins.

09:15.830 --> 09:21.680
So let's add in margins to the sides and let's try 30 pics of margins.

09:22.100 --> 09:25.750
So let's refresh and that was a little bit too big.

09:25.790 --> 09:31.470
Let's let's cut the with a little bit because I want to have three by three.

09:31.670 --> 09:37.700
And also let's do some margins at the top and the bottom as well so that we can have some better spacing

09:37.700 --> 09:38.840
between them.

09:38.840 --> 09:39.620
So there we go.

09:39.620 --> 09:46.370
And one more slight adjustment going to change this to be 7 170.

09:46.550 --> 09:49.340
So that way it will fit nicely and neatly into

09:52.200 --> 09:55.850
and I still want to actually move the dust to the bottom.

09:55.950 --> 10:00.990
So let's set this one at the bottom and we're going to do zero picks.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.820
So that right at the bottom.

10:02.840 --> 10:04.470
So just right now we're at the top.

10:04.470 --> 10:09.060
We want them at the bottom and we want the computers to pop up within these slots.

10:10.490 --> 10:17.780
So what I want you to do now is pause the video and add in event listeners for each one of these computer

10:17.810 --> 10:18.710
areas.

10:18.980 --> 10:28.380
So we've created the computers and we need to add that listeners to those.

10:28.520 --> 10:34.290
So let's use Querrey selector and we're going to set up a global variable so that we have access to

10:34.290 --> 10:35.360
a global variable.

10:35.360 --> 10:41.170
Is computers and then and here computers is going to equal to.

10:41.450 --> 10:51.420
We're going to sign it document and this time we're going to use Querrey selector all so Querrey selector

10:51.450 --> 10:58.110
all creates that array of all the matching elements and elements that we're looking for are the ones

10:58.110 --> 11:00.110
that have a class of computer.

11:00.330 --> 11:05.650
So we're basically going to build out that array and then next we need to loop through that array.

11:05.760 --> 11:11.310
So I've done this many times before where we're going to attach the event listener so we loop through

11:11.370 --> 11:17.350
while X is less than the length of that array.

11:17.370 --> 11:19.170
So the computer array.

11:19.320 --> 11:21.450
Next we need to increment x.

11:21.630 --> 11:24.390
So we have a way out of our loop.

11:24.750 --> 11:33.830
And next let's add in to computer and we've called it computers there and we call it computer here.

11:33.900 --> 11:42.210
So let's add in to computer and we're going to attach that listener and the listener that we're adding

11:42.270 --> 11:50.190
is click and the function that we want to fire off his hit computer.

11:51.250 --> 11:52.800
And we're not going to bubble up.

11:52.810 --> 11:58.540
We're not going to add any additional parameters so we'll just we'll set that up.

11:58.540 --> 12:04.630
So now what happens is once we hit the computer that we want to do a check.

12:04.660 --> 12:07.220
So let's update and add in that function.

12:07.420 --> 12:14.620
So we need a new function now which is called Hit computer and this is where we're going to actually

12:14.620 --> 12:22.240
check to see if the computer got hit and the way that we're actually going to show with our computers.

12:22.340 --> 12:27.740
If you want to take a quick peek at the computer notice that were top 100 percent.

12:27.900 --> 12:31.970
So basically we're moving it all the way down.

12:32.070 --> 12:34.170
So it's out of the visible area.

12:35.050 --> 12:40.270
And whenever we're out of the visible area our overflow is hidden in the office.

12:40.330 --> 12:42.120
So let's go back and refresh it.

12:42.120 --> 12:44.910
And so that way we can actually see the computers.

12:45.070 --> 12:49.840
So I do have to actually shrink these images down because I think they turned out a little bit big.

12:50.290 --> 12:54.690
So it's Add in a background size 100 percent by 100 percent.

12:54.700 --> 12:55.300
So there we go.

12:55.300 --> 12:59.500
So now we can see our computers and we can see them popping up

13:02.310 --> 13:05.270
and what I wanted to do maybe I can do 80 percent

13:08.970 --> 13:15.760
and we're going to have to actually do the full with the full height so it can do 80 percent height

13:16.480 --> 13:19.380
and background will do 100 percent.

13:20.080 --> 13:20.590
So there we go.

13:20.590 --> 13:25.600
So now we've got our computers and basically this is what they're going to look like when they pop up.

13:25.630 --> 13:29.780
So I'm going to go back and I'm going to update this back to 100 percent.

13:29.860 --> 13:39.130
And we know that for them to pop up we need to update and add in a class so we can set up a class and

13:39.190 --> 13:41.990
we can call this pop up.

13:42.250 --> 13:50.050
And this class is actually going to add top and it's going to send the top to zero.

13:50.050 --> 13:56.560
So basically this will give us the ability when we add the class top then the computers can actually

13:56.560 --> 13:58.890
pop up and we're going to see it visible.

13:59.320 --> 14:02.210
So all of this is coming up in the next section.

14:03.790 --> 14:11.210
Where we're going to show you how we can pick our Random office and then within this office I want to

14:11.210 --> 14:14.320
attach to the computer and have it pop up.

14:14.450 --> 14:20.410
And then if the computer actually gets clicked then we want to have some type of functionality.

14:20.420 --> 14:24.420
So right now we already have that functionality where the computer gets hit.

14:24.560 --> 14:26.940
So that's being taken care of over there.

14:26.990 --> 14:33.500
So the next thing that we need to do is we need to hide and pop up the computers randomly.

14:33.500 --> 14:35.210
So that's coming up in the next section.
