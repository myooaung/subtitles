00:01.380 --> 00:07.560
Won't come back in this lesson we're going to show you how you can use time outs and time outs are really

00:07.560 --> 00:10.070
useful object within the window.

00:10.290 --> 00:14.460
So let's set up a few functions in order to accommodate our timeouts.

00:14.460 --> 00:20.790
So first of all actually we need to set up a variable so we can just call it timer and we don't have

00:20.790 --> 00:26.000
to set it to anything right now because this is actually where we're going to hold our time information.

00:26.190 --> 00:27.960
I'm actually going to call it my timer

00:31.480 --> 00:33.180
so within this function.

00:33.190 --> 00:38.570
So this is the function that's actually going to trigger our first timeout.

00:41.270 --> 00:43.000
And we'll call it start

00:47.040 --> 00:50.370
start and.

00:50.950 --> 00:52.750
And within here.

00:52.750 --> 00:58.230
So in order to set up our timer we can use the variable my timer that we set up.

00:58.450 --> 01:05.590
And this is important because touching it to a variable actually gives you control in order to remove

01:05.860 --> 01:07.480
the timeout as well.

01:07.480 --> 01:14.810
So we're going to set timeout and what time does is it cause a function after a specific time.

01:14.980 --> 01:22.680
So basically after the specified time we're actually going to set and call in the function.

01:22.690 --> 01:29.200
So this is just going to be my pop up we'll call it my pop up.

01:29.200 --> 01:31.370
So that's the function that we're going to be calling.

01:31.480 --> 01:35.940
And next we need to specify the amount of time that we want to call that in.

01:35.980 --> 01:39.100
So we're going to call it in 1000 milliseconds.

01:39.130 --> 01:42.080
So basically that's in within one second.

01:42.430 --> 01:50.470
So let's do that now and we'll set up my pop up and then within here we can pretty much do whatever

01:50.470 --> 01:51.360
we want to do.

01:51.380 --> 01:58.950
So let's do an alert and within this alert we're just going to say hello.

01:59.130 --> 02:04.460
And we also want to set up one more that's actually going to clear the timer.

02:04.560 --> 02:06.960
So let's set that function up.

02:06.960 --> 02:11.590
So do function and this time it's going to be clear.

02:11.790 --> 02:15.870
So it's going to be clearing the interval so I don't have any arguments to pass in here.

02:16.050 --> 02:21.900
And we're going to do it window and this is a built in method where it's clear interval.

02:22.020 --> 02:29.550
So basically that cancels any repeating intervals so that we if we do have any that are still within

02:29.550 --> 02:34.080
the system this will clear them out and stop them from running.

02:34.080 --> 02:40.660
So now we're ready to go so we can create one more.

02:41.190 --> 02:49.050
So this one we're just going to create an input and this is going to be type button so that we can actually

02:49.050 --> 02:59.710
call out to our our method and then we're going to Skewes on click and use on click and we're going

02:59.710 --> 03:05.180
to call out and give it a value to we're just going to call it start.

03:05.200 --> 03:09.080
So whenever this button gets clicked then we're going to start our script.

03:09.100 --> 03:11.960
And that's going to start this interval.

03:13.720 --> 03:19.630
So basically we're going to launch that one and maybe what we'll do is we'll just keep it at that.

03:19.630 --> 03:21.780
So let's go and refresh the page.

03:21.790 --> 03:24.370
So now we've got a start button so let's see what happens.

03:24.370 --> 03:28.190
We hit start and we see we get this halo popping up.

03:28.660 --> 03:30.460
So basically that's what we can do.

03:30.460 --> 03:38.050
We can delay running of a function and if by chance I start it and all of a sudden I don't want it to

03:38.050 --> 03:38.760
go through.

03:38.830 --> 03:46.770
I can always clear it by doing the clear and interval so that will clear it.

03:46.860 --> 03:52.960
So this will be a stop and we see that it runs just that one time.

03:53.040 --> 03:55.860
So let's let's start.

03:55.860 --> 04:00.870
And if I hit stop fast enough then I'm able to clear out and clean out that interval.

04:00.870 --> 04:06.690
Otherwise if I had start and if I wait the 1000 milliseconds then we see that that fires off and you

04:06.690 --> 04:14.010
can use these functions in a number of different ways within your script in order to initiate the running

04:14.070 --> 04:22.060
of different functions within a specified time.

04:22.120 --> 04:26.920
And there's another really neat thing that we can do with that as well so if we want to continuously

04:26.950 --> 04:35.680
loop a specific function to continuously fire off we can initiate it to actually set that timeout again

04:35.680 --> 04:40.200
and again and this time I'm adding in my pop up over here.

04:40.210 --> 04:45.360
So when I start I and I I n t starts up it all.

04:45.370 --> 04:52.940
So the pop up it'll set the timeout and then within one second it will initiate start I.A. again.

04:52.960 --> 04:55.000
So let's see how that works will save it.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.460
Try it out and let's refresh the page.

04:58.480 --> 05:01.240
So let's start and now we see we've got.

05:01.240 --> 05:05.270
Hello and hello and hello.

05:05.320 --> 05:12.670
So basically what's happening is this is running over and over and over again so every minute or every

05:12.670 --> 05:14.850
second it's basically popping up.

05:15.010 --> 05:19.030
And in order for me to stop it I can always clear that interval that way.

05:21.070 --> 05:29.320
So what I want you to do now is open up your editor and run a specific function within a specific time

05:29.320 --> 05:30.000
period.

05:30.010 --> 05:37.210
So when somebody load your web page within five seconds pop up a welcome message to that user you can

05:37.210 --> 05:42.400
place it within your H mail as well as we've seen before.

05:42.610 --> 05:46.630
So try that out and update page 1.

05:46.630 --> 05:54.580
You can use wrapper and update the value of page 1 to welcome to my Web site within five seconds of

05:54.580 --> 05:56.970
the person landing on your page.

05:56.980 --> 06:01.550
So open up your editor try it out and I'll show you the solution coming up.

06:02.890 --> 06:05.080
So if you had an opportunity to try this.

06:05.110 --> 06:07.380
And it's great to get familiar with it.

06:07.630 --> 06:14.750
So what we want to do is we want to set a timeout that's actually going to update the value of wrapper.

06:14.920 --> 06:17.770
So let's first will build over function.

06:17.830 --> 06:24.040
So this function is going to be update wrapper

06:26.590 --> 06:34.660
and then here we can do documents and we know how we can grab those values we can do get element by

06:34.660 --> 06:47.610
id and rapper and now let's update that inner h t m l to say welcome to my Web site and we'll put a

06:47.610 --> 06:50.220
little happy face there at the end.

06:50.220 --> 06:57.360
So basically what we want to do is we want this particular function to run five seconds into the web

06:57.360 --> 07:06.150
page so we can set that timer and we can set that within here that instead of running this function

07:06.570 --> 07:13.100
we can run that function and we can set it to timeout within five seconds.

07:13.110 --> 07:19.360
So let's go back and see what happens so let's refresh our Web page.

07:19.590 --> 07:25.560
And now we got to wait five seconds and then we see that it actually updates to the new code.

07:25.560 --> 07:26.490
So that's it.

07:26.490 --> 07:27.780
So that's all we have to do.

07:27.780 --> 07:29.930
We didn't have to 70 variables for that.

07:29.940 --> 07:32.790
Of course you can if you want to as well.

07:32.810 --> 07:37.000
It's always a good idea to set them as variable so you can clear them out.

07:37.020 --> 07:42.300
But in this case we simply want to fire off that function within a given time period and that's all

07:42.300 --> 07:43.440
we want to do.

07:43.500 --> 07:49.820
So we're able to accomplish that within just a few lines of code.

07:49.870 --> 07:56.350
So go ahead and try to offer yourself if you already have and and see what you can do with the set timeout

07:56.740 --> 07:58.450
method in javascript.
