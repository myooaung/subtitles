00:00.770 --> 00:07.640
OK I know I've said this before but this is definitely my favorite section because with Jason and Ajax

00:07.880 --> 00:15.770
this opens up the door to get content and interact with other endpoints and other Web sites getting

00:15.830 --> 00:21.660
data back into your javascript application so you can connect to sites like YouTube.

00:21.740 --> 00:23.000
Pull back data.

00:23.060 --> 00:28.400
You can create your own space on files that can sit anywhere on the Internet and they can be pulled

00:28.400 --> 00:37.730
into your web page web application with Page refracts refreshes by using AJAX and Jaison is the perfect

00:37.970 --> 00:42.080
delivery format for data because it's really easy to use.

00:42.140 --> 00:47.930
And when we pull it into javascript we can really easily turn into a javascript object and make use

00:47.930 --> 00:49.710
of it within our code.

00:49.760 --> 00:56.750
So I'm going to show you all of this and bringing Jason data making use of Jaison data and how you can

00:56.750 --> 01:02.650
bring that information into your web page and make use of that as you output content.

01:02.690 --> 01:08.180
We're going to be building out some really cool applications within this section.

01:08.180 --> 01:14.120
So first of all we're going to build out is going to be a party invite where you can select names.

01:14.210 --> 01:15.890
You can check them off.

01:15.890 --> 01:20.560
You can add guests you can add additional names to your list.

01:20.660 --> 01:28.400
And this is all going to be brought in to the application using a J saw and file so you can really easily

01:28.550 --> 01:31.100
store that data and make use of that data.

01:31.100 --> 01:36.170
Also we're going to be looking at local storage so that's another way to store information into the

01:36.170 --> 01:36.950
browser.

01:36.950 --> 01:39.170
And I know we saw a little bit of it before.

01:39.230 --> 01:44.580
So it's worth revisiting because it's a great way to store that data.

01:44.630 --> 01:47.610
So it's persistent within the user's browser.

01:47.960 --> 01:55.060
Next we're going to look at generating a random country and then having to guess that country name.

01:55.070 --> 02:01.040
So there's a number of API that are out there on the Internet that you can access and you can play around

02:01.040 --> 02:01.370
with them.

02:01.370 --> 02:07.160
One of them is this one that's got all the countries and you can pull back country information you can

02:07.160 --> 02:11.890
get things like flags short codes capital cities.

02:12.050 --> 02:17.390
And so we just took all of this information and we're picking one at random.

02:17.390 --> 02:23.210
So random country and we're scrambling the letters and then making it into a guessing game.

02:23.210 --> 02:29.400
So this is a great starting point to really build applications and get familiar with other endpoints

02:29.450 --> 02:33.470
and API eyes and working with Jase on data.

02:33.490 --> 02:38.780
Next we're going to look at how we can set up a youtube search.

02:38.900 --> 02:46.280
So this youtube search will give us the ability to query into the YouTube API and return back search

02:46.280 --> 02:48.670
results for our search term.

02:48.770 --> 02:55.290
And then we can make use of them within our age HTML page and doing all of this via javascript.

02:55.370 --> 02:58.050
So pull it in using an AJAX command.

02:58.100 --> 03:03.980
It's all based on data we parse through it and then we make use of it outputting it into our H.T. a

03:04.010 --> 03:05.010
male web page.

03:05.060 --> 03:11.120
So basically looks like it's actually sitting on our Web page and we can incorporate all of these different

03:11.120 --> 03:15.620
really cool end points to bring data into our applications.

03:15.620 --> 03:21.980
Next we're going to look at building out a dynamic quiz so all of the quizz information is going to

03:21.980 --> 03:24.260
be coming out of a jigsaw file.

03:24.260 --> 03:29.510
So this is going to be sitting somewhere on the Internet and our application is going to make use of

03:29.510 --> 03:36.860
that Jaison data and build out a quiz that's going to be able to score go back forward and we're going

03:36.860 --> 03:42.890
to use a whole bunch of really cool capabilities that we've learned in the earlier sections.

03:43.010 --> 03:47.960
Bring it all together incorporating it into one big exercise.

03:48.060 --> 03:51.900
We're we're going to build out this quiz builder from scratch.

03:52.010 --> 03:55.000
So all of this and a whole lot more is included in the section.

03:55.070 --> 04:02.450
And I know you're excited to jump right in because working with Ajax and Jaison is just opens up the

04:02.450 --> 04:08.750
doors to a whole new world of data that you can make use of within your javascript applications.
