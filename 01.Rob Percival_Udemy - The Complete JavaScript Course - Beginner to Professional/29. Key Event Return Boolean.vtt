00:01.090 --> 00:06.670
Welcome back and we've looked at a number of different event handlers and in this lesson we're going

00:06.670 --> 00:12.580
to look at on key press on paste for input forms as well.

00:12.580 --> 00:14.730
So let's create an input area.

00:15.280 --> 00:17.170
And for this input area.

00:17.170 --> 00:22.670
So I'm going to set it up as text and we all know that with each team of 5 I can set it as a number

00:22.960 --> 00:31.480
but for the purposes of this exercise what I want to do with this input is I only want to restrict users

00:31.570 --> 00:34.990
to be able to have to add numbers.

00:35.020 --> 00:38.660
So my number input or I would just call it my name.

00:39.040 --> 00:48.170
So I only want users to be able to add in numbers so no other characters no at nothing but digits.

00:48.190 --> 00:57.380
So let's set up a function here so on key press so that listener are there.

00:57.850 --> 01:06.790
And what we want to happen is that we want to fire off a function and this function is going to be number

01:07.300 --> 01:10.260
check or just sorting it there.

01:10.270 --> 01:14.690
So basically it's going to check for the number value there.

01:14.710 --> 01:19.070
So now let's let's set that up here so we've got a function

01:23.450 --> 01:24.640
check.

01:24.770 --> 01:33.400
And so basically what's going to happen is we're going to check to see if that target is and the value

01:33.400 --> 01:37.760
of that target is a number.

01:37.870 --> 01:46.280
So let's build that message function again and message.

01:46.360 --> 01:51.410
So whatever value gets passed in the message we're going to do the same one here where we're just going

01:51.410 --> 01:55.040
to simply output it into our wrapper area.

01:55.250 --> 02:07.800
So document get element by Id grab that one with the wrapper ID and in our Him now equals them.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.690
So that way we can just send it as a variable value.

02:11.690 --> 02:22.040
So let's let's do this one first message and Ramus and the target value and it's actually going to send

02:22.040 --> 02:23.890
out a number of times.

02:23.900 --> 02:25.110
So let me show you what I mean.

02:25.190 --> 02:32.150
So basically whenever I'm typing in there we see that every time I update the key it's updating that

02:32.150 --> 02:32.760
value.

02:32.960 --> 02:39.840
So this is pretty good as we're able to get that value but it's not actually giving us that key value.

02:40.040 --> 02:47.640
So we need to actually return back the key value that was from that event.

02:47.650 --> 02:49.720
So let me show you how to do that.

02:49.750 --> 02:53.990
So instead of target value we can do that.

02:54.490 --> 02:59.580
And this is going to be the key that actually initiated that value.

02:59.710 --> 03:08.790
So that way we can do a check to see if these inputs are going to be a number or a digit.

03:08.830 --> 03:16.180
So it's as easy as that to make that check and Javascript has a built in ability to actually check to

03:16.180 --> 03:19.370
see if a value is a number or not.

03:21.480 --> 03:24.230
And this is where we're going to use boolean values.

03:24.240 --> 03:32.250
So let me open up the console and Javascript has a built in method that can check to see if value is

03:32.340 --> 03:33.690
a number or not.

03:33.690 --> 03:40.540
So in here I'm just going to enter in some text and we see that is Nan and it's true.

03:40.560 --> 03:42.100
So not a number.

03:42.210 --> 03:48.000
So in order to find out if it's actually not a number we need to do the negative.

03:48.270 --> 03:50.340
So again going back to the operators.

03:50.370 --> 03:56.070
And now if I type in some text here we can see that it's false.

03:56.430 --> 04:01.220
And if we do the opposite here and if we update this value.

04:01.230 --> 04:06.770
So 5 update this value with a number then it's going to come back as true.

04:06.780 --> 04:13.530
So this is what we want to do and we want to do a boolean check of this key value to check to see if

04:13.530 --> 04:14.950
it's a number or not.

04:15.210 --> 04:22.180
And we're actually going to return something back to this event handler and doing that.

04:22.200 --> 04:23.840
It gives us the ability.

04:24.180 --> 04:31.770
So if we're actually looking for our return back of a value then we can actually limit content that's

04:31.770 --> 04:35.030
being output so we can know all the key press event.

04:35.280 --> 04:37.510
So let me show you how that works.

04:37.560 --> 04:45.710
So let's do the check is nine and let's Ponson that key event.

04:45.770 --> 04:46.170
Tell You

04:51.840 --> 04:57.740
And what we're going to do is we're going to return this.

04:57.930 --> 05:03.270
And I'm also going to put that in here so that we can see what we're returning.

05:03.270 --> 05:05.430
So let's go back and refresh it.

05:05.550 --> 05:13.140
And we see that false and we see true and we still need to cut off the ability to be able to add in

05:13.200 --> 05:14.250
those values.

05:14.430 --> 05:17.310
And that's all we can add in return.

05:17.310 --> 05:22.360
So what this is going to do is this is going to return on the key press.

05:22.530 --> 05:25.440
And if this is true then it's going to allow it.

05:25.530 --> 05:33.240
And if it's false because writing in this return if this value is true if this value is true then we're

05:33.240 --> 05:35.640
going to be allowed to type the key.

05:35.640 --> 05:37.770
So let me show you what happens now.

05:37.770 --> 05:45.790
So now if I try to type in a character all I get is false if I try to type in numbers I get true.

05:46.050 --> 05:53.320
So it completely disables the ability to type in anything but digits into my input field.

05:53.610 --> 05:55.120
So it's the same thing.

05:55.140 --> 06:00.580
Jim L5 does have number but there are a number of uses for this type of functionality as well.

06:00.810 --> 06:05.240
And there's another one that I quickly wanted to add in and that's on paste.

06:05.430 --> 06:15.610
So we know that we can prevent prevent event from firing by doing returning back false.

06:15.610 --> 06:18.490
So this is the same thing as saying return false.

06:18.490 --> 06:21.720
So by doing return.

06:21.820 --> 06:24.460
So first set it returned true.

06:24.460 --> 06:32.550
And what I'll try to do is go back to refresh the page and I'm going to try to paste into their And

06:32.610 --> 06:34.850
we're allowed to do that because it's return true.

06:35.130 --> 06:42.720
But if I do return false when they go back and refresh it again and try to pass something in there it's

06:42.720 --> 06:45.750
not letting me pay so I am trying to paste in it.

06:45.810 --> 06:52.920
So this is even more advanced functionality that you can do within your event handlers where you can

06:52.990 --> 06:59.620
know them basically stop them from firing off and continuing with that process.

06:59.620 --> 07:05.970
So now what I want you to do now is try this for yourself try though on key press and you can start

07:05.970 --> 07:07.800
by just doing it.

07:07.950 --> 07:09.890
Either true or false.

07:09.920 --> 07:15.380
And if you do false then you're not going to be able to enter anything into that input field.

07:15.600 --> 07:22.770
And also if you do on paste return false you're not going to be able to enter any content into that

07:22.800 --> 07:24.730
input field either.

07:24.750 --> 07:31.130
And the other thing that I want you to take away from this lesson as well is the is nÃ¡n method.

07:31.170 --> 07:38.190
So this is built into javascript and it's a quick and easy way to tell if a value is a number and if

07:38.190 --> 07:40.840
it's not a number that's going to return true.

07:40.920 --> 07:48.360
And if it is a number then it's going to return false because it's not a number.

07:48.380 --> 07:56.350
So we do a double negative with the explanation mark in front of it to return true if it is a number.

07:56.350 --> 08:03.010
So what I want you to do as well is open up your editor and create another input field that only takes

08:03.010 --> 08:06.070
characters that doesn't take any numbers at all.

08:06.310 --> 08:09.890
So try that out and I'll show you the solution as well.

08:12.560 --> 08:17.900
So it's really easy that we just do basically the opposite of what we did for this one.

08:18.020 --> 08:22.440
So I'm going to do it does it matter.

08:22.450 --> 08:33.010
And on key press return and check to and at this time we're checking to make sure that the character

08:33.010 --> 08:34.270
is not a number.

08:34.480 --> 08:42.510
So we're seeing we've got to get rid of this explanation mark and named this to check too.

08:43.060 --> 08:45.480
And now let's go and refresh it.

08:45.490 --> 08:49.200
So this one only takes characters it doesn't take any numbers.

08:49.210 --> 08:50.640
This one only takes numbers.
