00:00.810 --> 00:01.720
Welcome back.

00:01.760 --> 00:08.460
And in this lesson I want to create the ability to actually vote on the friend and I want that actually

00:08.460 --> 00:12.300
to update within the cell that was selected.

00:12.300 --> 00:19.370
So anywhere if we click on any one of these so if we click on the box there the class box.

00:19.440 --> 00:24.570
I want it to initiate it and actually allow us to vote on that element.

00:24.570 --> 00:28.170
So this requires another data attribute.

00:28.170 --> 00:34.300
So let's instead of data roll we're going to add another one and we're going to simply call it data

00:34.410 --> 00:35.470
vote.

00:35.580 --> 00:42.090
So we're going to use this value as our default value for this is going to be zero.

00:42.510 --> 00:45.410
So we're going to start with a value of zero.

00:45.450 --> 00:50.930
And every time it gets clicked then we're going to output it and let's put that zero.

00:51.120 --> 00:56.080
So go back and refresh it and it didn't so go in the right place.

00:56.130 --> 01:00.620
So I need to go down here and this is the one that we're actually going to be updating.

01:00.690 --> 01:06.290
So we're not going to add any classes to it to make it a little bit here in order to update that content.

01:06.450 --> 01:12.480
So what I want you to do is to pause the video take the source code from the last lesson and update

01:12.480 --> 01:12.930
it.

01:12.930 --> 01:19.020
So whenever we click on it that it updates the value so takes the value of data roll not the value of

01:19.020 --> 01:24.780
the inner h M-L and we're making it a little bit more tricky so that we take the data roll value and

01:24.870 --> 01:28.350
increment it by one and then we output that value.

01:28.350 --> 01:32.400
And we also update the value of data roll as well.

01:32.520 --> 01:34.920
So go ahead and try that out.

01:36.810 --> 01:39.820
And I'll show you the solution coming up.

01:39.960 --> 01:45.660
So if you had an opportunity to try that out and we know that earlier we saw that we've got this on

01:45.660 --> 01:51.930
click event and this one basically fires off every time we click on that element.

01:51.930 --> 01:57.150
So we know that this is our place to go and this is where we can do our voting of the content.

01:57.150 --> 02:03.000
And actually I want to do something where I want to rearrange a few things because I think that if we

02:03.000 --> 02:07.420
place this one first then this will look a little bit better.

02:07.440 --> 02:12.590
So we have the ability to click on them and this is also where we're voting.

02:12.600 --> 02:18.150
So we know we've got the information here and we can pull back that information information we'll leave

02:18.240 --> 02:19.930
the message as well.

02:19.950 --> 02:22.270
So we need to pick up.

02:22.440 --> 02:33.800
So not only that date our role we also need to pick up the value of data the vote so get attribute data.

02:33.850 --> 02:34.310
Vote

02:37.180 --> 02:42.030
and let's set that up in a variable called V.

02:42.180 --> 02:47.670
So we also know the let's set that up here so we've got our votes are going to be contained within a

02:47.670 --> 02:48.790
variable v.

02:48.810 --> 02:57.020
So we loop through we're going to grab that data vote value when we're executing the on click there.

02:57.040 --> 03:04.000
So for now instead of Konsole logging that out let's console log the value of v and then we'll determine

03:04.090 --> 03:05.820
what we can do with that value

03:08.990 --> 03:09.890
so update it.

03:09.890 --> 03:14.200
And we're just going to simply log out whatever the value of v is.

03:14.210 --> 03:16.310
So let's refresh this.

03:16.330 --> 03:19.970
Now when we click on it we see we've got the value of zero.

03:20.450 --> 03:27.140
So firstly we need to do is check to see if the value of v is a number and if it's not a number we definitely

03:27.140 --> 03:31.310
need to turn it into a number in order to do something with it.

03:31.310 --> 03:35.990
So let's first try out and do an increment of the new V.

03:36.260 --> 03:42.010
So go back and refresh it and we can see that it is a number it's been returned as a number.

03:42.470 --> 03:44.630
And we're able to increment on it.

03:44.630 --> 03:50.840
So this is great because now we have the ability we're picking up that value that's contained within

03:50.840 --> 03:51.480
here.

03:51.650 --> 03:55.150
And we know that now we can update this value.

03:55.310 --> 04:03.170
So what I want you to do is pause the video and figure out the best way to update this last table.

04:04.650 --> 04:13.960
So using what we used earlier traverse through to the last element of the parent and update the inner

04:13.980 --> 04:20.760
h to melt with the value of the so pause the video and I'll show you the solution coming up.

04:20.810 --> 04:29.890
So there are a number of ways that we can do this so we can simply do this parent and then we can do

04:29.950 --> 04:31.640
last child element.

04:31.690 --> 04:34.420
So that's last child element.

04:37.490 --> 04:44.660
And maybe before we do that let's let's make sure that we know we've got the value of v in there and

04:44.660 --> 04:50.030
this is what I usually do with the console is I just make sure that I'm grabbing that last element so

04:50.030 --> 04:51.780
I am grabbing that last one.

04:51.860 --> 04:53.960
So everything looks good to go.

04:54.050 --> 05:00.720
And I can simply grab that and do dinner and let's just do it in a text that actually doesn't matter.

05:00.860 --> 05:04.020
And we're going to set it to the value of the.

05:04.060 --> 05:10.450
So let's refresh and right now our value should only go to 1 because we're not actually updating the

05:10.450 --> 05:11.320
attribute.

05:11.320 --> 05:16.630
So that's the next part of this is we want to be able to update that attribute value.

05:16.630 --> 05:20.080
So right now all those attribute values are at zero.

05:20.170 --> 05:22.640
And that's why we're not able to increment past one.

05:22.840 --> 05:33.270
So what I want you to do is pause the video and update the value of the attribute so we had an opportunity

05:33.270 --> 05:34.660
to try that out.

05:34.830 --> 05:38.070
So we're trying to do and we did see this earlier.

05:38.160 --> 05:43.250
So we know that we've got get attribute but we also have the ability to set an attribute.

05:43.290 --> 05:48.650
So we want to happen is we want to increment past the value of one.

05:48.660 --> 05:54.450
So the way to do that is to use this and we have to grab that parent again because that's where that

05:54.510 --> 05:56.000
attribute is sitting.

05:56.750 --> 06:01.770
So just as earlier we did get attribute we could also do this course.

06:01.850 --> 06:08.060
So both of these will work and I'm going to leave them both in as an example of different ways of traversing

06:08.120 --> 06:08.930
through the dawn.

06:09.140 --> 06:14.090
So now we know that we're getting to the parent and that's the one that we need.

06:14.150 --> 06:20.090
So we need to set the attribute and the way that we can set the attributes are the same way that we

06:20.090 --> 06:21.670
added in the style.

06:21.740 --> 06:24.180
We can do data value.

06:24.440 --> 06:33.020
So that's our attribute name and we can set it what the value of we see it go back out refresh the page.

06:33.020 --> 06:41.280
And now you can see that you have the ability and actually there should be data vote so may not update

06:41.470 --> 06:48.180
and now save it and now you can see that you have the ability to update and to vote on each one of your

06:48.660 --> 06:50.240
friends within the table.

06:51.710 --> 06:54.410
And this is all done dynamically via javascript.

06:54.590 --> 06:58.820
And of course if we assume as we refresh the page that resets itself.

06:58.820 --> 07:03.360
So it's not being actually stored in a database because it's all front end code.

07:03.410 --> 07:09.530
But this just gives you a better idea of what's available within javascript and what you can do with

07:09.560 --> 07:16.790
attributes and using all of these customized attributes gives you a lot more information that you can

07:16.790 --> 07:18.920
hold within the elements.

07:19.040 --> 07:23.810
And then you can access them via javascript and update them as well via javascript.
