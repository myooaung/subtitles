00:01.160 --> 00:02.000
Welcome back.

00:02.030 --> 00:04.640
And in this lesson we're going to loop through objects.

00:04.650 --> 00:07.380
So go ahead and create an object.

00:07.700 --> 00:15.590
So give it some values within this object so maybe we can do the same thing where we had a bunch of

00:15.590 --> 00:20.240
names so we'll call it user names as well.

00:20.250 --> 00:24.510
So just to be consistent with what we did within our array.

00:24.540 --> 00:34.260
So we've got a number of people so we're going to have Person A is going to be Mike person B is going

00:34.260 --> 00:45.550
to be shown and person C is going to be Larry.

00:45.650 --> 00:48.130
So we got our basic object.

00:48.560 --> 00:55.680
So now let's loop through the values that are contained within the object using for.

00:56.080 --> 00:57.580
And just to show you.

00:57.580 --> 01:06.100
So actually let's first refresh the page and we can see that under a user names if we list that out

01:06.580 --> 01:09.870
we don't have any length here.

01:10.090 --> 01:16.660
So like the arrays where we saw a length value we don't have that here within the object.

01:16.660 --> 01:18.100
So just keep that in mind.

01:18.310 --> 01:20.100
So let's loop through.

01:20.170 --> 01:30.430
So set a variable value of x and look through all the usernames.

01:31.430 --> 01:35.840
And now let's let's put the value of x.

01:36.020 --> 01:47.240
So in order to show that together and let's put X so we can take a closer look and see what's actually

01:47.240 --> 01:49.520
happening within our code.

01:49.880 --> 01:51.910
So go back and refreshed.

01:52.040 --> 01:59.840
So we see we've got ABC and I should do a line break there so it's a lot more readable.

01:59.870 --> 02:10.340
So we've got values ABC So they're actually the values and we've got the name and these are the values.

02:10.340 --> 02:14.020
So we're turning back the parent values.

02:14.020 --> 02:15.560
We're getting the names back.

02:15.860 --> 02:21.010
And we know that we can make use of them if we're using user names.

02:21.290 --> 02:27.440
So we know that the object is usernames so if we do usernames x we get undefined.

02:27.470 --> 02:31.670
So we do need to write code around it.

02:31.670 --> 02:36.430
So let's do X in here and let's see if this returns block.

02:36.830 --> 02:41.680
So we need to use this type of format we can't use the dot notation format.

02:41.810 --> 02:48.670
We need to use the bracketed format but we're able to return back to values so we can return back X

02:50.790 --> 02:52.740
saw that we're getting the name.

02:52.740 --> 02:59.520
And we're also getting the value source to equal sign and try that one more time.

02:59.720 --> 03:08.360
So we know that our object A and returns back the value might be returned by John see returns McAleer

03:08.630 --> 03:17.680
and then so we can loop through our object using an array or using a loop.

03:17.690 --> 03:24.110
So for this lesson I've got a really big challenge and why is it really big.

03:24.170 --> 03:26.290
We're going to look at the document.

03:26.300 --> 03:35.600
So what I want you to do now is to open up your editor and loop through all of the properties contained

03:35.660 --> 03:37.230
within the document.

03:37.340 --> 03:39.620
And this is going to be our object.

03:39.680 --> 03:43.930
So we want to output the contents contained within that object.

03:44.090 --> 03:44.910
And that's great.

03:44.910 --> 03:50.070
And so the user names try and document and see what type of output you get.

03:50.210 --> 03:54.680
And we'll work with it as you come back.

03:54.680 --> 04:04.130
So go ahead possibly open up your editor and loop through all of the values contained within the document

04:04.220 --> 04:04.820
object.

04:07.230 --> 04:12.000
So if you have an opportunity to try that and let me show you what the solution is.

04:12.000 --> 04:19.230
So we're going to loop through document so we know that the document object that dorm is a really large

04:19.350 --> 04:20.160
object.

04:20.160 --> 04:22.690
It's got a lot of information in it.

04:23.010 --> 04:30.150
So let's take a closer look and we'll see what we're actually putting for X and then we can also the

04:30.150 --> 04:39.500
same way that we output the values we can output at this type of format as well.

04:39.690 --> 04:42.890
So refresh the page and we'll see what happens.

04:43.260 --> 04:44.040
So there we go.

04:44.040 --> 04:50.280
So we were able to pull back all of this information that's contained within the document.

04:50.520 --> 04:54.430
And I did say there is a lot of information contained within there.

04:54.540 --> 04:57.650
So this gives you a more visual.

04:57.720 --> 05:03.370
And as we loop through the document object we find it all of this information.

05:03.690 --> 05:08.010
So let's say you can quickly loop through and find what's contained within the DOM.
