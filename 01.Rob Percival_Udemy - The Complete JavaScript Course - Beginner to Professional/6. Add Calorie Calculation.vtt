00:01.410 --> 00:08.980
Welcome back in in this lesson we're going to be wrapping up this exercise for our calorie calculator.

00:09.040 --> 00:14.590
So next thing that we want to do is work out the height so we know that we've got age and the height

00:14.590 --> 00:20.050
was a little bit more difficult because we've got a couple of values there so we need to get the value

00:20.050 --> 00:23.240
of feed and we need to multiply that by 12.

00:23.350 --> 00:27.090
And then we need to add it to the value within height inches.

00:27.280 --> 00:32.270
So let's go out and do that and we saw how really Mason Letelier age worked.

00:32.290 --> 00:38.410
So it's simply put that one in here and we're going to update it and we're going to have this one the

00:38.410 --> 00:41.730
first of all we're going to get is height in feet.

00:41.860 --> 00:44.520
So we know we need to multiply this by 12.

00:44.620 --> 00:47.280
So there we go so we multiply it by 12.

00:47.350 --> 00:49.750
And that's going to give us the number of inches.

00:50.050 --> 00:56.760
And we also know we need to add inches to this value.

00:56.830 --> 01:06.160
So simply do that and we're going to do and this one instead of feet will be inches.

01:06.270 --> 01:08.910
So that will give us the over all height.

01:09.060 --> 01:11.280
And then we can do added into our formula.

01:11.280 --> 01:14.310
So we've got next one that we need is weight.

01:14.340 --> 01:17.550
So let's set up wait and wait.

01:17.550 --> 01:26.340
Is we've got that value here so the same way that we did age let's do weight and we can set up weight

01:26.460 --> 01:27.570
in that format.

01:27.600 --> 01:29.420
So you've got weight we've got height.

01:29.460 --> 01:35.750
We've got age and we're ready to make our update and work out our formula.

01:35.880 --> 01:42.380
And I'm going to have one more here that I want to add in as lifestyle so we'll just call it lifestyle

01:44.470 --> 01:54.170
and this one we're going to get the value that's contained within their so it'll be 1 to 5.

01:54.230 --> 01:54.770
So there we go.

01:54.770 --> 01:57.930
So we got all of those parameters that are contained there.

01:57.980 --> 02:02.630
And this one over here because we do have two different formulas.

02:02.660 --> 02:07.820
We're going to do a condition we're going to check to see if it's male that we're going to run one formula

02:08.000 --> 02:08.890
if it's female.

02:08.900 --> 02:10.970
We're going to run the other formula.

02:10.970 --> 02:13.340
So let's let's try that out.

02:13.400 --> 02:16.970
So let's set that up and we're just going to call this one.

02:16.970 --> 02:25.480
This would just be the result and we're going to see if Because remember this is returning back a boolean

02:25.480 --> 02:26.180
value.

02:26.260 --> 02:33.100
So we know that if it's not male then it's going to be female so we can do a tear unary operator actually

02:33.100 --> 02:34.330
for this one.

02:34.420 --> 02:37.650
So let's do this and we have a choice here.

02:37.660 --> 02:45.420
We can punch all of these numbers in to a function so it could set up another function to do that calculation.

02:45.580 --> 02:53.800
Or we could do the whole formula here so let's an optional that we have to work with.

02:53.800 --> 02:57.820
So let's actually let's create a function for those.

02:57.820 --> 03:08.400
So the function first one will be male calculation and so we're going to get all of those values in.

03:08.420 --> 03:10.310
We have to pass everything in.

03:10.340 --> 03:13.290
So this this way actually it turns out a little bit longer.

03:13.310 --> 03:18.490
So maybe what I'll do is keep the formulas directly within this Teron every operator.

03:18.650 --> 03:25.190
So we know that with the terrine area OPERATOR So our first formula just take this one here and pop

03:25.190 --> 03:25.760
it in there.

03:25.880 --> 03:29.860
So we know that if we're getting this result here.

03:29.960 --> 03:37.800
So what we want to do is want to wrap this in brackets and let's clean it up so we know that we we don't

03:37.800 --> 03:44.700
need weights in years in inches so I can get rid of these because these are the same as my variable

03:44.700 --> 03:45.180
names.

03:45.300 --> 03:47.490
So I've got age height and weight.

03:47.520 --> 03:50.220
So those will all fit in nice and neatly.

03:50.220 --> 03:57.300
We need to update this multiplication because with javascript It's the little Asterix it's not the X.

03:57.450 --> 04:03.180
So just make sure that those are all right and we're not equaling up to this so we can get rid of that.

04:03.290 --> 04:05.030
We're equaling up to the result.

04:05.160 --> 04:09.910
And the only other thing that we want to add in is the value of life style.

04:09.960 --> 04:11.800
So it's art and lifestyle.

04:11.820 --> 04:14.270
And we're going to multiply it by.

04:14.460 --> 04:18.570
So right now for this exercise let's set up lifestyle.

04:18.570 --> 04:26.310
We're just going to equal it to the value that we're picking up times 0.2.

04:26.350 --> 04:30.700
We'll wrap it in rounded brackets and then we're going to add 1 to it.

04:30.700 --> 04:39.220
So this is approximately the ratio that we had incrementing by point 2 depending on how active the person

04:39.280 --> 04:39.680
is

04:42.600 --> 04:46.560
and with the Terran area operators so we need the alternative.

04:46.560 --> 04:51.720
So we know that this one was a formula for males.

04:51.720 --> 04:57.860
So if it's a male then it runs this formula and this is the formula let me double check.

04:57.990 --> 05:02.640
So the second one was the second one was for women.

05:02.790 --> 05:07.340
So just making sure that I'm getting the right formulas in the right order here.

05:08.010 --> 05:12.780
So this one is for women and we've got to do the same thing where we need to clean this up a little

05:12.780 --> 05:13.220
bit.

05:14.390 --> 05:17.730
So let's wrap it in another bracket here.

05:17.900 --> 05:24.870
Let's get rid of the excess wording here that we don't need because we already have the variables the

05:24.880 --> 05:26.000
same format.

05:26.140 --> 05:34.990
And let's update these strict says is multiplication X's two asterisks so that they work within javascript.

05:34.990 --> 05:41.110
I have to do a beautify and just to make sure that it's working and we'll put result in here.

05:41.110 --> 05:48.370
And before we go ahead we still need to update this as negatives there and just make sure that if we

05:48.370 --> 05:55.210
have any other ones some of these characters they don't immediately translate over so I'm just double

05:55.210 --> 05:59.680
checking to make sure that I don't have any problems with some of the characters so that they're not

05:59.680 --> 06:06.670
actually plus minus and they're not actually javascript mathematical symbols so now I think we're ready

06:06.670 --> 06:07.650
to try that out.

06:09.110 --> 06:10.660
So let's go out refresh.

06:10.730 --> 06:16.310
And we can see that now whenever we make some adjustments we see that the values are changing.

06:16.310 --> 06:17.730
We've got a value for mail.

06:17.750 --> 06:20.160
We've got a value for female.

06:20.180 --> 06:24.200
We update the age then we see that those values are also updating.

06:24.320 --> 06:31.610
So we've got all of the calorie intake it's all in all of the calculations and we're ready to add in

06:31.610 --> 06:33.170
some more to the formula.

06:33.170 --> 06:41.120
So we know that with the result we need to actually around this and this is where are going to use javascript

06:41.180 --> 06:46.660
math in order to round the result and that will clean that up a little bit.

06:47.790 --> 06:49.700
So out in that second bracket.

06:51.070 --> 06:54.130
And let's clean this up go back to refresh.

06:54.310 --> 06:55.640
Try it out again.

06:56.110 --> 07:00.130
So I got rid of all those decimal places because we don't need those we just want have a nice clean

07:00.190 --> 07:00.870
output.

07:00.880 --> 07:06.600
So this is basically the amount of calories that a person should have if they're really active then

07:06.600 --> 07:08.170
they need actually more calories.

07:08.200 --> 07:11.010
So everything looks like it's working properly.

07:11.110 --> 07:15.220
And the last and final step is to output it for the users.

07:15.220 --> 07:20.280
So we've seen this before earlier that before were outputting here to output.

07:20.410 --> 07:28.750
So let's go out and use that same input same element there and let's do documents you can go out and

07:28.750 --> 07:35.790
pause the video and finish this up where we're actually outputting the result seeing something like

07:35.800 --> 07:42.060
this is the number of calories you need per day and outputting it with in that output area.

07:42.070 --> 07:47.980
So go ahead and add that in I'll show you the conclusion coming up slurper to conclude the video get

07:47.980 --> 07:50.650
element by id output.

07:50.870 --> 07:59.420
And we know that we want to set the H to a male and we want a result of math around result.

07:59.420 --> 08:04.700
So what you put there and we can add in some more information like

08:08.400 --> 08:12.020
calories calories needed per day.

08:16.140 --> 08:19.170
So there we are so let's try that out and refresh.

08:19.200 --> 08:29.130
So let's see that if you weigh 150 pounds and if you're a male and you're six foot six you need 2141

08:29.130 --> 08:32.300
calories if you're younger.

08:32.850 --> 08:38.190
You need 2100 97 if you're more active you need more calories.

08:38.310 --> 08:45.570
If you weigh more than you need more calories and I believe that this calculation actually is to maintain

08:45.570 --> 08:46.660
your weight.

08:46.680 --> 08:51.010
So if you want to lose weight then you would go underneath those calories.

08:51.090 --> 08:54.070
Obviously we don't have too many people that are 10 feet high.

08:54.180 --> 09:00.870
So you could make that into the H2 model where you can check maximums and minimums and you can also

09:00.960 --> 09:03.410
add that into your function here in your javascript.

09:03.570 --> 09:10.380
So you can use javascript to make sure that the range is between a specific range and if it's outside

09:10.380 --> 09:16.070
of the range then we can do a check here a conditional check and update those values.

09:17.920 --> 09:23.620
So now it's up to you to take what you've learned in this exercise and then the previous exercise and

09:23.620 --> 09:32.010
make some updates and make this simple calorie counting application on your own.
