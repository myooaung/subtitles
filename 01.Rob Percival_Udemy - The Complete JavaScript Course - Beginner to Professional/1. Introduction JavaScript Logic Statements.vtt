00:00.970 --> 00:04.470
Are you ready for a logic statements in javascript.

00:04.470 --> 00:08.700
This is where logic allows you to make decisions within your code.

00:08.700 --> 00:14.820
You can apply logic and take the next step and allow that code to determine what's going to get rendered

00:14.820 --> 00:15.280
out.

00:15.300 --> 00:18.080
So which block of code gets rendered next.

00:18.300 --> 00:23.960
And in this section we're going to look at the Teron ary OPERATOR So we've seen this before earlier.

00:24.090 --> 00:29.160
And we're going to go into more detail how it works and how you can apply it within your javascript

00:29.370 --> 00:31.650
in order to start applying logic.

00:31.650 --> 00:38.130
So basically it allows you to ask a question and see if that condition is true or false if it's true

00:38.310 --> 00:39.720
then apply one value.

00:39.720 --> 00:48.330
If it's false then apply that other value so allows you to apply two different sets of values to a condition.

00:48.480 --> 00:54.300
And we can basically check to see if something is true or false and then have a result depending on

00:54.300 --> 00:54.810
that.

00:55.020 --> 01:01.350
There's our very quick short format in order to do conditional checks and apply that logic and that's

01:01.350 --> 01:03.240
what ternary operators are all about.

01:03.240 --> 01:09.450
They allow you that really easy shorthand method to apply some quick logic and get a response.

01:09.450 --> 01:15.180
There's also the if statement so the if statement allows you to really build out that logic and execute

01:15.450 --> 01:19.610
a block of code depending on what the result of that logic is.

01:19.770 --> 01:23.000
And logic is really important when it comes to programming.

01:23.130 --> 01:29.460
Because this is what programming is all about making those decisions and rendering out code depending

01:29.460 --> 01:33.210
on what the outcome is of that decision.

01:33.210 --> 01:41.190
There's also that if else statement so else provides you an alternative ending to your condition.

01:41.190 --> 01:47.460
So if it's true it's going to do something and else provide you that opportunity to do something else.

01:47.580 --> 01:49.130
And then there's the else if.

01:49.170 --> 01:55.440
So you can ask another condition see if that one is true and then you could ask as many else if you

01:55.440 --> 01:56.860
want into.

01:56.880 --> 02:01.280
You run out of LCS and then you end up with that else.

02:01.320 --> 02:08.340
So basically it allows you to ask a bunch to apply check if a bunch of conditions are true and if they're

02:08.340 --> 02:13.710
not true then you can do something and render that within your javascript.

02:13.770 --> 02:17.820
And there's a lot of power behind what you can do with conditional statements.

02:17.820 --> 02:20.490
We're also going to look at the switch statement.

02:20.520 --> 02:22.990
So the switch statement is an alternative.

02:23.070 --> 02:28.650
Instead of writing a bunch of if elses You can write the switch statement which gives you the ability

02:28.830 --> 02:36.030
to ask and see if a case is true and if it's true then you execute a block of code and you can go down

02:36.120 --> 02:41.540
the road have a number of different cases that you can compare and you can see if they come out true.

02:41.670 --> 02:46.670
And just like that if else statement you can apply alternative.

02:46.860 --> 02:49.130
If none of the cases are true.

02:49.320 --> 02:55.890
So this is great for creating different applications and you can apply these different conditional statements

02:56.130 --> 02:58.040
depending on the application you're building.

02:58.170 --> 03:04.290
And I'm going to show you two really good examples of what you can build using a simple conditional

03:04.290 --> 03:05.080
statement.

03:05.280 --> 03:08.440
So if we have a twin costs we throw it up in the air.

03:08.540 --> 03:10.880
It's going to land either heads or tails.

03:11.010 --> 03:13.250
And this is comparable to boolean.

03:13.290 --> 03:15.090
So it's either true or false.

03:15.180 --> 03:20.520
It can't be anything else and it's going to turn out to be one of those values and we're going to be

03:20.520 --> 03:28.380
building out a twin cost simulation within this section as well in order to simulate tossing a coin

03:28.410 --> 03:30.310
and getting a return value.

03:30.420 --> 03:36.810
So something is going to happen and we're going to either end up with heads or tails in this application.

03:36.810 --> 03:43.560
Then there's also another exercise in this course and we've packed it full of all kinds of exercises

03:43.830 --> 03:49.910
so you can see the code in action and we're going to show you how to build a magic 8 ball.

03:49.920 --> 03:56.310
It's going to be able to answer your questions and it's up to you to determine how javascript knows

03:56.340 --> 03:58.730
what you're thinking within the magic 8 ball.

03:58.800 --> 04:01.450
Where are you going to be building this application from scratch.

04:01.560 --> 04:06.630
And this is where we're going to show you how the switch statement works and how you could apply switch

04:06.630 --> 04:10.240
statements within your coding to really make things happen.

04:10.320 --> 04:17.060
Both of these exercises are designed to get you coding to apply that coding that we're showing you within

04:17.070 --> 04:17.900
the lesson.

04:18.150 --> 04:25.200
So do try it out and do practice work alongside the lessons in order to build out these applications

04:25.440 --> 04:31.890
and get familiar with logic statements because they're super important building block to coding and

04:31.890 --> 04:37.140
it's going to become really important in the latter part of the course as we build out more complex

04:37.140 --> 04:38.280
applications.
