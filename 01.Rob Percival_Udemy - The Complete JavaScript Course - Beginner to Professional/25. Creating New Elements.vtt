00:00.660 --> 00:06.210
Welcome back in in the previous lesson we built out a list of friends we can vote on those friends and

00:06.270 --> 00:09.950
we can see that we've got a list that's coming out of an array.

00:09.960 --> 00:16.770
So in this lesson what I wanted to do is I actually want to update our Tamal and do that dynamically

00:16.800 --> 00:18.330
via javascript.

00:18.360 --> 00:24.930
So first thing that we need to do is we need to create an input field and a button to be clicked and

00:24.990 --> 00:26.160
using that.

00:26.160 --> 00:31.030
So we're just going to create a div to wrap around it and then we'll do our input.

00:31.220 --> 00:38.230
So type and just make this a text field and we're going to give this one an ID

00:41.250 --> 00:47.400
so we'll give it an ID of a friend.

00:47.400 --> 00:53.600
So basically this is going to be our field where we can add a new friend into our list.

00:53.640 --> 00:57.320
So the thing that we need is a way to actually submit the button.

00:57.390 --> 01:05.580
So we'll do another input and this time the type will be button and adding and clicking that button

01:05.760 --> 01:09.810
will add a new value into the end of our list here.

01:09.810 --> 01:15.630
So visually as well as into our array you all are using javascript.

01:15.660 --> 01:23.410
So let's set up this button and we're going to give this one an ID so that we can simply access.

01:23.610 --> 01:28.990
So it will have an idea of add new and let's add a value here.

01:29.070 --> 01:35.540
So this will be friend so go ahead and save that.

01:35.690 --> 01:37.310
Go out and refresh it.

01:37.310 --> 01:42.860
So now we've got our spot here where we can add new people to the array.

01:42.860 --> 01:44.800
So we need to make some hookups first.

01:44.840 --> 01:50.780
And one of the first things that we need to do is hook up the ability for this button to become clickable.

01:50.840 --> 01:56.390
And so we can pick up that button click and actually do something.

01:56.410 --> 02:05.050
So go ahead and pause the video and set that up grab that button and add a click event within the javascript

02:05.350 --> 02:06.460
and I'll show you how to do that.

02:06.460 --> 02:07.930
Coming up as well.

02:07.930 --> 02:10.950
So we had the opportunity to set that up.

02:11.020 --> 02:16.560
And so what we want to do whenever we click this button we want to fire off a function.

02:16.690 --> 02:17.790
So let's set that up.

02:17.790 --> 02:23.020
Now so first of all let's grab that element so we can make use of that.

02:23.030 --> 02:24.460
So that's the add new.

02:24.500 --> 02:31.790
So we'll just call it new as well and we'll use document and get element by id and then here we just

02:31.790 --> 02:33.800
need to identify that element.

02:33.800 --> 02:40.670
So that way we hooked up went to the new object within our script and we're all ready to make our event

02:40.670 --> 02:41.420
object.

02:41.420 --> 02:50.060
So let's grab a new and do the on click event to it.

02:50.300 --> 02:54.200
And what we want to do is we want to fire off a function.

02:54.200 --> 02:59.720
So let's set this up and we're going to just do an anonymous function.

02:59.720 --> 03:01.330
So we're not going to have any name for it.

03:01.350 --> 03:07.700
And we can continue to build out all the functionality that we need within this function over here.

03:08.540 --> 03:12.520
So what do we need to do within this function in order to make this happen.

03:12.530 --> 03:15.980
So we need to pick up the value from input.

03:16.160 --> 03:18.030
So that's the first thing that we need to do.

03:18.050 --> 03:19.550
Next thing we need to do.

03:19.780 --> 03:32.180
Add it to the array and then also we need to add it to the H.T. MLM and once we do that then we're all

03:32.180 --> 03:33.000
ready to go.

03:33.000 --> 03:39.110
And these are the three functions that we need to add in within this function to handle when this event

03:39.110 --> 03:40.190
gets clicked.

03:40.190 --> 03:42.080
So let's start with the first one.

03:42.140 --> 03:42.860
So go ahead.

03:42.860 --> 03:51.550
Pause the video and create a variable to pick up the input that's contained within this element within

03:51.610 --> 03:52.830
this input field.

03:52.870 --> 03:54.670
So the friend input field

03:58.660 --> 04:06.740
so I'm going to create a placeholder here and I'm just going to use the variable Q And then down here

04:06.860 --> 04:13.060
when I actually are going to set that up as a local variable within this function.

04:13.100 --> 04:17.900
So we don't need to do it globally and always whenever you can do it locally try to do it locally.

04:17.900 --> 04:18.950
So lets up.

04:18.950 --> 04:20.360
Q And within.

04:20.360 --> 04:28.190
Q We're going to hold documents and we're going to do get element by id and we're going to select that

04:28.190 --> 04:34.830
value that's contained within the ad friend.

04:35.620 --> 04:41.540
So with that ad friend object that ad front element we want to pick up the value.

04:41.620 --> 04:43.210
So that's what we want to do here.

04:43.270 --> 04:48.580
So that solves our first item that we need to do within this function.

04:48.580 --> 04:52.290
So the next part is that we need to add it to the array.

04:52.450 --> 04:59.650
So again if you could pause the video and add this brand new value into the my array and we saw how

04:59.650 --> 05:07.570
to do this earlier when we were building arrays so I show you the solution in order to add it to the

05:07.570 --> 05:14.260
erate So you specify the array name and we do push and what pushes going to do is that's going to add

05:14.320 --> 05:17.780
whatever value we've got here within the rounded brackets.

05:17.890 --> 05:20.520
And that's going to add that into the array.

05:20.590 --> 05:30.110
So now comes the interesting part when we actually connect with the Dom and we update our h t m l so

05:30.110 --> 05:34.510
we're going to use a builtin method that's available within Javascript.

05:34.520 --> 05:41.690
So let's first of all we need to create our element so we're going to just create a t r so using the

05:42.650 --> 05:43.140
format.

05:43.160 --> 05:46.580
And we're going to use the method create element.

05:46.850 --> 05:54.020
So this basically allows us to create an alarm element using javascript and element that we're creating

05:54.080 --> 05:55.740
is a TR.

05:56.690 --> 06:05.750
So the next thing that we need to do is create a TV so that would be our element where we can actually

06:05.750 --> 06:08.150
hold the values.

06:08.660 --> 06:09.710
So the table cell.

06:09.710 --> 06:15.190
So again we're going to use create element and we're going to go ahead and create a team element.

06:15.470 --> 06:18.040
So now we've created two elements.

06:18.050 --> 06:23.030
And what we want to do is we want to append that Tedi into the TR.

06:23.120 --> 06:30.350
So the way to do that is use TR and the method append child.

06:30.380 --> 06:39.280
So we're basically adding a child into the TR element and the child that we're adding is TV.

06:39.440 --> 06:44.430
So this is going to give us a brain you roll with T.D. added into it.

06:44.630 --> 06:52.860
So next thing that we need to do is we need to actually add in we need to add this roll into the H Tim

06:52.940 --> 06:56.460
L and before we do that I want to still append.

06:56.570 --> 06:58.880
So I want to create.

06:58.880 --> 07:08.410
So this will be my t d text and within here this is where I actually going to create a text note.

07:08.510 --> 07:12.280
So this one is create or it should be document.

07:12.290 --> 07:14.440
We always need to start out with document.

07:14.650 --> 07:22.970
So document and create So we've got a number of options here and what we're creating is a tax code.

07:23.390 --> 07:29.810
So basically this is what we can use in order to create that text that's going to be sitting in side

07:29.810 --> 07:31.610
of the field.

07:31.610 --> 07:34.380
So first of all we know that we should create a number.

07:34.490 --> 07:35.530
So let's just start.

07:35.600 --> 07:41.570
And we're going to create 10 so we're going to update this to be more dynamic later on.

07:41.660 --> 07:47.330
But for now let's just work on getting that element here and we're going to be adding it to the bottom

07:47.390 --> 07:50.990
of our element our element table here.

07:50.990 --> 07:58.010
So the next challenge is to actually traverse over into the dorm and find out where our table is located

07:58.040 --> 08:03.680
because we need to attach this element that we've newly created and we've added in some value into the

08:03.680 --> 08:04.530
T.D..

08:04.550 --> 08:08.360
So actually we need to still append that child.

08:08.390 --> 08:15.710
So let's just go back and we'll do in appending of that text information so to the TV and we're going

08:15.710 --> 08:23.660
to pinned a child into there and the child that we're appending is that t text.

08:23.820 --> 08:26.410
So now we should be ready to add that element.

08:26.550 --> 08:30.240
And the next step is that we need to attach to the table.

08:30.330 --> 08:37.460
So let's create and let's create a variable and we'll just call it that container.

08:37.740 --> 08:43.180
And this is where we're going to have to locate where the table is located.

08:43.290 --> 08:47.050
So we're going to do a query selector

08:50.520 --> 08:57.120
so using query selector and we need to actually find out where this table is located.

08:57.120 --> 09:04.050
So we've got a few hints that we know that it's within output and we know that there's a table element

09:04.140 --> 09:05.540
within output.

09:05.670 --> 09:09.690
So let's let's add let's console log this out.

09:09.840 --> 09:13.190
So a log out the two values that we have so far.

09:13.200 --> 09:17.250
So do console directory and we'll output out container

09:22.190 --> 09:24.520
so output the value of container

09:27.710 --> 09:33.680
and then also we wanted to output the value of that newly created element to the TR.

09:33.770 --> 09:35.890
So we're going to output that one as well.

09:36.110 --> 09:42.590
So we can take a closer look at the one we created and where we're actually going to deposit.

09:42.590 --> 09:45.060
So let's go back and refresh it.

09:45.940 --> 09:51.430
And now let's just type something in here and do test so we can see that we've got our table.

09:51.430 --> 09:57.640
So we've selected the right table and we've got our TR And we've got a child in there so we've got one

09:57.640 --> 10:02.470
child in there a TV and that TV contains some text.

10:02.500 --> 10:04.240
Got to go all the way down to the bottom.

10:04.360 --> 10:06.670
So we've got our text content is 10.

10:06.910 --> 10:12.130
So ultimately we're still going to have to create two more cells and I'll show you how to do that upcoming

10:12.130 --> 10:13.090
as well.

10:13.180 --> 10:16.330
But for now we've got all of the information ready.

10:16.360 --> 10:29.090
And now what we need to do is append the TV TR into the TV Cell So going by what we've just done here

10:29.120 --> 10:33.920
where we've created an element and besides creating the element we see once we've created that element

10:34.190 --> 10:40.360
we can actually also grab an element and we can append information into those elements.

10:40.520 --> 10:50.470
So what I want you to do now is add in the new table row that we've created the TR value into the container.

10:50.570 --> 10:53.590
So pause the video and try that out.

10:53.660 --> 10:58.580
So notice that the structure is the same that when we do list this information out.

10:58.580 --> 11:06.440
So if I listed out here so the table we get we get it as an object and the TR we get within that same

11:06.440 --> 11:08.020
type of object format.

11:08.210 --> 11:14.860
So we know that when we created a T.D. we could add it into the T by using a pen child.

11:14.990 --> 11:15.670
So go ahead.

11:15.670 --> 11:20.030
Pause the video and try it out and I'll show you the solution coming up.

11:20.030 --> 11:26.150
So if you had an opportunity to try that out and the solution to it is following that same format where

11:26.150 --> 11:31.390
we can append a child and we're going to append TR into that container.

11:31.490 --> 11:33.550
So let's go out and refresh.

11:33.860 --> 11:39.800
And so let's type in a value there so we typed in test and there we go so we see that we are able to

11:40.070 --> 11:42.560
append an item there.

11:42.770 --> 11:49.760
And now the next thing that we need to do is we need to finish this off and we need to add in the other

11:49.760 --> 11:51.160
elements as well.

11:51.810 --> 11:58.680
And we also need to make this dynamic so we know that this number here is related to how many items

11:58.680 --> 12:00.990
we had within our array originally.

12:01.170 --> 12:07.300
And as we push more content into the array This is always going to dynamically change.

12:07.440 --> 12:12.620
So we can use the length of the array to determine what this number is going to be.

12:12.630 --> 12:18.570
We know that the ADD friend value is going to be the second column and the third column is going to

12:18.570 --> 12:20.200
start at zero.

12:20.430 --> 12:27.000
So go ahead and make those updates and pause the video and I'll show you the solution coming up.

12:27.000 --> 12:32.210
So what we want is this right now we're typing and test when we hit add friend.

12:32.220 --> 12:36.490
It should go here at the bottom of the list.

12:36.500 --> 12:42.400
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to shorten some of this because we do have quite a bit of stuff

12:42.400 --> 12:43.400
going on here.

12:43.540 --> 12:49.510
And I can shorten it by doing this so I don't have to have as many variables in there because we're

12:49.510 --> 12:52.240
going to be actually doing quite a bit here.

12:52.270 --> 12:57.840
So that's the first thing that we want to do is we want to append that Tee-Tee.

12:57.840 --> 13:00.180
So we want to spend it with the text node

13:03.030 --> 13:08.000
and this value is related to the length of my array.

13:08.160 --> 13:12.410
So know if we get that in my array length right now it's going to be 9.

13:12.450 --> 13:14.190
We want it to show up as 10.

13:14.310 --> 13:16.330
So we need to add 1 to that.

13:16.470 --> 13:18.480
So let's go ahead and try that out.

13:18.660 --> 13:23.640
And just to make sure I actually going to get rid of some of these items here in the array just to make

13:23.640 --> 13:25.840
it simpler so we can see it on one page.

13:25.890 --> 13:27.690
Go back out and refresh it.

13:27.690 --> 13:29.220
So now let me add a friend.

13:29.280 --> 13:34.650
So now we're getting six so we know that because what's happened here is we're already pushing it into

13:34.650 --> 13:35.440
the array.

13:35.520 --> 13:36.460
So there is a choice.

13:36.480 --> 13:40.610
We can move it down here at the bottom and push it into the race at that point.

13:40.620 --> 13:42.290
So that's what happened there.

13:42.390 --> 13:48.730
So let's go back and refresh it and make sure that the next value is going to be 5.

13:49.080 --> 13:56.730
So we saw how we could create that cell and now we need to create one that contains the text node of

13:56.790 --> 13:59.450
the name of the information that we've set up there.

13:59.460 --> 14:06.690
So I want you again to pause the video and instead of just adding that one I want you to do that same

14:06.690 --> 14:11.930
format that we've done over here and create another table cell.

14:12.180 --> 14:16.030
So we've already used TDD and we've already attached it.

14:16.200 --> 14:27.420
So let's do TV again and this time we're going to create another brand new brand new TV.

14:27.600 --> 14:35.280
And this time instead of attaching the text note of this let's delete that out and we want to attach

14:35.490 --> 14:39.450
the brand new value of q that we've picked up here.

14:39.990 --> 14:48.160
And then also we need to append it into our TR so we can do that as we've just created it.

14:48.180 --> 14:50.040
We can append that to TR.

14:50.160 --> 14:52.890
So going backwards and do it that way.

14:52.890 --> 14:57.460
So go back and refreshed and let's try this again.

14:57.480 --> 15:00.630
So now when we hit add friend there we go.

15:00.630 --> 15:07.170
So we're able to add that test value and then so we need to do one more where we need to add the value

15:07.230 --> 15:08.340
of 0.

15:08.430 --> 15:10.720
So let's try that as well.

15:12.240 --> 15:17.650
And I can get rid of these console logs because we're not going to making use of those right now either.

15:17.760 --> 15:23.790
So we've got one more that we need to do and we can literally copy out that same format that we had

15:23.790 --> 15:27.110
here and just paste it in again.

15:27.150 --> 15:31.460
And lastly for this one the value is simply going to be just 0.

15:31.710 --> 15:35.460
So let's go ahead refresh our page and try it out.

15:35.460 --> 15:39.160
So hopefully now I should add in all of those values.

15:39.300 --> 15:44.320
And the one thing that we noticed that we don't have the right attributes yet to it.

15:44.460 --> 15:46.580
So that's the next thing that we need to do.

15:46.620 --> 15:51.540
We need to add in the ability to make a clickable and update and so on.

15:51.540 --> 15:57.310
So we know that when ever we go over to the array that array holds all of those values.
