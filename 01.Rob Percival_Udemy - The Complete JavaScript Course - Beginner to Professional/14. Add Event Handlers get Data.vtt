00:00.640 --> 00:06.040
Welcome back in in this lesson we're going to use some javascript in order to create our shopping cart

00:06.290 --> 00:09.580
from the items that were outputting from the last lesson.

00:09.790 --> 00:12.170
So we saw that we can output some items.

00:12.170 --> 00:17.920
I'm going to put a space in there and also what I want it to do is I want to add a little bit more styling

00:17.920 --> 00:21.610
so I know I've got this class of product items.

00:21.730 --> 00:27.970
So let's go up over to our CSSA and let's do some quick styling for here.

00:27.970 --> 00:34.810
So what I wanted to do is I want to turn this more into a button type format so let's do that quickly

00:34.940 --> 00:36.820
solid and black.

00:36.970 --> 00:38.510
So give it a button line.

00:38.530 --> 00:41.380
I'm going to get rid of the text decoration.

00:41.380 --> 00:44.860
So that is going to get rid of the underline.

00:45.010 --> 00:46.710
So set that to none.

00:46.900 --> 00:51.670
Let's give it a background color so the background color is is green.

00:51.810 --> 00:54.550
So nice green buttons clickable buttons.

00:54.760 --> 00:56.540
Click color.

00:56.840 --> 01:00.150
So maybe the color can be this color.

01:00.500 --> 01:04.570
So it doesn't really matter because they're just trying to demonstrate.

01:04.960 --> 01:06.270
So just so it floats.

01:06.330 --> 01:07.800
Oh puts a little bit better.

01:07.930 --> 01:12.620
And most of the Course most of this lesson I do want to focus on the Javascript.

01:12.820 --> 01:21.350
So let's do a quick refresh and we've got some buttons and I think some padding would help as well.

01:21.370 --> 01:25.910
So we add in just a little bit of padding around those buttons.

01:25.990 --> 01:28.720
So now go back and refresh it.

01:28.720 --> 01:32.620
So now we've got some padding around that button and we're all ready to go.

01:32.620 --> 01:38.930
So next thing that we want to do is we want to make these buttons clickable so something to happen whenever

01:38.950 --> 01:40.500
these buttons get clicked.

01:40.510 --> 01:46.210
So we already do have hyperlinks but we know that with the hyperlinks alone it's not going to really

01:46.210 --> 01:46.780
do anything.

01:46.780 --> 01:48.880
So we need to add event listeners.

01:48.940 --> 01:55.150
So this is the next step is to make these buttons clickable and then we're going to pick up the information

01:55.150 --> 01:57.840
contained within the data attributes.

01:57.940 --> 02:02.410
So no as we're looping through it once we add that HMO.

02:02.500 --> 02:08.750
So basically what we should do is we should set up an initiate.

02:09.220 --> 02:14.350
So whenever the page loads that's when we can build that.

02:14.380 --> 02:16.230
So do window on load.

02:16.270 --> 02:18.290
And what do I in I.T..

02:18.370 --> 02:21.140
And then we're going to wrap all of this in a function.

02:21.160 --> 02:22.480
I N I T.

02:23.080 --> 02:28.660
So that whenever the page loads then we know that we can take care we can handle all this.

02:28.660 --> 02:33.820
So basically this is actually going to be the build so just call it function build

02:37.380 --> 02:44.390
items and then within here so this is where we're actually going to build all of those items into the

02:44.390 --> 02:45.340
HMO.

02:45.550 --> 02:48.860
So let's let's just set that up as separate functions.

02:48.940 --> 02:55.090
So when we launch or I NIIT first thing we want to do is build our items and then the next thing that

02:55.090 --> 03:02.010
we want to do is we want to set up our our Make these are clickable.

03:02.230 --> 03:05.790
So I know that we've just added them here within the team Mel.

03:05.800 --> 03:11.860
So the next step is we could add in an on click event to them.

03:11.860 --> 03:16.070
So basically on click and going into a function on click.

03:16.180 --> 03:20.140
So that would probably be one of the easiest ways to do that.

03:20.140 --> 03:26.810
The other thing that we can do is that we can attach event listeners.

03:26.910 --> 03:28.430
So maybe we're going to do that.

03:28.470 --> 03:33.090
So let's do a loop and we'll loop through.

03:33.270 --> 03:37.260
So first of all we need to do get queries selector.

03:37.260 --> 03:38.190
So we'll just do.

03:38.200 --> 03:45.270
Q And this one is documents get elements where I actually we're going to do queries Selectric just to

03:45.270 --> 03:46.320
be different.

03:46.560 --> 03:52.970
We could get the elements by class name as well so let's do queery selector.

03:53.000 --> 04:04.670
All because we want to pick up all of the elements with the class so the class that product item class.

04:04.770 --> 04:07.640
So it's pick that up and now we need to loop through it.

04:07.650 --> 04:09.060
So set up

04:12.530 --> 04:19.440
and I'm going to pull this x value out here so that it's it's a local variable within that function.

04:19.580 --> 04:29.540
So that I can use X against variable x equals zero and we're going to loop while the value of Q length

04:30.350 --> 04:32.860
while X is less than the value of Q length.

04:33.020 --> 04:39.650
And we're going to increment X so there is or loop and next thing that we need to do is add an event

04:39.650 --> 04:40.160
handler.

04:40.160 --> 04:42.910
So we've got Hugh X..

04:42.980 --> 04:51.620
So for the item event listener and the listener that we want is a click and we're just going to do the

04:51.620 --> 04:52.780
function here.

04:52.910 --> 04:59.210
So whenever it gets clicked it passes over the event information and then let's make some use from it.

04:59.360 --> 05:05.420
So the first thing that I want to do because we did set these as hyperlinks is we need a way to actually

05:05.420 --> 05:07.510
disable the hyperlinking.

05:07.560 --> 05:12.460
So one of the earlier lessons we did show you one of the methods in order to do that.

05:12.470 --> 05:19.880
So what I want you to do is pause the video and add in a way in order to prevent the default action

05:19.970 --> 05:22.370
of the hyperlink from firing off.

05:22.370 --> 05:29.850
So go ahead and add that in and I'll show you the solution so the solution is to take that event object

05:30.330 --> 05:37.770
and pass in the method prevent default so basically that cancels the event out.

05:37.770 --> 05:42.090
So now all of these clicks all of these links are no longer going to go anywhere.

05:42.090 --> 05:43.410
They're not going to do anything.

05:43.470 --> 05:45.660
And that's exactly what we want to happen.

05:45.840 --> 05:51.930
And instead we want to add in a function so let's call it add to cart.

05:51.930 --> 06:03.340
And here we can pass over we can simply launch the function and the next thing that we need to do so

06:03.340 --> 06:07.590
that we can test to make sure that everything is working.

06:07.660 --> 06:19.170
So to cart and remember we're going to pick up that information from the the surrounding attributes

06:19.170 --> 06:22.350
here whenever the hyperlink gets clicked.

06:22.350 --> 06:26.670
So we're going to be able to use that and pick up the information.

06:26.670 --> 06:30.180
So if we do a console log and if we

06:33.190 --> 06:34.210
do events

06:36.590 --> 06:46.080
target so event target passes that information and if we want specific we look at data so we can look

06:46.080 --> 06:47.210
at the data set.

06:47.460 --> 06:54.210
So I think we are ready to do one more quick look through and then we should be ready to try that within

06:54.270 --> 06:55.490
our Web page.

06:55.530 --> 06:59.890
So go ahead save that and go out to your web page refresh it.

06:59.910 --> 07:04.620
And now whenever we click we see that we are picking up that information.

07:04.620 --> 07:12.210
So we're actually picking up that data that data set value so it's sort getting rate to the ID name

07:12.240 --> 07:14.430
price and the value.

07:14.520 --> 07:18.350
So we're able to pick up all of that information sitting in that hyperlink.

07:18.570 --> 07:27.010
And now we can actually use this information to actually add items into our shopping cart so ready to

07:27.070 --> 07:34.240
start adding these items because you can pick them up within this add to cart and we can simply add

07:34.240 --> 07:35.750
them into our cart.

07:35.890 --> 07:39.610
So that's going to be the next part of coming up in the next lesson.

07:39.740 --> 07:42.230
We're going to start adding items into the cart.

07:42.280 --> 07:50.770
So what I want you to do now is practice developing building out these dynamic hyperlinks that you can

07:50.770 --> 07:56.820
set event listeners to and then pick up the attribute information when they get clicked.

07:56.830 --> 08:00.710
So go ahead and try that out in the next lesson.

08:00.730 --> 08:08.980
We're going to be looking at how we can store this information back into the storage and make use of

08:08.980 --> 08:12.160
it whenever the user comes back and loads to the page.

08:12.160 --> 08:13.980
So I'm going to be showing you that coming up.
