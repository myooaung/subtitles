We saw earlier how much power the dorm possesses and this section we're going to be looking at even

00:06.300 --> 00:11.030
more we can do with the dorm actually making our content dynamic.

00:11.040 --> 00:17.700
So depending on the content and the responses and event handlers that were triggering within the web

00:17.700 --> 00:20.040
page we can do even more.

00:20.160 --> 00:25.770
And just getting access to information simply contained within that dorm.

00:25.890 --> 00:32.580
So I'm going to show you even more ways to select elements better select elements Querrey selector Querrey

00:32.580 --> 00:39.450
select are all and a whole bunch more how to traverse through the dorm really to be able to fine tune

00:39.450 --> 00:45.510
that selection process and get those elements that you need in order to make things happen within the

00:45.510 --> 00:46.290
web page.

00:46.350 --> 00:53.280
And again that Dom is one of my favorite aspects of of using javascript because there's just so much

00:53.280 --> 00:59.030
you can do and you can create really amazing experiences for your web users.

00:59.040 --> 01:04.740
We're also going to be built focusing on building several exercises within this section.

01:04.770 --> 01:09.090
So one of the exercises is going to be a dynamic element selector.

01:09.150 --> 01:14.980
So we're going to be able to select elements information from an input field and a whole bunch more.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.430
Also how to build a pop up.

01:17.520 --> 01:24.310
So essentially a modal pop up window above the rest of your content using just javascript.

01:24.450 --> 01:31.230
And then also how to build a web component where we can do in a Curti and style component that depending

01:31.230 --> 01:37.940
on if you click the heading it will hide and it will show different pieces of content that's hidden.

01:37.940 --> 01:44.880
So an accordion style component all via javascript and we're also going to create interactive voting

01:44.940 --> 01:45.900
system.

01:45.900 --> 01:52.680
So a friend list voting system where we can add friends to the list we can vote and we can have a separate

01:52.680 --> 01:54.220
count for each friend.

01:54.330 --> 02:00.300
And this is all created dynamically so creating dynamic elements and adding to your list.

02:00.300 --> 02:03.660
We're also going to show you how you can build out a shopping list.

02:03.660 --> 02:10.050
Track your mouse coordinates depending on the event and apart particular element interaction with that

02:10.050 --> 02:17.700
element and being able to track where your mouse is coming in and what the x and y coordinates are of

02:17.700 --> 02:20.440
the mouse at the time when it's on top of the element.

02:20.580 --> 02:26.710
And we're also going to be building out a dynamic list that can be edited and also deleted.

02:26.760 --> 02:34.380
So deleting all of that dot deleting elements and also adding brand new elements into your web page.

02:34.380 --> 02:37.630
So all this and a whole lot more is included within this section.
