00:01.160 --> 00:08.480
Welcome back in in this lesson we're going to be looking at the drag and drop of handlers that are available

00:08.480 --> 00:09.500
within the dorm.

00:09.530 --> 00:14.720
So I set up basic CSSA where I can create essentially a box.

00:14.720 --> 00:17.290
So let's do that and we'll use class

00:21.670 --> 00:24.320
so box.

00:24.500 --> 00:30.240
So I want to set up two divs one and two.

00:30.980 --> 00:34.760
And then I want the ability to actually drag between the two divs.

00:34.760 --> 00:35.570
Let's go back.

00:35.660 --> 00:36.920
And a refresher.

00:38.300 --> 00:41.090
And I also want to put a border around this border

00:44.450 --> 00:53.210
so do one pick solid block border and go back in and refresh it.

00:53.220 --> 00:53.820
So there we go.

00:53.820 --> 00:58.460
So we've got basically our two slots in order to drag and drop.

00:58.650 --> 01:04.560
So we're going to attempt to move an element from one box into the other.

01:04.830 --> 01:08.780
So now we need to create that element that we can start to pull in.

01:09.030 --> 01:12.740
So let's create it within that first box.

01:12.780 --> 01:17.280
So this one will be a div and will give it an ID

01:21.300 --> 01:26.950
and we'll call it get get L.

01:26.980 --> 01:30.730
So to get the element and then

01:34.570 --> 01:36.840
and oh say drag me please.

01:39.460 --> 01:41.710
So let's go back refreshed.

01:41.830 --> 01:44.350
So I've got one that says drive me please.

01:44.350 --> 01:47.350
And then the other one doesn't have anything in it as of yet.

01:48.930 --> 01:52.500
And I'm also going to add some colors to this element.

01:52.520 --> 01:57.830
So get well and we'll give it a background color.

01:59.120 --> 02:02.360
So that we can more easily identify it.

02:02.840 --> 02:03.690
So there we go.

02:03.980 --> 02:05.690
So now let's refresh it.

02:05.690 --> 02:10.470
So that's the element that we want to drag and we want to be able to drag it and drop it off in the

02:10.500 --> 02:11.380
other box.

02:11.600 --> 02:19.220
So there's the listener that's on drag so he got a number of different ones here so we've got on Drag

02:19.220 --> 02:23.580
start over leave and turn and on drag on drop.

02:23.690 --> 02:26.810
So these are the ones that we're going to be using on Drag start.

02:26.990 --> 02:29.830
So we need to have a d start.

02:30.110 --> 02:39.020
So this is the function that we want to fire off whenever the drag starts and who should put it call

02:39.020 --> 02:47.640
it do start so let's set up that function within our Javascript.

02:47.690 --> 02:51.530
So basically this is firing off whenever the drag is starting.

02:51.620 --> 02:53.240
And let's update that message

02:55.920 --> 02:57.660
drag started.

03:02.010 --> 03:03.930
So that's all that's going to happen right now.

03:03.960 --> 03:14.260
So it's refreshed and we need to actually add an attribute here as well.

03:14.280 --> 03:18.240
So this what we want and need to add the attribute draggle

03:25.560 --> 03:27.910
so drag up will has to equal.

03:27.910 --> 03:28.670
True.

03:29.020 --> 03:32.530
So that basically allows that element to become draggle.

03:32.530 --> 03:41.360
So let's refresher so we can see now when we refresh the page when we select it and we start dragging

03:41.360 --> 03:43.780
it we've got drag started.

03:43.790 --> 03:45.690
So that's the message that we want.

03:45.710 --> 03:55.030
So the next thing that we want to do is we want to have somewhere where we can actually drop it.

03:55.140 --> 03:56.810
So let's add those in.

03:56.820 --> 04:03.930
So within the box there we're going to add another event listener so this one is called on drag where

04:03.930 --> 04:06.680
it should be actually on drop.

04:06.690 --> 04:14.100
So on a draw we need to fire off so d drop.

04:14.210 --> 04:16.290
This is the event that we want to fire off.

04:16.430 --> 04:23.480
So on draw we want to fire off Diedre and I want to add that to the other box as well because they need

04:23.480 --> 04:25.030
to be the same.

04:25.130 --> 04:31.890
And another thing too that we need to also we need to so they have on drag over.

04:32.330 --> 04:39.370
So this is something that can fire off whenever the element is on top of another one.

04:39.390 --> 04:42.140
And so basically we want to disable this.

04:42.270 --> 04:47.170
So we want to no drop.

04:47.200 --> 04:50.270
So basically we want to have a no drop function.

04:50.320 --> 04:58.150
And this one all this is going to do is this is basically going to prevent the ability to drag over.

04:58.360 --> 05:06.090
So let's update and add in our functions within the javascript's So there was an drop.

05:06.400 --> 05:09.480
So the default to it is drag over.

05:09.490 --> 05:11.220
So we want to prevent the default.

05:11.260 --> 05:15.420
And there is a built in method with javascript as well to do that.

05:15.580 --> 05:22.400
And this one actually becomes really useful because this allows you to prevent defaults of typical actions.

05:22.420 --> 05:28.930
So if you if you do this on a link or something else you can basically prevent the default action of

05:28.930 --> 05:29.890
that element.

05:29.890 --> 05:34.010
We know that a lot of elements like hyperlinks they have default actions.

05:34.090 --> 05:40.870
And whenever you're dragging drag over there's default elements with default actions within the elements.

05:40.930 --> 05:45.520
So we can disable that by doing event to prevent default.

05:45.520 --> 05:50.980
So basically now we can't drag over it which is what we want because we want the ability to be able

05:50.980 --> 05:53.660
to drop that and so function.

05:53.980 --> 05:57.830
And last one is the drop.

05:57.910 --> 06:05.680
So this is the function that fires off and will say within here that Draut that

06:08.940 --> 06:11.000
so to say drop it for now.

06:11.010 --> 06:13.200
So let's go back and refresh it.

06:13.440 --> 06:18.280
And now it can drag it and drag start it and we can see it drop it.

06:18.450 --> 06:22.120
So everything is working but we're not transferring the element.

06:22.200 --> 06:25.610
So that's because there's a few things that we need to still take care of.

06:25.890 --> 06:29.520
So one of them is we need to prevent the default.

06:29.520 --> 06:36.030
So we want to prevent the default action of dropping and the other thing that we want to do is we want

06:36.030 --> 06:36.600
to

06:39.870 --> 06:47.520
check to see if the target is actually where we want to drop it so it has to be one of the boxes and

06:47.580 --> 06:48.630
we need to check.

06:48.630 --> 06:56.450
So this is a condition where we check to see if the target server the event target from before.

06:56.440 --> 07:02.610
So we're still using that because it contains a whole bunch of information and we can check to see class

07:02.610 --> 07:04.270
names in it as well.

07:04.350 --> 07:13.610
So we can check to see if the class name is equal to box which it has to be in order for us to drop

07:13.610 --> 07:17.830
it that we know that we're okay to drop.

07:18.010 --> 07:20.920
And there's a few other things that we still need to add in.

07:21.010 --> 07:25.060
So we need to have a default global variable that can hold

07:27.740 --> 07:31.960
hold taken hold the item basically.

07:31.980 --> 07:45.390
So what we want to do is when we start the drag We want to add into the hold item the event target.

07:45.390 --> 07:52.500
So basically what we've picked up we want to drop in to the hold item and that way we know that we've

07:52.500 --> 07:58.200
got the hold item and we can remove we can remove it from there.

07:58.260 --> 08:01.530
And then we can drop it into the new place.

08:01.620 --> 08:06.560
So going over to here so we know that it is a box or all good to go.

08:06.750 --> 08:11.070
And we're going to use another one another built in method within the dorm.

08:11.070 --> 08:17.910
So basically this adds a note at the end of the child child's list of the parent node so we can basically

08:18.000 --> 08:19.380
append a child.

08:19.620 --> 08:29.670
And what we want to do is we want to append that item that we're dragging in on top and that one is

08:29.670 --> 08:31.770
going to be under Holder item.

08:31.800 --> 08:35.410
So we want to pen the child with the holder item.

08:35.810 --> 08:37.100
So let's see how this works.

08:37.110 --> 08:40.050
And there's still a few other things that we still need to finish off.

08:40.200 --> 08:47.180
But we can see that we're able to kind of drag and drop it and everything seems to be working properly.

08:47.190 --> 08:53.910
Let me add in some identifiers here for these divs because the boxes we don't have anything to identify

08:53.910 --> 08:55.060
them as of yet.

08:55.170 --> 08:56.970
So just do one and two.

08:57.090 --> 08:59.930
And I'm also going to make them a little bit bigger as well.

09:02.080 --> 09:03.940
And I'm also going to give them some padding

09:07.950 --> 09:09.020
and margin

09:12.380 --> 09:18.510
so margins zero and 50 picks.

09:18.690 --> 09:29.600
So let's refresh it now so now we can see that we can drag and drop it into different elements and everything

09:29.630 --> 09:32.110
is working properly.

09:32.170 --> 09:38.430
So that's how you can do a drag and drop of elements and just go to make sure that you do cancels out

09:38.480 --> 09:39.100
the dance.

09:39.130 --> 09:45.580
So in this one we learned that we can prevent the default events from firing off by doing prevent default

09:45.910 --> 09:47.270
on the event object.

09:47.410 --> 09:56.260
And we also saw how we can go through and we can append into our elements so it can append content into

09:56.260 --> 09:57.310
them as well.

09:57.460 --> 10:04.780
And now I want you to pause the video and add in a few more boxes so add in two more boxes and I'll

10:04.780 --> 10:08.110
show you how to do that coming up.

10:08.110 --> 10:14.590
So one and two add in a few extra boxes go back and refresh it.

10:14.710 --> 10:21.190
So now we've got a number of boxes and everything should still work the same way where we can drag and

10:21.250 --> 10:28.450
drop it into any one of those boxes is they all share those same properties and they all have the same

10:28.540 --> 10:32.920
event listeners drop and the drag over has been disabled.

10:33.040 --> 10:39.460
So they're able to drag and drop elements into any one that has the class of box.
