00:01.590 --> 00:05.970
Welcome back in in this lesson we're going to be building out a shopping cart.

00:06.150 --> 00:12.450
So first of all we need some items for our shopping cart so we've got we need to create an array that's

00:12.450 --> 00:17.380
going to hold a bunch of items that we're going to then utilize within our shopping cart.

00:17.430 --> 00:25.620
So let's create some items there so maybe we've got an iPhone in there and we've got a price of that

00:25.680 --> 00:27.110
iPhone.

00:27.690 --> 00:38.340
So we've also got so we actually need to to create this as an object so let's convert this into an object.

00:38.360 --> 00:44.150
And we know that we can have a series of objects within an array so we can loop through all of those

00:44.150 --> 00:45.690
items as well.

00:45.710 --> 00:55.480
So let's put them in here and then for an object just as we saw last time we need to give it a key and

00:55.480 --> 00:56.410
then a value.

00:56.410 --> 01:00.200
So the value can be iPhone and the key can be name.

01:00.250 --> 01:02.010
Let's do cost as well.

01:03.520 --> 01:06.960
And I say get rid of the quotes here so that we can have a numeric value.

01:09.260 --> 01:12.040
So we've got a number of different things here.

01:12.080 --> 01:13.490
So we've got a cost.

01:13.490 --> 01:23.440
We've got a name and maybe also we want to have if we have multiple So we want more specific information.

01:23.450 --> 01:27.780
So we'll call in details.

01:28.460 --> 01:38.530
So this iPhone and what color it is or something like that so that we've got some more options for details.

01:38.630 --> 01:44.230
And next we need to copy this format and do a comma separated out.

01:44.250 --> 01:50.630
So I'm going to do a number of different items here that we can build out for our shopping cart.

01:50.730 --> 02:03.140
So the next thing i pod and make this 800 and then maybe we have something like a cable or something

02:03.480 --> 02:06.100
and it's a three foot cable.

02:06.270 --> 02:09.480
So three it's a three foot cable.

02:09.570 --> 02:13.260
And the cost for this cable is going to be 10 bucks.

02:14.120 --> 02:15.940
Let me just beautify this.

02:15.970 --> 02:17.850
So it's a lot more readable.

02:17.890 --> 02:20.440
You've got a cable and then next.

02:20.480 --> 02:25.250
This is just a bunch of random stuff that I'm putting in here for our shopping cart.

02:25.250 --> 02:29.480
So maybe this one's a camera and it's

02:31.710 --> 02:37.180
25 megapixel and this camera is 300 bucks.

02:37.530 --> 02:48.280
So we need some more random stuff so maybe this is a laptop and the laptop is Intel iOS 7 or something

02:48.280 --> 02:48.960
like that.

02:50.080 --> 02:53.260
And let's give it a cost of twelve hundred.

02:54.200 --> 02:55.620
And into LCD

02:58.120 --> 02:58.780
monitor

03:01.540 --> 03:09.620
LCD monitor and this is a 24 inch screen so this one is 200 bucks.

03:09.640 --> 03:17.720
And lastly let's let's do one more and we'll just do TVs of TV.

03:17.730 --> 03:27.500
So just a really simple TV and it's a 50 inch TV and let's do 450.

03:27.510 --> 03:28.290
So there we go.

03:28.320 --> 03:32.180
So now we've got a bunch of products here ready to go.

03:32.370 --> 03:37.930
And we've got to build out our details for our web page.

03:38.280 --> 03:44.160
So we've got to loop through all of these items and build them out so that they can be clicked and they

03:44.160 --> 03:46.850
can add into our shopping cart.

03:46.890 --> 03:51.420
So let's let's build that out and this is all done in Javascript.

03:51.420 --> 03:58.760
So first of all we know we need to loop through all of those items that we have available.

03:58.800 --> 04:05.780
So we've got items and we're going to loop through it so we're going to do the For Each loop.

04:05.780 --> 04:10.310
So for each and we're going to execute for each one of these.

04:10.340 --> 04:13.280
And then within here within the for each.

04:13.300 --> 04:21.330
We're going to do a function and for the value we're going to return back the.

04:21.530 --> 04:24.270
And let's just for now let's just console log.

04:24.280 --> 04:28.930
So just to make sure that we're picking up all of that information within the console.

04:28.930 --> 04:30.730
So let's go back to the page.

04:30.840 --> 04:32.100
We don't see anything yet.

04:32.130 --> 04:38.820
Let's open up the console and you can see within the console we've got all of our Leighton's listed.

04:38.880 --> 04:44.400
So as we loop through we've got all of this information and then this is the information we can use

04:44.400 --> 04:46.140
to build our Web page.

04:46.140 --> 04:49.480
So let's go out and build out our Web page.

04:49.670 --> 04:55.450
So as we're looping through I'm going to set up a variable called H Tim L and I couldn't just keep it

04:55.450 --> 04:56.580
a blank.

04:56.900 --> 05:07.050
And then within here solutes build out r h t m l so h t m will equal h t m l and start with a div and

05:07.080 --> 05:15.930
give it a class of item within the div and next to each 3.

05:16.070 --> 05:24.960
And then within here let's add in let's add in one of the values there so what we're going to do probably

05:24.960 --> 05:27.600
will do the name.

05:27.720 --> 05:31.160
So it's returning back that object name.

05:31.180 --> 05:38.010
So H-3 so close that one off and then we could probably also use an image.

05:38.010 --> 05:43.110
So I can grab an image from place hold it that we used before.

05:43.140 --> 05:44.580
So we're all going to have the same image.

05:44.580 --> 05:49.080
And of course we could always add the image details within the object and so on.

05:49.080 --> 05:52.570
So if we want to vary them we can do that as well.

05:52.830 --> 05:55.040
So we're just to go quickly.

05:55.080 --> 05:59.530
We're not going to output that but you're welcome to add that if you need to.

05:59.550 --> 06:04.590
So we've got another option here for for some of the details.

06:05.830 --> 06:10.380
But the product so let's do the details.

06:16.490 --> 06:23.190
So output the details value there and then next have a clickable link.

06:23.210 --> 06:30.180
So this is just going to be in H.F. and it's actually not going to go anywhere so I just want to have

06:30.200 --> 06:36.910
a link and I'm going to give it a class so I'll give it a class of product item.

06:36.930 --> 06:44.870
So these are all the different items and we're going to use the data attributes in order to pass the

06:44.870 --> 06:47.080
values on the click.

06:47.090 --> 06:53.360
So let's set up some data set up some data attributes and this is actually probably one of the easiest

06:53.360 --> 06:57.670
ways to add in.

06:57.820 --> 06:59.920
So I've got a double quote.

06:59.950 --> 07:01.280
I've got a single quote.

07:01.530 --> 07:10.360
I've got a plus plus single quote and a double quote so pick up the name that way.

07:12.830 --> 07:23.060
And next let's add in another dieta attributes you've got a name so let's do data asks for data details.

07:23.060 --> 07:28.460
Call it data ass so you can pick the information up and we need to do the same thing that we did over

07:28.460 --> 07:38.060
here where we need to equal that to the details so that we can always pass that those details whenever

07:38.060 --> 07:43.140
we get it clicked and then we also need to have the price as well.

07:43.160 --> 07:49.250
So let's add in one more data attribute there and we're going to call it price.

07:49.910 --> 07:55.230
And then this is the cost because we've got all of those values.

07:55.260 --> 08:02.270
And so basically what I'm doing here is I'm just simply adding in a bunch of data attributes so that

08:02.270 --> 08:04.480
we can pick up this information.

08:04.820 --> 08:06.780
And there's actually one more that I wanted to add.

08:06.790 --> 08:15.740
And I do want to have a distinct ID number so I can do that as we're looping through but unfortunately

08:15.740 --> 08:20.320
because I'm not doing a for loop I don't have an ID value.

08:21.270 --> 08:31.930
Handy right now so let's let's just X to zero and I going a set the ID to whatever value of x it is.

08:31.950 --> 08:34.440
So that way we can distinguish between the values.

08:34.560 --> 08:40.050
And you could also if you were pulling it in from your database you might already have an ID.

08:40.110 --> 08:41.650
So you could just use that one.

08:41.670 --> 08:44.010
This one just needs to be that distinct number.

08:44.040 --> 08:50.170
In order for us to identify it within the cart and then let's do it.

08:50.220 --> 08:57.150
So this would just be a hyperlink where we can add the value to a card and this will increase into the

08:57.160 --> 09:01.520
H HMO and couple of things we do need to do increment x.

09:01.720 --> 09:12.720
And also once we've finished the loop let's let's do a document get element by id and let's grab output

09:15.780 --> 09:24.580
and we'll do the inner of output and we'll update it with whatever we got.

09:24.580 --> 09:28.990
An HMO or thought to it

09:32.620 --> 09:34.330
and I'll add in a line break there.

09:34.330 --> 09:36.120
So let's go ahead and try the suit.

09:36.430 --> 09:44.420
So we refreshed the page and we've got all of our items there being shown within our visual area.

09:44.440 --> 09:49.330
So next thing that we need to do is we need to do some styling for the items.

09:49.510 --> 09:53.550
So this again this is all optional This isn't anything with javascript.

09:53.680 --> 09:58.260
It's just so that it displays a little bit nicer are not going to spend a lot of time on it.

09:58.330 --> 10:05.380
So I'm going to add in a border so that velox we can distinguish between the different items add in

10:05.380 --> 10:10.200
some padding so do a percentage here and do with as well.

10:10.240 --> 10:15.790
So do something like 29 percent and float them all to the left.

10:15.820 --> 10:21.940
So I'm not going to worry too much about the styling but let's just float them all to the left and give

10:21.940 --> 10:27.470
them the height as well so they're all nice and equal height of 300 picks.

10:27.550 --> 10:31.270
So let's refresh that now and try that out.

10:31.360 --> 10:34.220
One other thing we got to take care of those images.

10:34.270 --> 10:42.970
So I did add in a class called Image fluid and this is a board that vowel that name from Bootstrap.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.870
So I don't have bootstrap attached to here so I have to mimic some of this.

10:46.870 --> 10:50.170
So that's Max with that 100 percent.

10:50.170 --> 10:53.820
So basically that will keep images all contained.

10:54.160 --> 11:00.100
And it looks like I haven't closed off one of the divs properly and that's why I'm getting that kind

11:00.100 --> 11:04.110
of overlap there so I can add that in and try that again.

11:04.240 --> 11:13.170
So it's refreshed the save the save the page and go back and refresh it actually I've got two divs there

11:13.180 --> 11:16.740
so before I save it and refresh it now.

11:16.900 --> 11:18.110
So everything now.

11:18.280 --> 11:21.160
And neatly are lines little bit better now.

11:21.190 --> 11:25.470
So now we're ready to start adding in some javascript functionality.

11:25.500 --> 11:27.540
Let's come on up in the next lesson.

11:27.550 --> 11:33.660
So what I want you to do now to practice is to build out a list of items and output them.

11:33.730 --> 11:40.840
So loop through all of those items and output them within a web page and then add in the data attributes

11:40.990 --> 11:42.960
from the list of items.

11:43.090 --> 11:48.430
And then we're going to do in the next lesson is I'm going to show you a can pick up this information

11:48.670 --> 11:49.860
when it gets clicked.

11:49.870 --> 11:52.190
So that's coming up in the next lesson.
