00:02.100 --> 00:08.780
Another thing that we can do with strings is we can simply replace value so we can have a placeholder

00:08.780 --> 00:11.560
value and have it work as a template.

00:11.750 --> 00:15.330
Updating the content that's being contained within it.

00:15.500 --> 00:22.690
So it's first of all create a name and this is just regular name.

00:23.240 --> 00:27.270
And next let's create our message.

00:27.560 --> 00:35.960
So our message is actually going to include the name and we're going to replace the content directly

00:36.020 --> 00:41.460
that's contained within the message rate using javascript templates.

00:41.510 --> 00:48.380
So we've got the dollar sign and the curly brackets and then what's in here is where we need to place

00:48.660 --> 00:56.070
the declare the variable value there the variable name there so we can place that within the name.

00:56.270 --> 01:01.670
And then let's just add in was here today.

01:02.180 --> 01:05.960
So see what happens so go back into the browser refresh it.

01:05.960 --> 01:07.430
So he didn't throw any errors.

01:07.610 --> 01:11.570
If we type in name we get the name if we type in message.

01:11.570 --> 01:13.660
What do you think we're going to see within message.

01:13.820 --> 01:21.220
And if you said that name is going to be replaced with the actual value of name you're correct.

01:21.230 --> 01:24.880
So it actually works as we've seen with templates.

01:24.950 --> 01:27.620
We're able to replace values.

01:27.620 --> 01:34.700
So these are the new template literals that give us the power to simply update that content directly

01:34.700 --> 01:38.140
within that variable without having to do anything else.

01:38.150 --> 01:43.100
So it just knows that this means that we're replacing it with the value of name.

01:43.100 --> 01:47.340
So what happens if we try to replace it with one that doesn't exist.

01:47.480 --> 01:50.430
And if I refresh it then we throw an error.

01:50.540 --> 01:56.660
So if you are doing this make sure that they do exist when you're trying to insert it into the template

01:57.350 --> 01:59.220
so we can also.

01:59.300 --> 02:02.930
So the other thing we know is we can change those values.

02:02.960 --> 02:13.510
So if I change the value to John and if I go and if I refresh then what what do you think is going to

02:13.510 --> 02:15.330
be contained within message.

02:15.330 --> 02:19.680
So we're still out Lawerence because it's coming down from that sequence.

02:19.750 --> 02:28.630
But if I take this statement and if I place it after my reassignment of the value for name and if I

02:28.630 --> 02:31.230
refresh it like this.

02:31.260 --> 02:34.490
Now if I do message that we see that the message is.

02:34.540 --> 02:36.150
John was here today.

02:38.100 --> 02:44.270
So what I want you to do now is pause the video and use this within a function.

02:44.430 --> 02:51.450
So console logging out calling to a function and then pass that parameter into the function so pass

02:51.750 --> 02:58.470
jaunt into the function and then have the function build that output message output into the console

02:58.500 --> 03:02.380
and also return it so that when where console logging it.

03:02.490 --> 03:04.690
We see it in there as well.

03:04.740 --> 03:09.660
So go ahead and do that and add this into a function turned us into a function and I'll show you the

03:09.660 --> 03:10.960
solution coming up.

03:11.970 --> 03:15.430
So we saw that we can declare the name there.

03:15.630 --> 03:24.590
And we also saw that we can change the value of the name and we can update a value within a template.

03:24.710 --> 03:27.690
So let's wrap this within a function.

03:32.070 --> 03:35.100
So this one is going to be called update message.

03:35.100 --> 03:38.540
We're going to take our one parameter that's going to get passed in here.

03:38.700 --> 03:41.670
And remember with LET and Konst.

03:41.790 --> 03:43.650
So they're going to work the same way.

03:43.650 --> 03:47.630
And we've already seen this with functions that we've got local variables.

03:47.640 --> 03:50.610
So this is going to be working within this block.

03:52.640 --> 03:57.310
Because we're declaring it within the block and we no longer need this one that's sitting outside of

03:57.310 --> 03:58.010
the block.

03:58.030 --> 04:03.390
So now let's take that value of message and we're going to log it out into the con..

04:03.400 --> 04:06.910
So it's going to be visible at that point.

04:06.910 --> 04:10.830
And we're also going to return back the value of message.

04:11.740 --> 04:22.520
And then let's go down here and let's console log out update message and then here let's pass in values.

04:22.640 --> 04:25.370
Dujon So let's see what happens say.

04:25.390 --> 04:28.910
Refresh the page and we get both of them.

04:28.960 --> 04:34.120
John was here and the error here is that I'm actually not passing that parameter in there.

04:34.210 --> 04:36.550
So let's try that again and this time it worked.

04:36.550 --> 04:37.190
So there we go.

04:37.190 --> 04:45.040
So we're able to update and pass that message information in and pick that up and update the value within

04:45.040 --> 04:46.180
that string.

04:46.330 --> 04:53.890
Pause the video and add this within a loop so set up this message have it contained within a loop and

04:53.890 --> 04:59.350
then as it loops through update that value that's contained within the message and that put it into

04:59.350 --> 05:00.270
the console.

05:00.280 --> 05:02.620
So go ahead and try that out in your browser.

05:02.710 --> 05:05.170
I'll show you the solution coming up.

05:05.320 --> 05:07.670
So if you had an opportunity to try that.

05:07.900 --> 05:11.320
And do you remember when you were creating your loop to use.

05:11.320 --> 05:21.190
Let us let's use LET and let's loop through while I is less then so let's do it maybe 10 times and increment

05:21.250 --> 05:21.800
I.

05:22.030 --> 05:29.740
So what we want to do is we want to set up a message that's contained within here so message and we're

05:29.740 --> 05:32.420
going to use the value of i

05:36.450 --> 05:37.140
count.

05:37.220 --> 05:41.640
Now and let's console log out message

05:45.770 --> 05:48.260
let's go out and try that out and refresh

05:52.170 --> 05:59.960
and before we run it let's add in a default value for ice or starting point for I started it at zero

06:00.210 --> 06:01.140
refresh it.

06:01.230 --> 06:02.160
And so there we go.

06:02.160 --> 06:09.630
So we're able to update that value that's contained so use message kind of as a template here and update

06:09.690 --> 06:13.980
that value of IDE that's dynamically changing and output it into the console.
