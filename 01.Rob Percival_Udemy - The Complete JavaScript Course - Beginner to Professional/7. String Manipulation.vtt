00:01.050 --> 00:05.630
Welcome back and in this lesson we're going to look at even more string methods.

00:05.670 --> 00:12.000
And there's quite a lot of them and they're actually really useful when you're working with strings.

00:12.000 --> 00:21.300
So let's grab our Hello world and we're going to actually transform the value of hello world and we're

00:21.300 --> 00:23.340
going to use the built in string method.

00:23.340 --> 00:25.430
So just we're grabbing the string object.

00:25.500 --> 00:36.150
So it's Daut and we can transform it to uppercase so we can see that that's what it looks like as upper

00:36.140 --> 00:37.200
case.

00:37.440 --> 00:42.710
We can take B and we can transform this one.

00:42.850 --> 00:46.800
And so let's transform this one to lowercase.

00:46.840 --> 00:50.520
So we've got to uppercase two lowercase.

00:50.770 --> 00:52.090
There's a built in methods.

00:52.090 --> 00:55.660
So notice that we got rid of the upper H and the upper W

00:58.730 --> 01:01.100
and we can also return back.

01:01.100 --> 01:05.810
So just as we saw with the raise we can get back the index value.

01:05.810 --> 01:09.040
So we saw that we can do an index value of a letter.

01:09.140 --> 01:15.020
We can do where we select a and we do index.

01:15.020 --> 01:17.190
So we've got an option index of.

01:17.270 --> 01:22.420
And then we need to add in the character so we can say we're looking for H.

01:24.600 --> 01:27.660
And we can return back that within a.

01:27.690 --> 01:29.640
There's no upper case h.

01:29.670 --> 01:34.430
So this is another important thing to note and we saw this within arrays as well.

01:34.470 --> 01:41.260
So if it doesn't exist then we get an index value of negative 1 being returned.

01:41.370 --> 01:46.110
And this is important when you're doing conditional statements and checking to see if a value actually

01:46.110 --> 01:48.070
exists within an array.

01:48.360 --> 01:52.710
So another other thing that we can do so we don't have to limit it to just one character.

01:52.740 --> 02:01.170
We can do an entire word and we can see that we can return back the index value of the entire word.

02:01.190 --> 02:05.360
So what if we have a repeating word Celeste's set up a new variable.

02:05.360 --> 02:08.740
I'm going to do C concatenate it with B.

02:08.870 --> 02:12.740
So now we've got a value of c world.

02:12.740 --> 02:13.310
Hello.

02:13.340 --> 02:14.520
Hello world.

02:14.630 --> 02:20.500
So what if we want to get index of.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.400
So let's get index of.

02:22.400 --> 02:25.560
And we're going to check to see which one is repeating.

02:25.610 --> 02:29.310
So I'll get the index of this character string.

02:29.420 --> 02:32.860
So we see that we're returning back that first set.

02:32.870 --> 02:39.320
So this is 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 and it's starting at point number 7.

02:39.320 --> 02:42.210
We can also do last index of.

02:42.350 --> 02:51.330
So this is another option and this is ideal if we have multiple of that same character that we're trying

02:51.330 --> 02:52.010
to look.

02:52.030 --> 02:59.530
So multiple occurrences of our same needle we can see that we can get the last index of.

02:59.540 --> 03:01.940
And actually we need to do this with and see.

03:01.940 --> 03:03.100
So that was a.

03:03.260 --> 03:09.620
And we can do it within C because we know that C has multiple occurrences of that character.

03:09.710 --> 03:18.450
So we see that we get it returning back at twal So we see this time that EHLO is within that 12 because

03:18.450 --> 03:25.850
we're looking at the last occurrence of it and another thing that we know is that we can actually slice

03:25.880 --> 03:27.310
part of the string out.

03:27.500 --> 03:36.410
So if for instance I want to take C and I want to take a piece of C out we know that if I want to take

03:36.530 --> 03:42.800
EHLO out so the last occurrence of it we need to just specify where we're beginning the slice and then

03:43.830 --> 03:49.310
where we're ending the slice.

03:49.450 --> 03:56.960
So if for instance we enter six and we do 16 then we're slicing out that Hello.

03:57.100 --> 03:57.820
Hello.

03:57.940 --> 04:00.090
And now when we take a look at see.

04:00.220 --> 04:09.480
So if we did see equals C slice We know that we can pull back those values and pull them out.

04:09.580 --> 04:16.560
And also let's also include the spaces we only need to include one space we can set this one at 16

04:21.330 --> 04:27.320
and now when we look at c we are actually returning back that sliced value.

04:27.360 --> 04:33.070
So we want to actually slice this out but we want to return back C as World World.

04:34.310 --> 04:38.590
So we have another option as well that we can't return back part of a string.

04:38.600 --> 04:46.090
So if I do see and substring that allows me to take out a part of the string out.

04:46.160 --> 04:48.820
So again similar to what we saw with slice.

04:48.890 --> 04:57.890
We can have a beginning index and then we can specify how many characters we want to slice so.

04:58.050 --> 05:02.130
So let's say I want to slice out three starting at three.

05:02.130 --> 05:05.150
We can see that that returns the L L O.

05:05.250 --> 05:13.750
So that starting at item index number 3 and then returning back and ending or turning back three.

05:13.980 --> 05:18.830
So if we want to return back 5 we can do that as well.

05:18.930 --> 05:23.410
So we can see there we're getting all five starting at index three.

05:23.430 --> 05:26.750
I remember we've got a space here right in the beginning as well.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.920
So that's what's throwing things off a little bit.

05:30.090 --> 05:33.240
And similar to sub S T R.

05:33.240 --> 05:35.270
There's also sub string.

05:35.520 --> 05:42.870
So this one is very similar and the difference is that this one instead of needing to return back how

05:42.870 --> 05:44.940
many characters were returning.

05:44.940 --> 05:47.240
We have a starting and an ending point.

05:47.250 --> 05:56.490
So if I do three and I want to go to index 10 we can see that this way I can return back 3 to the index

05:56.490 --> 05:57.070
of 10.

05:57.120 --> 05:57.900
So that's the difference.

05:57.900 --> 06:04.650
The second parameter there and that's what's allowing us to select where we're actually stopping our

06:04.740 --> 06:05.790
substring.

06:05.790 --> 06:09.680
So it kind of the same thing as slice.

06:09.750 --> 06:11.860
So it's time for another exercise.

06:11.910 --> 06:14.900
So we're not going to do anything worth checking the guess.

06:14.940 --> 06:21.180
And we want to rate right this basic default message to say hello Javascript.

06:21.180 --> 06:25.960
So just taking out that javascript and simply rewriting that.

06:26.160 --> 06:28.990
And I want you to do that all via javascript.

06:29.010 --> 06:36.510
So rewrite this message to just say javascript using the string methods that we saw earlier and you

06:36.510 --> 06:44.250
can add that code in here so that before we go to check mess check guess that simply it runs the functionality

06:44.250 --> 06:44.650
here.

06:44.760 --> 06:46.190
So do this all in javascript.

06:46.190 --> 06:54.770
I'll show you the solution coming up so we know with variable message we can get the inner H-2 M-L.

06:54.780 --> 06:59.540
So that's the first thing that we need to start with we need to start with our string.

06:59.550 --> 07:05.210
So let's put a message and we'll get.

07:05.330 --> 07:09.470
So take the inner text.

07:09.470 --> 07:12.160
So put it when it within a string value.

07:13.980 --> 07:17.690
So let's go ahead and clear out our console and refresh it.

07:17.880 --> 07:24.120
So sometimes one of the best ways to work with it is so now that we've got complete javascript course

07:24.210 --> 07:29.980
within here and we've got to somehow transform this to say hello Javascript.

07:30.090 --> 07:32.320
So let's begin with that.

07:32.430 --> 07:36.110
And we know with the variable a we've got.

07:36.120 --> 07:36.590
Hello.

07:36.600 --> 07:42.480
And we also have hello inby so we can use any one of these to grab the word Hello.

07:42.600 --> 07:47.580
So let's set up a variable and just simply grab hello out of that.

07:47.790 --> 07:50.260
And so this variable will say hello.

07:50.490 --> 07:57.120
So this is the first part of our task because we've got to say hello javascript and we saw with substring

07:57.270 --> 08:07.050
we could grab out part of the variable so let's do B and we can use either one because we actually know

08:07.050 --> 08:09.950
the amount of the value that we're trying to pull back.

08:10.170 --> 08:17.560
So we know that we want to start at zero and we want to go five characters in.

08:18.030 --> 08:21.050
So let's go back out and let's refresh that.

08:21.330 --> 08:26.960
So now let's just make sure that we hold low within that rate parameter.

08:27.180 --> 08:31.050
And actually we need to grab 6 characters because we need that space.

08:31.050 --> 08:33.760
So models will pick up the space at this point.

08:34.020 --> 08:43.380
So the next thing is that we need to work with string and we need to extract javascript and maybe we

08:43.380 --> 08:49.270
can first start by determining where javascript is located.

08:49.290 --> 08:58.530
So let's do a string and let's do index of in order to find out where the javascript is located.

08:58.530 --> 09:05.210
So it actually wouldn't matter to us which which we're javascript's or if we had more than one javascript's

09:05.260 --> 09:08.780
with in the string we could use more than one.

09:08.790 --> 09:14.250
So we've got string index of javascript so we know that it starts at 9.

09:14.580 --> 09:18.030
So we can grab nine and we can also count out the characters.

09:18.040 --> 09:22.950
We know that Javascript has 10 characters long so we could do a substring here.

09:23.010 --> 09:29.530
So let's do this one here and this one will say Javascript.

09:29.660 --> 09:34.180
And actually let's do a jay jay script

09:37.650 --> 09:43.190
and so let's get the word javascript out of the string value there.

09:43.680 --> 09:50.250
So maybe the first thing that we maybe want to do is get index.

09:50.340 --> 09:53.080
So we just give this one a variable of C..

09:53.220 --> 09:55.330
And this is where index is going to be sitting.

09:57.500 --> 10:03.500
So take the string value and to index some case for whatever reason our

10:06.710 --> 10:12.080
value changes we want to be able to make sure that we can grab javascript out of it.

10:16.200 --> 10:21.760
So next we want to use string and we're going to use substring again.

10:26.420 --> 10:30.420
So this time we can use this substring.

10:30.440 --> 10:35.660
So they're going to really do the same thing and we can use the value of c as our starting point and

10:35.720 --> 10:42.910
we want to go all the way to C plus 10 because we know that the length of it is 10.

10:42.920 --> 10:46.670
So it's probably easier just to use substring in this case.

10:46.670 --> 10:55.480
But anyway so now let's go back and refresh the page and let's just see what our value of a script is

10:55.480 --> 10:56.410
going to be.

10:56.410 --> 10:58.100
So we've got Javascript.

10:58.180 --> 11:01.090
So now it's just a matter of combining them together.

11:03.200 --> 11:05.190
So let's let's do that now.

11:05.270 --> 11:11.450
And we're going to just combine them together and we know that we can reset the value of message and

11:11.510 --> 11:15.240
we can do in our text and we can equal that to

11:18.160 --> 11:28.350
hello and concatenate it to a US script so let's refresh it one more time and we see that now we've

11:28.350 --> 11:34.590
written out Hello javascript just by using the strings and the string method manipulating and grabbing

11:34.590 --> 11:36.440
the strings that we want to make use of.

11:36.660 --> 11:44.070
So what are the thing that I did want to mention here is what happens if you're actually unsure of if

11:44.070 --> 11:46.670
these are upper case or lower case.

11:46.680 --> 11:48.420
So you've got something like this.

11:48.600 --> 11:55.680
And we're going to notice that when we refresh it we're no longer it's no longer going to work properly

11:56.160 --> 12:03.480
because we're not able to grab that value there and we're simply trying to grab javascript and this

12:03.480 --> 12:04.820
is case sensitive.

12:04.890 --> 12:06.260
So keep that in mind.

12:06.270 --> 12:07.750
Pause the video.

12:07.860 --> 12:14.700
And to update it we can actually search for javascript regardless of the case that's being presented

12:14.700 --> 12:16.010
to us.

12:16.020 --> 12:20.340
So pause the video and work out the solution and I'll show you that coming up.

12:20.340 --> 12:25.880
So first of all we can do something like this where we can add another method in here.

12:25.950 --> 12:34.740
So before we're actually work before we're actually grabbing at the string we can transform it to lowercase

12:35.640 --> 12:37.330
or it should be two lowercase

12:41.050 --> 12:46.780
so transforming it to lower case and then we're going to get the index of javascript's so make sure

12:46.780 --> 12:51.930
that over here the string the needle that you're searching for is lower case as well.

12:51.940 --> 12:54.450
So now we're presented with javascript.

12:54.490 --> 12:58.830
The J is upper case and the rest of the characters are lowercase.

12:58.900 --> 13:06.430
So we need to actually transform it back into lowercase and we can create the S and keep that uppercase

13:06.520 --> 13:07.230
as well.

13:07.240 --> 13:16.250
So we want to transform this part and this part to lowercase and we can accomplish this by multiple

13:16.250 --> 13:18.170
methods stringing them together.

13:18.260 --> 13:25.130
So we know that we can grab the first character there and we can simply I'm going to just update this.

13:25.130 --> 13:30.470
And let's let's do substrings so that I can simply count the characters.

13:30.620 --> 13:32.960
So make a quick update an adjustment to there.

13:33.080 --> 13:38.880
So the first one that I want to grab is substring and I want to grab that G so that once fine.

13:38.900 --> 13:49.250
I want to add it together and this time I want to do C plus 1 and grab some string and this time I'm

13:49.250 --> 13:56.420
actually going to transform it to lower case so he can grab up portion of the string transforming it

13:56.420 --> 13:59.150
to lowercase and Dot separate it.

13:59.150 --> 14:02.270
And then we can list out so we're doing plus one.

14:02.360 --> 14:06.770
And now let's grab nine characters so go back out and refresh it.

14:06.770 --> 14:14.660
So this time we've got javascript all lowercase and we might want to do one last thing and that is to

14:14.690 --> 14:17.410
rewrite G-S script.

14:20.260 --> 14:26.440
And we can remove out the one character or we can just simply update that character.

14:27.310 --> 14:28.000
So go ahead.

14:28.000 --> 14:37.120
Pause the video and using the string method and Javascript transform just the G and the S to the upper

14:37.120 --> 14:40.660
case and I'll show you the solution coming up.

14:44.410 --> 14:46.710
So if you have an opportunity to try that.

14:46.780 --> 14:52.540
And I'm going to just create a brand new string for this and we're going to use that javascript because

14:52.540 --> 14:53.700
we've got it within that.

14:53.880 --> 14:56.620
J.S. JF script object there.

14:56.860 --> 14:59.730
And now let's apply some substring.

14:59.740 --> 15:05.350
So the first thing that I want to do is I want to grab the string from the starting and I want to go

15:05.350 --> 15:12.960
in four positions so that will get me java and then I want to do something different with the s.

15:13.300 --> 15:18.570
So actually I'm going to update these and I'm going to keep that one at G.

15:18.580 --> 15:21.770
So let's go in four positions.

15:21.820 --> 15:30.940
And next I want to grab that ass by itself and let's do a substring.

15:31.080 --> 15:35.450
So do substring and grabbing just the one characteris or starting at 4.

15:35.450 --> 15:41.340
So where we left off the last time and I only want to grab one character one additional character so

15:41.340 --> 15:43.850
that will grab that ass.

15:44.730 --> 15:49.250
And then lastly let's add in the rest of the string.

15:49.260 --> 15:55.220
So this is sub string.

15:55.410 --> 16:00.770
And this time we're going to grab all the characters all the way from 5 onwards.

16:00.840 --> 16:06.020
So grab that entire string and the one thing that we need to do so just says we did up here.

16:06.030 --> 16:12.990
We transformed it to lower case we need to transform it to uppercase.

16:13.040 --> 16:19.430
So now let's go back to refresh page and try it out and it should say javascript within that camel case

16:19.430 --> 16:24.040
where the first j is upper and then the s is upper as well.

16:27.530 --> 16:32.870
So it is it is important to get familiar with the substring and the different methods because this gives

16:32.870 --> 16:38.240
you a lot of manipulation that you can do with the string variables especially if you have a really

16:38.240 --> 16:44.880
long string values and you need to find out where certain words are and make updates to those words.

16:44.960 --> 16:47.410
You can do that using the string method.
