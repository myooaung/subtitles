00:01.360 --> 00:05.940
So want to do a quick shortening of this array value.

00:05.950 --> 00:10.020
So the variable that we've set is tile flipped over.

00:10.150 --> 00:15.350
So I actually want to shorten that and I'm going to replace it with T.F. all.

00:15.490 --> 00:17.710
So that will just shorten it quite a bit.

00:17.710 --> 00:22.070
And so these are this is the ray where we're holding all of the tiles that are flipped over.

00:22.090 --> 00:24.460
So do a quick update of that.

00:24.460 --> 00:29.520
And let's go out and just make sure that everything is working properly so no match.

00:29.560 --> 00:31.470
So we are working properly.

00:31.540 --> 00:38.200
So the objective of this lesson is that we need to hide those values that we flipped over and we know

00:38.230 --> 00:44.650
the last two values that we have within our tile flipped over array are going to take contained the

00:44.650 --> 00:45.830
last two values.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.800
And we also know that they don't notch from what we've done up here within our conditions.

00:50.890 --> 00:57.850
So that means that we can simply remove them out of the array and bring our way back to the initial

00:57.850 --> 00:58.490
value.

00:58.690 --> 01:06.070
So this is what we're going to do here where we're going to pop out that tile flipped over and we're

01:06.070 --> 01:09.700
going to use the array method pop.

01:09.700 --> 01:11.530
So we're going to get the ID first.

01:11.650 --> 01:13.390
And this is getting the ID.

01:13.900 --> 01:16.660
So this now is title EF 0.

01:16.840 --> 01:23.440
And what we want to do is use the method to remove it out of that array.

01:23.610 --> 01:30.640
So let's pop that allows us to do that and the next thing that we need to do is document get element

01:30.640 --> 01:31.910
by ID.

01:32.110 --> 01:38.200
And we know that when we pop it out of the array that we can set it into the variable because we saw

01:38.200 --> 01:43.260
that before where we can return a value and it returns the value that was removed.

01:43.450 --> 01:51.460
So now we know that we can grab that ID and we can update the inner h to Mel and we're going to set

01:51.460 --> 01:56.770
it back to what we had initially where we just had the click value.

01:56.770 --> 02:00.020
So let's go ahead and update that

02:04.470 --> 02:06.080
so we originally had set.

02:06.090 --> 02:07.740
This was our value.

02:07.740 --> 02:09.790
So we're going to just reset it back.

02:09.930 --> 02:15.600
And if you have a tile that you're using for the back of it you can do that as well.

02:15.600 --> 02:21.000
So basically this will reset it back to its original initial value.

02:21.060 --> 02:25.730
Remove it out of our array and then we need to do a few other things too.

02:25.770 --> 02:27.710
So we need to clear that interval.

02:27.750 --> 02:30.060
So we've got that timer that's going to run.

02:30.150 --> 02:34.190
And we did set it to set interval.

02:34.260 --> 02:39.080
So this one will continue to run this interval every second.

02:39.120 --> 02:41.270
Continue to try to run hide card.

02:41.430 --> 02:44.230
So we got to do a clear and remove that.

02:44.790 --> 02:50.200
Let's also update the card flipped so we know that we had the card flipped.

02:50.250 --> 02:56.180
So now that we flipped them both back it can go back to equaling negative 1.

02:56.400 --> 02:59.010
And let's update the message that we've got.

02:59.010 --> 03:00.990
Out to the users as well.

03:03.330 --> 03:09.030
Click or select again.

03:09.030 --> 03:12.240
So let's try it go back and refresh it.

03:12.240 --> 03:18.240
Hit start and we've got to flip to cut fat to over and we actually found a match there.

03:18.390 --> 03:26.080
So let's do two more and something is going wrong here because we're not actually supposed to flip over

03:26.080 --> 03:28.080
the ones that are flipped over.

03:28.090 --> 03:35.010
So let's go back in and see what's going on here that we're not supposed to be flipping them back over.

03:35.000 --> 03:40.270
And what's actually happening is we forgot to set some of the settings.

03:40.330 --> 03:47.060
So if we don't want the cards to flip over any more over here we've got the matches found.

03:47.170 --> 03:53.610
And we also need to set card flipped to negative one.

03:53.650 --> 03:55.920
So let's try this again.

03:56.020 --> 04:02.520
So it we did find a match there and we found a match there and we see that.

04:02.520 --> 04:08.550
So that's working better so that was the problem there that we weren't resetting the card flipped.

04:08.550 --> 04:14.010
And when we were going back in here that was basically messing around with how many cards we've got

04:14.010 --> 04:19.350
flipped over so I kept thinking that we've flipped over more cards so we have to always reset back to

04:19.350 --> 04:24.330
the default and allow the users to continue to flip over cards.

04:24.330 --> 04:30.300
So we've got quite a bit of the game play going and we see that we're still running into a few issues

04:30.300 --> 04:31.120
here.

04:31.140 --> 04:38.370
So one of them is that I can actually click a whole bunch of cards and I'm loosing my sync that I'm

04:38.370 --> 04:41.200
only allowed to have two that are playable.

04:41.280 --> 04:43.620
So this is where we need to have the lockout.

04:43.770 --> 04:52.960
So we need to lock the play while we're we've already flipped over two cards to allow that to turn back.

04:53.040 --> 04:59.820
So that's one of the problems here that we're not locking this out and we do do also need to do a check

05:00.060 --> 05:03.410
to make sure that we are locking it out.

05:03.430 --> 05:06.400
Another problem too is we can keep clicking these.

05:06.530 --> 05:09.150
So we're not actually removing that on click event.

05:09.150 --> 05:11.550
So that's the other thing that we need to make sure.

05:11.550 --> 05:23.800
So we need to make sure that not an array of flipped over so that we can't keep flipping that same card.

05:23.940 --> 05:30.410
So if it is in that array then we're going to skip that and also not locked it.

05:30.480 --> 05:32.320
So we need to have a condition here.

05:32.760 --> 05:40.950
So basically let's set up our condition and this condition is basically going to wrap most of our function

05:40.950 --> 05:44.910
here and it's going to go all the way to here.

05:44.930 --> 05:54.430
And we're going to have an else that's just going to say that Luckett so locked out.

05:55.080 --> 06:00.240
So basically when we're locked out then we don't want anyone to be able to play or click or anything

06:00.240 --> 06:01.150
like that.

06:01.170 --> 06:09.180
So let's let's set our lockout that we did set up a variable for that earlier so the lockout.

06:09.450 --> 06:15.630
So basically once they've flipped over two cards we're going to lock them out from flipping over any

06:15.630 --> 06:18.000
more cards until we can actually do our check.

06:18.180 --> 06:20.530
So let's lock it to true.

06:20.770 --> 06:23.900
And that should be an equal sign.

06:24.020 --> 06:30.320
So we're setting our lockout to true and the next thing that we need to do as well is we need to make

06:30.320 --> 06:36.020
sure that lockout is not not true.

06:36.110 --> 06:39.350
So if lockout is false that we can continue our game play.

06:39.770 --> 06:43.980
And the other thing that we wanted to do is check to see if a tile is in the array.

06:44.000 --> 06:50.740
So for now let's try this one and just see that we can only click two tiles and we can't click any more.

06:51.020 --> 06:58.250
So we've got this lockout here and we need to also remove our lockout down here when we're hiding the

06:58.250 --> 06:58.730
cards.

06:58.760 --> 07:03.770
That's another thing that we need to add in that we've got that play lockout.

07:04.130 --> 07:10.550
So let's set play lockout back to false so that the user can then click on another set of cards.

07:10.820 --> 07:12.740
So go back to it refresh it.

07:12.980 --> 07:18.510
So now we should only be able to select two cards and we're locked out.

07:18.560 --> 07:21.600
So this would help a little bit with the game play.

07:22.790 --> 07:24.930
And basically we're still locked out.

07:24.950 --> 07:29.100
So we did found a match and we're still locked out.

07:29.120 --> 07:31.790
So we need to update the lock as well.

07:31.790 --> 07:35.970
If we found a match then we're not going to remove the lock.

07:35.990 --> 07:41.160
So every time we do the card flipped minus one that we're also removing the locket.

07:41.900 --> 07:45.130
So the game play seems to be working much better now.

07:45.230 --> 07:50.960
We're not getting any of those errors so even though I'm clicking all over the place we see that we

07:50.960 --> 07:57.550
are things are working properly and we also need to add in when we can finish up.

07:57.620 --> 08:02.840
And the other thing that we need to add in is that we can't click the ones that are already selected.

08:04.050 --> 08:10.650
So what I want you to do now pause the video and create a function where we can check to see if a value

08:10.710 --> 08:12.690
is within an array.

08:12.720 --> 08:18.870
So we need two parameters that we're going to pass a value and the array and this will check to see

08:18.930 --> 08:21.350
if the value is within the array.

08:21.510 --> 08:24.890
So the value and the array value.

08:25.530 --> 08:30.660
So go ahead and update this function and we're going to make use of it up here.

08:30.680 --> 08:32.950
We're checking to see if the play lock out.

08:33.090 --> 08:39.900
And we're also going to check to see if the value that we've just clicked is actually within the array.

08:39.930 --> 08:44.100
So does the video try that out and I'll show you the solution coming up.

08:44.100 --> 08:50.550
So the solution is just one line of code and we're going to take that array and we're going to use index

08:50.640 --> 08:50.880
of.

08:50.880 --> 08:55.850
So we've used this several times before where we see if we get that value.

08:56.010 --> 09:02.740
And if the value is greater than negative 1 then we know that it's actually in that array.

09:02.760 --> 09:06.600
If it's negative 1 then we know that it's not in there right.

09:06.810 --> 09:11.250
So that's all we have to do so is going to return a boolean value of true or false.

09:11.400 --> 09:17.430
And this is perfect for what we need it when we pick our value that we want to make sure and check to

09:17.430 --> 09:20.560
see if that value is not in the array.

09:20.780 --> 09:21.870
And we're going to use that.

09:21.870 --> 09:31.900
And so we want to check to see if player lockout is false and we're going to check to see if an array

09:32.310 --> 09:35.560
and this is where we need to pass over that array.

09:37.590 --> 09:42.730
So the array is T.F. oh so much shorter than it was originally.

09:42.930 --> 09:47.070
And also we need to check to see if the value.

09:47.070 --> 09:50.230
So that's the T ID.

09:50.830 --> 09:56.770
And we're going to pass over the array so we're passing over the value and then passing over the array

09:57.070 --> 09:59.530
and we're seeing if it's actually in there.

09:59.680 --> 10:05.630
And let's let's just make sure things are working properly.

10:05.860 --> 10:07.540
So whenever we click at

10:11.120 --> 10:17.050
we should be locked out of actually clicking.

10:17.100 --> 10:22.530
So let's click some of them and we see that we're clicking and we're locked out of the clicking.

10:22.530 --> 10:25.810
So we're not able to click multiple items anymore.

10:26.040 --> 10:27.130
And it is waiting.

10:27.150 --> 10:32.520
So I also want to make sure that we can't click ones that are already flipped over.

10:35.700 --> 10:38.370
So basically it's telling us that it's locked out.

10:38.370 --> 10:41.590
What I'm trying to click the tiles that are already flipped.

10:41.700 --> 10:44.310
So when I click those it just says locked out.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.850
So that's exactly what we want we want them to be looked at.

10:46.850 --> 10:51.610
We don't want users to be able to pick up and click them and click them over again.

10:51.750 --> 10:57.270
So we're able to effectively lock the ability to click and click the tiles.

10:57.460 --> 11:01.830
There's a few more things that we need to add in and a few finishing touches that we need to put up

11:01.860 --> 11:02.910
on the game.

11:02.910 --> 11:06.200
We need to be able to tell if the game is over.

11:06.240 --> 11:12.300
So that's one of the things and then we also need the ability to start the game again and that we can

11:12.660 --> 11:14.580
we can work on an upcoming lesson.
