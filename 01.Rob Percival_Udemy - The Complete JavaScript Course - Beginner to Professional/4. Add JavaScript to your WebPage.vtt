00:01.440 --> 00:07.410
In the previous lesson we created some javascript and added it into our h tim L.

00:07.540 --> 00:12.850
Now you're probably looking at this and saying OK well javascript should be able to do a whole lot more

00:12.850 --> 00:13.310
than this.

00:13.330 --> 00:16.570
And you're correct it can do a lot lot more.

00:16.570 --> 00:19.350
So this is just a simple way to add Javascript.

00:19.510 --> 00:25.570
And usually it's not really a common way to have javascript because for the most part we do try to separate

00:25.630 --> 00:32.290
our javascript out of our aged him out so it's easier to read easier to edit easier to update and so

00:32.290 --> 00:32.830
on.

00:32.830 --> 00:38.210
So you got a few options to Javascript you can add it the script tags.

00:38.230 --> 00:44.440
So these look just like HTL where we've got an opening and closing script and then we've got javascript

00:44.530 --> 00:45.540
in the middle here.

00:45.700 --> 00:51.210
So between the script tags where we open and close this is where all of our content can go.

00:51.340 --> 00:58.990
So we can just as easily take this alert put it in here and for javascript we need to where we don't

00:58.990 --> 01:02.890
need to but it's always a good idea to include those semi-colons.

01:02.920 --> 01:07.780
So I'm going to get rid of that were actually I can just paste it so I can have javascript in a number

01:07.780 --> 01:09.960
of areas within my code.

01:10.180 --> 01:17.020
So I've got my script tag up here and I've got it firing off as the page is going to load so I don't

01:17.020 --> 01:19.790
have any event listener that it's listening for.

01:19.840 --> 01:24.490
So nothing like what is happening here where we're actually listening for the user to take some type

01:24.490 --> 01:25.500
of action.

01:25.540 --> 01:33.040
This script is going to just fire off because the browser reads from top down it's going to hit the

01:33.040 --> 01:38.470
script tags it's going to know that that's part is javascript it's going to see this javascript statement

01:38.710 --> 01:40.680
and it's going to just execute that it.

01:40.810 --> 01:43.380
So let's refresh the page and see what happens.

01:43.510 --> 01:49.190
And there's our hello and maybe we should distinguish all of these Hello's that we're building here.

01:49.270 --> 01:55.420
So unbuild hello to refresh the page again and we see now it's this one that's firing off.

01:55.420 --> 01:58.700
We've got hello and we've got a click OK.

01:58.720 --> 02:01.760
In order to render out the rest of the page.

02:01.810 --> 02:04.170
So that's one way to add Javascript.

02:04.210 --> 02:07.970
And this was a second way that we added within the script tags.

02:07.990 --> 02:15.400
Now a lot of times commonly we usually place script tags at the bottom of the page just before the body

02:15.440 --> 02:19.330
close and there's a number of reasons for doing that.

02:20.230 --> 02:26.610
And mainly because you want all of your each to to load and if you want to access any one of these HDMI

02:26.630 --> 02:33.700
male elements you do need to have them loaded in order to access them via javascript and we are going

02:33.700 --> 02:36.640
to be showing you that as we go through the course as well.

02:36.640 --> 02:44.770
So what I want you to do right now is to pause the video and add in javascript using the script tags

02:45.220 --> 02:51.370
and pass yourself a message you can pass your name and show your name into the alert message and see

02:51.370 --> 02:54.670
it pop up as you refreshed your page.

02:54.670 --> 02:58.620
So once you've completed that then I'm going to show you even more.

02:58.630 --> 03:04.120
Another way to add javascript and this is actually going to be one of the most common ways to add javascript

03:07.060 --> 03:14.500
and just one other note before I show you the last way is that sometimes you're going to see where the

03:14.500 --> 03:22.120
script tag actually has its own attribute and it's identified as something like application Javascript.

03:22.240 --> 03:25.790
And basically what this does is this is the mean type.

03:25.840 --> 03:35.410
So this helps the Internet Explorer or the internet browser understand what type of what type of script

03:35.530 --> 03:41.620
it should be expecting between the script tags and I know that I did just say Internet Explorer and

03:41.620 --> 03:48.460
that's because this is for older browsers and some browsers that aren't compatible with the new just

03:48.760 --> 03:54.560
script tags they do need that older type attribute added into them.

03:54.670 --> 03:58.700
And most of the time this always reverts back to Internet Explorer.

03:58.750 --> 04:03.780
So if you're looking to be backwards compatible you do need to add in the type.

04:03.850 --> 04:08.680
Although most of the modern applications they're not going to include the type if you're just looking

04:08.740 --> 04:10.620
at more modern browsers.

04:10.720 --> 04:14.960
But for backwards compatibility always a good idea to throw that in.

04:15.190 --> 04:23.710
So the last type of script or last way that we wanted to access javascript is as an external file and

04:23.710 --> 04:27.080
this is actually probably the most common way to do this.

04:27.250 --> 04:30.190
And this is probably one of the best ways to do that.

04:30.370 --> 04:35.320
And the reason being so I'm going to comment this one out so we don't have too many that are firing

04:35.380 --> 04:35.870
off.

04:36.070 --> 04:38.540
And this one has gone.

04:38.620 --> 04:44.320
Initially it's going to look the same but instead of having our tags between the script tags we're going

04:44.320 --> 04:51.280
to specify a source within the attribute and then here is where we specify the path to our javascript

04:51.280 --> 04:51.930
file.

04:52.090 --> 04:55.860
And this is also I could bring in javascript libraries like Querrey.

04:55.900 --> 04:57.070
And so on.

04:57.100 --> 05:03.590
So I'm going to just create a file called script g s and I'm going to link it in the script tags.

05:03.760 --> 05:10.210
And basically now when the page loads actually going to be looking for a script just ask because it's

05:10.210 --> 05:15.100
going to try to render out any of the content located within scripture as.

05:15.280 --> 05:19.100
So now we need to create script G-S create a brand new file.

05:19.240 --> 05:21.640
And here I can add an alert.

05:21.880 --> 05:30.220
And this time I'm going to say hello three and we'll just see this and we call this script.

05:30.240 --> 05:30.610
G.

05:30.620 --> 05:34.620
S. so always make sure that your paths are correct.

05:34.680 --> 05:41.450
So this one is on the same same directory as my index file so that's where I'm just linking to it.

05:41.640 --> 05:47.520
But if you've got it in a folder or if you've got an external Web site then make sure that you're taking

05:47.520 --> 05:51.330
care of the linking properly to access that file.

05:51.330 --> 05:58.020
So now we can go back to index and we see that what's going to happen is the browser is going to render

05:58.020 --> 06:03.270
out all this code is going to hit this on clicks it's going to register this click event so that's going

06:03.270 --> 06:04.420
to be ready to go.

06:04.440 --> 06:06.020
It's going to read the script.

06:06.060 --> 06:06.570
J.

06:06.800 --> 06:11.880
So it's going to fire off all of that code and notice that I don't have to wrap it within the script

06:11.880 --> 06:18.360
tags because this is a G-S file meaning it's a javascript file and it's understood that it's a javascript

06:18.360 --> 06:22.790
smile and I am linking to it from the script tags as well.

06:22.800 --> 06:24.420
So basically that's a link.

06:24.420 --> 06:29.460
And over here I've commented out the alerts so I'm not going to get that hello to firing off.

06:29.490 --> 06:36.270
And now let's go back out into a browser refresh the page and we're going to see Halo 3 is firing off.

06:36.330 --> 06:40.830
So there's a lot of reasons for using external files.

06:41.040 --> 06:49.740
And the main one is that they're reusable that you can link to the same G-S file from one each time

06:49.760 --> 06:53.700
a file or a thousand or 10000 It doesn't matter.

06:53.700 --> 06:56.070
You can link to it from multiple ways.

06:56.070 --> 07:02.880
And this really provides a lot of flexibility in your application because you can open this up and you

07:02.880 --> 07:08.310
can make a change and have it reflect across your entire web site or any of the pages that are actually

07:08.310 --> 07:09.990
linking to this.

07:10.010 --> 07:17.030
This J.S. file and other benefit is that you'll be able to separate out your javascript from your aged

07:17.030 --> 07:17.560
him.

07:17.700 --> 07:23.850
And that's why I said that normally you don't see a lot of this anymore because we're trying to separate

07:23.850 --> 07:27.840
out writing scripts in the H-2 him as much as possible.

07:27.900 --> 07:33.660
And if we can bring this out and include it into an external script file then if we do need to add in

07:33.660 --> 07:37.120
our javascript we know exactly where to go and where to look for it.

07:37.170 --> 07:42.640
Otherwise it does get a little bit complex because we have to sift through a whole bunch of H-2 mail.

07:42.660 --> 07:45.160
And in this case there's not a lot here.

07:45.210 --> 07:51.720
But in some cases you will run into a lot of HMO and it does become difficult to really sift through

07:51.720 --> 07:54.390
it and make good use of it.

07:54.570 --> 08:03.120
So those are the three ways that you can add javascript into your page and they all have their own benefits.

08:03.180 --> 08:08.100
And normally if you're writing a lot of script or if you're really using your javascript keep in an

08:08.100 --> 08:09.580
external script file.

08:09.690 --> 08:17.310
If you do have some javascript if you're doing a one page site or if you've got some simple code that's

08:17.430 --> 08:24.390
just reflective on each team that you have on the one page then you can add it in as a script file where

08:24.470 --> 08:25.920
between the script tags.

08:25.980 --> 08:32.040
This will make it look a little bit faster because it's going to have less server requests than loading

08:32.070 --> 08:33.400
and other external file.

08:33.570 --> 08:41.040
And then lastly if you have no other choice you can add it in as a click event or an attribute within

08:41.070 --> 08:43.560
that element.

08:43.560 --> 08:50.040
So what I want you to do now is to open up your editor and use that same alert function that we use

08:50.040 --> 08:52.920
within this lesson and try them for yourself.

08:52.920 --> 09:00.900
So I didn't as an attribute out it in as a script within your file within your age to Metafile.

09:01.020 --> 09:09.030
And then lastly I added in as a separate J.S. file and linked to it within your H-2 him out try it out

09:09.210 --> 09:11.810
and Pastor So some interesting messages.

09:11.900 --> 09:17.310
And in the next lesson we're going to be jumping into dev tools and then you show you a little bit more

09:17.310 --> 09:22.740
about how we can use dev tools within our development process.

09:22.740 --> 09:24.480
So that's coming up in the next lesson.
