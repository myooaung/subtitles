00:01.690 --> 00:08.070
This lesson I want to go over some of the next steps with javascript.

00:08.080 --> 00:13.060
Now there are some great resources on line and with javascript.

00:13.060 --> 00:18.670
We saw the power of bringing in javascript libraries and how much additional functionality they could

00:18.760 --> 00:20.970
add to our applications.

00:20.970 --> 00:22.420
It is a great resource.

00:22.420 --> 00:31.570
Java scripting dot com and this lists all of the most popular new and just overall trending javascript

00:31.570 --> 00:33.220
libraries that are out there.

00:33.280 --> 00:39.100
So there's a number of these that I'm sure you've heard of and ant and all of these libraries allow

00:39.100 --> 00:42.430
us to extend what we can do with javascript.

00:42.430 --> 00:44.010
There's also a query.

00:44.110 --> 00:50.680
So the Querrey is probably one of the most popular javascript libraries and there's also angular re-act

00:50.740 --> 00:51.470
view.

00:51.490 --> 00:53.650
So these are some of the more popular ones.

00:53.650 --> 01:01.510
There's ones that are more specific such as 3. G-S allows you to build a G-S a 3D library materialise

01:01.840 --> 01:02.830
foundation.

01:02.950 --> 01:08.880
So there frameworks for designing web sites similar to bootstrap.

01:08.890 --> 01:14.620
So it's just a lot of libraries here so I do encourage you to take a look around and try out some of

01:14.620 --> 01:15.330
these libraries.

01:15.330 --> 01:16.030
Bring them in.

01:16.030 --> 01:23.140
Tax for these libraries may not look familiar at all because they've each got their own set of javascript

01:23.200 --> 01:24.070
methods.

01:24.070 --> 01:27.660
So even though they're based on Javascript it is going to look different.

01:27.670 --> 01:33.400
This is why it's really important to have a good solid understanding of javascript before jumping into

01:33.400 --> 01:34.690
any one of these libraries.

01:34.690 --> 01:40.860
If you're looking for hosted libraries there's a great resource developers dot Google dot com.

01:40.870 --> 01:46.720
This is a great place to get hosted libraries so what host of libraries do is they simply allow you

01:46.720 --> 01:54.340
to bring angular or Jay Querrey directly into your project without actually having to download the source

01:54.340 --> 01:54.870
files.

01:54.990 --> 01:58.740
And if you notice as well that there m i n g s.

01:58.840 --> 02:01.810
So that means that there are minute fight versions of the file.

02:01.870 --> 02:06.070
These are ones where all the whitespace is removed and they're very hard to read.

02:06.130 --> 02:11.920
If you do want to make use of them if you're Or if you have to make use of them then best suggestion

02:11.950 --> 02:16.310
is to go to a javascript beautifier paste them in and beautify it.

02:16.360 --> 02:22.270
And this is going to add in all that whitespace back in and make them readable once again going back

02:22.270 --> 02:27.880
into the course and looking through all of the source files and exercises that there are contained within

02:27.880 --> 02:28.520
the course.

02:28.660 --> 02:34.120
You can go back and you can apply some of the newer things that you've learned back into those exercises

02:34.330 --> 02:40.210
and prove them make them better extend expand them and really make them in your own add them into your

02:40.210 --> 02:49.120
per folios and grow your scope of different projects that you've worked on and practice Javascript.

02:49.180 --> 02:55.090
So that's one of the main things and takeaways from this course is to continue to practice and expand

02:55.090 --> 02:56.920
on your knowledge with javascript.
