Welcome back into the previous lesson we saw how we can retrieve information from the object.

00:06.640 --> 00:10.050
And this time let's update some information object.

00:10.050 --> 00:16.000
And we actually had a clue earlier on when we looked at this constructor method because we saw that

00:16.180 --> 00:21.930
we could just like we are setting variable values and were setting array values.

00:22.030 --> 00:27.910
We can set values for the object so we can do the same thing that we've got over there are going to

00:27.910 --> 00:37.630
get rid of some of this access here and I'm going to just simply output car and update this to be car.

00:38.560 --> 00:46.180
So if we want to change our Mustang color from red to blue and we can go and we can refresh it and we

00:46.180 --> 00:48.840
can see that now that color is blue.

00:48.840 --> 00:50.450
So it's as easy as that.

00:50.470 --> 00:57.880
Specify what you want to change and you're able to make that change directly within your object.

00:57.970 --> 01:02.210
So it's as easy as that to make updates to our values.

01:02.380 --> 01:08.740
And of course we can also do this in the console here so we can update the value.

01:08.770 --> 01:11.670
And of course we need to do that assignment operator.

01:11.740 --> 01:17.240
So if we want to sign it and make it black we see that our response back is whatever.

01:17.250 --> 01:19.170
Then you assign that value is.

01:19.300 --> 01:23.380
And now if I go car I can see that the color has changed.

01:23.410 --> 01:24.830
So this is the same thing.

01:24.850 --> 01:28.300
If we do the bracket notation.

01:28.300 --> 01:33.180
So if we do color and I it keep changing this color.

01:33.460 --> 01:38.080
So it's a lot easier to change it within the object than it would actually physically be able to paint

01:38.080 --> 01:38.660
it.

01:38.830 --> 01:40.120
But that's beside the point.

01:40.120 --> 01:48.220
So let's change it to yellow and refresh it and we can see that now our car color yellow we refresh

01:48.310 --> 01:52.020
the object and we can see now the color is yellow.

01:52.240 --> 01:54.540
So it's as easy as that to make changes.

01:54.700 --> 02:04.800
And also if I want to delete out of value from my object so let's say I don't want to use color anymore

02:04.990 --> 02:12.850
I can use the keyword delete and then I can specify car color and we can see that it comes back.

02:12.850 --> 02:16.200
True because it actually existed within the object.

02:16.270 --> 02:19.350
And now when I list the object it's gone.

02:19.600 --> 02:24.150
So we don't see it anymore within our object so we can't delete it.

02:24.190 --> 02:31.270
That's those items and then added I can all we to do is car dot color.

02:31.360 --> 02:33.880
So the same way that we were creating it.

02:34.150 --> 02:38.270
And let's let's bring it back to our bread Mustang.

02:38.530 --> 02:45.030
So now when I put a car we can see that the color is back in there and it's red now.

02:45.610 --> 02:52.270
So you can see how easy it is to update the content contained within the object and make use of that

02:52.360 --> 02:54.380
within your javascript.

02:54.820 --> 03:00.590
And lastly I kind of want to go back to what we've been doing earlier where we look at typeof.

03:00.630 --> 03:04.210
So what do you think type of car is going to be.

03:04.300 --> 03:07.200
We saw that arrays came back as objects.

03:07.360 --> 03:12.340
So what do you think this one's going to come back as and if you object.

03:12.360 --> 03:18.880
You're correct because objects are objects in Javascript.

03:19.640 --> 03:26.470
So what I want you to do now is take what you've learned in this lesson and try it for yourself.

03:26.540 --> 03:31.820
Work with creating some objects again looking around at what you see in the real world.

03:31.820 --> 03:37.790
Create an object around it and then update that object with some additional values.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
With new lines of code and you syntax.

03:42.100 --> 03:48.200
So making some updates to your original object as you make some more observations and see what other

03:48.250 --> 03:50.540
properties those objects have.
