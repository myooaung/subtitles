Welcome back in in this lesson we're looking at how we can pull in data and then we can also store it

00:07.680 --> 00:09.140
to local storage.

00:09.330 --> 00:14.310
So this exercise we wanted to store to local storage.

00:14.460 --> 00:19.990
So let's go ahead and add that in here and I hope you had an opportunity to try that out.

00:20.040 --> 00:30.830
So let's let's check the local storage local storage and that was item and store it in party.

00:30.870 --> 00:33.100
And of course you might call it something different.

00:33.570 --> 00:39.260
And if it exists then we know that we can actually get the value.

00:39.300 --> 00:44.220
So party will be equal to Jason.

00:44.240 --> 00:48.070
And this is where we need to practice the parsing and the string of phi.

00:48.090 --> 00:53.400
So we know we can parse through whatever value because it's going to be stored as a string value.

00:53.550 --> 00:58.380
So we know if this is there then we simply pull that out and we parse it.

00:58.380 --> 01:05.820
Otherwise we're going to get the data from that data file and then we still need to parse it.

01:05.820 --> 01:06.480
So there we go.

01:06.480 --> 01:08.100
So we are going to parse that through.

01:08.100 --> 01:10.640
So one way or another we're going to get that data.

01:10.770 --> 01:17.010
So right now as it is because we're not setting it to local storage yet that it's always going to be

01:17.340 --> 01:19.260
adding and saving it.

01:19.320 --> 01:24.990
So the next thing that we need to do is we need to set it to the local storage.

01:24.990 --> 01:26.380
And this is where we're going to practice.

01:26.380 --> 01:28.280
JS on string a fine.

01:28.500 --> 01:37.140
So next thing and I believe there's probably two places that you need to added in and set party and

01:37.200 --> 01:43.020
Jaison string ify the value of party selling the item because there's actually two places where we're

01:43.020 --> 01:45.100
doing a full update of that.

01:45.360 --> 01:55.510
So go ahead and make those changes and think of where we're actually updating the visual inputs.

01:55.620 --> 02:01.980
So we've got an event listener here and we also are adding over here so there's two spots where we need

02:01.980 --> 02:06.010
to get the value of party unstring defiant.

02:06.060 --> 02:06.720
So go ahead.

02:06.720 --> 02:10.230
Pause the video add that in and I'll show you the solution coming up.

02:11.680 --> 02:17.830
So if you had an opportunity to try that out and I we need to store it into local storage so that we

02:17.830 --> 02:19.220
can make use of the data.

02:19.270 --> 02:24.340
So the data initially is coming from the Jaison file but what we're doing is we're storing it in the

02:24.340 --> 02:25.510
local storage.

02:25.510 --> 02:27.200
So let's go ahead and add that in.

02:27.220 --> 02:30.980
So local storage and set item.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.020
So whenever we make that update and we called it party.

02:35.020 --> 02:36.970
So let's go ahead and call that party.

02:37.150 --> 02:45.420
And this is where we use Jason string of ephi and we string a fly the contents of party.

02:45.970 --> 02:52.120
And whenever you're working with Jason it's really it's really useful to be comfortable with string

02:52.120 --> 02:53.260
of phi and parce.

02:53.390 --> 02:59.170
That's one of the reasons why we're going through this exercise just to Gary get comfortable with the

02:59.170 --> 03:06.880
fact that we're string of flying it and this gives us the ability to make it into a string format and

03:06.880 --> 03:11.830
then we pull that information back when we parse it into adjacent parts.

03:11.980 --> 03:13.570
So that's what's happening there.

03:13.600 --> 03:16.960
So over here we're updating and we're adding.

03:17.080 --> 03:20.190
And then over here as well we've made some updates.

03:20.200 --> 03:29.280
So any time we're updating the party party array value we need to send it to local storage so that it's

03:29.290 --> 03:30.480
stored properly.

03:30.760 --> 03:33.310
So let's go ahead and save this.

03:33.490 --> 03:35.660
Let's check this off.

03:35.800 --> 03:37.390
Refresh the page.

03:37.390 --> 03:39.340
Let's add somebody new in here.

03:40.740 --> 03:48.140
And refresh again and we can see that we are able to track those changes and refresh it again.

03:48.150 --> 03:51.790
So now it's just taking that data from the local storage.

03:51.870 --> 03:57.390
And if your browser isn't supporting local storage it's always going to pull that information back from

03:57.390 --> 03:58.710
that data file.

03:59.130 --> 04:07.530
So the next lesson we're going to look back at using this data based on data using AJAX in order to

04:07.530 --> 04:08.030
query it.

04:08.030 --> 04:15.680
So it's going to work a little bit better than actually equaling it to a Jaison object as a string value.

04:15.810 --> 04:19.060
And I'll show you how to do that in the upcoming lesson.
