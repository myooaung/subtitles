Welcome back in this lesson we're going to be applying what we learned in the previous lesson where

00:05.400 --> 00:08.250
we saw how we can change our arrays.

00:08.280 --> 00:12.380
So let's start with a very basic three with four items in it.

00:12.390 --> 00:17.190
So we've got cat dog rabbit and a bird so it's not order.

00:17.220 --> 00:22.660
And when we refresh the page we get an output of cat dog rabbit and bird.

00:22.890 --> 00:32.550
And what I want you to do is to open up your Ed. Take this simple array and try to get this output.

00:32.550 --> 00:37.190
So we've got horse FISH FISH FISH FISH FISH FISH FISH.

00:37.230 --> 00:39.210
So there's seven fish in there.

00:39.480 --> 00:41.440
Rabbit dog and sheep.

00:41.520 --> 00:47.280
So this is what the result is that it won't take what you learned in the previous lesson and there probably

00:47.280 --> 00:49.950
are a number of ways to accomplish this.

00:50.010 --> 00:55.430
So try to create the shortest possible path to get your array to look like this.

00:55.580 --> 01:00.660
And so when you console log it and get it to look with these values.

01:00.780 --> 01:02.060
So pause the video.

01:02.070 --> 01:07.980
Open up your editor or open up your browser because you could just as easily places within your browser

01:08.220 --> 01:15.310
and do your modifications of the array content and see if you can get it to look like this.

01:17.590 --> 01:20.630
So we had the opportunity to try this out.

01:20.840 --> 01:23.130
And now I show you the solution.

01:23.140 --> 01:28.640
So first of all what we wanted to do is to make our array a little bit longer.

01:28.900 --> 01:36.240
And we saw that down here at the end our array has force here.

01:36.280 --> 01:40.770
So let's add horse in.

01:41.980 --> 01:45.800
So now when we refresh our array it looks like this.

01:45.820 --> 01:47.920
And we've got all of those undefined.

01:48.160 --> 01:55.110
And in the previous lesson we saw how we can actually take care of all those undefined by using fill.

01:55.130 --> 01:56.360
So let's use Phil

01:59.430 --> 02:04.300
and within Phil we see that we've got fish repeat a whole bunch of times.

02:04.470 --> 02:07.650
So we can set that fill in at this point.

02:07.650 --> 02:09.650
We started at three.

02:09.660 --> 02:11.460
So then I started it after bird

02:15.640 --> 02:17.170
or actually we need to start.

02:17.170 --> 02:21.280
We're not we don't have bird included in there so let's start it at three.

02:21.310 --> 02:23.690
So it's going to be one to three.

02:23.710 --> 02:25.010
So it's going to overwrite it.

02:25.030 --> 02:26.300
So that's the starting point.

02:26.350 --> 02:32.830
And we saw that in the last lesson as well that whatever index you specify it actually overwrites that

02:32.830 --> 02:35.660
one and it goes all the way to 10.

02:35.710 --> 02:38.340
So stopping just before it hits horse.

02:38.350 --> 02:40.700
So let's try this out now and refreshed it.

02:40.840 --> 02:48.130
So now we've got cat dog rabbit bunch of fish and horse and we see that it actually starts in the reverse

02:48.130 --> 02:49.100
order.

02:49.120 --> 02:53.650
So let's actually now let's reverse the order of it.

02:53.710 --> 02:56.950
So this one is reverse.

02:57.020 --> 03:00.060
So it's the method that we're going to use built in method.

03:00.880 --> 03:03.010
And now let's refresh it.

03:03.040 --> 03:11.290
And so now it's starting to look a lot more like what we have over here except cat is sheep and everything

03:11.290 --> 03:12.450
else looks the same.

03:12.450 --> 03:14.350
We've got the seven fish in there.

03:14.590 --> 03:16.990
So there's a number of things that we could do here.

03:17.060 --> 03:20.700
And of course you could do the new holder.

03:20.710 --> 03:25.900
You could specify that last item and you could just replace it with sheep.

03:26.140 --> 03:31.450
But what I wanted to do is I want to just go through some of the methods that we use last time.

03:31.570 --> 03:40.930
So we'll pop basically remove out that cat and add in our new one by using new folder again and this

03:40.930 --> 03:43.240
time we're going to push that value in.

03:43.330 --> 03:49.100
And as I said there's probably several ways that you could do this you could accomplish the same thing.

03:49.480 --> 03:55.390
And this one over here you could have done it a little bit shorter by just specifying that last item

03:55.450 --> 03:56.760
needs changed to sheep.

03:56.790 --> 03:59.640
So you could have done that as well and that would be correct as well.

03:59.660 --> 04:02.790
And at that point you'd get that same output.

04:02.800 --> 04:09.160
So let's refresh it and make sure that we did get that same put within our range and everything looks

04:09.160 --> 04:10.000
correct.

04:10.000 --> 04:16.570
So I can even copy that and paste that in there and we can do a quick eyeball comparison and we see

04:16.570 --> 04:21.180
that in fact they are the same the values are all the same.

04:21.250 --> 04:23.740
And we did accomplish our goal.

04:23.740 --> 04:29.740
So have some fun with it and try it out for yourself and see all the different methods that you can

04:29.740 --> 04:37.500
apply in order to accomplish this and put starting with these four items in the array.

04:39.140 --> 04:45.590
So the next lesson were to look at some more methods that are available for arrays providing even more

04:45.590 --> 04:47.440
power for our arrays.

04:47.450 --> 04:48.310
So that's coming up.
