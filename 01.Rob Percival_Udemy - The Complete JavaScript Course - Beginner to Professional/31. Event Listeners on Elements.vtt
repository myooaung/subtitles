00:01.060 --> 00:05.830
Welcome back in in this lesson we're going to introduce event listeners.

00:05.890 --> 00:12.970
So previously we've looked at event handlers and we know that every element can only have one event

00:12.970 --> 00:20.380
handler and that forces us if we want mouseover mouse out in order to do it in line with the attributes.

00:20.380 --> 00:26.290
And if we're trying to separate our javascript from our age to a male that doesn't go over well so I'm

00:26.290 --> 00:31.970
going to show you another way to do this and this is going to be with event listeners.

00:31.990 --> 00:39.250
So this is newer So some of the older browsers I think it's below ideate they're not going to be able

00:39.250 --> 00:41.570
to handle out of that listener.

00:41.830 --> 00:48.490
So just be mindful of the fact that this isn't going to work across all browsers but it's actually going

00:48.490 --> 00:55.770
to give us the ability to add multiple event listeners multiple events on the same element.

00:57.070 --> 00:58.460
So let's open up.

00:58.460 --> 01:01.140
And so this is what we had in our previous code.

01:01.270 --> 01:10.090
And what I wanted to do is basically fix this up so that we can have that source there and we can do

01:10.090 --> 01:13.590
the most over's despite accessing the ID.

01:13.780 --> 01:16.510
So let's get rid of the stuff we had here.

01:16.600 --> 01:22.600
And I'm also going to simply I'm going to grab the source of this image or actually we are loading the

01:22.600 --> 01:26.950
source of the image over here so we're doing that dynamically when the page loads.

01:26.980 --> 01:33.130
So keep that in place so that will keep it nice and neat and that will give us full control over whatever

01:33.130 --> 01:35.790
image we're actually loading into the page.

01:35.790 --> 01:41.680
And this is from the previous lesson where we're looking at handling mouse events.

01:41.740 --> 01:46.330
So that was earlier where we're looking at just different ways of handling mouse events.

01:46.320 --> 01:54.740
We do a mouseover and most and other really cool thing about it is we action we can add event listeners

01:54.770 --> 01:57.210
and we can also remove that listeners.

01:57.320 --> 02:05.150
So that becomes a really useful when we're trying to update and do even more with our elements.

02:05.150 --> 02:11.480
So now let's build out this functionality that we have down here where we're swamping the image so get

02:11.480 --> 02:15.410
rid of that and I'll bring that rate down to the bottom because we're not going to need that we're just

02:15.410 --> 02:19.480
going to need it simply as a guide within our web project.

02:20.920 --> 02:26.410
So let me make a few more adjustments because we're going to need a global variable that's going to

02:26.410 --> 02:31.910
access this particular element because we're going to have to access that number of times.

02:31.930 --> 02:33.300
So this will be my image.

02:33.310 --> 02:36.180
So just give it a variable of I.

02:37.180 --> 02:44.690
And that way we know that we can load the source on load and we can get the value of the image loader

02:44.710 --> 02:47.210
so set up all of her variables at the top.

02:47.320 --> 02:55.310
So just doing some reorganizing and this way we can clean up some of this code where we don't have to

02:55.310 --> 02:59.960
keep continuously repeat and we'll keep the message one as well.

03:00.050 --> 03:03.310
And I wanted to get rid of these ones that we have here.

03:04.630 --> 03:08.000
So let's see if things are still working or what's broken.

03:08.050 --> 03:10.930
So we know that when we click it we're still getting that clicked.

03:10.960 --> 03:15.100
So that's still working and that's working within that new set up.

03:15.100 --> 03:20.090
So now let's add in some additional event listeners.

03:20.210 --> 03:25.100
So I want to actually update this one first because this is the first one that we're looking at.

03:25.190 --> 03:30.590
So we're going to do I guess are grabbing that same object and we're doing ad event listeners so we're

03:30.590 --> 03:35.030
able to register event to a Target basically.

03:35.030 --> 03:40.330
So add to that listener and we need to specify what type of event that we're listening for.

03:40.430 --> 03:43.220
So it's going to be a click that we're listening for.

03:43.310 --> 03:51.110
And once it gets clicked then we're going to do a function in here and we can pick up that event information

03:51.350 --> 03:56.930
within the parameters here which we don't actually need to but just for the sake of it we're going to

03:56.930 --> 03:58.950
pick that information up there.

03:59.330 --> 04:03.640
So now that we've clicked it we can console log.

04:03.800 --> 04:10.240
So we'll console log the event object and we'll also do message.

04:10.260 --> 04:13.420
Clicked now and now I can get rid of this part here.

04:13.480 --> 04:16.290
So let's go back out and refreshed.

04:16.540 --> 04:22.170
And now you can see when I click it we've got that mouse event firing off.

04:22.340 --> 04:28.550
And if you don't want to pass it as a parameter by default it will pass in as event.

04:28.580 --> 04:33.500
So this will do the same thing if I go out here and if I refresh it I can still click and I can still

04:33.500 --> 04:35.360
get that most event information.

04:36.370 --> 04:40.750
So let's add in some more mouse events and this time.

04:40.780 --> 04:45.680
Let's do so we've got that click or let's add in a mouse event.

04:45.700 --> 04:47.810
So I want to add in the mouse over.

04:47.830 --> 04:50.320
So let's do the message.

04:50.350 --> 04:57.640
And over so simply Now whenever we're over it we should see the mouse over there.

04:57.740 --> 05:04.610
So now when we hover over it we can see that we've got that mouse again being triggered off.

05:04.610 --> 05:10.620
Next we can do on mouse out or mouse move.

05:10.670 --> 05:12.610
So we've got a number of options.

05:12.650 --> 05:15.400
Let's do most.

05:15.460 --> 05:19.970
So before we were using mouse over and mouse.

05:20.150 --> 05:23.120
So we're going to do the same one so we've got mouse.

05:23.270 --> 05:27.530
And actually there should be mouse over and this one is out so we can see that.

05:27.530 --> 05:29.190
Now it should fire off.

05:29.480 --> 05:33.200
So let's just make sure that everything is working so we know that we're over.

05:33.320 --> 05:34.700
And now we know that we're out.

05:34.880 --> 05:38.300
So we're all ready to actually swap our image.

05:38.480 --> 05:45.430
So the next thing that we need to do is simply add in what we want to do and what we want to swap out.

05:45.650 --> 05:51.150
And earlier we saw that we've already hooked up that.

05:51.250 --> 05:53.570
So this is the active event.

05:53.590 --> 05:57.780
So what we can do is when we're mouse over it we can do this.

05:57.840 --> 06:02.650
Source.

06:02.880 --> 06:08.190
And now all we need to do is specify the value that we want for the source.

06:09.000 --> 06:17.460
And I believe that we were using the placeholder dot com values so we want to do the second image whenever

06:17.460 --> 06:18.730
we hover over it.

06:18.870 --> 06:20.350
So now let's try this out.

06:20.460 --> 06:26.400
So whenever we're over we're swapping out the image and now the only thing that's left is to create

06:26.460 --> 06:28.160
a place holder.

06:28.170 --> 06:31.250
So we're just going to hold the value in t

06:36.760 --> 06:49.280
grabbed the old value the original value of this source before we overwrite it and place it within the.

06:49.300 --> 06:55.470
And now what I want you to do is pause the video and take care of the mouse.

06:55.660 --> 07:01.180
So make sure that it's going to work that whenever we're over it shows the red image.

07:01.210 --> 07:04.500
And we when we go out it shows the original image.

07:04.540 --> 07:06.760
So I want you to add that into the script.

07:06.820 --> 07:11.330
So pause the video and add it into the script and I'll show you the solution coming up.

07:13.140 --> 07:16.600
So welcome back and I hope you had an opportunity to try that out.

07:16.800 --> 07:24.860
And the solution for this we can simply grab this because we've got this object and we know that that

07:24.900 --> 07:27.530
old image was being stored in t.

07:27.690 --> 07:29.060
So this is all we have to do.

07:29.160 --> 07:36.420
We just need to update that value of that source to the previous value that we have stored.

07:36.420 --> 07:42.240
So now when we ever we hover over it and we go off of it we can see we've got the mouse over and mouse.

07:42.420 --> 07:45.910
And when we click it our Click event is still firing off.

07:46.080 --> 07:52.760
So everything is working as before but we've actually had a nice separation from our script.

07:52.890 --> 07:58.410
And if we actually were linking to a script file the H Tim L would be nice and clean and we don't have

07:58.410 --> 08:08.300
any javascript now in between as attributes within our H-2 mail and the event listener gives us the

08:08.300 --> 08:16.210
ability to handle multiple event events on the same element.

08:16.220 --> 08:23.060
So go ahead and try to do it for yourself in multiple event listeners you cannot in as many as you want

08:23.300 --> 08:29.300
on the same element and separate go back to some of the earlier code that we had written and go back

08:29.360 --> 08:37.940
and separate out the h tim L from the Java Script writing it all within the script tags or within a

08:37.950 --> 08:39.010
G-S file.
