WEBVTT

00:01.420 --> 00:02.180
Welcome back.

00:02.200 --> 00:06.150
And in this lesson we're going to set up some more variables and values.

00:06.280 --> 00:10.300
So we do need to hold some more information within our game.

00:10.300 --> 00:13.530
So we need to hold our tile images.

00:14.110 --> 00:18.190
So we need to create an array that contains all of our tile images.

00:23.050 --> 00:30.090
And this is going to be our initial array also create another array that has the tile array.

00:30.220 --> 00:34.380
So this is going to be all of our tiles that are our current tiles.

00:34.840 --> 00:40.750
And we can actually shorten this as well so we can them separate them out and declare a whole bunch

00:40.750 --> 00:50.700
of these within this one statement and the other one we need to track which tiles are flipped over.

00:50.740 --> 00:52.100
So are doing another array.

00:52.210 --> 00:58.810
And this is the one that's actually going to hold all of the tiles that are flipped over so that we

00:58.810 --> 01:04.300
can have several different arrays that we can do some comparisons with.

01:04.300 --> 01:05.640
So first thing that we need to do.

01:05.650 --> 01:11.450
So let's go back here and the first thing that we need to do is highlight that's the start button.

01:11.470 --> 01:17.360
So in Everetts gets clicked then what I want to do is hide it so I don't want that on the screen anymore.

01:17.410 --> 01:18.190
So go ahead.

01:18.220 --> 01:20.950
Pause the video and hide that start button.

01:21.070 --> 01:25.450
Using what we learned within the dorm and stiles and I'll show you how to do that.

01:25.450 --> 01:30.370
Coming up so let's go ahead and hide that start button.

01:30.380 --> 01:32.810
So we've got it within the espie object.

01:32.840 --> 01:39.620
So once we click it then next step is to apply our style to it and the style that we're going to apply

01:39.650 --> 01:43.270
is display.

01:43.500 --> 01:46.350
And we're going to set this value to display.

01:46.380 --> 01:47.340
None.

01:47.340 --> 01:50.220
So basically that's going to hide the button when it gets clicks.

01:50.220 --> 01:51.610
So let's refresh it.

01:51.690 --> 01:54.270
Click the button and we're ready to go.

01:54.660 --> 01:58.020
So next step is to build out our race.

01:58.020 --> 02:05.550
So for this let's create a function to do this and we'll create a function called Build array and then

02:05.550 --> 02:12.160
hear what we want to do is we want to loop through and create an array of images.

02:14.640 --> 02:20.940
So this is where if you had a bunch of images to use you can load them all in here according to their

02:20.940 --> 02:21.750
values.

02:21.900 --> 02:28.190
But what I can do is I'm going to create these dynamically using placeholder dot com that we saw earlier.

02:28.200 --> 02:37.310
So starting at a value of 1 we're doing X while X is less than 7 and we're incrementing x.

02:37.350 --> 02:43.950
So basically we're going to do tile images and this is that brand new array that we're going to build

02:43.950 --> 02:52.330
out and we're going to push into there with the value of x and let's add in.

02:52.350 --> 02:53.790
So we're going to simulate that.

02:53.790 --> 02:54.870
These are images

02:57.490 --> 02:57.970
so there we are.

02:57.970 --> 02:59.560
So that's our first step.

02:59.590 --> 03:00.820
And then that's done.

03:00.820 --> 03:04.660
So we've got some images within tyle images and we're ready to go.

03:04.660 --> 03:11.820
So all we need to do do is replace update this here and we're building out our image array.

03:12.100 --> 03:14.860
So the next thing that we need to do is shuffle

03:17.640 --> 03:18.980
our tile array.

03:19.200 --> 03:26.230
So with the memory game we actually have a set of images but we have two of each image.

03:26.250 --> 03:31.070
So in order to do that we still need to do that when we're building out this array.

03:31.230 --> 03:39.630
So we know with tile images we're actually able to duplicate this and we saw a method earlier we're

03:39.630 --> 03:41.110
looking at arrays.

03:41.250 --> 03:47.640
So what I want you to do is pause the video and duplicate tile images into itself.

03:47.790 --> 03:57.080
So basically for each one of these X concatenated with Jay Peggs we're going to have 12 tiles and they're

03:57.290 --> 04:05.150
all going from one to seven values and then having those as the values and we're going to simply duplicate

04:05.150 --> 04:06.690
those out.

04:06.740 --> 04:10.120
So I paused the video and I'll show you the solution coming up.

04:10.120 --> 04:14.040
So a solution for this is that let's create.

04:14.150 --> 04:18.390
So we've got our tile images and this time we're going to use tile array.

04:20.030 --> 04:24.920
And what we're going to do is that newly created array of images.

04:24.920 --> 04:28.140
So this could also be a preset set of images.

04:28.280 --> 04:34.280
So if you had a bunch of images that you want to use within this project you could skip this building

04:34.360 --> 04:39.720
of the race step and you could just simply have that array with six images in there.

04:39.860 --> 04:48.030
And then this way we can concatenate tile images and we're going to use the concat method within arrays

04:48.320 --> 04:51.120
and basically concatenate it to itself.

04:51.530 --> 05:00.870
So at the end of the day we end up with tile array containing two sets pairs of images from the tile

05:00.870 --> 05:01.560
images.

05:01.620 --> 05:03.800
And this is one where we just built it there.

05:04.050 --> 05:07.450
So the next step is to shuffle our array.

05:07.670 --> 05:10.470
And we've done this before several times.

05:10.470 --> 05:16.470
So I'm going to run through this fairly quickly and this is the same function that we've used before

05:16.680 --> 05:18.950
where we take in an array.

05:19.410 --> 05:25.550
So we call it shuffle array so we can take in the array value.

05:25.660 --> 05:31.260
And I and I did mention earlier that this is a very useful function to have and we've used that several

05:31.260 --> 05:32.490
times.

05:32.490 --> 05:36.330
So this is a great way to shuffle array values.

05:36.600 --> 05:44.870
So first thing that we need to do is loop our array and we're going to loop that.

05:44.900 --> 05:49.190
So we're actually setting up as our default value isn't going to be zero.

05:49.220 --> 05:56.240
It's going to be the length of the array minus one because we arrays started in 0 and we're going to

05:56.240 --> 05:59.470
loop while x is greater than zero.

05:59.480 --> 06:02.250
So this is going to be backwards loop.

06:02.240 --> 06:05.840
We're going to loop down instead of looping up which we normally do.

06:06.110 --> 06:13.250
And then at the end once we've reorganized that array and we've shuffled it we're simply going to return

06:13.250 --> 06:16.050
back that array value.

06:16.160 --> 06:17.930
So let's do that over here.

06:18.050 --> 06:21.650
And we know that in order to do that all we need to do is shuffle.

06:21.680 --> 06:30.010
And we can shuffle that erase we call out to this function and we can pass in that tile array.

06:30.170 --> 06:36.520
So is this going to do is this is going to shuffle around all of those array values.

06:36.800 --> 06:37.310
So let's

06:42.120 --> 06:50.310
go through this loop here now and create our random values and do the swap that we did before.

06:50.310 --> 06:56.370
So I want you to pause the video and create the next part of this function on your own and I'll show

06:56.370 --> 06:57.970
you the solution coming up.

06:58.970 --> 07:04.730
So if you had an opportunity to try that out so you know that first of all we need a way to hold some

07:04.730 --> 07:05.690
values.

07:05.690 --> 07:13.430
So to use a value called holder and just a variable and within here.

07:13.430 --> 07:16.660
So this is where our mouth random is going to sit.

07:16.970 --> 07:26.720
And then we know we need to multiply the value of random times whatever X is plus 1.

07:26.730 --> 07:34.430
So this is going to give us our Random index value for our current array decks and we want to do it

07:34.450 --> 07:37.200
we want to set up an item value.

07:37.200 --> 07:46.120
So basically we want to take whatever the item is within the array index of x.

07:46.140 --> 07:50.870
So this is where we're currently are starting at the top and going down.

07:50.910 --> 07:54.380
We're going to take that value of the item.

07:54.570 --> 07:59.400
Next thing that we need to do is we need to overwrite that value.

07:59.430 --> 08:06.120
So we've taken that value we've put it into this to hold onto it and the next step is that we're going

08:06.120 --> 08:15.030
to grab that and we're going to get that random index value from Holder and we're going to replace it

08:15.030 --> 08:17.370
with a random item in the array.

08:17.580 --> 08:24.270
And then the next step is to do the complete swap where we're taking that random item that we've replaced

08:24.370 --> 08:33.630
every x x x with and we're replacing it back with the value that we were holding from our original point.

08:33.630 --> 08:38.580
So basically what we've done is a swap and then that's it.

08:38.580 --> 08:41.040
So we've got our shuffle array.

08:41.040 --> 08:45.200
So we've got our ability to shuffle out our array.

08:45.240 --> 08:52.740
So then next step is to build our gameboard and this is where we're actually going to output some content

08:52.860 --> 08:56.040
visually for the users to be able to see.

08:56.430 --> 09:02.430
So first of all let's go back and just make sure that everything is working properly and then we're

09:02.430 --> 09:03.920
not throwing any errors.

09:03.930 --> 09:10.400
So everything looks like it's running properly and just to make sure open up your console because we've

09:10.400 --> 09:14.820
got all of these values are sitting here and do the tile array.

09:14.930 --> 09:15.520
So there we go.

09:15.520 --> 09:23.060
So we see that we've got all we've got 12 items in there and they're within a random order is exactly

09:23.060 --> 09:23.890
what we want.

09:23.990 --> 09:25.080
And now we're ready.

09:25.100 --> 09:30.560
So you've basically built out the positioning of each one of those items and the next step is to simply

09:30.620 --> 09:34.930
output them within the game board and the game board is the main play area.

09:34.940 --> 09:41.450
So it's build data now so let's call this one build board.

09:41.770 --> 09:44.860
It don't need to pass the parameters in here either.

09:45.410 --> 09:48.290
So we're going to be building out HVM else.

09:48.290 --> 09:50.060
Let's start out with blank.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.550
H t m l.

09:51.780 --> 09:56.050
And let's loop through.

09:56.080 --> 10:00.390
So we'll start out with a variable of X equals zero.

10:00.640 --> 10:04.310
And let's let's do the shortcut for arrays.

10:04.320 --> 10:06.860
Where are we going to loop through the tile array.

10:07.060 --> 10:08.550
So let's do Tyler.

10:08.890 --> 10:11.790
And for each method.

10:12.460 --> 10:13.710
And this is going to pick up.

10:13.750 --> 10:20.250
Each one of the items within the array and give it a value of L within the function.

10:20.470 --> 10:26.650
And then within this function then we could do building out r h t m l as we need to.

10:26.650 --> 10:38.260
So next step is to increment X so increment X by 1 and then we're going to add 2 h t m l and build out

10:38.320 --> 10:46.300
our gameboard And then lastly after we've done it we've already hooked up gameboard to our object called

10:46.330 --> 10:47.120
gameboard.

10:47.230 --> 10:48.440
So it's do gameport.

10:48.460 --> 10:50.680
And in our h t m l

10:53.290 --> 10:55.880
and we're going to add that H to meld into it.

10:57.440 --> 11:01.510
So the next step is to just simply build out gameboard.

11:01.850 --> 11:07.280
So first let's create our div and I'm going to give it a class so that we can apply some styling to

11:07.280 --> 11:16.680
it give it a class of game tile and we'll just close that off and we'll just add another row here.

11:16.830 --> 11:21.800
So h him out equals h to M L and this is where we actually set our image.

11:21.870 --> 11:28.500
So we give the image an I.D. and we're going to make these IDs unique by adding in the value of x to

11:28.500 --> 11:29.140
them.

11:29.220 --> 11:31.400
So be cards X.

11:31.650 --> 11:35.580
And we know that as we're looping through X it's incrementing and they're all going to have different

11:35.580 --> 11:38.720
values so they are going to be unique.

11:40.330 --> 11:46.340
And let's close off that Id I.D. And next let's do a source

11:49.230 --> 11:55.820
and the source is going to be we're going to use that placeholder that we had used before where it used

11:59.430 --> 12:02.380
the placeholder dot com images from there.

12:02.490 --> 12:05.060
So I'm going to simply use the same thing.

12:05.730 --> 12:09.680
And then within here I'm going to add an On Click event.

12:09.780 --> 12:17.300
So what I want to do is I want to fire off a function called pick card every time it's clicked and I'm

12:17.300 --> 12:23.150
going to pass in some parameters here on the default and I'm also going to pass through the value of

12:23.150 --> 12:28.370
this so we can only use the event object as well.

12:28.370 --> 12:30.270
So keeping that in mind.

12:30.680 --> 12:33.280
So let's pass this.

12:33.350 --> 12:35.290
And let's close off that string.

12:35.300 --> 12:37.280
So sometimes this does get a little bit tricky.

12:37.280 --> 12:42.650
So because I am using the single quotes and the double quotes so sometimes that does get a little bit

12:42.650 --> 12:43.040
tricky.

12:43.040 --> 12:45.000
So I'm just trying to be mindful of that.

12:45.200 --> 12:49.040
So class and let's call this flip image.

12:49.190 --> 12:54.550
So another thing that we add another class so that we can apply some styling to it.

12:54.920 --> 12:59.480
And then last but not least let's finish off and close off that div.

12:59.600 --> 13:02.050
Let's go back up to our C Ss.

13:02.120 --> 13:05.540
So set some styling for the game tile.

13:05.720 --> 13:11.720
And we should also set some styling for the Flip image slots.

13:13.280 --> 13:14.570
Some styling for that.

13:14.600 --> 13:16.640
And let's give it a with.

13:16.790 --> 13:21.770
So basically this is how wide the cards are going to be where the images are going to be.

13:21.800 --> 13:24.960
So now next step is to try to save it.

13:25.100 --> 13:28.080
So let's go back to our game board and refresh.

13:28.160 --> 13:31.890
Hit start.

13:31.920 --> 13:32.490
So there we go.

13:32.490 --> 13:37.260
So we built out our game board when we go ahead and we hit start.

13:37.290 --> 13:45.780
So basically we're building out that gameboard and we also need to include the billboard within the

13:45.900 --> 13:47.770
list of functions under start.

13:47.790 --> 13:52.450
So once we add that in we hit start and we can see that we're building our game board.

13:52.460 --> 13:58.900
So essentially we've built that and this is the back of each one of the tiles.

13:58.920 --> 14:02.550
So let's actually make tiles a little bit smaller.

14:02.670 --> 14:04.330
So they're not so big.

14:04.740 --> 14:10.340
And also what I want to do is maybe add in some padding around it.

14:10.590 --> 14:14.030
So around each one we'll do three pics of padding.

14:14.640 --> 14:16.640
Let's try that again and refresh

14:19.420 --> 14:24.940
it let's move that padding up to the game tile and I'm going to update this to the max with.

14:25.050 --> 14:28.200
So let's go back refreshed and see what happens.

14:28.410 --> 14:32.720
So there we got more distinct tiles.

14:32.960 --> 14:36.440
And I think I got the class they're wrong so let's update that.

14:36.440 --> 14:43.000
So given that flip image so let's update the class and set the max with that 50.

14:43.070 --> 14:45.820
Let's do a flip image go back and refresh it.

14:45.830 --> 14:47.040
And now we hit start.

14:47.050 --> 14:50.930
So now it's a little bit small so maybe let's do it a little bit bigger

14:53.890 --> 14:54.970
and try it again.

14:55.030 --> 14:55.600
So there we go.

14:55.600 --> 15:01.770
So now we've got essentially our gameboard and we could probably do it a little bit bigger as well.

15:01.960 --> 15:04.060
So setting these defaults.

15:04.090 --> 15:04.600
So there we go.

15:04.600 --> 15:08.660
So now we've got a four by three gameboard all ready to go.

15:08.860 --> 15:14.080
So the next lesson we're going to continue to build out this project and going to had to make these

15:14.110 --> 15:20.830
clickable and show you how you can get them to flip and also show us show you how we can fire off that

15:20.830 --> 15:23.860
pick card function that we set off over here.

15:23.860 --> 15:29.910
So let's give you the next step to create the gameplay and the action within the game.
