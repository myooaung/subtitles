WEBVTT

00:00.330 --> 00:03.280
We don't have a whole lot happening within our game quite yet.

00:03.300 --> 00:09.210
We've got a start button start button disappears and we run a block of code in the function called Make

00:09.270 --> 00:17.040
item let's set up some more additional functionality so we want to get the boundary of our main container.

00:17.040 --> 00:22.300
So Gary in that container object we're gonna use get bounding client rectangle.

00:22.340 --> 00:26.160
This is a method that gives you the parameters of an element.

00:26.280 --> 00:33.640
And if I plates into the console you're going to see that whenever we hit start we get the bounding

00:33.640 --> 00:34.850
client rectangle.

00:34.870 --> 00:37.480
So this is the full space that we have to work with.

00:37.480 --> 00:41.200
We've got the bottom the height the left the right the top and the width.

00:41.200 --> 00:43.100
So this is that whole gameplay area.

00:43.120 --> 00:49.780
Next we need to create an element and create generically randomly create an element and position that

00:49.780 --> 00:50.910
somewhere on the page.

00:50.980 --> 00:57.520
So using document element create element creating a div and then for this day we're going to set all

00:57.520 --> 01:05.440
of its properties dynamically with JavaScript So adding in to that div updating its style attributes

01:05.860 --> 01:08.410
we can set a position of absolute.

01:08.410 --> 01:14.740
So that will allow us to position that element and a console log it out so that we can see the element

01:14.830 --> 01:16.180
as we're constructing it.

01:16.180 --> 01:18.190
So there we've got our elements.

01:18.190 --> 01:23.640
We've got a style of position absolute and that means that we need to also position it.

01:23.650 --> 01:30.430
So we need to do a left position and this can be math random and the random value when we take baths

01:30.430 --> 01:33.790
random we need to multiply by the number that we want to randomize it by.

01:34.240 --> 01:41.960
And we already have some values that we can utilize here that are available within our boundary object.

01:42.040 --> 01:49.090
So taking that boundary with plus picks that will give us a position a left position that we can use

01:49.270 --> 01:51.890
and then also taking boundary height.

01:51.940 --> 01:56.180
This is all coming from that boundary object that we're showing here on the right hand side.

01:56.260 --> 01:57.940
And this can be boundary type.

01:57.970 --> 02:00.280
So that will set the vertical position.

02:00.280 --> 02:06.720
We're setting the horizontal position and we also need to set some random width and height for that.

02:06.730 --> 02:14.560
So doing a style and width so we're generating all of the properties that attributes the style attributes

02:14.590 --> 02:18.790
that are available for this element dynamically within this function.

02:18.790 --> 02:26.270
So anywhere from ten so we'll start it out at 40 and we'll have random eyes of ten.

02:26.320 --> 02:31.310
So it could be anywhere from 40 to 50 white and we'll do the same four.

02:31.390 --> 02:35.140
So this could be as well anywhere from 40 to 50 white.

02:35.230 --> 02:40.160
So the height and the width will change position of left and right will change also.

02:40.360 --> 02:43.400
Let's set up a border radius to it.

02:43.420 --> 02:49.190
So again using that style value we can set border radius.

02:49.300 --> 02:54.400
We've got a lot of options within JavaScript in order to set the same thing that you would expect to

02:54.400 --> 03:02.800
see when you are creating that within your CSF as well we can also set our cursor so the cursor value

03:02.940 --> 03:07.580
so setting that to a pointer it's probably is easier to do it and see assess.

03:07.590 --> 03:09.780
But of course this is a javascript course.

03:09.780 --> 03:11.760
So we want to really focus on javascript.

03:11.820 --> 03:15.150
Another one that we want to do is maybe do a background color.

03:15.210 --> 03:17.830
So this is expecting a hex value.

03:17.940 --> 03:24.660
So make sure that we put the hash in front and we're going to generate a random hex value number.

03:24.660 --> 03:30.010
So doing math random and then to string and base 16.

03:30.270 --> 03:33.350
And then we're going to substring that minus thing six.

03:33.360 --> 03:35.420
So that will return back a hex value.

03:35.760 --> 03:37.860
So show you how that works within the console.

03:37.860 --> 03:45.810
So if we take math random we get decimal zero dustbowl and a whole bunch of digits after that if I take

03:45.810 --> 03:53.010
math random and if I do two string C that turns it into a string and I can change the base for the string

03:53.020 --> 03:59.400
so if I do base 16 it's going to use it's going to create a hex value for the string.

03:59.430 --> 04:02.180
And so now all we need to do is chop off.

04:02.190 --> 04:07.400
We only need the last six characters and that's where we can utilize substring.

04:07.440 --> 04:13.050
So applying one more method to there and that's the substring and we want to take back the last six

04:13.380 --> 04:19.320
which effectively generates a random hex value and all we need to do is add in the hash.

04:19.320 --> 04:21.600
And that's going to give us a random background color.

04:21.600 --> 04:23.190
So that's how that formula works.

04:23.190 --> 04:28.050
That's a really effective way to generate a random color within one line of code.

04:28.050 --> 04:35.220
Also adding in a border so a border we can set it up just as we would with our regular CSI us where

04:35.220 --> 04:41.250
we can set border solid black to make sure we get all of those parameters in there and also want to

04:41.250 --> 04:44.100
track in when the start time is.

04:44.100 --> 04:49.910
So whenever our element gets created one of a value for that.

04:49.920 --> 04:53.560
And then lastly let's add it to the visible area.

04:53.640 --> 05:00.660
So using container append child we can append that div to the main container elements so that we'll

05:00.660 --> 05:02.520
make it visible on the page.

05:02.520 --> 05:08.540
So let's refresh and start game and then there we've got our element showing up and popping up.

05:09.000 --> 05:14.460
So coming up next we need to make this clickable so that we can track how long it takes the user to

05:14.460 --> 05:16.750
click the element as it shows up.

05:16.800 --> 05:18.030
So that's coming up next.

05:18.030 --> 05:25.470
So go ahead and practice applying style properties to your element that you've just created using create

05:25.530 --> 05:32.370
element add in some objects to it and also take a look at using math random because it gives you the

05:32.370 --> 05:37.050
ability to randomize some of these values and make them different all the time.

05:37.050 --> 05:41.950
So now we can see that these are elements that are popping up are always going to look different.

05:41.950 --> 05:46.590
And you can play around with some of these numbers to make them bigger or smaller to really see what

05:46.590 --> 05:48.960
different effects you can get out of the bathroom.

05:49.110 --> 05:52.170
So coming up next we're going to add interaction to that element.
