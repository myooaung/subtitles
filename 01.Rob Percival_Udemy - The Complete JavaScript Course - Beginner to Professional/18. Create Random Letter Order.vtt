00:00.990 --> 00:06.810
Welcome back can in this lesson we're going to turn what we did in the previous lesson into a country

00:06.870 --> 00:08.820
name guessing game.

00:09.030 --> 00:13.160
So let's make those updates so we did have load data.

00:13.260 --> 00:17.190
So let's just say new country.

00:17.190 --> 00:19.870
So this will always generate a new country.

00:19.950 --> 00:25.740
We also need maybe we can have our input here.

00:25.950 --> 00:29.680
So this is the input and to type

00:32.180 --> 00:35.390
text and give it an idea of.

00:35.420 --> 00:39.610
Yes so this is where we're going to hold the users guess information.

00:39.920 --> 00:42.440
And next let's create a couple device.

00:42.610 --> 00:52.590
So needs some outputs so id of output 1 and give it to clos so that we can add some styling to make

00:52.590 --> 00:53.840
it look a little bit better.

00:53.850 --> 00:57.760
Some of it is plain and let's duplicate that.

00:57.810 --> 01:04.980
So we're have output one and put two and that's all we can have our solutions as well as the randomized

01:05.010 --> 01:06.330
guess values.

01:06.660 --> 01:14.740
Let's add some quick styling to box and of course there's always you can always make these look a lot

01:14.740 --> 01:15.580
nicer.

01:15.580 --> 01:21.080
I do want to keep the focus of this application more on the Javascript.

01:21.290 --> 01:26.470
So I'm not going to spend a lot of time on the C S us so I'm just setting a background color.

01:26.490 --> 01:31.450
We'll just take ILO's Baloo and we'll set a border.

01:31.570 --> 01:47.220
So one pick solid block border let's add some padding to 10 pics of padding and margin and pick's margin.

01:47.270 --> 01:47.800
So there we go.

01:47.800 --> 01:49.970
So now we've got a couple boxes there.

01:50.120 --> 01:52.250
Let's refresh it just see it looks.

01:52.250 --> 01:52.850
So there we go.

01:52.850 --> 01:57.010
So we're going to have our input area there where we're going to have our guess.

01:57.200 --> 02:02.770
And we also need to have another button to guess the the name the value.

02:02.910 --> 02:04.130
So I need to enter in

02:07.000 --> 02:08.270
subside here.

02:08.290 --> 02:16.180
And this one is going to be yes and my and we'll call it my guess.

02:16.910 --> 02:18.980
So not to be confused with yes.

02:19.190 --> 02:21.090
The idea of this one is my guess.

02:21.110 --> 02:26.180
So this is basically the button that you click in order to submit your guess.

02:26.210 --> 02:31.760
So next part is that we need to hook up all of this stuff we need to shuffle the words and we need to

02:31.760 --> 02:32.640
output them.

02:32.660 --> 02:38.330
And then lastly we're going to do a comparison to see if the users guess is correct.

02:38.330 --> 02:42.490
So quite a few things that we need to still build here within the application.

02:42.530 --> 02:48.770
So we got this far where we were outputting that value and now we know that we've been able to pick

02:48.860 --> 02:54.080
a word so we can output that here within that output area.

02:54.080 --> 03:02.120
So another thing that we need to do is we need to scramble that word and we also need to scramble the

03:02.120 --> 03:09.320
players guess values as well because we want the player to be able to type something and hit gas and

03:09.350 --> 03:11.380
be able to see that output here.

03:11.540 --> 03:15.750
And if the user doesn't have the right letters then we're just going to put a dash.

03:15.950 --> 03:19.720
So let's let's add all of that in.

03:19.730 --> 03:22.610
So let's set up documents

03:25.290 --> 03:31.640
and get element by id and we're going to just simply go directly to the output so output 1.

03:32.250 --> 03:42.650
And this is where inner h t m l and this is going to be equaled to and we're going to create a function

03:42.650 --> 03:48.560
called shuffle word and we're going to grab pick name.

03:48.630 --> 03:51.300
So that's the actual name that was selected.

03:51.450 --> 03:57.510
Because remember when we grab that object here where it containing even more information with it so

03:57.510 --> 04:00.490
we don't want to do that whenever we do this new country.

04:00.510 --> 04:04.620
We've got the name but then we've got more data here and object.

04:04.620 --> 04:10.650
So we're only looking for the name and the rest of the stuff we can actually put in as clues or hints

04:10.650 --> 04:11.430
in the game.

04:11.430 --> 04:16.500
So if we want to enhance the game there's quite a bit of data here that we can make use of.

04:16.500 --> 04:24.570
So next let's shuffle the word sole function and this one is going to shuffle the letters or shuffle

04:24.570 --> 04:28.580
the word and we have done this one before as well.

04:29.400 --> 04:32.360
So we want to create a function that we can reuse.

04:32.400 --> 04:36.870
And I'm going to run through this pretty quickly because we have done something similar before.

04:36.870 --> 04:42.140
So let's set up our response and we'll set that response to be blocked blank.

04:42.420 --> 04:46.360
We're going to take that word value and we're going to split it in.

04:46.530 --> 04:51.910
So basically split it and we're going to create an array out of it.

04:53.250 --> 04:57.980
So do w and that should be equals to w split.

04:58.350 --> 05:04.980
So we'll split it and let's saw a console log that it would.

05:05.130 --> 05:11.640
So a console log out w Let's see how this works so far we might encounter an error but let's try that.

05:11.790 --> 05:12.330
So there we go.

05:12.330 --> 05:17.060
So we've got all of the letters split and we've got on.

05:17.170 --> 05:20.460
So let's try that again.

05:20.460 --> 05:22.110
So this one not Tunisia.

05:22.290 --> 05:26.710
So we can see that the country is split but we haven't reorganized the words yet.

05:26.760 --> 05:29.320
We haven't reorganized those those values.

05:29.370 --> 05:35.800
So within here we need to return back the response because a function that was sent in.

05:35.850 --> 05:42.690
So we want to return back the response of those reordered words and let's do a while loop and we're

05:42.690 --> 05:45.400
going to loop through the length of.

05:45.450 --> 05:48.970
So while the length is greater than zero.

05:49.200 --> 05:56.130
And what we're going to do is we're going to build out the response as we deconstruct as we remove stuff

05:56.190 --> 05:57.330
out of the tree.

05:57.600 --> 06:01.700
So we're going to add values and we're going to do.

06:01.740 --> 06:07.150
We're going to use splice and using math random again.

06:07.150 --> 06:10.450
So math floor math or random

06:13.130 --> 06:19.650
and let's multiply it by the length that's remaining within the word.

06:19.930 --> 06:26.460
And we're going to splay So one position and I need to fix that response.

06:29.750 --> 06:30.540
So there we go.

06:30.590 --> 06:31.590
So let's see.

06:31.730 --> 06:35.180
And then what we want to do is let's put that value.

06:35.180 --> 06:37.780
So we did have an error there.

06:40.040 --> 06:41.670
So let's update that.

06:41.760 --> 06:45.180
So it was I put the semi-colon wrong spot.

06:45.210 --> 06:46.250
So let's try that again.

06:49.390 --> 06:57.520
So now whenever we click it there's our country's scrambled so the next step is that I also want to

06:57.520 --> 07:07.840
put out a bunch of dashes here for the length of the word that we've sent in so the user roughly knows

07:07.840 --> 07:11.200
how many letters there are within that output.

07:11.200 --> 07:12.520
So not one here.

07:12.550 --> 07:18.330
Let's create another variable to hold this information and we're going to be outputting that value.

07:18.520 --> 07:21.920
So let's instead of shuffle word we don't need to shuffle it.

07:22.180 --> 07:24.180
We can just do WW.

07:24.190 --> 07:26.230
So that will be our word.

07:27.140 --> 07:33.020
Basically dasht word and we know that we've picked the word at this point.

07:33.110 --> 07:35.590
So we need to create a bunch of dashes.

07:35.660 --> 07:40.630
So let's set up a variable W.W. set that to be blank.

07:40.640 --> 07:48.130
And now let's loop through the length of the words and update.

07:48.370 --> 07:52.480
So we know that we've picked out a name so let's do a for loop here.

07:52.540 --> 07:54.940
So variable x equals zero.

07:55.090 --> 08:00.500
And we're going to loop while X is less than the length of the name.

08:00.700 --> 08:05.520
And we're using the string values again so it's pick a name and length.

08:05.530 --> 08:15.780
So that's actually going to give us a length of the name string value and all we need to do is increment.

08:15.830 --> 08:22.370
So we need to add two w w w w w just the two W's we need to add that value.

08:22.370 --> 08:23.560
So let's try that out.

08:23.590 --> 08:25.370
Refresh hit new country.

08:25.430 --> 08:30.980
So we see that this is probably France and we've got the six characters there for the gas.

08:31.010 --> 08:37.610
So the next item up that we need to do is we need to allow the user to create a guess of the word.

08:37.610 --> 08:43.570
We have to do a condition check to see if the user gets the word correctly and then output it.

08:43.610 --> 08:48.410
And of course we can go into our javascript console and we can see the name.

08:48.470 --> 08:50.290
So we know that this is France.

08:50.360 --> 08:56.600
So we need to make sure that the user can enter in a word here and we can do a comparison to make sure

08:56.930 --> 09:00.420
and see if the users guess is correct.

09:00.440 --> 09:07.610
So I want you to do now before the next lesson is to add in an event listener tying it into the button

09:07.670 --> 09:09.340
my guess.

09:09.440 --> 09:14.860
So we can create Let's create a separate function and we'll call it guess word.

09:14.930 --> 09:19.880
So function and yes word.

09:19.940 --> 09:22.670
And so we want to fire off this function.

09:22.850 --> 09:26.270
And this is where all of our condition is going to take place.

09:26.270 --> 09:30.440
So first of all we need to get that value of yes.

09:30.620 --> 09:33.230
So we need to get that input value here.

09:33.380 --> 09:45.260
Next we need to check to see if the if the users guess is going to be equal to our guess and the way

09:45.260 --> 09:46.340
that I wanted to do it.

09:46.340 --> 09:48.330
I want to do it a little bit differently.

09:48.380 --> 09:56.840
So I want to have a loop through the letters of each.

09:56.840 --> 10:07.290
So I do a loop through the letters of PIC name and we're going to compare letter by letter.

10:07.310 --> 10:14.520
So the first letter of the guess compared to the first letter of the actual real one.

10:14.710 --> 10:22.130
And don't forget to also use the method to lower case so that we don't have to worry about that the

10:22.130 --> 10:26.950
user is put in the case incorrectly that they're all going to be lowercase.

10:27.160 --> 10:31.210
And that also means that we should update this to be all uppercase.

10:31.210 --> 10:36.430
So again depending on what we want to do or maybe we want to transform this all to be lowercase because

10:36.430 --> 10:42.300
we see that the way it's being output here that it's automatically coming in as uppercase.

10:42.300 --> 10:44.230
We know that that's the first letter.

10:44.260 --> 10:45.570
So that's what we need to do.

10:45.610 --> 10:59.040
And then we need to update that output to so Update put to Worth correct letters.

10:59.520 --> 11:00.020
So that's it.

11:00.030 --> 11:02.050
So let's let's do that.

11:02.160 --> 11:06.340
So give it a try and I'll show you the solution coming up in the next lesson.
