00:02.280 --> 00:08.580
Previously we looking at reg X literals and in this lesson we're going to look at the reg X object.

00:08.580 --> 00:13.000
So the object can be constructed and it can also be changed at runtime.

00:13.050 --> 00:18.600
And that's one of the main reasons for using object overliteral because you do have the ability to make

00:18.600 --> 00:25.420
that change as opposed to the literals which are compiled at the load time of the script.

00:25.510 --> 00:27.880
But they also have better performance.

00:27.940 --> 00:30.090
So it all depends on what you need.

00:30.090 --> 00:36.220
But if you need some type of dynamic capability within your reg X then you've got to opt in for the

00:36.880 --> 00:38.060
object format.

00:40.130 --> 00:46.690
So in this lesson I'm going to show you how we can actually replace some content and we can use Regg

00:46.700 --> 00:48.470
X in order to do this.

00:48.470 --> 00:51.170
So first of all I need to create some inputs.

00:51.320 --> 00:54.260
So I'm going to give this one an input of a.

00:54.650 --> 01:03.830
So this is going to be our initial text and then or we can just call it as text for search text.

01:03.840 --> 01:07.770
So this is the text that we're going to be searching for within a string.

01:08.100 --> 01:16.430
So this is going to be an input and we'll do a type input type text and we can leave the value empty.

01:16.680 --> 01:23.730
And then next we're going to do id and this one is going to be what we're going to be replacing that

01:23.730 --> 01:24.770
string with.

01:24.800 --> 01:29.270
So type and this one can be text as well.

01:29.340 --> 01:32.240
So create those two inputs and last.

01:32.230 --> 01:34.210
We also need a function.

01:34.230 --> 01:38.280
So we need another input and this time let's do a button.

01:38.310 --> 01:44.940
So just as what we've been doing before with the click attribute and get this to fire off the function

01:45.300 --> 01:51.980
that is going to do the lookup we'll call it look up.

01:51.980 --> 01:56.500
So basically it's going to look up whatever input we've got here.

01:56.600 --> 01:59.300
And then also it's going to allow us to replace it.

01:59.360 --> 02:11.260
So whenever that gets clicked and let's do a value of find text and I'm also going to do a search for

02:16.720 --> 02:25.470
Replace with and will add in those inputs so that now when Let's go back and refresh and we should also

02:25.470 --> 02:28.880
put in another line break there so let's go and refresh.

02:28.890 --> 02:34.170
So now we've got basically we're going to search for and we're going to replace it with whatever text

02:34.170 --> 02:35.280
we've got here.

02:35.340 --> 02:44.460
So now let's build out our function so we know that we need to have a function and this function is

02:44.460 --> 02:47.160
called look up.

02:47.610 --> 02:53.640
So we're going to look up some content and first thing that we need to do we need to get a string value

02:53.640 --> 02:55.150
that we need to look up.

02:55.200 --> 03:05.340
So this we can create using our documents get element by id and in this case we're going to grab the

03:05.340 --> 03:10.040
contents of output and we'll just do enter text.

03:10.170 --> 03:12.190
So it should be a period there.

03:12.390 --> 03:18.570
So grab the contents of output and this is going to be come our string that we're going to actually

03:18.570 --> 03:19.920
search for.

03:19.920 --> 03:25.550
So the next thing that we need to do we need to actually get those values.

03:25.590 --> 03:33.510
So we need to get our search value so search text value and just do the document get element by ID as

03:33.510 --> 03:34.920
well for this one.

03:35.640 --> 03:37.500
So it can pick up those values

03:44.530 --> 03:51.820
and also let's copy it and we need one more because we need to pick up that replace text so search text

03:51.910 --> 03:53.140
replace text.

03:53.290 --> 03:55.770
And so this one is called text.

03:55.930 --> 03:58.190
And the other one is called Our text.

03:58.330 --> 04:00.100
So that will give us those values.

04:00.130 --> 04:06.910
And of course I still need to put in the values so that when we're grabbing their text that's what we're

04:06.910 --> 04:11.580
grabbing the values and we copy that over to here and save that.

04:11.590 --> 04:14.000
So this gives us all the parameters that we need.

04:14.020 --> 04:19.690
And also the last thing that we need to do is we need to identify a pattern.

04:20.080 --> 04:22.190
So let's set up our Regg.

04:22.230 --> 04:28.420
So are we our regular expression and this time we're going to use it within an object format.

04:28.420 --> 04:31.370
So we're doing new reg expression.

04:31.480 --> 04:36.580
And basically this creates a regular expression for matching text with a pattern.

04:36.610 --> 04:40.660
So basically we need to have some parameters in here.

04:40.690 --> 04:45.390
So the first parameter is that we need to find what we're searching for.

04:45.400 --> 04:47.400
So that's that search text there.

04:47.410 --> 04:49.760
So this is the text that we're looking for.

04:49.930 --> 04:53.910
And the next thing that we need to do is we need to provide attributes.

04:53.920 --> 05:01.420
So the same thing that we were doing before with our literal expressions we can put those parameters

05:01.420 --> 05:01.950
in there.

05:02.080 --> 05:04.990
And this is the same thing that is sitting over here.

05:05.080 --> 05:10.090
So we know that with G This is a global search so it returns back all the values.

05:10.340 --> 05:18.610
It ignores the case so we can put those in there as well and we can put it as IGY or G-I the order actually

05:18.610 --> 05:24.130
doesn't matter because as long as that character is there for the parameter it's going to actually know

05:24.130 --> 05:25.140
what it needs to do.

05:25.390 --> 05:26.050
So that's it.

05:26.050 --> 05:30.230
So now we've got a regular expression and we're taking a look for it.

05:30.370 --> 05:36.430
And let's let's console log go to regular expression and we'll see what's contained within there.

05:36.520 --> 05:43.730
And then after we'll finish off that match and replace and that's going to be just straight Javascript.

05:43.750 --> 05:46.810
So now let's go back and refresh it.

05:46.810 --> 05:55.100
So let's search for javascript and replace it with HVM m-L.

05:55.190 --> 05:59.420
So let's do a find and we see that we actually find the Javascript.

05:59.420 --> 06:01.160
So let's do that again.

06:01.160 --> 06:04.990
So we see that the regular expression is the same as that literal one.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.950
So we see that we've got that slash and now this should be familiar because we know from the previous

06:09.950 --> 06:13.790
lesson that this is the parameter that we're searching.

06:13.790 --> 06:19.450
So next we need to actually apply our regular expression and we can do that.

06:19.460 --> 06:23.990
We can create another variable and this will be the result.

06:24.080 --> 06:27.810
And so within the result we're going to search.

06:27.890 --> 06:32.950
So we need to identify our string or string is within that output text.

06:32.990 --> 06:36.830
So we haven't identified yet that that we're actually searching for that.

06:36.860 --> 06:43.280
So we're searching for it and we're looking for a match and the match parameters.

06:43.280 --> 06:47.980
So this is the regular expression pattern that we want to look for.

06:48.020 --> 06:54.170
So the same idea as what we were doing earlier except we were actually just copying this in and this

06:54.170 --> 06:56.170
time we're building the regular expression.

06:56.180 --> 07:02.600
So this is the same idea but it also gives us the ability to create more of a dynamic regular expression

07:02.660 --> 07:03.860
as well.

07:03.890 --> 07:11.220
So now that we've created this let's let's see what our result and we're going to console log.

07:11.270 --> 07:14.880
So instead of R-E we don't need to log that anymore.

07:15.030 --> 07:19.790
And this time let's log that result go back and refresh it.

07:20.030 --> 07:26.440
And let's let's search for tests first and we see that we get a null result.

07:26.600 --> 07:31.970
And this time with search for javascript and we see that javascript is included.

07:31.970 --> 07:33.630
So the next thing that we know is.

07:33.680 --> 07:40.100
Next thing we need to do is we know that we've actually got a result here and if we have a result then

07:40.190 --> 07:41.590
we can replace it.

07:41.780 --> 07:50.570
So let's do a condition and let's just check to see if result exists and if it exists then what we're

07:50.570 --> 07:53.380
going to do is we're going to do a replace.

07:53.390 --> 07:58.110
So we're going to do an S and set up a match.

07:58.120 --> 08:01.810
We're going to do replace.

08:02.210 --> 08:05.470
And we're going to replace with.

08:05.810 --> 08:15.110
So whatever is matching within our regular expression so our regular expression work get a match.

08:15.170 --> 08:19.970
So this is again where we're using Legere expressions to identify a pattern.

08:20.090 --> 08:22.610
And these two aren't could actually be related.

08:22.610 --> 08:25.280
We can do them independently as well.

08:25.280 --> 08:31.400
And then the next thing that we need to specify is the text that we're replacing it with.

08:31.430 --> 08:36.070
So our team and this is of value that we're grabbing from the Arti field.

08:38.070 --> 08:42.970
So we know if we find it if we do find a result then we can replace it.

08:43.380 --> 08:46.000
And that's just javascript as well.

08:46.020 --> 08:53.190
So let's try this this time and we'll grab javascript and we'll Prosit with age to M-L so find it and

08:53.240 --> 08:58.630
we see that we found it and we need to replace that.

08:59.060 --> 09:07.670
And there's one other thing that we need to do is we need to grab our value and then replace with the

09:07.670 --> 09:10.080
new contents of apps.

09:10.130 --> 09:12.090
Let's go back and refreshed.

09:12.110 --> 09:22.150
So one more time grab a javascript replace it with H TNL and click it and there's one thing that we

09:22.150 --> 09:23.010
need to still do.

09:23.020 --> 09:30.940
And that's place at the end of the string so or we could maybe just put this in a variable so we'll

09:30.940 --> 09:32.550
call it our.

09:32.560 --> 09:35.880
So this is the replaced text instead of S..

09:35.890 --> 09:40.480
Let's do our Because we're not actually updating the string that we've taken in here.

09:40.480 --> 09:46.120
This one still stays the same but when we're doing the replace if we want to update it we could do as

09:46.210 --> 09:46.950
equals.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.450
And that way we could output it.

09:48.640 --> 09:50.920
Or we could create a brand new variable.

09:50.920 --> 09:53.440
So again depending on what we're trying to do.

09:53.500 --> 09:58.800
So let's try this one more time and we're going to try to replace javascript with H to m l.

09:58.840 --> 09:59.530
So there we go.

09:59.530 --> 10:01.260
So we're able to find a match.

10:01.390 --> 10:05.950
And also we can do complete and Javascript.

10:05.950 --> 10:10.610
So basically whatever we type in here this is actually going to replace words.

10:10.930 --> 10:15.160
And so on so we can type a number of information here and we can see that now.

10:15.180 --> 10:16.640
We've actually replaced it.

10:16.840 --> 10:20.140
So what I want you to do now is try it for yourself.

10:20.140 --> 10:26.360
So go ahead and create your web page and then also create a couple of fields here.

10:26.560 --> 10:35.050
I have some content within your output and create a way to update that text dynamically using regular

10:35.050 --> 10:36.270
expressions.

10:38.430 --> 10:45.330
And what I also want you to do is to try it with the same characters so multiple javascript's there

10:45.570 --> 10:52.540
and multiple characters there within there and I'll show you how that works coming up.

10:52.580 --> 10:58.710
So if you get an opportunity to try this out and now we see that we've done quite a few updates there.

10:58.710 --> 11:06.020
So let me update this with each team Mel again and we see that now this time we do do the loop.

11:06.060 --> 11:12.630
We grab all five javascript objects that we were able to find and we replace them with each team.

11:12.960 --> 11:19.020
And you can also add in some conditions and some additional parameters to make this a little bit more

11:19.020 --> 11:20.440
interesting as well.

11:20.550 --> 11:21.580
So that's up to you.

11:21.690 --> 11:26.730
So go ahead and try it for yourself and get familiar with regular expressions.
