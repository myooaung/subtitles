00:00.420 --> 00:05.430
Welcome in this lesson we're gonna be setting up our reaction games first thing that we need is a mean

00:05.430 --> 00:06.330
container.

00:06.330 --> 00:10.600
So setting up a class and this is where all of the gameplay will take place.

00:10.650 --> 00:16.710
Also within here adding in an element that we can contain the score with him.

00:16.710 --> 00:23.230
So setting up another div giving it a class of score so we can access it using our javascript.

00:23.370 --> 00:28.770
And then one last element that we're going to need and giving it a class of button so we can style it

00:28.830 --> 00:32.070
as button start game here.

00:32.160 --> 00:36.540
Also adding in some styling to make this look a little bit better.

00:36.570 --> 00:41.310
So making it look more like a button do a center text align for that as well.

00:41.320 --> 00:43.820
Just trying to make it look more like a button.

00:43.890 --> 00:45.460
So setting up a border radius.

00:45.480 --> 00:47.520
And then lastly let's center it.

00:47.650 --> 00:49.280
So do a margin auto.

00:49.440 --> 00:56.400
Also do some styling for the container Scooby the full size of available space that we have for us and

00:56.460 --> 00:57.420
margin Auto.

00:57.450 --> 00:59.340
So it can center that element as well.

00:59.400 --> 01:02.170
So also add some styling for score.

01:02.210 --> 01:05.270
You can add in a default value for score of 0.

01:05.280 --> 01:07.310
So you've got a default value there for score.

01:07.360 --> 01:09.300
And let's center this one as well.

01:09.300 --> 01:12.550
So doing a margin auto will center that element.

01:12.720 --> 01:18.930
It's now that we've got our court C assess and each table setup let's use JavaScript in order to select

01:18.930 --> 01:19.980
our elements.

01:19.980 --> 01:26.880
So setting up some objects in order to contain that element content can use document query selector

01:26.910 --> 01:31.050
to select the element selecting the element what the class of container.

01:31.050 --> 01:36.840
And when you refresh just to make sure that we did select the right element you see we do have our container.

01:36.840 --> 01:40.280
Now as a javascript we've got a start game option.

01:40.330 --> 01:41.460
We only have one element.

01:41.460 --> 01:47.310
So again we can use query selector and selecting that element with score.

01:47.310 --> 01:49.920
So this should be start game and then we'll do one more first.

01:50.400 --> 01:52.050
So with the class of start gate.

01:52.170 --> 01:58.620
And then lastly let's do one more for the score area call it score area so that we can have another

01:58.620 --> 02:00.260
variable for score.

02:00.310 --> 02:03.260
And Leslie let's set up an object for a player.

02:03.330 --> 02:08.670
We'll have a score and we can utilize this as we build out our application.

02:08.670 --> 02:11.010
So this is a global object that we can make use of.

02:11.010 --> 02:17.220
So once you've set that up we're ready to add some functionality into the button as well as begin the

02:17.220 --> 02:17.780
gameplay.

02:18.030 --> 02:19.980
So let's all still coming up the next lessons.

02:19.980 --> 02:24.330
So go ahead and open up your editor create some elements on the page.

02:24.330 --> 02:30.450
Apply some styling you can customize the styling and then select those elements using JavaScript and

02:30.450 --> 02:38.040
make sure that they are selected properly by adding in and referencing it into the console so that you

02:38.040 --> 02:43.560
make sure that you do have those correct elements and you're ready to move on to the next part of the

02:43.560 --> 02:43.980
project.
