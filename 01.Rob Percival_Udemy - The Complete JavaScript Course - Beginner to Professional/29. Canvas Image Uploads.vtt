WEBVTT

00:01.230 --> 00:02.260
Welcome back.

00:02.340 --> 00:07.590
And we've seen quite a bit that we can do with canvas in the previous lessons and what if you actually

00:07.590 --> 00:15.600
want to upload an image into canvas so from your computer into your canvas element on your web page

00:15.960 --> 00:22.410
and then of course if this was on an actual Web site uploading it from your computer to there as well

00:22.800 --> 00:27.290
and then having it displayed within your your web page.

00:27.420 --> 00:29.920
And in this lesson I'll show you how to do that.

00:29.940 --> 00:37.500
So first thing that we need to do is we need to set up some inputs and this input is going to be a type

00:37.800 --> 00:47.930
file so that we can grab a file and we'll give it an ID of G load.

00:47.940 --> 00:52.530
So it's actually going to give us the ability to upload an image.

00:52.750 --> 00:55.790
And now comes the Javascript.

00:55.810 --> 01:03.670
So what I want to do is I want to add an event listener for whenever we've got an image that we've selected

01:03.670 --> 01:04.270
here.

01:04.270 --> 01:07.800
So we want to use the change event listener.

01:07.840 --> 01:13.390
So I want you to pause the video create this input and add an event listener.

01:13.390 --> 01:19.250
So whenever the content of that file changes it's going to fire off this event listener.

01:19.380 --> 01:25.060
This is going back to javascript and the listeners and it changes the one that we're looking for.

01:25.210 --> 01:32.890
So go ahead and add that in and create a function that's going to fire off whenever we make a change

01:32.950 --> 01:35.140
to our file input.

01:35.140 --> 01:45.310
So if you had an opportunity to give that to set that up and say the solution coming up so I am g loader

01:45.340 --> 01:48.300
so the image Lowder's going to give it a variable.

01:48.430 --> 01:56.280
And this one is what we've done many times before so get element by id grabbing that elements so I am

01:56.300 --> 02:05.160
g loader so grab that element and placing it within the IMJ loader variable object next that we want

02:05.160 --> 02:08.000
to do was add an event listener.

02:08.160 --> 02:14.430
So I m g loader and let's do it this one out of the listener.

02:14.730 --> 02:23.590
So we're going to listen for on change and whenever it changes then we're going to update the image

02:25.880 --> 02:26.970
up image.

02:26.990 --> 02:35.800
So it just create you image and we're going to set that listener and the other thing that we need to

02:35.800 --> 02:38.280
do is grab our canvas.

02:38.290 --> 02:42.300
So we saw earlier we're going to do the same thing that we did earlier.

02:42.400 --> 02:46.780
So let's set up a variable and you don't always have to call it canvas.

02:46.800 --> 02:53.360
Just get in the habit of calling it canvas so you can actually refer to it as needed.

02:53.590 --> 02:56.080
So it never actually makes sense.

02:56.080 --> 03:03.580
So canvas so grabbing that canvas and variable so the contacts so I usually use CTX but you can use

03:03.580 --> 03:07.300
context or any other variable that makes sense.

03:07.300 --> 03:09.400
So can this get

03:12.470 --> 03:21.460
context and so we're grabbing the context so we know that we can draw 2D images within that canvas area.

03:21.510 --> 03:26.800
That's the CTX so setting up that context and I remove the spacing there.

03:26.960 --> 03:33.470
So next to that we need to do is create a function so this function is called you image.

03:33.470 --> 03:41.100
So basically for uploading the image so you can call it up image so that the name has a little bit more

03:41.100 --> 03:42.000
meaning there.

03:42.390 --> 03:47.840
And we need to pick up that newly updated content.

03:48.120 --> 03:57.490
So first of all we need a file reader so we saw that earlier where we've got our reader and we can create

03:57.550 --> 04:05.140
a new object file reader and this basically gives us the ability to read file contents and we're going

04:05.140 --> 04:13.210
to need this in order to update our image because we need to grab the contents of the file and we know

04:13.210 --> 04:21.580
that the file reader has few built in functions so we've got one that's called on load and so whenever

04:21.580 --> 04:27.090
that on loads then let's fire off the function.

04:27.460 --> 04:34.600
So build that on load and that's actually one of the thing that we need to do we need to read the read

04:34.960 --> 04:38.220
as data you are l.

04:38.260 --> 04:40.240
So this is the same thing that we saw earlier.

04:40.250 --> 04:47.530
And basically it allows us to read the contents of a specific specified blob producing a data.

04:47.560 --> 04:56.050
You are this is the same thing we saw when we were outputting our canvas item that we can do read data

04:56.150 --> 04:57.470
as you are as well.

04:57.470 --> 05:05.300
So basically it's going to turn that uploaded information from the target

05:08.000 --> 05:09.720
and it's going to turn.

05:10.130 --> 05:14.020
So that's files and we're only an upload.

05:14.020 --> 05:14.970
The first one.

05:15.020 --> 05:18.230
So even if they select more than one will only grab that first one.

05:18.230 --> 05:27.170
So basically what we're doing is we're turning that into a readable image format and then we could utilize

05:27.170 --> 05:29.840
that within our canvas.

05:29.900 --> 05:32.200
So we know once it finishes loading.

05:32.330 --> 05:40.410
So let's do a console log here and we'll log out the value so let's select a value.

05:40.550 --> 05:45.040
Open up our console and we see that we've got this result data image.

05:45.080 --> 05:47.810
And this is exactly what we need in this.

05:47.840 --> 05:53.150
This is exactly what we need in order to output it with him canvas in a readable format.

05:53.180 --> 05:55.940
So the next thing that we need to do within the onload.

05:56.000 --> 06:03.380
So we know that that image has loaded slut's load variable image and let's create a brand new image

06:03.440 --> 06:11.520
object and then this brand new image object we can simply draw onto the canvas.

06:11.520 --> 06:18.000
We've got to make sure that it loads just as the file reader loaded.

06:18.120 --> 06:20.740
We need to make sure that this loads as well.

06:20.820 --> 06:23.920
So again anonymous function here.

06:24.060 --> 06:34.770
And once it's loaded then we're actually ready to update this into into our draw image and we know that

06:34.920 --> 06:42.750
from looking at the source we know that the image source of this brand new image source that we've created

06:42.810 --> 06:46.070
is within that target.

06:46.080 --> 06:51.870
So we saw that we're putting that event target and we're outputting the result value.

06:52.020 --> 06:56.330
So the result was were that 64 image was actually sitting.

06:56.610 --> 07:04.610
And the next thing that we need to do is simply output it into our canvas using draw image and let's

07:04.950 --> 07:09.970
add that image and then all we need to do is elect x and y position.

07:09.990 --> 07:10.980
So let's try that.

07:11.070 --> 07:19.230
Let's refresh it and grab an image and we can see that our image gets positioned within our canvas element.

07:20.980 --> 07:29.660
So what I want you to do now is pause the video and take what we learned earlier and add the word javascript

07:29.750 --> 07:33.540
course at the bottom of your uploaded image.

07:33.560 --> 07:37.970
So go ahead puzzle video and add that in to the application.

07:37.970 --> 07:42.470
And we know that we should add that in whenever the new image is uploaded.

07:42.470 --> 07:49.130
And we saw that we could do the CTX we could draw an image and we know that in order to create we use

07:49.190 --> 07:50.120
filled text.

07:50.180 --> 07:54.600
So great pause the video and add that in and I'll show you the solution coming up.

07:55.310 --> 07:57.980
So if you have an opportunity to try that out.

07:58.340 --> 08:01.520
So first thing that we do we want to set a font.

08:01.580 --> 08:07.730
Now you don't have to set a font size but you like to have a nice big font and we can use the aerial

08:07.730 --> 08:12.420
font so that it really shows up on top of that image.

08:12.500 --> 08:18.660
Really nice and big next to CTX and let's do Phil text.

08:18.950 --> 08:26.990
And this was the method where we can pass in some information and we want to add in javascript course.

08:27.350 --> 08:34.760
So anytime we upload an image we're going to write on top of it javascript course and we can also specify

08:34.850 --> 08:39.670
where we want to position that so we could position at the bottom we can position at the top.

08:39.800 --> 08:47.620
So let's try let's do X of 10 and we'll do y of 100.

08:47.620 --> 08:48.700
So let's try that.

08:50.110 --> 08:52.550
So refreshed.

08:52.730 --> 08:55.530
Grab an image upload that image.

08:55.560 --> 08:56.580
And there you go.

08:56.580 --> 09:05.220
So we have writing javascript course on top of the image and you can do quite a bit more as well.

09:05.220 --> 09:10.950
If you want there's another thing that we can do as well to this uploaded image.

09:11.040 --> 09:18.750
We can also update the size of our canvas in order to accommodate that.

09:18.750 --> 09:20.710
So let's take care of that as well.

09:20.730 --> 09:22.110
So let me show you how to do that.

09:25.480 --> 09:32.570
So over here where we've loaded the image before we draw it we're going to take the canvas with and

09:32.590 --> 09:37.220
we saw that this is actually something that we can reset and we can dynamically set.

09:37.300 --> 09:44.830
So we can take whatever the width of the images canvas height and we can take whatever the height of

09:44.980 --> 09:48.670
the newly updated image and we can update that.

09:48.670 --> 09:51.590
So let's let's try that one more time.

09:51.790 --> 09:57.520
And we notice that we've got the default canvas size but whenever we select an image and upload it that

09:57.520 --> 10:01.670
we get that new size being attached to it.

10:01.950 --> 10:07.260
So go in and try that within your own editor and see what different things that you can make happen

10:07.320 --> 10:12.310
when you upload images using javascript and canvas together.
