00:00.760 --> 00:07.480
In this lesson we're going to be looking at javascript cookies now cookies actually require the server

00:07.510 --> 00:11.680
to be able to able to read and store cookies.

00:11.680 --> 00:18.510
So we need an actual You are L and we can't use the local one that we've been using previously.

00:18.550 --> 00:25.000
So I've set up a local office so this is basically a server machine that's running on my local computer

00:25.240 --> 00:29.500
and it basically simulates what your web server would be doing.

00:29.500 --> 00:36.250
So it gives me the ability to store cookies and for this exercise we are going to actually need to have

00:36.250 --> 00:39.730
the server up and running because we do need to have that domain.

00:39.730 --> 00:43.730
We can't just simply linked to the file as we've been doing earlier.

00:43.750 --> 00:49.900
So if you do want to set up a local machine there is one available the same one that I'm using is available

00:49.900 --> 00:52.060
at Apache friends dot org.

00:52.180 --> 00:55.310
It's available on Windows Linux OSX.

00:55.420 --> 01:00.480
And basically when you download it and you start it up you get this type of control panel.

01:00.580 --> 01:07.450
And the one that you need to run is Apache and then start the Apache server and then also you also need

01:07.450 --> 01:10.140
to link to where your files are located.

01:10.240 --> 01:16.930
Or you can locate the files within the default directory of the download which should be zap.

01:16.960 --> 01:25.290
And they do have a folder there for typing in and storing your server files.

01:25.290 --> 01:31.500
So basically what it's doing is it's simulating the server and predominately used for back in code for

01:31.500 --> 01:35.420
databases and a whole lot of great stuff when you're a web developer.

01:35.460 --> 01:41.400
So really handy tool to have and for javascript you don't actually need it but for this lesson because

01:41.400 --> 01:45.470
we are looking at cookies we do need to have an actual you r l.

01:45.660 --> 01:53.000
So let's let's create our first cookie and creating a cookie in javascript is relatively easy.

01:53.130 --> 02:01.550
So all we have to do is open up a document so you type into the document object.

02:01.650 --> 02:04.280
And this is the dorm what we looked at before.

02:04.380 --> 02:05.750
So there's nothing new here.

02:05.760 --> 02:12.510
And cookies are really useful for a lot of things when it comes to web web sites.

02:12.510 --> 02:19.320
You can store user log in information and any type of information that you want to make use of where

02:19.320 --> 02:24.540
you want the user to have use of next time they access your web page.

02:24.570 --> 02:32.760
So the cookie that I want to set up is I want it to set up a user or a log in and we're just going to

02:32.760 --> 02:33.880
say log in.

02:33.900 --> 02:35.020
True.

02:35.190 --> 02:42.750
So this is if our user has logged in and they're coming back to the Web site and they're just simply

02:42.750 --> 02:46.230
go into the log in and log in has already been set to true.

02:46.230 --> 02:49.840
So we don't have to have them ask them for their credentials again.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.450
It's stored within the cookie.

02:51.510 --> 02:56.190
And until they clear out their cookies even if they close down their browser they're still going to

02:56.190 --> 02:57.930
have access to this.

02:57.930 --> 03:04.060
So next thing that we need to do is output that cookie object so we can see it within the document.

03:04.080 --> 03:11.790
So let's open up the document and we need to do document directories so let's do a console directory

03:11.850 --> 03:16.190
and documents so it can take a closer look at the document object.

03:16.200 --> 03:20.940
So let's open that up and we can see within the document object there are cookies.

03:20.940 --> 03:22.460
So it's sitting there.

03:22.500 --> 03:29.400
So basically if it's within the document object that also means that we have access to the cookie and

03:29.460 --> 03:31.500
we can't recall that information.

03:31.500 --> 03:36.440
So basically it's that same information that I've sent here and it's being stored.

03:36.450 --> 03:43.800
So even if I was to delete this and go back refresh the page and so rember this time we're actually

03:43.860 --> 03:52.320
not setting the cookie so I gotta do a document directory and we'll put the document object again.

03:52.410 --> 03:55.200
And you see that the cookie is still there.

03:55.200 --> 03:57.440
So notice that this is a fresh page.

03:57.450 --> 03:58.220
I've removed it.

03:58.230 --> 04:04.530
I'm not setting it anymore but it's still persistent within the cookies of my web browser and it's linking

04:04.530 --> 04:06.560
to this particular domain name.

04:06.690 --> 04:12.120
And the idea is if anyone ever travels back once you set a cookie and travels back to their domain name

04:12.360 --> 04:14.420
then they can always have access to it.

04:14.430 --> 04:22.680
You can also set expiry dates for your cookies and usually some of the best ways to create cookies are

04:22.680 --> 04:28.170
to create a function in order to create those cookies because that's going to save you a lot of time

04:29.010 --> 04:30.600
and calculation.

04:30.600 --> 04:34.620
So let's let's set up a function in order to create the cookies.

04:34.800 --> 04:38.100
And we'll also set up a function in order to read cookies.

04:38.100 --> 04:40.370
So this one is going to read the cookie.

04:40.410 --> 04:46.030
The other one is going to write the cookie or create a cookie or a cookie a cookie.

04:46.050 --> 04:50.450
So first and that we need to do is we need to create that cookie

04:53.460 --> 04:56.870
and we have taken some parameters for the cookie.

04:56.880 --> 05:01.230
So first of all let's create a name for the item than the cookie.

05:01.230 --> 05:06.990
We also need to have a value for the cookie and the amount of DS So we're going to set an expiry date

05:07.290 --> 05:08.660
for this cookie.

05:08.880 --> 05:11.240
So expiry is going to be easy.

05:11.280 --> 05:13.600
And for now let's just leave that blank.

05:13.890 --> 05:19.330
So let's create our cookie in order to create the cookies so let's document.

05:19.780 --> 05:29.370
So just as we did earlier document cookie and then we equal it to name and let's say equal so the same

05:29.370 --> 05:33.490
format that we did earlier where we did the log in equals true.

05:33.600 --> 05:36.660
So this time we're doing the name the value.

05:36.750 --> 05:39.150
So this is all going to be done within the function.

05:39.150 --> 05:42.160
And also I wanted to add in the expiry.

05:42.180 --> 05:50.220
So I want to add in the for the expiry.

05:50.530 --> 05:53.360
And there's one other thing that I want to add in as well.

05:53.440 --> 05:55.950
So you can be specific with the path.

05:56.080 --> 06:02.950
So I'm going to set the path to equal just the forward slash there so that will bring us back to the

06:02.950 --> 06:09.700
root path where we have some options as well where we want to store the paths of the cookie so if you

06:09.700 --> 06:14.530
want to store it depending on a particular page we can specify that page.

06:14.530 --> 06:16.380
But I'm just going to forward slash that.

06:16.450 --> 06:19.050
So it's going to store it for that entire domain.

06:19.060 --> 06:22.130
So not for the page but as Stuart for the entire domain.

06:22.260 --> 06:27.640
And that's how you can split that up and you can have various cookies for different pages that are available

06:27.640 --> 06:29.580
within your web page.

06:29.600 --> 06:30.700
So let's also.

06:30.700 --> 06:33.910
Now let's set the days condition.

06:33.910 --> 06:40.840
So we're going to do check to see how many days and depending on the number of days this is where we

06:40.840 --> 06:42.870
need to set up our date.

06:43.610 --> 06:47.820
So let's create a date objects or a new date.

06:47.820 --> 06:53.400
So this is the date method that we saw earlier in the previous lesson and we're going to simply set

06:53.460 --> 06:56.760
a time so we get a Unix time stamp.

06:56.760 --> 06:58.520
So set time.

06:58.770 --> 07:03.560
So again using what we learned earlier where we can set a time.

07:03.570 --> 07:07.980
So first of all before we set a time we need to get the current time.

07:08.040 --> 07:12.390
So we're going to get the date and then we're going to add to that current time.

07:12.390 --> 07:14.390
So get time.

07:14.520 --> 07:19.790
And this will give us our current time within that Unix time stamp.

07:19.890 --> 07:27.300
And now we can add in a number of days to it and we know that we've got the days value but it's going

07:27.300 --> 07:28.770
to be returned back.

07:28.950 --> 07:31.860
So the get time is going to give us in milliseconds.

07:31.950 --> 07:33.880
So we need to multiply this out.

07:34.050 --> 07:43.840
So over 24 hours over 60 Minutes over 60 milliseconds and over 1000 milliseconds.

07:43.920 --> 07:50.520
So this will give us a value that we can set within those milliseconds for that expiry.

07:50.640 --> 07:53.950
And then the next step is just to add to the expiry.

07:54.120 --> 07:56.440
So we need to set up that value.

07:56.610 --> 08:02.810
So splitting the cookie information we do the semi-colon and we set expires

08:05.640 --> 08:10.200
and we equal whatever our expiry time is for the cookie.

08:10.400 --> 08:17.790
So we can add in the date and now it's transform it to UTC.

08:17.840 --> 08:23.270
So this will give us a really long format of that date that we've created up here

08:26.100 --> 08:28.550
so let me make some adjustments to this.

08:28.560 --> 08:37.370
So get rid of the date value because I had given it a value of D and next we've set up the expiry So

08:37.370 --> 08:40.670
we're all ready to say set and create cookies.

08:40.700 --> 08:46.470
So let's go out refresh our prey page and try our cookie maker.

08:46.490 --> 08:54.000
So first of all let's set a name so we'll set a name for this and we give it an ideal value.

08:55.940 --> 09:02.020
And the value will be five and the number of days that we're setting this cookie is going to be 10 days.

09:02.300 --> 09:03.640
So let's try this out.

09:03.860 --> 09:06.710
And now let's list the document object

09:10.220 --> 09:11.990
so let's list the document

09:14.660 --> 09:15.250
and.

09:15.270 --> 09:17.660
Take a look at the cookie that we've set.

09:17.670 --> 09:20.760
So now we see that we've got another cookie sitting in there.

09:20.820 --> 09:23.540
So we still have the log in as equals true.

09:23.640 --> 09:27.390
But now we have a brand new one with ID equals five.

09:27.390 --> 09:33.940
So this is the one that we just set up over here and the next lesson I'll show you how to retrieve this

09:34.000 --> 09:35.360
information.

09:35.410 --> 09:40.720
So if you do have access to the local host or if you want to go ahead and try out zap.

09:40.900 --> 09:43.470
This will give you the ability to do localhost.

09:43.540 --> 09:49.510
So it does take download and you can just you work off of the default configuration.

09:49.570 --> 09:56.320
And as long as you're putting your work files within that default root folder of zap you should be OK

09:56.320 --> 09:58.230
to run the local machine.

09:58.360 --> 10:02.610
And the way you know that you've got it up and running is you can go to localhost.

10:02.800 --> 10:05.920
And that's going to run all of those default root files.

10:06.070 --> 10:12.640
And if you do get the set up or if you want to just upload it to your web server if you have access

10:12.640 --> 10:18.600
to a web server then you can upload it there as well to try out cookies and the lesson.

10:18.640 --> 10:21.160
So you have to read this cookie information.

10:21.190 --> 10:22.120
So that's coming up.
