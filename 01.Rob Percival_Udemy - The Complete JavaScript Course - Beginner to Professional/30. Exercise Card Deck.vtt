00:00.720 --> 00:06.840
Work back in in this lesson we've got an exercise for you and this exercise is going to be dealing out

00:07.050 --> 00:11.180
a number a deck of cards out to any number of players.

00:11.190 --> 00:15.010
So this is determined by the user coming into your application.

00:15.060 --> 00:17.140
It's first ask you how many players.

00:17.280 --> 00:20.490
So we've got a choice we can go all the way up to fly players.

00:20.490 --> 00:22.160
We can go down to one player.

00:22.230 --> 00:28.620
So let's try four players and we can see that each one of the players gets a set of cards dealt with

00:28.620 --> 00:28.830
them.

00:28.830 --> 00:34.200
So there's four players that we had selected we can select three players and we can deal out cards to

00:34.200 --> 00:35.020
three players.

00:35.130 --> 00:37.500
So this is one full deck of cards.

00:37.500 --> 00:44.850
Notice that all of the cards are unique and we are using functions very heavily within this application

00:45.060 --> 00:47.080
in order to deliver this.

00:47.130 --> 00:48.460
The results here.

00:48.930 --> 00:55.200
So initially what we're going to do is we're going to use a couple of arrays and we're going to use

00:55.200 --> 01:03.810
those kind of Us or default values for the cards and set those up and then we need to initiate several

01:03.810 --> 01:05.050
different arrays.

01:05.070 --> 01:09.430
So the first array is in order to start the dealing.

01:09.540 --> 01:14.690
So to start the game and initiate that initial dealing of the cards.

01:14.820 --> 01:21.660
So that means building out the cards shuffling the cards and then dealing a set of cards to each one

01:21.660 --> 01:22.620
of the players.

01:22.680 --> 01:25.080
And this can also change and fluctuate.

01:25.080 --> 01:31.110
So the application has to be dynamic enough in order to be able to build up cards to any number of players

01:31.110 --> 01:32.580
that they used or selected.

01:32.580 --> 01:39.620
So you see here we can go all the way up to five players and each one gets a unique card from the deck.

01:40.810 --> 01:44.470
So this game is based around four major functions.

01:44.650 --> 01:46.840
And as I said starting the game.

01:46.840 --> 01:53.670
So just initiating the game building out that player array and then also dealing out the cards.

01:53.740 --> 01:59.240
So looping through all of the available cards and actually first we got to build the cards.

01:59.260 --> 02:05.210
So looping through all the defaults in order to build all of these unique 52 cards in the deck.

02:05.380 --> 02:11.450
So we know that it starts at two ends at Aces and there's four different suits to a deck of cards.

02:11.530 --> 02:14.820
There's spades diamonds hearts and clubs.

02:15.070 --> 02:20.740
And then next we need to shuffle the cards because once we build the deck it's not going to be any good

02:20.740 --> 02:24.820
to us if the deck of cards is always in the same order.

02:24.850 --> 02:26.990
So we do need to shuffle the cards.

02:27.100 --> 02:33.250
And then lastly we deal out the cards and the way that you can look at functions is each one of them

02:33.340 --> 02:35.530
has its own set of tasks to do.

02:35.650 --> 02:39.280
And you create code in order to do those tasks.

02:39.280 --> 02:44.700
So what I want you to do now is pause the video and try it for yourself.

02:44.740 --> 02:50.290
See if you can build out this application and I'm going to show you the solution coming up.

02:52.310 --> 02:58.310
And as well you can pause the video at any point while I am providing the solution and then take it

02:58.310 --> 03:03.710
from there and try it for yourself in order to build out the same functionally that I have here on the

03:03.710 --> 03:05.250
right hand side.

03:05.270 --> 03:06.140
So let's begin.

03:06.140 --> 03:12.890
So the first thing that we do need to do is establish our default values here for the deck of cards

03:13.310 --> 03:15.700
and I'm going to set up a couple arrays.

03:15.830 --> 03:21.520
So one I've got suits and the other one is going to be the card face.

03:21.530 --> 03:24.740
So these are the values that are on the cards.

03:24.800 --> 03:28.220
So I do need to create several suits.

03:28.400 --> 03:31.160
So I to start by creating suits up here.

03:31.280 --> 03:34.100
So start with spades.

03:34.160 --> 03:36.790
Next we're going to create hearts.

03:37.340 --> 03:40.680
And next we're going to do clubs.

03:40.970 --> 03:43.530
And then last but not least.

03:43.580 --> 03:45.470
Diamonds and diamonds.

03:45.470 --> 03:50.660
I'm going to use our short form and the reason I'm using that is because that's going to give me the

03:50.660 --> 03:54.430
ability to output these A.S.C. characters.

03:54.440 --> 03:58.740
So this is going to make more visually appealing.

03:58.850 --> 04:04.010
And then I'm also going to set the colors as I build out the cards within the deck.

04:04.100 --> 04:09.020
So the next thing that we need to do is set all of the face values of the cards.

04:09.170 --> 04:16.940
So you know we can have twos we can have threes we can have fours we can have fives and going all the

04:16.940 --> 04:20.000
way up to 10.

04:20.420 --> 04:28.490
And then after that we need to build that Jok the queen the king and the ace.

04:28.490 --> 04:30.180
So let's build those out.

04:30.200 --> 04:34.150
So those are jacks Queens.

04:35.730 --> 04:40.330
Kings and lastly ace.

04:40.380 --> 04:44.850
So you can also put the ace first if you want it to assign values to them.

04:44.910 --> 04:47.660
But that's actually not going to be one of the requirements here.

04:47.700 --> 04:54.030
So you can do it actually in any order that you want as long as you get all 13 different faces for the

04:54.030 --> 04:54.970
cards.

04:54.990 --> 04:59.210
So the next thing that I want to do is set up some default or raise.

04:59.220 --> 05:05.430
Now these arrays are going to be have to be global because we're going to need to access them for the

05:05.450 --> 05:10.410
different functions and we are building out four different functions to accommodate all of the tasks

05:10.440 --> 05:13.220
we need in order to run this application.

05:13.470 --> 05:18.480
So the other thing that we need is we're going to build out the deck of cards within the cards array.

05:18.720 --> 05:25.530
And the thing that we need to do is we need to have a place to hold the cards for the players so we're

05:25.530 --> 05:32.590
simulating this as much as possible within real life where we're actually going to be dealing the cards.

05:32.610 --> 05:38.520
So as we when we create the deck we're going to be taking the cards out of the deck and placing them

05:38.610 --> 05:44.310
within the players or race and then we can loop through the players and output their results.

05:44.340 --> 05:46.990
So that's what we see here on the right hand side.

05:47.010 --> 05:52.440
So the next thing that we need to do is we need to initiate the game.

05:52.530 --> 05:54.690
So see here that we've got deal.

05:54.750 --> 05:59.390
And when you look into the H Tim L we've got a function called Start deal.

05:59.400 --> 06:04.040
So let's set that up first because that's the first function that we encounter.

06:04.140 --> 06:09.690
And essentially this is the one that's going to control all the other functions and the order the functions

06:09.690 --> 06:11.770
are going to get invoked.

06:12.390 --> 06:17.550
So the first thing that we need to do is I want to actually clear out players.

06:17.550 --> 06:22.280
So I want to make sure that I'm starting with a completely blank array.

06:22.440 --> 06:26.490
And so what this will do is this will clear out the arrays.

06:26.640 --> 06:33.540
So just in case I have already dealt out a set of cards and I want to deal out another fresh set of

06:33.540 --> 06:37.580
cards I don't want any lingering values with them players or cards.

06:37.680 --> 06:42.260
And that's where I'm just doing that where I'm just making sure that they're nice and empty.

06:42.720 --> 06:53.320
So next what I want to do is actually build out this players a race so when I'm a multi dimensional

06:53.320 --> 06:59.260
array and if you remember multi dimensional arrays they kind of look like this so you could initiate

06:59.260 --> 07:01.770
the rate within this type of format.

07:01.780 --> 07:05.950
So what we're going to do actually we're going to make it a little bit more dynamic so we're not going

07:05.950 --> 07:08.420
to create any length for there.

07:08.550 --> 07:12.020
That's not necessary within our initial scope.

07:12.250 --> 07:20.280
So what we need to do is we need to grab the value that's held here within the number of players.

07:20.340 --> 07:23.340
So let's go ahead and we're going to grab that.

07:23.340 --> 07:28.920
So we're going to do that locally because we're not actually going to need this value outside of the

07:28.920 --> 07:31.700
scope of this particular function.

07:31.710 --> 07:39.610
So next Let's do number and documents get element by ID.

07:39.630 --> 07:46.630
And this is where we're going to grab the value that's contained within player's So that's the value

07:46.630 --> 07:49.320
here that input value there that we have.

07:49.360 --> 07:50.640
So we're grabbing that.

07:50.680 --> 07:53.980
And what we need to return back from there is the value.

07:54.190 --> 08:02.210
So basically we're going to get it's a numeric format under none whatever values contained within here.

08:02.230 --> 08:10.420
So the next thing that we need to do is let's build the cards so we can build the deck of cards.

08:10.430 --> 08:16.070
And this is going to be a function to build the Kurds and next function.

08:16.080 --> 08:25.170
We need to shuffle the cards and then the last function is going to be to deal the cards.

08:25.290 --> 08:27.780
So now that we've established this

08:30.780 --> 08:36.730
I want you to again if you haven't already paused the video and try it for yourself.

08:36.840 --> 08:42.790
Build out this function to build the deck of cards build out the function to shuffle the cards.

08:42.900 --> 08:48.750
So what this is going to be doing is this is going to randomize our array and our array is going to

08:48.750 --> 08:52.220
be contained within cards so we can just pass that through.

08:52.290 --> 08:57.320
And we're going to shuffle them and then return back that newly shuffled deck of cards.

08:57.690 --> 09:00.600
And then lastly we want to deal out the cards.

09:00.660 --> 09:12.010
And over here again I'll pass in that array for the cards themselves and now I want you to try it for

09:12.010 --> 09:15.690
yourself so we know that we need to set up several functions.

09:15.820 --> 09:27.330
So the first one is build cards so that one up the next one is going to be a function to shuffle cards.

09:27.380 --> 09:28.340
And I'll give you a clue.

09:28.340 --> 09:32.860
This is going to be just that randomising of the array values.

09:32.990 --> 09:36.590
And then next we need to just deal out the cards.

09:36.590 --> 09:40.870
So that's actually going to deal a deck of cards out to the users.

09:40.880 --> 09:46.040
So go ahead and try to fill out these functions and I'll show you the solution coming up.
