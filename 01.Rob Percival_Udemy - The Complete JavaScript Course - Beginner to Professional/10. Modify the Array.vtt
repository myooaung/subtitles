00:00.660 --> 00:01.580
Welcome back.

00:01.590 --> 00:08.550
And in this lesson I'm going to show you why javascript is truly amazing because with arrays we also

00:08.550 --> 00:13.120
have the ability which is built in to modify these arrays.

00:13.200 --> 00:18.750
So I've kept my animals array because I just love having an array full of bunch of animals that we can

00:18.750 --> 00:20.960
utilize and make use of.

00:20.970 --> 00:22.480
Within this lesson.

00:22.710 --> 00:27.780
So now that I've got my array I've got my five items in my array.

00:27.900 --> 00:33.880
I can add new information into the survey by doing a push.

00:34.230 --> 00:35.360
So this is.

00:35.400 --> 00:43.890
So in order to push so we specify animals and then we use the method push.

00:43.980 --> 00:48.400
So specify the array name and then we use the method push.

00:48.480 --> 00:51.300
This is built in method within Javascript.

00:51.420 --> 00:55.090
So we want to add another item into this array.

00:55.170 --> 00:56.890
So it's odd in sheep.

00:57.630 --> 01:05.550
And then next let's console log what the animals are raised and we'll take a look at and see what actually

01:05.550 --> 01:06.750
happened to it.

01:06.930 --> 01:11.660
So refresh and we see that sheep got added in there at the end.

01:11.820 --> 01:20.930
So Porsche gives you the ability to add item at the end of an array.

01:20.950 --> 01:26.240
So next we can also remove that item from the end of that array.

01:26.250 --> 01:30.060
So this is another builtin method in Javascript.

01:30.060 --> 01:36.960
And we again we need to specify the arrays so we've got animals is there a way that we want to use.

01:37.200 --> 01:43.820
At this time we want to do is we want to use PAUP and we don't have to pass a value in there.

01:43.950 --> 01:52.780
And basically what Pop do will remove the last item from and of an array.

01:53.370 --> 02:00.330
So let's go here and refresh it and we see that array is back to what originally was.

02:00.570 --> 02:06.570
We also have some additional methods that are really cool and and provide us quite a bit of stuff that

02:06.570 --> 02:09.520
we can do within our arrays.

02:09.720 --> 02:17.490
And this is why developers love using arrays in javascript so it gives you so much more power than just

02:17.490 --> 02:20.670
having it directly as a variable.

02:20.670 --> 02:23.920
So we can have these collections of items.

02:24.000 --> 02:31.710
So if we wanted to remove the item in the first item so let's say we want to take cat out of our tree

02:32.010 --> 02:34.250
we can use the shift method.

02:34.680 --> 02:42.790
So this will remove move first item and then I'm going to keep saying in the array.

02:43.110 --> 02:44.580
So let's refresh it.

02:44.610 --> 02:46.720
And now we see that cap is gone.

02:46.770 --> 02:50.700
We can also add an item back in there.

02:50.700 --> 02:57.180
So instead of shift it's going to be on shift and this one much like whenever we're adding anything

02:57.240 --> 03:00.070
we need to specify what we want to add in.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.900
So let's add in another animal here.

03:03.000 --> 03:09.990
So instead of our cat we've taken the cat we've added in a horse let's go and refresh it and we can

03:09.990 --> 03:18.660
see that this way we can add items in the first and first item 2 or three.

03:18.960 --> 03:22.620
That gives us the ability to add that first item into the array.

03:22.620 --> 03:25.950
We can also splice.

03:26.110 --> 03:31.730
So we can remove items depending on what their index value is.

03:32.240 --> 03:35.510
And much like what we did with the prompt method.

03:35.530 --> 03:38.280
We can also assign variables to this.

03:38.440 --> 03:48.030
So basically what happens is that it's so similar to if I wanted to remove another item from animals

03:48.030 --> 03:54.420
so I'll just do that within the console and I'll show you what our response is.

03:54.430 --> 03:55.860
So we'll just plop.

03:55.930 --> 04:02.890
And this is moving the last item and we see that when we remove that last item our response is the value

04:02.950 --> 04:04.540
of the last item.

04:04.540 --> 04:14.860
So we can set a variable and we can have it remove one and then over here we can console like and we

04:14.860 --> 04:21.910
can actually log what was removed because we're able to pick that information up just as we did with

04:21.910 --> 04:22.610
the prompt.

04:22.720 --> 04:25.450
So we see that sheep was actually removed.

04:25.450 --> 04:32.140
So every time we remove something we can actually place that within our within a variable or we can

04:32.160 --> 04:36.290
even place it in an array if we want to do that as well.

04:36.580 --> 04:44.400
So another thing that we want to do is we have the ability to actually to splice.

04:44.400 --> 04:48.900
So we can specify a position and how many items we want to remove.

04:49.050 --> 04:53.800
So animals and let's you splice this time.

04:53.820 --> 04:58.390
So this one is a little bit tricky because it's actually going to take two arguments in there.

04:58.680 --> 05:03.030
So the first one is the position of the items with the index value.

05:03.030 --> 05:10.380
So let's let's take right here let's take rabbit and bird so we know that 0 1 2.

05:10.380 --> 05:17.010
So let's start at two and we'll remove have two items and we see that now we've taken out rabbit and

05:17.040 --> 05:19.530
Bird and now for list listo animals.

05:19.680 --> 05:20.810
That one's gone.

05:21.030 --> 05:27.630
So we've essentially if we had set a variable we would have actually created an array with the items

05:27.630 --> 05:29.910
that were moving using splice.

05:30.000 --> 05:37.560
So splice is really useful as well because it gives us this ability to pull back more than one item

05:37.620 --> 05:43.080
out of the array and be really specific with what we want to select and what we want to remove.

05:43.290 --> 05:56.160
So animals splice first argument is that index position the position of the item that we want to remove.

05:56.500 --> 05:57.880
So we went with two.

05:57.940 --> 06:00.660
And in this instance let's just remove one item.

06:00.700 --> 06:12.370
So we're going to essentially be removing a rabbit out of the array and remove from position number

06:12.910 --> 06:15.700
of items.

06:15.700 --> 06:22.100
So just put that good here and refresh it and we can see that we took Robert out of our array.

06:23.470 --> 06:31.180
So couple other methods that I didn't want to mention we also have the ability to take animals and we

06:31.180 --> 06:33.710
can reverse them.

06:33.830 --> 06:35.900
So by using the reverse method.

06:36.040 --> 06:45.750
And basically this reverses order reverses the order of items.

06:45.790 --> 06:54.400
So now let's take a closer look and we can see that Fish's first bird and its reverse items and we can

06:54.400 --> 06:57.270
also do animals sort.

06:57.310 --> 06:59.000
So this is a useful method.

06:59.080 --> 07:06.960
And basically this gives us the ability to sort items by value.

07:07.270 --> 07:12.430
So basically it will alphabetically sort all of the items within the array.

07:12.460 --> 07:14.750
So you've got bird dog fish horse.

07:14.830 --> 07:23.490
And if we had some numbers in there they actually go for the before the characters so numbers would

07:23.490 --> 07:24.800
come in first.

07:25.140 --> 07:32.970
So what I want you to do now is I've got a challenge for you and what I want you to do is to take an

07:32.970 --> 07:33.750
array.

07:34.320 --> 07:41.260
And I want you to sort it but in reverse alphabetical order.

07:41.470 --> 07:49.430
So whatever and I'm going to add in zebra into this as well so that we have something starting with

07:49.460 --> 07:50.090
Z.

07:50.380 --> 07:59.720
So basically the way that I want it sorted is zebra rabbit fish dog cat bird.

08:00.160 --> 08:10.290
So let's let's pause the video here and see if you can sort this array in a reverse sort order.

08:12.370 --> 08:18.910
So you had the opportunity to try this out and really this is going to be something that we've already

08:18.910 --> 08:25.580
done down here where we're taking this animals are race so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to

08:26.410 --> 08:33.330
bring this one back down here and I'm going to commentate all of this content here.

08:34.630 --> 08:39.340
So that's not interfering with what we're looking at now for this particular challenge.

08:39.370 --> 08:47.470
So the challenge was to take that array to sort it in reverse order and really it's as simple as just

08:47.470 --> 08:50.290
making those commands in the right order.

08:50.290 --> 08:55.180
So first we sort then we reverse and that should give us the value

08:57.970 --> 08:59.150
in reverse.

08:59.150 --> 08:59.900
So let's see.

09:00.200 --> 09:03.720
So we get zebra rabbit fish dog cat bird.

09:03.850 --> 09:05.890
So that was relatively easy.

09:06.350 --> 09:09.440
And there's another trick that I want to show you as well.

09:09.490 --> 09:17.920
So what I'll do is I just comment these ones out and you can actually take this and you can chain these

09:17.980 --> 09:19.300
methods together.

09:19.300 --> 09:24.240
So if you want to assert first was sort that we want to reverse.

09:24.370 --> 09:28.530
And if I go back out here and refresh it we see that we get that same effect.

09:28.660 --> 09:30.640
So you can actually chain them together.

09:30.640 --> 09:35.430
You don't necessarily need to have them on separate lines or separate statements.

09:35.470 --> 09:41.710
You can bring them together and make it a lot more neater when you're outputting your code.

09:41.830 --> 09:48.970
So another one that I want to show you before we finish off this lesson and that's going to be Phil.

09:49.030 --> 09:55.730
So Phil is a really powerful one and we saw earlier that if I take my array.

09:55.780 --> 09:59.750
And so I'm going to comment.

09:59.850 --> 10:01.380
Got one as well.

10:01.510 --> 10:11.500
And we saw earlier that if we take the array and if I do animals and if I do something like 20 and then

10:11.560 --> 10:14.150
I had another animal here.

10:14.320 --> 10:19.820
So I'm going to go back to horse saying I'm running out of animals here.

10:19.990 --> 10:26.560
So if I go back to here and if we print out the array We've got 21 items in there and we've got a bunch

10:26.560 --> 10:32.700
of undefine there so we've got a bunch of undefined values that are sitting there within that array.

10:33.070 --> 10:43.100
So this is where Phil can be used and we can actually fill in the missing items in the array.

10:43.130 --> 10:54.470
So now that we've set the length to 21 I can take animals and I can use Phil and Phil is pretty powerful

10:54.920 --> 10:59.270
because it gives you the ability to fill all of those empty items.

10:59.360 --> 11:05.750
So I know that I've got a couple options here a parameter so I can enter in.

11:05.750 --> 11:09.020
The first thing that we need to enter in is the value.

11:09.170 --> 11:16.770
So if we've got a mouse and next we can enter in a starting position.

11:16.790 --> 11:21.440
So starting index we've got 1 0 1 2 3 4 5.

11:21.500 --> 11:28.790
So let's start at position number 6 and then we can leave it at 6 and I'll show you what actually happens

11:28.790 --> 11:29.380
now.

11:29.480 --> 11:36.050
So we see that instead of leaving them all blank it fills in all of those values with mouse all the

11:36.050 --> 11:37.510
way till the end.

11:37.520 --> 11:42.040
I can also specify an ending index value.

11:42.170 --> 11:49.520
So I have another option here and I can do something like 20 and refresh it.

11:49.700 --> 11:55.160
And we see that it goes all the way to item number 20 which is.

11:55.280 --> 11:56.610
And then it stops there.

11:56.660 --> 12:03.270
So it fills all of those in with mouse but it stops before it hits that last one which is the horse.

12:03.320 --> 12:12.620
So I could also do something like animals length and we could refresh it and we can see that this time

12:12.620 --> 12:16.690
because the length is 21 it's going to go all the way to 21.

12:16.850 --> 12:24.460
So I could also subtract one off of the length to make it a little bit more dynamic cute refreshed again

12:24.470 --> 12:27.420
and we can see that that way we made it more dynamic.

12:27.560 --> 12:30.320
So I do have another really quick challenge for you.

12:30.410 --> 12:37.550
And this is going to be trying to make this value of 6 dynamic and plus the video and I'll show you

12:37.550 --> 12:41.630
how to set that value and let me show you what the solution is.

12:41.630 --> 12:47.620
So the solution is to set a start start slow start value.

12:47.810 --> 12:53.860
And here is where we can use this value of animals length minus one.

12:54.470 --> 13:01.470
And this gives us a value of so you can cancel like that out so we can actually see what that start

13:01.500 --> 13:02.330
for you is

13:05.450 --> 13:12.470
and then let's replace 6 with that start value and go back to refresh the page.

13:12.470 --> 13:15.140
So we've got our start value of 5.

13:15.260 --> 13:19.610
So we know that we don't need to subtract the one off our start value.

13:19.730 --> 13:20.700
So just leave it.

13:20.780 --> 13:21.630
Animals length.

13:21.670 --> 13:22.580
Refresh it.

13:22.670 --> 13:25.210
And this time we got six so we're correct.

13:25.280 --> 13:33.050
We're able to start at zebra and we're able to add filler all the way to the horse.

13:33.230 --> 13:39.290
So the next lesson we're going to be working with all of these different built in methods and I'm going

13:39.290 --> 13:48.080
to be issuing you a challenge to take a starting array value and provide the array value that I'm going

13:48.080 --> 13:49.010
to be showing you.

13:49.280 --> 13:50.830
So that's coming up in the next lesson.
