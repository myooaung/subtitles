00:01.090 --> 00:07.150
Welcome back to the conclusion of our name game find her game that we've been developing over the last

00:07.150 --> 00:08.390
few lessons.

00:08.510 --> 00:16.300
So we had left it off that when we hit start it asks us to find a name and then we can go ahead and

00:16.300 --> 00:20.360
we can try to find that name and all of the scrambled names.

00:20.530 --> 00:24.320
So let's let's update what we're doing down here.

00:24.340 --> 00:30.160
And we want to make sure that we want to output a message if it's correct or not.

00:30.160 --> 00:36.430
So when the user makes a selection and we're going to put it to message to say let's do a message to

00:40.370 --> 00:45.950
and to correct and then message to wrong.

00:50.660 --> 00:51.920
And save that.

00:51.920 --> 00:57.540
Go back out and click Start swift to find Larry.

00:57.560 --> 01:00.240
So it clicked and it's correct Ron.

01:00.320 --> 01:01.740
So that's working.

01:01.760 --> 01:10.880
So the next objective is to actually remove the item from the array and also remove the item visually

01:10.970 --> 01:12.740
from the user's screen.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.520
So those are two things that we need to do.

01:14.540 --> 01:22.250
And then we also need to relaunch that find person function because this basically means that they've

01:22.250 --> 01:23.170
got it correct.

01:23.300 --> 01:25.580
So they have to find a new person.

01:25.580 --> 01:26.780
So there's two things.

01:26.780 --> 01:28.950
Two more things that we need to do in here.

01:29.090 --> 01:32.720
So we need to remove element.

01:33.020 --> 01:38.280
So the current element and we have to remove from our

01:42.360 --> 01:54.330
So pause the video and go back to where we were looking at arrays and idÃ©e and how we can select.

01:54.330 --> 02:00.040
So we've got the value of the item in the array but we don't have the index.

02:00.090 --> 02:07.740
So look up how we can remove an item from the array and then also we'll go over how we can remove the

02:07.740 --> 02:10.730
element from the screen as well.

02:12.710 --> 02:15.070
So we had an opportunity to take a look at.

02:15.080 --> 02:21.890
When we looked at arrays and we know with the raise we need to get the index value in order to do a

02:21.890 --> 02:22.930
removal.

02:22.970 --> 02:29.120
Otherwise we just don't know what item it is that we need to remove so we can use splice but we need

02:29.120 --> 02:31.200
to know the index value.

02:31.460 --> 02:37.510
So let's find out the index value of that particular key within the array.

02:37.760 --> 02:47.860
So we can do variable and we'll just give it a variable of an my array and we can do index of.

02:48.320 --> 02:53.490
And this is where we can pass s or key and actually it doesn't really matter.

02:53.990 --> 02:59.550
So basically what's going to happen here is this returns back our index number.

02:59.780 --> 03:07.470
So now we can get rid of this and we can do my array and we can use the splice method.

03:07.850 --> 03:16.760
And basically this allows us to provide an index number and remove a number of items from the array.

03:16.790 --> 03:20.740
So we only want to remove that one item that matches that index number.

03:20.870 --> 03:23.640
So basically it's going to pull that one out of the array.

03:24.110 --> 03:31.700
And the other part of it was that we needed to do is we needed to remove one of these element.

03:31.820 --> 03:40.670
So we know we have the current element in this and we know that if we want to remove something we have

03:40.670 --> 03:51.650
to go up to the parent node because then if we move up then we can look to do remove child from that

03:51.650 --> 04:00.980
parent and we already have information on that child because that information is t..

04:00.990 --> 04:07.890
So basically we're passing that this object we know which element is that we want to remove.

04:07.890 --> 04:13.200
So basically we're passing that up and then we're removing it from the array as well.

04:13.200 --> 04:20.610
So now let's try that out and start so we know that we've got Mike and it's wrong.

04:20.700 --> 04:22.050
So we're looking for Larry.

04:22.170 --> 04:23.010
So it's there.

04:23.070 --> 04:23.900
So it's correct.

04:23.950 --> 04:26.100
We got to remove him out.

04:26.370 --> 04:28.270
Next one John.

04:28.350 --> 04:31.240
So everything looks like it's working properly.

04:31.410 --> 04:34.200
And there's one other thing that we do need to still take care of

04:37.650 --> 04:43.260
so you notice that once I'm coming to the end of the game there's actually no way to finish the game.

04:43.290 --> 04:49.440
So this is where we need to add in a way to finish the game and we can do this when we're looking for

04:49.440 --> 04:51.880
the new elements when it's been clicked.

04:51.990 --> 04:57.750
So this is the part where we know that if we've removed it out of the array then that's it.

04:57.750 --> 05:05.030
The game is over and we're not looking for anything else or any new items within that array because

05:05.080 --> 05:07.000
array is at zero.

05:07.020 --> 05:15.840
So let's do a quick check to see if my array length is less than or equal to zero.

05:16.020 --> 05:19.270
And if it is then we know our game is over.

05:19.590 --> 05:27.490
So let's pass a message into Message 1 and we're going to just say game over a message one

05:30.700 --> 05:32.160
game over.

05:32.170 --> 05:34.960
So nice and big uppercase like that.

05:34.990 --> 05:41.290
So now we know the game is over and the user really has no choice but to start again.

05:41.500 --> 05:48.940
So we're not going to ask him any more notches and there's nothing else really to do other than to start

05:48.940 --> 05:50.560
the game again.

05:50.590 --> 05:56.560
So let's let's save that and let's try the functionality.

05:56.900 --> 06:03.360
So now we're looking for the names so I can just click a bunch of them here as well.

06:05.730 --> 06:08.490
So we're looking for Laurence looking for a jawin

06:17.210 --> 06:19.060
and going all the way down.

06:19.100 --> 06:20.340
And now we see Game over.

06:20.360 --> 06:24.460
So now we can get started again and we can play the game once again.

06:24.920 --> 06:31.290
So the game is fairly flexible because if you add in more values into the array it will work.

06:31.340 --> 06:35.780
Make sure that you don't have any duplicates within that array because that will throw the game off.

06:35.960 --> 06:40.730
And other than that it's fairly dynamic and it will adjust to the number of people that you have in

06:40.730 --> 06:47.780
the array and you can also update these functions with the shuffle functions that we looked at earlier

06:48.050 --> 06:48.820
as well.

06:48.890 --> 06:54.590
And then this one here is just simply to add a little bit more interest because we can scramble the

06:54.590 --> 06:55.250
letters.

06:55.310 --> 06:59.690
So this is another function that we're going to be looking at later on in the course what we can do

06:59.690 --> 07:03.140
with strings and string methods.

07:03.620 --> 07:05.200
So try it out for yourself.

07:05.300 --> 07:07.310
Build out and build out

07:11.000 --> 07:14.030
a bunch of divs dynamically from the array.

07:14.030 --> 07:15.750
So that's the thing to practice here.

07:15.770 --> 07:18.530
Take an array with a number of values.

07:18.530 --> 07:26.270
Build out your gameboard dynamically with mouseover mouseover and on click pass those values over and

07:26.270 --> 07:28.700
make something happen within the functions.

07:28.700 --> 07:35.540
So try that for yourself and you could also update the styling and create your own spin on what happens

07:35.930 --> 07:37.870
when the user guesses correctly.
