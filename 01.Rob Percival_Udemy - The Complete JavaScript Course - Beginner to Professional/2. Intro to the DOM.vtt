00:01.250 --> 00:07.350
Well come in in this section we're going to be looking at how we can connect javascript to our age to

00:07.370 --> 00:08.520
male elements.

00:08.740 --> 00:12.500
And we're going to accomplish this by using the dorm.

00:12.580 --> 00:19.450
And what that dorm is is essentially is the document object model and it outputs the entire contents

00:19.660 --> 00:27.550
of your HMO page as nodes within an object like structure and in order to see that on.

00:27.670 --> 00:34.470
So I'm just doing right now is collect on selecting the document object and I'm listening.

00:34.480 --> 00:37.710
So we saw earlier in that we were using console log.

00:37.810 --> 00:42.050
We could also use console Diyar to output a directory.

00:42.190 --> 00:49.150
So when I refresh it I get this object here that's sitting with my console and I open that up and it

00:49.150 --> 00:52.080
contains a whole lot of information.

00:52.110 --> 00:54.910
We can see we've got that you are out of the Web site.

00:55.060 --> 00:57.150
We've got them base you are on.

00:57.310 --> 00:59.230
So in this case it's the same.

00:59.250 --> 01:01.300
We even got character sets.

01:01.300 --> 01:03.920
We've got information about cookies.

01:04.090 --> 01:10.960
And then we've also got that document type and we've got even more information so we've got basically

01:11.020 --> 01:14.880
all of the information that's contained within each HTML page.

01:14.890 --> 01:17.620
And it's like a map of your web page.

01:17.740 --> 01:24.760
And what this does is this allows us to connect and manipulate different parts of our web page using

01:24.880 --> 01:25.630
javascript

01:28.170 --> 01:35.970
and there is a whole lot we can do with using javascript and picking up information from the dawn.

01:36.030 --> 01:42.700
It allows us to interact with each to melt content and make use of the content that we've got here within

01:42.810 --> 01:44.030
our age to melt.

01:44.100 --> 01:50.500
So if I was to create a different if I refresh it for that particular div is now reflected with the

01:50.520 --> 01:58.340
on and we see here that all the East Tummo collections we've got our H-2 mail time starting at the top

01:58.420 --> 02:04.940
that we've got a head that's one that we encounter is title than body and then div and then script and

02:04.940 --> 02:11.370
all of that information is put here and accessible via the dome.

02:11.490 --> 02:14.720
And this is all delivered and rendered.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.650
Built up by the browser.

02:16.800 --> 02:22.360
So what's happening here is that the browser is accessing the H-2 Mel page.

02:22.460 --> 02:31.900
It's reading through the contents of each page and then rendering it and building up this model of what's

02:31.900 --> 02:33.730
available on your page.

02:33.730 --> 02:41.020
So this was all created by the browser and every time the page loads it builds out all of this information

02:41.200 --> 02:45.970
which of course is then accessible and usable by Javascript.

02:47.560 --> 02:55.990
So what I want you to do now is to open up the console in your browser and simply type in the console

02:56.200 --> 02:58.320
and you can do this on any web page.

02:58.360 --> 03:06.180
So console Dionte and then select that document object and then close off the parentheses.

03:06.310 --> 03:10.750
And that's so you can get information as to contain what's contained on the page.

03:10.780 --> 03:13.910
And this is again available on any web page.

03:13.930 --> 03:23.290
So open up the console and right now on the Google Chrome dev tools page into console console directory

03:23.320 --> 03:24.500
and document.

03:24.640 --> 03:27.220
So that's the first statement that we need to enter in.

03:27.340 --> 03:31.350
And now you can see that I've got all of the information that's contained here.

03:31.450 --> 03:34.490
I can get the URL I can get all of the elements.

03:34.490 --> 03:39.790
There's quite a lot of elements on this page so I access and they're all built with him dorm.

03:39.910 --> 03:42.040
I've got all of the body information.

03:42.160 --> 03:45.040
I've got all of the page information.

03:45.070 --> 03:51.610
I've even got over here when we go down further we can see all of the listeners that have been set up

03:51.700 --> 03:52.750
within the page.

03:52.750 --> 03:54.950
So all of those are listed as well.

03:55.060 --> 04:03.100
And we really make use of those with javascript and we can treat this entire document just as if it

04:03.100 --> 04:04.740
was any other object.

04:04.840 --> 04:11.320
And we can traverse through picking up information that's contained within here and making use of it

04:11.320 --> 04:15.280
within our javascript so open that up right now within your console.

04:15.280 --> 04:21.190
Try it out and take a look at the web page that you're on and pick up some key information and then

04:21.190 --> 04:25.830
the next lesson I'm going to show you a poll and bring that into javascript's.

04:25.840 --> 04:26.770
So that's coming up.
