00:00.580 --> 00:06.670
What cannot get in this lesson we're going to be manipulating the styling of elements within our page.

00:06.740 --> 00:12.470
So we're going to be creating what we see here where we've got rotating callers and some random callers

00:12.470 --> 00:16.760
being applied to the elements within our age Tim Page.

00:16.760 --> 00:21.710
The way that we're going to do this is we're going to use the style attribute so we know when we're

00:21.710 --> 00:24.710
writing H.T. M-L that we can grab the style.

00:24.710 --> 00:28.370
So first of all let's grab this element up here.

00:28.370 --> 00:31.340
We're going to just do it by id setting up a variable.

00:31.340 --> 00:38.150
Message equals document and we've done this multiple times before where we're using Document get element

00:38.150 --> 00:43.940
by ID in order to grab that element because we just need to have that one element and we're going to

00:43.940 --> 00:46.990
bring that in to a variable called message.

00:47.000 --> 00:53.180
So let's go back out and refreshed the page and now type message so that we can see that we can grab

00:53.180 --> 00:54.160
that element.

00:54.170 --> 00:58.790
So once we have that element we can actually do stuff with that element.

00:58.790 --> 01:03.330
So watch what happens with that element and let's do message.

01:03.380 --> 01:09.590
And just like what we saw earlier where we're getting the enraged him all the inner text and we were

01:09.590 --> 01:14.390
also able to pull back the attributes so we could pull back the ID and so on.

01:14.390 --> 01:19.490
So if we do something like Message ID we actually get its ID being returned back.

01:19.520 --> 01:26.810
So we see within that dorm we already have a connection within that object connecting it to all of the

01:26.810 --> 01:31.250
different parts all the different attributes that are part of that element.

01:31.250 --> 01:37.730
So it can pull back the ID and that also means that if we can pull it back then we can update it and

01:37.760 --> 01:39.510
we know when were writing him.

01:39.530 --> 01:46.100
We can add in the attribute style and style it gives us the ability to manipulate the essence of the

01:46.100 --> 01:47.270
element.

01:47.270 --> 01:49.080
So let's let's try that.

01:49.100 --> 01:57.180
So we've got the elements within the value of message and let's apply style to it.

01:57.470 --> 02:01.500
So what style we know we have a lot of options with style.

02:01.610 --> 02:06.060
And one of them that we use and C-s us is we display.

02:06.260 --> 02:08.980
So let's update the display value.

02:09.020 --> 02:10.780
And we're going to set it to none.

02:10.790 --> 02:15.730
So watch what happens to message when I click this and we see that it disappears.

02:15.770 --> 02:19.440
Because we've now updated the style attribute to it.

02:19.490 --> 02:28.600
So now that element of say style display none so we can bring it back into our page by using block.

02:28.700 --> 02:34.120
And we know that from CSSA if we display block then it's visible once again.

02:34.250 --> 02:37.570
So that element didn't actually disappear we just weren't able to view it.

02:37.670 --> 02:40.290
And that was all done through us.

02:40.310 --> 02:45.000
So let's try something else so we know that with CSX we've got a lot of options.

02:45.050 --> 02:48.560
We can do color so we can update the color of an element.

02:48.590 --> 02:55.040
So let's try updating the color so watch again that first element and we're updating color and we see

02:55.040 --> 02:56.150
it comes back red.

02:56.330 --> 02:58.810
So we can update and change the color.

02:58.820 --> 03:05.810
We've also got a bunch of options for the border so we can select back the border color as well.

03:05.870 --> 03:11.120
So let's do the border of the element and we've got options for border bottom.

03:11.120 --> 03:18.590
So this is in line with what we typically see within CSSA where we can do solid one pick and we'll do

03:18.600 --> 03:24.010
block so we can see that we can add that bottom border to it.

03:24.250 --> 03:27.120
And we also can update the color.

03:27.190 --> 03:32.610
So if we want to do just the bottom border color we've got an option to that as well.

03:32.650 --> 03:35.520
So let's do color and equal it in blue.

03:35.650 --> 03:41.950
So this is the same options that we have in CSX when we select those elements we can see that we've

03:41.950 --> 03:47.860
got all of these options so when I select it within here now I've got all of these attributes being

03:47.860 --> 03:48.570
applied.

03:48.640 --> 03:54.250
So I've selected the element and I'm looking at my inspector within the chrome console and I see I've

03:54.250 --> 03:57.310
got a bottom border one pick solid blue.

03:57.310 --> 03:59.440
I've got a color red display.

03:59.440 --> 04:03.370
Block so we've got all of those attributes being added in.

04:03.490 --> 04:07.600
And we're doing all of this dynamically via javascript.

04:07.600 --> 04:15.580
Let's do one more thing let's do a border so let's do a border completely around it and we'll do a border

04:16.120 --> 04:21.570
one pick solid and let's do a black border around it.

04:22.180 --> 04:24.390
So now we can do a border around it.

04:24.400 --> 04:26.290
So there's a lot of options.

04:26.410 --> 04:30.530
And some of the styling is the same as the styling attributes.

04:30.700 --> 04:32.690
And some will vary slightly.

04:32.680 --> 04:38.600
So you got to be a little bit careful that it's not always exactly like CSX.

04:38.650 --> 04:40.810
There's also background color.

04:40.960 --> 04:43.380
So this one because it's an object.

04:43.450 --> 04:45.550
They keep it within one word like that.

04:45.670 --> 04:49.530
So let's update the background color and set it to yellow.

04:50.330 --> 04:56.310
So what I want you to do now is pause the video and update some of the style and go to a web page.

04:56.330 --> 05:03.290
Any web page or open up the one that we've got here now and create some elements and then select those

05:03.320 --> 05:09.140
elements and update some of those styling of those elements and just get familiar with some of the styling

05:09.170 --> 05:09.920
options.

05:10.070 --> 05:15.890
And you can see the options within the dropdown if you're using Chrome within the developer console.

05:15.890 --> 05:21.070
You'll see that just as I'm typing here you get a bunch of options for style.

05:21.080 --> 05:25.220
So I've got the same thing here that I've got a lot of different options.

05:25.220 --> 05:26.700
They're all listed in here.

05:26.750 --> 05:31.250
You can see that you can get a really really fine tune what you're updating.

05:31.250 --> 05:33.560
We've got background color which we've used.

05:33.560 --> 05:39.470
We've got background position so we can update all of that dynamically as well which is really cool

05:39.470 --> 05:42.740
because that gives us the ability to move things around.

05:42.800 --> 05:46.980
We've got the font options so we can do font size.

05:47.120 --> 05:52.190
So some of these if you're especially used to see assess a lot of the stuff will be familiar with you

05:52.460 --> 05:58.780
and just keep in mind that there is a way that you need to make sure that it's not always lined within

05:58.790 --> 06:00.060
that same format.

06:00.110 --> 06:01.220
So there's padding.

06:01.460 --> 06:02.240
So go ahead.

06:02.240 --> 06:03.400
Open up a web page.

06:03.500 --> 06:07.590
Just try it out for yourself and just be familiar with the styling.

06:07.910 --> 06:11.720
And also I've got a challenge for you as well.

06:11.750 --> 06:17.470
So I want you to open up your editor and select out all of these elements.

06:17.630 --> 06:22.800
And I want you to apply different background color to them.

06:22.910 --> 06:30.830
So open them up and apply a background color to them so maybe open them up and do yellow to all of the

06:30.830 --> 06:32.720
class outputs.

06:32.780 --> 06:40.790
So pause the video and update the background color of all of the elements with the class output and

06:40.790 --> 06:42.890
I'll show you the solution coming up.

06:44.210 --> 06:46.610
So you had an opportunity to try that out.

06:46.760 --> 06:48.820
So let me show you the solution for this.

06:48.840 --> 06:55.640
So the challenge is that we've got a number of elements with the class output and we want to update

06:55.730 --> 06:57.910
the background color to yellow.

06:58.100 --> 07:03.770
So the first thing that we need to do is make our selection of our elements and get it into a usable

07:03.770 --> 07:05.220
format in Javascript.

07:05.270 --> 07:08.840
So placing all of those elements into an object.

07:08.840 --> 07:14.660
So I'm going to use E-L as a variable and this is where it's optional so there is a number of ways actually

07:14.660 --> 07:19.620
to make the selection because we're simply selecting all the elements with class.

07:19.640 --> 07:23.600
So I like to use actually Querrey selector all.

07:23.840 --> 07:28.110
And that's because this one it's really one of the most flexible ones.

07:28.250 --> 07:29.510
But again it's up to you.

07:29.530 --> 07:32.270
You could do this in a number of different ways.

07:32.330 --> 07:34.160
So Querrey select all.

07:34.190 --> 07:40.850
And then we need to select the particular element and with queries select all.

07:40.880 --> 07:45.840
Don't forget if you're selecting a class that to include the period in front of it.

07:45.930 --> 07:50.870
So it's often sometimes that something that gets left out because the other ones when we're already

07:50.870 --> 07:56.330
specifying how we're grabbing that element if we're grabbing it by ID we already know that there's going

07:56.330 --> 08:01.700
to be a hash in front of it when we're doing it within styling so we don't need to be specific but in

08:01.700 --> 08:07.910
here we need a way to differentiate that it's output and it's not an idea or it's not a tag and so on.

08:07.910 --> 08:11.630
So that's where we need to specify just as we do within CSX.

08:11.660 --> 08:20.030
So grab all of those elements and now we know that we've got access to it as as an array so we can loop

08:20.030 --> 08:24.330
through all of those Arev values and output the values.

08:24.480 --> 08:27.290
I can set one up here within the loop.

08:27.290 --> 08:37.610
So basically I'm going to use the variable x so x starting at zero and loop through while x is less

08:37.610 --> 08:47.990
than l length because we've got all of those elements within that L array and then we need to increment

08:48.040 --> 08:48.400
x.

08:48.410 --> 08:50.130
So we have a way out of loop.

08:50.240 --> 08:53.260
So eventually that that condition will fail.

08:53.270 --> 09:00.290
So now we're doing our loop and the next part of it was simply to update the background color to yellow.

09:00.410 --> 09:10.100
So let's do l and grab it with an X and we saw earlier that we can do style and background color.

09:10.100 --> 09:16.490
So there is a number of different options as well but let's do background color and lets the background

09:16.490 --> 09:17.960
color to yellow.

09:19.370 --> 09:24.670
So go back out refresh your page and we see that we were able to set them all.

09:24.770 --> 09:25.410
Yellow.

09:25.680 --> 09:28.730
So there was a second part to this challenge.

09:28.850 --> 09:36.890
And now what I want you to do is as we saw earlier I want a bunch of random colors rotating colors and

09:36.890 --> 09:38.270
every two to three seconds.

09:38.300 --> 09:44.830
I want a different background color on the elements of the class that have class output.

09:45.140 --> 09:46.860
So update your code.

09:46.880 --> 09:53.000
Open up your editor and make those adjustments to the source code and use what we worked on earlier

09:53.060 --> 09:58.730
where we saw the onload where we can launch a function and then use that function to set an interval

09:58.880 --> 10:05.790
which we also saw earlier where we can set an interval to run another function on a set amount of time.

10:06.110 --> 10:06.650
So go ahead.

10:06.650 --> 10:07.640
Plus the video.

10:07.670 --> 10:11.040
Try it out and I'll show you the solution to that.

10:11.240 --> 10:13.940
So we'll get an opportunity to try this out.

10:14.040 --> 10:17.180
And the first thing that we need to do we need to set up an array.

10:17.370 --> 10:20.480
So I'm going to set up an area I'm going to call that background color.

10:20.640 --> 10:26.490
And then within here we need to populate it with a number of typical background colors.

10:26.610 --> 10:35.430
So we're going to use red blue and yellow and green and then I'm also going to use some other ones here

10:35.440 --> 10:42.440
so I think pink is a valid color purple so you can you can add as many as you want to this list that

10:42.450 --> 10:43.260
doesn't really matter.

10:43.260 --> 10:48.270
This is just giving us more variety within what we're choosing to display.

10:48.570 --> 10:54.540
And the next thing that I want to do is I want to hold a value for the color because I want to have

10:54.780 --> 10:55.980
random color.

10:55.980 --> 11:01.940
So I'm just going to have a placeholder of a global variable called See and then next what we need to

11:01.940 --> 11:07.760
do is we need to launch a function which is going to initiate the intervals because remember again that

11:07.760 --> 11:12.920
that interval we need a way to start it and we want to make sure the page has loaded before we try to

11:12.920 --> 11:14.150
run our interval.

11:14.150 --> 11:19.790
So I wait till on load and we saw earlier that there was a number of ways to do this as well.

11:19.820 --> 11:22.660
So you could do it within the javascript's window on load.

11:22.730 --> 11:24.320
It doesn't really matter.

11:24.320 --> 11:26.600
We're just launching that start function.

11:26.810 --> 11:33.860
So now we need to go in here and create a start function of function and start and within the start

11:33.860 --> 11:34.340
function.

11:34.340 --> 11:36.460
This is where we're going to set our interval.

11:36.560 --> 11:44.720
So using the method set interval that allows us to run a code snippet repeatedly on a fixed delay and

11:44.750 --> 11:50.270
we know that we can use a function which would be our code snippet that we could run repeatedly.

11:50.270 --> 11:52.670
And then next we need to set an interval time.

11:52.730 --> 11:58.250
So I'm going to use two thousand milliseconds so that equates to about two seconds.

11:58.310 --> 12:02.500
So next and last but not least we need to create another function.

12:02.630 --> 12:09.980
And this one is going to be the one that's actually going to swap the background color and do all of

12:09.980 --> 12:11.300
that functionality.

12:11.300 --> 12:16.640
So we've got quite a bit of it already done in here where we're setting it as yellow.

12:16.760 --> 12:21.450
But we do need to have a little bit of random action happening as well.

12:21.620 --> 12:29.780
So the way that we can select a random value from our color array is we've thought we've seen this before

12:29.840 --> 12:35.250
where we can generate using math random and pick a random value.

12:35.390 --> 12:38.610
So let's set that up will you see which was our placeholder.

12:38.690 --> 12:43.610
We're going to grab that array which was background color.

12:43.950 --> 12:50.290
And then here is where we need to specify the index value that we want to use for this color.

12:50.310 --> 12:53.910
So usually I like to do this in all in one nice neat statement.

12:53.910 --> 12:58.740
You could also set up another variable call that number and then this one could generate the random

12:58.740 --> 13:02.490
number and then place that within the brackets.

13:02.700 --> 13:09.060
But for now I'm going to just do it all as one statement so mouth floor and then we know that within

13:09.060 --> 13:15.540
here the reason we use mouth floor is because math random returns back of value with a bunch of decimal

13:15.540 --> 13:16.380
places.

13:16.380 --> 13:18.850
So we want to cut off all those decimal places.

13:19.140 --> 13:26.850
And we also know that with math random if we multiply it by a number that actually gives us a random

13:26.940 --> 13:28.660
value for that.

13:28.860 --> 13:35.960
Up to that number zero to that number and we're going to do length so that we'll pick a random number.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.530
We've got a length of six.

13:37.560 --> 13:42.550
So we'll get a random number from 0 to 5 because we're math floor.

13:42.660 --> 13:48.810
And basically that equals all of the possible index values within the background array.

13:48.810 --> 13:50.850
So now all that is next step.

13:50.850 --> 13:52.940
Just copy that see over to there.

13:53.100 --> 13:55.000
And now we're ready to try this out.

13:55.380 --> 13:58.650
So save it and go out here and try it out.

14:00.190 --> 14:06.250
And we wait two seconds and basically we have completed our functionality for this lesson where we've

14:06.250 --> 14:14.120
got these rotating colors background colors available within our within our aged him M..

14:14.420 --> 14:20.920
And also practice even more with the style attribute because there is a lot you can do.

14:20.930 --> 14:27.080
And if you're not familiar with CSSA then you're going to see that there's a lot of different options

14:27.080 --> 14:28.440
for those attributes.

14:28.460 --> 14:33.620
So it is important to kind of get familiar with them and see what is available and if you are familiar

14:33.620 --> 14:40.520
with CSSA you should be able to find similar attributes similar object values that you can relate and

14:40.520 --> 14:44.230
connect to an update within your team.

14:44.600 --> 14:46.340
So go ahead and try it for yourself.

14:46.460 --> 14:52.710
And in the next lesson we're going to look at even more we can do with styling and Javascript.
