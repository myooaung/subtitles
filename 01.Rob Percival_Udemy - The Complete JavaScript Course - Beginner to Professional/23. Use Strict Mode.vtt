Welcome back in in this lesson we're going to look at using strict within our javascript so we're able

00:07.650 --> 00:12.920
to define how the code should be executed and what mode it should be executed in.

00:12.930 --> 00:15.390
So let's first of all let's create a function.

00:15.390 --> 00:19.080
We're going to invoke the function and let's create that function.

00:19.080 --> 00:26.430
So in all the functions and we saw earlier that javascript is very forgiving when it creates code.

00:26.460 --> 00:36.540
So if we do something like we set a value of A and we call it to Hello World and then over here we do

00:36.540 --> 00:39.510
a console log a.

00:40.920 --> 00:46.530
And if we refresh it we see that it works even though we never declared the variable.

00:46.530 --> 00:47.700
It still works.

00:47.700 --> 00:54.450
And that's because javascript tries to make things work it tries to understand as best as possible what

00:54.450 --> 01:00.750
your intentions are and if for some reason you forgot to declare a variable within a function.

01:00.900 --> 01:07.170
This automatically becomes a global variable and you have access to it after you've invoked the function

01:07.470 --> 01:14.640
which normally shouldn't happen and you can't prevent these types of errors by adding in use strict.

01:14.640 --> 01:23.370
So basically what this does is this basically forces javascript to execute within a strict mode.

01:23.440 --> 01:30.210
And what that does is that takes care of and catches these types of errors and it throws an error within

01:30.210 --> 01:31.260
the console.

01:31.260 --> 01:36.110
So this basically gives us the ability to catch these errors and fix them.

01:36.150 --> 01:44.370
So in a case where we are declaring variables within a function and we are placing them globally this

01:44.370 --> 01:49.920
makes javascript not as forgiving and open to creating these types of errors.

01:49.920 --> 01:52.950
So what I want you to do now is try it for yourself.

01:53.070 --> 01:58.500
Open up your editor create a function call that function without declaring a variable set of variable

01:58.500 --> 02:00.200
in there and then add in.

02:00.240 --> 02:03.080
Use strict and see the difference.

02:03.360 --> 02:05.360
And then of course if you remove it.

02:05.430 --> 02:06.520
Use strict.

02:06.630 --> 02:08.070
You'll see that it's work.

02:08.100 --> 02:09.460
Once again working.

02:09.660 --> 02:15.790
So this is really bad format and you should never do this in practice when you are writing your code.

02:15.840 --> 02:17.780
Always always declare your variables.

02:17.970 --> 02:25.950
But in case you want to make sure and ensure that things are proper in that use strict they're within

02:26.010 --> 02:27.150
the top of your code.
