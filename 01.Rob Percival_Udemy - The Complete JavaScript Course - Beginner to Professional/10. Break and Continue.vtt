00:01.080 --> 00:07.970
So well come back and this lesson where you look at break and continue and how they work within loops.

00:07.970 --> 00:15.410
So earlier we saw how we can build a table within a loop and if for instance Well some want to break

00:15.410 --> 00:16.310
out of this loop.

00:16.460 --> 00:20.090
We don't want to continue to the value of 10.

00:20.090 --> 00:27.580
We can do a quick check and have the ability to actually jump out of this.

00:28.060 --> 00:35.020
So all we need is a condition and this condition gives us the ability to write some code to run some

00:35.020 --> 00:35.590
code.

00:35.730 --> 00:37.140
So let's do a roll.

00:37.300 --> 00:46.100
And in this case we're going to check to see if RHO is equal to 5 and if it is then all we're going

00:46.100 --> 00:47.600
to do is break.

00:47.600 --> 00:49.540
So let me show you what happens now.

00:49.930 --> 00:51.760
So we refresh the page.

00:51.760 --> 00:56.610
We actually get the five five rows of content.

00:56.710 --> 01:02.500
And this is where break comes in and actually stops the execution of the loop.

01:02.830 --> 01:06.690
So there are instances where you might need to break out of the loop.

01:06.880 --> 01:08.230
And this is how you do it.

01:08.280 --> 01:10.210
You just simply enter and break.

01:10.210 --> 01:17.920
Usually it's done with a condition and if that condition evaluates to TRUE that won't just break out

01:17.920 --> 01:19.130
of it.

01:19.180 --> 01:26.620
So this could be used for instances if maybe some of these values you don't want to post them.

01:26.650 --> 01:33.310
If you've got some if you working off of a set number of values and you post them in the cells and then

01:33.310 --> 01:36.070
all of a sudden something is corrupted or it's not right.

01:36.070 --> 01:38.130
They can break out of it really easily.

01:38.380 --> 01:42.150
So the other one that I want to talk to about is continue.

01:42.390 --> 01:43.970
So continue.

01:44.290 --> 01:53.920
We do it the same way we do conditional and we ask to see if that will do it for five as well.

01:54.470 --> 01:57.380
So next we continue.

01:57.380 --> 01:59.490
So what do you think will happen here.

01:59.780 --> 02:07.580
If we add and continue we saw what happened with break but continue is actually a complete opposite

02:07.640 --> 02:12.660
of break because break makes sense to jump out of that.

02:12.830 --> 02:13.910
But continue.

02:13.910 --> 02:20.080
So what do you think continue is going to do here and pay and look at what the output is going to be.

02:20.210 --> 02:25.590
So when I go and if I refresh it what do you think happened with continue.

02:25.590 --> 02:26.670
So let me explain.

02:27.050 --> 02:36.310
So what's gone on here is we've gone through the first roll second third fourth fifth and this one is.

02:36.320 --> 02:39.360
Now we know that roll is equal to five.

02:39.380 --> 02:48.200
So what's happening here is that we actually see all of this part here with continue and we go back

02:48.200 --> 02:51.140
to the irradiation of the loop value.

02:51.560 --> 02:59.180
So all that's happened here is we jumped over that value and we've simply simply skipped it.

02:59.210 --> 03:07.970
So this is important to know that if for instance I want to do something if I put continue at the bottom

03:08.210 --> 03:13.940
it's actually not going to make any difference because this is continue at the bottom of the code and

03:13.940 --> 03:16.990
I'm not running any additional code on after here.

03:17.420 --> 03:22.760
So you can see this by this type of format.

03:22.780 --> 03:32.670
If I was setting a value and I'm going to use Holder again so I'm going to just say for now it's empty.

03:33.780 --> 03:37.890
And what we're going to do is we're going to add some values in it.

03:37.890 --> 03:44.810
So basically I can't put a value of holder and I'm going to equal that too.

03:45.020 --> 03:49.240
It would just take that value that's contained within the cell.

03:50.810 --> 03:53.330
And we'll do it like Dock's amps then

03:56.090 --> 04:00.480
just thinking where I put it in a more meaningful format.

04:00.500 --> 04:03.330
So just to hold her over here.

04:03.380 --> 04:06.980
So basically what's happening is they should be equal.

04:07.070 --> 04:13.460
But I've got continue over here so watch what happens on line number five and we can see that they all

04:13.490 --> 04:14.290
equal

04:17.930 --> 04:23.160
So notice that within this cell here it's equal to the 26 that we have here.

04:23.240 --> 04:31.020
So these values are the same because what's happened is that we've skipped resetting the value for Holder.

04:31.100 --> 04:33.890
We've gone back already here and we've continued the loop.

04:34.070 --> 04:41.420
So Holder never got a chance to update because we had to continue which was actually blocking the execution

04:41.420 --> 04:42.240
of the code.

04:42.380 --> 04:44.690
If this condition was true.
