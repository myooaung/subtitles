00:00.960 --> 00:07.050
Welcome back in in this lesson let's have some fun with what we've learned previously how we can manipulate

00:07.050 --> 00:11.720
how we can grab information that's available on the web page and update it.

00:11.790 --> 00:14.870
So it actually doesn't even have to be our own web pages.

00:14.970 --> 00:21.930
And of course because the door is created within the rendering of the web page source code whenever

00:21.930 --> 00:23.460
we refresh it's going to go away.

00:23.460 --> 00:29.190
So you're not actually going to be going in and updating anybody's Web site but this could be a quick

00:29.280 --> 00:34.860
trick in order to access information contained within the Web site and actually make some updates to

00:34.860 --> 00:35.230
it.

00:35.430 --> 00:43.020
So let's go and open up our browser so this can be any web page you want it can be even the one that

00:43.020 --> 00:44.980
you're on right now watching the video.

00:45.060 --> 00:51.420
So all you have to do is find an element that's got an I.D. and let's say for instance under chrome

00:51.420 --> 00:59.130
dev tools we can do an inspect on open dev tools and we can see that this particular element is called

00:59.190 --> 01:01.830
ID has an ID of open.

01:01.830 --> 01:03.320
So let's open up the console.

01:03.330 --> 01:09.880
So a variable and I get into the variable A and that is to document.

01:10.500 --> 01:17.580
So documents and do that get element by id and then ID is called Open.

01:17.640 --> 01:21.450
So select that element and place it within a.

01:21.630 --> 01:30.200
So see if I take a look and actually grab that and that information is being contained within a.

01:30.400 --> 01:34.830
So let's take a look and see what's contained within our text there.

01:34.950 --> 01:38.010
And we can see that we've grabbed that element properly.

01:38.010 --> 01:39.650
We've got open and have tools.

01:39.810 --> 01:45.860
And now we know that just as we do before we can actually uptick that are tax.

01:45.920 --> 01:53.250
So let's do something like this little world and update it and we see that what happens now is that

01:53.250 --> 01:58.980
for this instance of this particular web page even though it's on a different server I don't really

01:58.980 --> 02:00.550
have access to the source code.

02:00.660 --> 02:06.180
I can manipulate it because this is an instance of it and I've caught all of that access to what's happening

02:06.180 --> 02:13.980
within the dorm so I can select any number of elements and make updates to them simply by just grabbing

02:13.980 --> 02:16.600
them within the DOM within the web page.

02:16.650 --> 02:19.360
So now I wouldn't want you to do is pause the video.

02:19.380 --> 02:24.240
Open up your browser and you can go to any page you like.

02:24.240 --> 02:31.080
Look through the source code find one that has an ID and update some of the text that's available on

02:31.080 --> 02:37.950
the web page and you might have to spend a little bit of time trying to find ones that actually have

02:37.950 --> 02:38.620
IDs.

02:38.730 --> 02:40.710
Maybe they don't all have IDs.

02:40.950 --> 02:46.260
So in this particular case I can see that another one device more discovered of tools.

02:46.350 --> 02:51.690
So it doesn't have to be this web page but just make sure that you're able to actually identify those

02:51.750 --> 02:58.110
elements and later on in the course I'm going to show you other ways of making those selections and

02:58.110 --> 03:00.660
being able to select those elements.

03:00.660 --> 03:05.580
So even if it doesn't have an I.D. there's ways to select it and that's going to be coming up in the

03:05.580 --> 03:07.580
latter part of the course.

03:07.590 --> 03:09.850
So for now open up your browser.

03:09.870 --> 03:15.400
If it's not open already or open up and you're tired go to your favorite web page and take a look at

03:15.450 --> 03:21.540
the source code grab an element that has an ID and update that enter peached himself or the entire text

03:21.540 --> 03:22.120
of it.

03:22.140 --> 03:25.060
You can even have some fun with updating that age to melt.

03:25.260 --> 03:26.820
So try it for yourself.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.050
And I know that you want more coming up as well.

03:31.140 --> 03:37.570
So have an opportunity to try this out for yourself and it is really good practice getting familiar

03:37.570 --> 03:39.310
and making those selections.

03:39.360 --> 03:44.770
So I'm going to just grab another one that I've got here so this one's called device dash board.

03:44.880 --> 03:51.150
So let's set up a variable and you don't actually need to set up a variable so maybe what I want to

03:51.150 --> 04:02.990
do is maybe I want to just make this update to it just right away so if it's get element by ID and I

04:03.090 --> 04:08.190
believe it was called to vice and I don't need to go back.

04:08.310 --> 04:12.570
So it was device mode.

04:12.860 --> 04:18.410
And now let's set that interface to all of this particular object.

04:18.460 --> 04:21.140
So let's change this to each one.

04:21.370 --> 04:29.430
And big words are you are you are now.

04:29.750 --> 04:32.010
So whatever message you want to put in there.

04:32.240 --> 04:34.130
And of course you can have some fun with this.

04:34.250 --> 04:40.580
So what I'm going to change it is I change this value as soon as I hit enter and it's going to update

04:40.580 --> 04:41.800
that value.

04:42.290 --> 04:42.950
So there we go.

04:42.950 --> 04:51.140
So we updated the H2 mail here and we've rewritten our own words into it.

04:51.140 --> 04:57.100
So the good thing about when you select it within a variable and this is the obviously the advantages

04:57.170 --> 05:03.240
of variables is that you can make updates to it as you need to.

05:03.250 --> 05:09.210
So this time what I want to do is I actually want to update the entire text of that element.

05:10.770 --> 05:19.230
To equal the title of the web page and remember from before this information is contained within the

05:19.230 --> 05:20.690
document object.

05:20.700 --> 05:24.010
So we have access to all of that information.

05:24.060 --> 05:27.860
So pause the video and try it for yourself.

05:27.990 --> 05:35.010
You can even there you can either put the value of the document title into a variable and then place

05:35.090 --> 05:42.240
within your inner tax or you could just do it with one big statement like this one over here or you

05:42.240 --> 05:49.900
could place that element within a variable and then attach that value as a number of ways to do this.

05:49.920 --> 05:57.630
And since I've already got the value of this particular element already within that object A I'm going

05:57.630 --> 06:03.370
to just simply update that enter text above syntax in order to grab the document.

06:03.390 --> 06:06.000
It was simply a document title.

06:06.000 --> 06:12.840
So now when I press Enter we see that we're updating this value with information contained within the

06:12.840 --> 06:14.040
document object.

06:14.850 --> 06:22.440
So this is important because we can see that we can connect information we can update information on

06:22.440 --> 06:23.290
her page.

06:23.610 --> 06:26.600
We can pull back information from the document object.

06:26.730 --> 06:29.100
So there is a lot you can do with it.

06:29.160 --> 06:34.880
And this really does open up the door to creating interactive and dynamic web page content.

06:34.920 --> 06:37.910
And this is what javascript is all about.

06:37.920 --> 06:45.110
So now we're able to actually update our content and pull back information about the web page.

06:45.130 --> 06:48.620
So there's one other part that I want to show you about the dawn.

06:48.760 --> 06:51.260
And that's how we can get four volumes.

06:51.280 --> 06:57.010
So this is going to be another important part of getting information from our Web page and creating

06:57.010 --> 07:00.010
that interaction from our Web users.

07:00.040 --> 07:02.100
So that's coming up in the next lesson.
