00:00.970 --> 00:06.610
Well come back in this lesson we're going to see what we can do what attributes we're going to manipulate

00:06.640 --> 00:10.300
attributes of an element using javascript.

00:10.300 --> 00:17.380
So earlier we saw how we can add styles we can toggle classes we can update the inner text.

00:17.380 --> 00:20.680
So it is a lot of options that are open to us and as well.

00:20.710 --> 00:23.650
Attributes are open to us as well.

00:23.710 --> 00:26.800
So let's create Let's grab that element.

00:26.890 --> 00:39.090
So we're just use again and this time to document a document and we'll get element by ID.

00:39.100 --> 00:45.520
Actually no we can't do element by ID or maybe we will get we'll change this one too id so get element

00:45.520 --> 00:48.330
by id and will grab a message.

00:48.330 --> 00:52.150
So just to keep things simple or use get element by ID.

00:52.150 --> 00:55.840
So let's go back out to the page and to refresh the page.

00:56.080 --> 01:02.740
So we know with elements we've got a lot of information that we can contain we can add attributes we

01:02.740 --> 01:05.620
can set various attributes and so on.

01:05.620 --> 01:08.930
So let's first of all let's set an attribute.

01:09.160 --> 01:13.120
And we know with him out elements the idea is an attribute.

01:13.270 --> 01:19.270
We can also add additional attributes if we need to we can add custom attributes as well.

01:20.540 --> 01:29.150
So if for instance we want to apply multiple styles we saw earlier that if we grab the element and if

01:29.180 --> 01:39.110
we do style and we add in color and then we could set the color to be red that when we go into the element

01:39.110 --> 01:44.660
itself and we do go over to the inspector that we've added this style color red.

01:44.870 --> 01:50.870
So what actually happens if I want to add in more than one style to it.

01:51.080 --> 01:55.140
So this is where I can use set attribute instead.

01:55.160 --> 02:01.590
So we know that we've set this attribute and we've by default at odds and the style attribute.

02:01.700 --> 02:07.870
So we can also use E-L and we can use the method and it's called Set attribute

02:10.990 --> 02:13.260
and then within set attribute.

02:13.360 --> 02:20.170
Basically what it's going to do is it allows us to first specify the attribute that we want to set.

02:20.170 --> 02:26.980
So I want a set style and I want to set the value of style so I can do things like I can have in that

02:26.980 --> 02:32.310
color red and we can have multiple properties so I can do padding.

02:32.470 --> 02:38.650
And this is just typical Just as we would when we were tight typing it is an inline attribute so we

02:38.650 --> 02:39.990
can add some padding.

02:40.000 --> 02:50.010
I can also do border and one pick solid block so we can add any number of values within here.

02:50.170 --> 02:56.310
And then when I execute this we go back to the element and we see that we've added in the style attribute.

02:56.500 --> 03:02.690
So we've updated and we've added in the style attribute dynamically via javascript.

03:02.860 --> 03:06.610
So another thing that we can do is we can remove attributes.

03:06.700 --> 03:14.570
So now we can go back here and we can do elements and instead of setting attribute let's remove an attribute.

03:14.800 --> 03:17.600
So this method is called remove attribute.

03:17.740 --> 03:22.000
And then within here we need to specify what we want to remove.

03:22.030 --> 03:26.080
So if we want to remove our style we could do it this way.

03:27.730 --> 03:33.760
And we see that what happens now is we removed that entire style attribute so it didn't matter that

03:33.760 --> 03:37.360
we added in all of these values into the style attribute.

03:37.480 --> 03:41.410
We can simply remove it back by just doing the remove attribute.

03:41.410 --> 03:42.920
So there's a lot of power in this.

03:42.970 --> 03:46.950
And you can also save yourself quite a bit of time as well.

03:47.850 --> 03:53.400
So in this exercise what I want to do is I want to build a table from an array.

03:53.550 --> 03:55.510
So we're going to use a list of names.

03:55.530 --> 03:58.580
So this is that same list of names that we used earlier.

03:58.740 --> 04:01.350
And of course you can use your own list of names.

04:01.350 --> 04:05.120
So basically we've got the eight names here or nine names.

04:05.160 --> 04:07.190
And I want to build out an array.

04:07.290 --> 04:13.770
So basically I want to have a table and have all of the names here on the left hand side and then we

04:13.770 --> 04:16.560
want to apply some attributes to those as well.

04:16.560 --> 04:21.900
So to those elements and then we want to make those clickable and find the information that's contained

04:21.990 --> 04:23.720
within that cell.

04:23.730 --> 04:32.750
So this challenge is to build out a table from the information contained within this array and make

04:32.750 --> 04:38.870
it a three column table and it will have the nine rows each row containing a different name and then

04:38.870 --> 04:44.450
having the two columns and just leave those columns blank for now and do all of this via javascript

04:44.780 --> 04:52.010
and you can add in a brand new element here so we can call it div and ID and output so you can just

04:52.010 --> 04:55.610
deposit that table within the output element.

04:55.850 --> 04:56.500
So go ahead.

04:56.510 --> 05:03.770
Open up your editor paused the video and build out a table using the information contained within the

05:03.770 --> 05:07.180
array and do this all via javascript.

05:07.690 --> 05:09.860
And I'll show you how to do that coming up.

05:10.280 --> 05:16.990
So the challenge was to build a table so I can use the window on load.

05:17.050 --> 05:21.820
So to have a little bit of variety because we were doing that for the other one within the body.

05:21.860 --> 05:28.970
So this time let's do a window on load and whenever the window loads then we want to fire off a function

05:29.030 --> 05:32.300
that's going to be held in build.

05:32.300 --> 05:37.910
So remember again not the rounded brackets because otherwise that will fire off the function and we

05:37.910 --> 05:41.300
just want to fire off once the onload is complete.

05:41.300 --> 05:46.050
So this is the same thing as doing an anonymous function and having the content within here.

05:46.310 --> 05:53.210
So next we've got to add in our function that gets fired off whenever the window object loads.

05:53.240 --> 05:55.150
So we need to build out a table.

05:55.160 --> 06:02.280
So let's start with the variable h t M-L and we're going to start with a heading there.

06:02.330 --> 06:12.590
So H-1 my friends table so this will have all of these friends that are going to be contained within

06:12.590 --> 06:17.720
the table and we're going to open up the table element.

06:17.900 --> 06:19.540
So that's all we need to do there.

06:19.580 --> 06:24.940
And then next we know we need to loop through the length of the array.

06:25.010 --> 06:32.510
So this one is what we've done multiple times before where we set the value and we loop through while

06:32.540 --> 06:36.510
X is less than the length of my array.

06:36.860 --> 06:44.600
So that in 2 there and increment X so that we can complete our loop and the next thing that we want

06:44.600 --> 06:47.450
to do is we want to actually build out the table.

06:47.450 --> 06:52.710
So let's update each to MLS update and concatenate each two together.

06:52.880 --> 07:00.200
And this will allow us to build our table so we know that tables start with a table roll and then each

07:00.200 --> 07:04.670
row as a table cell there and then contained within.

07:04.670 --> 07:13.450
Here is where I actually want to output the value of my array.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.720
X so that will be that person's name.

07:18.380 --> 07:24.200
And then we can close that sell off and then we also want to add a few additional cells.

07:24.200 --> 07:29.140
So for now we can keep them blank and just close those off.

07:29.960 --> 07:37.490
And again do another one and close that one off and then once we're completed we can close off the road

07:37.550 --> 07:39.800
as well.

07:39.800 --> 07:41.780
So basically that's her HMO.

07:41.830 --> 07:48.410
And it will loop through the length there and once we've completed it then we can actually output it

07:48.500 --> 07:53.010
to our document to document get element by ID.

07:53.240 --> 07:56.820
And we're going to just put it into output and that's the inner.

07:56.900 --> 08:00.750
And make sure you use age to e-mail because this is h t m l.

08:00.770 --> 08:02.650
So let's see how this looks.

08:02.660 --> 08:08.450
And there's one actually one of the thing that I need to add in here is I need it to close off the table

08:09.170 --> 08:15.800
so I can add in another value here so maybe this looks a little bit neater where I just simply and the

08:15.800 --> 08:20.880
table and so that way my aged him is complete.

08:20.880 --> 08:22.690
So let's go back and refresh it.

08:22.720 --> 08:24.030
And there we go.

08:24.220 --> 08:25.510
So what a thing.

08:25.540 --> 08:30.840
I do want to add in is into the styling because I like to be able to see my table rows.

08:31.300 --> 08:34.090
So let's add some styling and

08:36.790 --> 08:38.670
we're just going to do it here with him.

08:38.760 --> 08:45.280
SS So do border one pick solid and what do its lighter color.

08:45.280 --> 08:47.470
Kind of an off off color there.

08:47.470 --> 08:49.290
So it's very light border.

08:49.450 --> 08:53.830
And also let's add in some padding because usually it's always good to have a little bit of padding

08:53.830 --> 08:54.940
around the soles.

08:54.940 --> 08:56.000
Let's try that out.

08:56.050 --> 08:56.690
So there we go.

08:56.700 --> 08:58.190
So now we've got our table.

08:58.210 --> 09:03.860
We've got the three columns all built dynamically via javascript.

09:03.900 --> 09:10.560
So the next thing that I want to do is I want to add a clickable cell within here so I can add in the

09:10.560 --> 09:16.070
class here and I'm going to just say that I'm going to call it a box.

09:16.350 --> 09:21.990
And then within here the value that I want to contain is I want the value of x.

09:22.080 --> 09:28.020
So let's concatenate the value of x in here so that we've got some type of value that's contained within

09:28.020 --> 09:29.340
here.

09:29.610 --> 09:34.800
So let's save that gwo and refresh the page.

09:34.800 --> 09:40.290
So now we've got our list the numbers and I'm actually going to add one to those so that we're not starting

09:40.290 --> 09:42.160
out with the value of zero.

09:42.300 --> 09:47.130
So usually that just doesn't look good because a lot of people that aren't working with arrays don't

09:47.130 --> 09:49.290
really see that why they should start with zero.

09:49.380 --> 09:50.910
So that's why we like to start it with one.

09:50.910 --> 09:53.370
So we've listed all nine people.

09:53.400 --> 09:57.390
So what I want you to do now is make these cells clickable.

09:57.410 --> 10:03.300
So these ones that have the class box and make them clickable and I'll give you a hint as well.

10:03.330 --> 10:10.910
So make sure that we're applying this after we've actually built code that I would put and we've set

10:10.920 --> 10:18.750
the enraged him out of output and then we can loop through output and grab the appropriate classes using

10:18.750 --> 10:25.320
Querrey selector all and then we can add that on click event for those events and what we're going to

10:25.320 --> 10:30.350
do is we're going to add some attributes and we're going to pass some attributes into them.

10:32.830 --> 10:38.550
So go ahead and add those as clickable elements and I'll show you how to do that.

10:38.680 --> 10:44.790
So we know that we've set this up and now we've got we've built out our table.

10:44.860 --> 10:48.860
So let's make those clickable and we're going to do this all via javascript.

10:49.060 --> 10:51.380
So this is going to be well.

10:51.400 --> 10:54.190
So we're going to use E-L for this particular list.

10:54.220 --> 11:02.750
And so this is going to be the E-L box and we're make it a local variable within our function.

11:02.760 --> 11:08.430
So what I want to do is use document because now that we've got all of that content in the document

11:08.430 --> 11:13.630
object where you use Querrey selector and query select selector all.

11:13.650 --> 11:20.040
So you can grab all of those appropriate elements and let us use the hash.

11:20.040 --> 11:22.860
So this one is all sitting with an output.

11:22.860 --> 11:29.580
So just in case by chance if we're selecting elements that are outside of output we don't want to select

11:29.580 --> 11:30.220
any of those.

11:30.240 --> 11:37.650
So let's add an output and then we want it followed by any ones that have the class box.

11:37.680 --> 11:40.080
So basically that builds our list.

11:40.260 --> 11:46.980
And now we can loop through there and we can add an event listener.

11:47.130 --> 11:49.210
So let's add the on click here.

11:49.230 --> 11:51.180
So we'll just do our loop.

11:51.270 --> 11:58.200
So we need to once again loop through all of the values contained within that array and we're going

11:58.200 --> 12:04.920
to loop through it while x is less than the length of L box

12:08.350 --> 12:15.460
x Well X is less than the length of L box and then we're going to increment X by 1 and then now let's

12:15.550 --> 12:18.520
add our event listeners.

12:18.520 --> 12:24.040
And the reason that we're doing it within this order is that we need to build out our table first and

12:24.040 --> 12:27.070
then we have access to that table content.

12:27.070 --> 12:31.830
So let's create those event listeners.

12:32.240 --> 12:38.970
So as we loop through L box we're going to add the on click event.

12:39.740 --> 12:40.750
So it's on click

12:44.490 --> 12:50.640
and when it gets clicked then what we want to do is we want to run and function.

12:50.640 --> 12:53.080
So this is anonymous function as well.

12:54.780 --> 12:56.800
And we want something to happen.

12:56.820 --> 13:02.620
So what we want to do is we want to get its attribute value.

13:02.670 --> 13:04.030
So let's update that.

13:04.050 --> 13:12.540
And so we'll pick out the current element that was clicked and in order to get the attribute value I

13:12.540 --> 13:14.960
want to add in an attribute value here.

13:15.000 --> 13:19.250
So I'm going to call it data roll.

13:19.270 --> 13:25.180
So basically this is what what's going to be contained within here is this is going to be the value

13:25.270 --> 13:29.830
of the roll that just got clicked.

13:29.880 --> 13:34.440
So it's going to be just a value of x so we don't have to do plus one.

13:34.560 --> 13:38.150
So that we know what the index value is from the array.

13:38.310 --> 13:44.070
And basically then we can pull back the value that's associated with it using their revalue.

13:44.070 --> 13:53.580
So let's use this and we're going to use the method get attribute and the attribute that we're picking

13:53.580 --> 14:00.370
up is called data roll.

14:00.640 --> 14:05.470
And what we're going to do for now is we're going to output this in the console.

14:05.470 --> 14:10.570
So basically and so that would give us the ability to work with it later on.

14:10.570 --> 14:15.430
So let's go back out and make sure that everything is working properly.

14:15.670 --> 14:23.140
So now when we click on them we actually get the index value of that item and we can actually take this

14:23.140 --> 14:24.880
one step further.

14:24.880 --> 14:32.290
So typically what I want to do is I don't like adding in these data attributes to the particular to

14:32.290 --> 14:34.390
these table cells.

14:34.390 --> 14:39.840
I usually like to add it into the role because all of this information is pertaining to the role.

14:39.970 --> 14:42.490
And at some point we might need to access it.

14:42.490 --> 14:47.860
So what I want you to do now is to determine what the data role.

14:47.880 --> 14:52.880
So what the attribute is of the table role.

14:52.950 --> 14:59.580
So traverse to it starting out at this you know that you're starting out at the element that got clicked

14:59.850 --> 15:03.850
and navigate and get the value of data roll.

15:03.950 --> 15:06.580
So try it out and I'll show you the solution coming up.

15:08.510 --> 15:10.550
So you can use this.

15:10.550 --> 15:16.220
And we saw earlier that we've got parent element so we can get the attribute of the parent element so

15:16.220 --> 15:21.080
go back and refresh it and now even though that attributes is sitting in the parent.

15:21.080 --> 15:26.630
So if we go to inspect it you can see that that attribute is not sitting in the role it's sitting in

15:26.630 --> 15:28.570
the table cell it's sitting in the role.

15:28.640 --> 15:34.520
So we're able to actually access the content of the parent and that's the best place for it to be because

15:34.520 --> 15:41.480
this actually gives us the ability to pull it out on any one of these table these tea table cells and

15:41.480 --> 15:45.880
pull out that information and get that index value and then we can make use of that.

15:46.070 --> 15:52.520
So let's do one more thing here where we're going to set a variable so we're just going to set a basic

15:52.580 --> 15:59.120
MT variable and then I get to use that over here and I'm going to equal it to whatever the value of

15:59.120 --> 16:00.560
this is.

16:01.430 --> 16:09.270
And then next what I want to do is output the corresponding my array item that's going to score spawn

16:09.280 --> 16:09.860
to it.

16:10.040 --> 16:15.320
And now that we've got a table roll we can actually pull back information that's contained from the

16:15.320 --> 16:15.900
array.

16:15.980 --> 16:19.620
So we know which association it is and where it's associated.

16:19.880 --> 16:25.160
So there's actually something else that I want to show you before we close off this lesson and let's

16:25.160 --> 16:28.790
say for instance you don't actually know the parent element.

16:29.060 --> 16:33.560
So I got a copy of it and you don't really know exactly where data row is.

16:33.560 --> 16:37.250
You might have a few elements it might be a few elements in deep.

16:37.250 --> 16:43.730
So you want to find actually the closest value of data to the current element.

16:43.730 --> 16:51.410
So we can do it within this type of format as well where we can do this and we can use the method called

16:51.410 --> 17:00.830
closest and what closest we'll do is it will actually find and return the correct value.

17:00.830 --> 17:08.060
So depending on what value we're looking for we can take a look and we can see where data row is actually

17:08.060 --> 17:09.560
located.

17:09.710 --> 17:17.800
And with this we're looking for actually an object here so we need to square bracket it.

17:17.800 --> 17:23.240
So because we might have more than one data row so we want to make sure that we're isolating out just

17:23.240 --> 17:28.690
that value that attribute that we're looking at and whatever attribute is being held as data roll.

17:28.760 --> 17:35.900
So now we see that it's still functioning its function the same way we're using the closest method.

17:35.910 --> 17:42.690
So what I want you to do now to finish off this lesson is once we've made our selection update the message

17:42.690 --> 17:52.090
here to reflect which one we've selected which row that we've selected and also the name coming from

17:52.090 --> 17:52.900
the array.

17:53.230 --> 17:57.790
John Roll a 3 Larry little roll for and so on.

17:57.790 --> 18:02.290
So go ahead and add that in and I'll show you the solution coming up as well.

18:02.320 --> 18:04.160
So a solution for this.

18:04.400 --> 18:05.230
All we need to do.

18:05.230 --> 18:10.240
We've already got all of that information that we're getting from the data row and we're passing it

18:10.300 --> 18:13.140
and we've got access to all of this information.

18:13.150 --> 18:20.660
So now it's as simple as outputting it with in the message area so we can do this in a number of ways.

18:20.680 --> 18:27.880
So typically what we do is we set up a message and we get to document get element by ID.

18:27.920 --> 18:31.940
So we've already set that up and we've got the message all ready to go.

18:34.490 --> 18:38.770
And I'm going to actually update this two message.

18:39.010 --> 18:45.850
So now within message instead of a console logging it out we're going to update our inner h t M-L and

18:45.880 --> 18:54.940
we're going to output those values there now so we know we can get that username and we can say is on

18:55.390 --> 18:57.670
roll number.

18:57.700 --> 19:06.160
And then here we can just simply get the value that we're returning back from our data attribute.

19:08.170 --> 19:09.610
So go ahead refreshed.

19:09.730 --> 19:13.430
And now when we click on it a message is just here upon the top.

19:13.510 --> 19:18.280
So as we click on it we see that jawin Larry is on row 3 and so on.

19:18.280 --> 19:20.320
So it is all updating properly.
