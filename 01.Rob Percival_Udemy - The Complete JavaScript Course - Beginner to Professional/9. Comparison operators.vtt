00:01.310 --> 00:05.840
Welcome back in this lesson we're going to be looking at comparison operators.

00:05.840 --> 00:12.680
So these are operators that are used within logical statements and they give us the ability to determine

00:13.040 --> 00:16.910
and compare the difference between two different values.

00:16.910 --> 00:21.860
So we're going to use the two variables that we set up in the previous lesson and we're going to do

00:21.950 --> 00:23.510
a comparison of those.

00:23.630 --> 00:28.430
So let's save that bring that in to our cons..

00:28.700 --> 00:34.350
And I've got a value of A which is five a value of B which is 4.

00:34.470 --> 00:39.980
And let's do a comparison operator so it's different than the assignment operator.

00:39.980 --> 00:41.530
We've got one equal sign.

00:41.720 --> 00:53.120
And what we're doing is we're looking at if A is equal to B and we get a boolean response which is false.

00:53.150 --> 01:06.170
So if we do A is equal to B but we do B as equal plus 2 B plus 1 we now we see that A is actually equal

01:06.170 --> 01:08.230
to B plus 1.

01:08.390 --> 01:09.470
So that's true.

01:09.470 --> 01:12.120
So because they're both equal to 5.

01:12.470 --> 01:19.070
So another really interesting one so I'm set up a variable and I have a set up of string this time and

01:19.070 --> 01:21.320
a string value of 5.

01:21.470 --> 01:29.540
So now we've got a value for c which is a string value of five value of AA which is about a numeric

01:29.540 --> 01:31.070
value of 5.

01:31.190 --> 01:35.070
And let's see if A is equal to see.

01:35.390 --> 01:45.110
And surprisingly we get back true because actual values contained within these variables is going to

01:45.110 --> 01:46.360
be true.

01:46.490 --> 01:48.960
But the only thing that's different is the type.

01:49.160 --> 01:52.870
And that's where we add in a third equal sign.

01:52.880 --> 02:01.610
So this gives us the absolute comparison of A and C comparing the type and if we do this one the three

02:01.610 --> 02:05.100
equal signs we get return back false.

02:05.150 --> 02:11.490
We can also do a comparison and check to see if he is not equal to B.

02:11.660 --> 02:16.870
So what do you think the result here is going to be is a not equal to B.

02:17.030 --> 02:24.310
And if your answer to that is true you're correct because A is not equal to B.

02:24.470 --> 02:30.190
We can also do an absolute not equal to as well.

02:30.350 --> 02:33.470
So if we had a value a.

02:33.830 --> 02:42.350
And we're comparing it to B and what's in that bracket because we know that B plus 1 making it 5 would

02:42.350 --> 02:44.670
be equal to A.

02:44.690 --> 02:46.430
So this is a numeric value.

02:46.580 --> 02:54.530
So we're checking to see if it's absolutely not equal to B.

02:55.220 --> 03:03.530
And we see that return back false because it isn't equal the type the type is the same but it's not

03:03.620 --> 03:16.340
equal to because they aren't equal if in comparison we do just be we get a value of true because we

03:16.340 --> 03:21.240
know that A is not equal to absolutely not equal to be.

03:21.260 --> 03:22.830
So in this case we're not.

03:22.850 --> 03:28.640
We've got the same type on both hands but we want to make sure that the type is equal that we do need

03:28.640 --> 03:29.800
to use that.

03:29.870 --> 03:33.110
There's a few other comparison operators.

03:33.260 --> 03:35.070
So there's the greater than sign.

03:35.180 --> 03:38.730
So he has a greater than B is equal to 5.

03:38.750 --> 03:40.260
B is equal to 4.

03:40.280 --> 03:43.690
So let's say true is a less than B.

03:43.790 --> 03:47.250
What do you think the value here is going to be the boolean return value.

03:47.270 --> 03:49.070
We see that that's false.

03:49.070 --> 03:53.790
We can also check to see if it's equal to or greater than.

03:53.900 --> 03:57.540
So let's increment B by 1.

03:57.620 --> 04:02.940
And so now we know that the value of b is fly of the value of A is 5.

04:03.050 --> 04:07.800
So let's check to see if A is greater than B and we get back false.

04:07.910 --> 04:13.730
And the reason that's false is because a actually isn't great and then B because they're equal and this

04:13.730 --> 04:21.620
is where we can do a comparison and we can check to see if A is greater than or equal to B and as well.

04:21.620 --> 04:29.510
We can also change this to less then and we can see that A is less than or equal to B and that comes

04:29.510 --> 04:32.470
back to.

04:32.510 --> 04:40.280
So now that we've seen the comparison operators in action we can also show you one other operator.

04:40.350 --> 04:45.890
And this is the only javascript operate that takes three different values that you can use it.

04:45.900 --> 04:50.940
And it's actually a short cut for the if statement which we are going to be looking at later on.

04:51.210 --> 04:57.200
So the ternary operator basically gives us the ability to compare our condition.

04:57.240 --> 04:59.090
So either true or false.

04:59.220 --> 05:05.550
And if we get back true then it's going to give us the first expression and if we get back false it's

05:05.550 --> 05:07.870
going to give us the second expression.

05:07.890 --> 05:09.260
So let's set this up.

05:09.270 --> 05:10.830
I'm going to call it by.

05:11.280 --> 05:14.390
So it's ternary.

05:14.480 --> 05:18.190
So that's actually within an Tharon ary operator.

05:18.200 --> 05:22.680
So I was going to call it my turn Airey and I'm going to equal to 2.

05:22.680 --> 05:25.070
So this is where I'm going to have a condition.

05:25.170 --> 05:31.890
So any number of these conditions that we looked at depending on what we are returning here if it's

05:31.890 --> 05:33.750
true or false and so on.

05:33.870 --> 05:41.050
I'm also going to add in that variable for see I had in that string value of 5.

05:42.630 --> 05:50.450
So let's say let's add something in here and we'll do a quick quick comparison operator in here.

05:50.550 --> 05:56.460
So a good bracket around those so that we can know that we can complete that condition.

05:56.730 --> 06:06.640
So let's do if A is equal to see then what we want to do.

06:06.670 --> 06:17.200
The output that we want to have is one of equal and if it's not equal then we're going to say not

06:19.960 --> 06:26.890
so basically let's go out and let's refresh the page and I know this looks a little bit complex right

06:26.890 --> 06:27.400
now.

06:27.640 --> 06:34.200
But we can output the value of my Teron Aerie and we can see that the value is actually equal.

06:34.450 --> 06:41.320
So we're doing a computation here using the Teron Airey we're using the conditional operators here and

06:41.410 --> 06:48.100
where outputting a result depending on what that condition is.

06:48.250 --> 06:56.260
And this is a great example of how boolean can be used within javascript to provide a powerful option

06:56.290 --> 07:03.460
for creating conditions where it can simply do a condition check there and return back either true or

07:03.460 --> 07:07.450
false and depending on what gets returned back.

07:07.570 --> 07:12.760
So we can also say that maybe this could be true and maybe this could be false.

07:13.060 --> 07:15.090
And these aren't hooly values.

07:15.130 --> 07:17.250
These are actually going to be the string values.

07:17.350 --> 07:25.030
So we can just as easily set up here and then we could go back and we can put that value and see that

07:25.030 --> 07:25.850
it's true.

07:27.950 --> 07:33.860
So this is the part where we're going to have another exercise and this exercise is going to involve

07:33.860 --> 07:35.160
the prompts again.

07:35.210 --> 07:42.680
But what I want you to do is to evaluate the two numbers that have been entered into the prompts and

07:42.680 --> 07:45.410
to see which one is bigger.

07:45.590 --> 07:53.060
So we can say that we're going to check to see if the first number A is going to be larger than the

07:53.060 --> 07:58.340
second number and if it is that we're going to come up with a customized message and we're going to

07:58.340 --> 08:00.340
output not one alert.

08:00.740 --> 08:04.280
So pause the video and try it for yourself.

08:04.280 --> 08:10.960
Open up your editor and create the two prompts asking for the two numbers numeric values.

08:11.120 --> 08:16.620
And remember again that the numbers coming in from the prompts are going to be string values.

08:16.760 --> 08:23.200
So if we're making any type of comparison here we should convert them into numbers.

08:23.270 --> 08:30.050
So the same thing that we did in the previous exercise and then do that Terry operator where we're evaluating

08:30.050 --> 08:37.010
that and depending on what it comes back or the True or false or in a customized string message and

08:37.010 --> 08:38.620
then have an alert.

08:38.660 --> 08:40.040
So pause the video.

08:40.070 --> 08:46.220
Go ahead try it out and I'm going to show you the solution coming up.

08:46.430 --> 08:53.840
So you had the opportunity to try this out for yourself because it is really important to give it a

08:53.840 --> 08:56.710
go and work with Javascript.

08:56.990 --> 09:02.620
So I'm going to call this one first and prompt next one prompt.

09:02.680 --> 09:10.950
So A and B and this one is going to be second you get rid of C because we don't need to use that.

09:10.980 --> 09:16.320
So he is going to have this one and maybe I'm going to call it message.

09:16.340 --> 09:24.350
So what we want to do is we want to compare the first value of A which is a to the second value which

09:24.350 --> 09:27.860
is B and we want to see which one is bigger.

09:28.040 --> 09:37.130
So we're going to check to see if A is bigger than B and if A is actually bigger than B then that means

09:37.130 --> 09:41.510
that this is true and he is Lerche

09:46.190 --> 09:54.370
and maybe we can also call out the value of a just to make it a little bit more interesting when we're

09:54.370 --> 09:58.390
concatenating those values there.

09:58.390 --> 10:02.400
Also remember that we do want to switch these two numbers.

10:02.530 --> 10:08.370
So can I create a fairly complex statement here.

10:08.710 --> 10:15.530
So it is going to have a lot of what we've learned in the previous lessons and next.

10:15.730 --> 10:20.370
Or maybe we can do first is larger versus larger.

10:20.440 --> 10:26.070
And then over here first is smaller

10:29.290 --> 10:35.060
than and this time let's concatenate be there.

10:35.180 --> 10:39.410
So it doesn't matter that they're not going to be numbers because we're out putting them on strings

10:39.470 --> 10:40.200
anyway.

10:40.370 --> 10:47.120
And then lastly let's add in our ever favorite altered message to the user.

10:47.360 --> 10:50.620
So let's go ahead and try this out in the browser.

10:50.810 --> 10:54.130
Don't forget to add that second bracket around there.

10:54.140 --> 10:58.850
So now let's go out to the browser I can minimize this as well.

10:58.910 --> 11:01.620
And we see when we refresh the page.

11:01.700 --> 11:03.730
So we're being asked for the first number.

11:03.800 --> 11:06.660
So this time let's center in a large number there.

11:06.680 --> 11:14.140
And the second number let's make this one smaller and we see that first is larger because it's a 10.

11:14.150 --> 11:19.910
And we know that's larger than the second number we can of course try this again and this time let's

11:19.910 --> 11:21.650
try a small number for first.

11:21.830 --> 11:27.680
And a really large number for a second and we see that the first is smaller than the second number which

11:27.680 --> 11:30.070
was the number that we entered.

11:30.080 --> 11:34.560
So you did have an opportunity 290 to try this out for yourself.

11:34.700 --> 11:38.860
And this is the beginnings of what Javascript can do.

11:38.870 --> 11:44.780
We see that we're creating those interactions where doing something with the inputs that the user input

11:44.780 --> 11:53.630
is good and we're returning back dynamically generated message back to the user depending on what they're

11:53.630 --> 11:54.310
inputting.

11:54.470 --> 12:00.650
So creating that complete interaction with the user that's coming in to interact with our web application.

12:02.340 --> 12:08.040
So the next lesson we're going to look at logical operators and I'm going to show you even more that

12:08.040 --> 12:10.100
you can do with your javascript code.

12:10.140 --> 12:11.380
So that's coming up.
