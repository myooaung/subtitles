00:01.470 --> 00:02.260
Welcome back.

00:02.290 --> 00:05.960
And in this lesson I can assure you even more that you can do with the dog.

00:06.070 --> 00:10.900
So previously we saw all of the wonderful information that's contained within the dome.

00:11.080 --> 00:15.210
We can also write to the document so we can do something like this.

00:15.370 --> 00:18.610
And this is one of the methods to build more than the dome.

00:18.670 --> 00:23.430
So we saw that when we put all of this information.

00:23.560 --> 00:24.790
Not all values.

00:24.790 --> 00:31.540
Some of them are actually more objects that are deeper objects and then we can traverse through them

00:31.540 --> 00:35.430
and get the values and then we also had some methods here.

00:35.440 --> 00:38.490
So these ones here are not exactly.

00:38.530 --> 00:43.060
You're not going to return back of value because these are look connected to methods.

00:43.090 --> 00:46.590
So we also have the ability to write to the document.

00:46.780 --> 00:53.980
And this is one of the ones that is available with the document object where we specified document right.

00:54.130 --> 01:00.410
And then within the parentheses we typo and whatever string value that we want to write it.

01:00.430 --> 01:07.960
So this way we can actually write into our H-2 page and we noticed that whenever I click over this particular

01:07.990 --> 01:12.130
element it's visible now with a source code of that element.

01:12.220 --> 01:17.030
But it's actually not directly built into our source code.

01:17.140 --> 01:24.790
So we see that once the browser renders the say that it reads the javascript and it adds this particular

01:24.790 --> 01:31.470
string value which is located just underneath the script tags because we're typing it within the script.

01:31.600 --> 01:38.410
So it just simply adds in the next available slot within within the web page.

01:38.520 --> 01:40.380
And that's just after the script times.

01:40.500 --> 01:45.180
So that's where the hello world is just falling there and it actually gets displayed to the user.

01:45.390 --> 01:53.550
So we are able to communicate to the user via the DOM and put content that's actually visible from our

01:53.550 --> 01:56.100
javascript to the web users

01:59.180 --> 02:02.890
and immediately there is a downside to the document.

02:02.900 --> 02:03.470
Right.

02:03.650 --> 02:10.190
And we notice that if for instance I wanted to type some content within this div I'd have to recreate

02:10.190 --> 02:14.730
the script tags and then I'd have to enter in the document right with him there.

02:14.870 --> 02:18.310
And really this isn't really an efficient way to do that.

02:18.560 --> 02:22.810
So it does actually work but it's not the best way to do that.

02:22.940 --> 02:29.960
So there is another solution and that's using some of the built methods that are already available preprogramed

02:30.170 --> 02:31.320
ready to go.

02:31.340 --> 02:39.560
Using the document object so we know that the document it builds so that all of the information that's

02:39.560 --> 02:41.660
contained within the web page.

02:41.750 --> 02:48.860
And we also know that all of this information is then stored and it's accessible via our Javascript.

02:48.860 --> 02:56.210
So if for instance we want to output Hello world between these dids we also do want to keep our script

02:56.450 --> 02:58.330
separated from each TNL.

02:58.370 --> 02:59.900
So that's bad practice.

02:59.900 --> 03:07.290
So we need a way to identify the element where we want to input where we want to put that content into.

03:07.510 --> 03:15.260
So let's create an element we'll give it an ID and using the IDS is one of the most basic ways of selecting

03:15.320 --> 03:16.220
elements.

03:16.340 --> 03:19.840
And this is the next step where we need to select the element.

03:19.960 --> 03:26.480
So we need to be able to identify the intimates re-added in the ID so we know that if we had a whole

03:26.480 --> 03:31.730
bunch of elements here that we can pick this one up and this is the one that we want to place and make

03:31.730 --> 03:34.240
use of within our Javascript.

03:34.580 --> 03:42.940
So let's make that connection and instead of a document right I'm going to say I should probably need

03:42.940 --> 03:44.840
to change quite a bit of this.

03:44.900 --> 03:51.570
So we're want to document and the method is going to be get element by ID.

03:51.590 --> 04:00.560
So it's get caught up capital element by id and then within a string ID we need to we need to indicate

04:00.830 --> 04:03.500
what the ID is that we're grabbing.

04:03.590 --> 04:08.000
We don't need to create a hash here because this is already an ID.

04:08.090 --> 04:14.780
So the javascript method is already expecting that ID so it knows to look for within your H-2 melt code.

04:15.080 --> 04:19.610
The element that has the ID of output.

04:19.910 --> 04:27.260
And if you try to specify one that's not not within each two elements it's going to throw an error because

04:27.260 --> 04:28.580
it's not going to be able to find it.

04:28.700 --> 04:36.230
So it knows within the syntax that it has to go and look for this particular input and then we know

04:36.230 --> 04:40.450
that we're actually placing this within our javascript and connecting it.

04:40.820 --> 04:48.350
So how to see what sort of next step how do we we saw earlier that we can set up a variable and that

04:48.350 --> 04:53.960
variable can contain information and it can also contain the object information.

04:54.170 --> 04:58.820
So we know that this element is going to have a whole bunch of information attached to it.

04:58.820 --> 05:02.290
So it's not just that we've got that one element.

05:02.360 --> 05:07.410
So let me refresh the page and let's take a closer look at.

05:07.700 --> 05:09.930
We can go down and dig down deep.

05:09.950 --> 05:18.890
We know that this div has a whole bunch of information and it also has it's got a lot of separate smaller

05:18.930 --> 05:20.840
notes that are also attached to it.

05:20.900 --> 05:25.380
So everything within the dorm is considered a node.

05:25.550 --> 05:29.360
But we also have new ones that are in other nodes and so on.

05:29.510 --> 05:37.590
So we need to really be able to pull back and when we're specifying ID we're grabbing this entire object.

05:37.820 --> 05:41.230
So let's place this with an object value.

05:41.390 --> 05:50.210
So we just call this we'll call it output so that when we know that output the output object is tied

05:50.210 --> 05:54.860
to that output ID you don't have to call it the same it can be called differently.

05:55.130 --> 05:59.600
So this is just proven instances of this demonstration.

05:59.600 --> 06:04.310
We're calling it output because we've got a variable name output and an ID need output.

06:04.550 --> 06:08.180
So let's go back and let's refresh the page.

06:08.180 --> 06:11.940
And now let's see what value is contained with that output.

06:12.140 --> 06:18.110
So we see when we select it we get that instrumental element being returned back.

06:18.110 --> 06:21.420
So let's try something different was to console log.

06:21.650 --> 06:30.050
And we saw that directory previously it would put our content our dorm information in a more about object

06:30.110 --> 06:32.310
structure format that's readable.

06:32.480 --> 06:37.850
And this is the same case where we've selected this output as an object.

06:37.910 --> 06:44.770
We've got all of the information that's contained within it and we see that now we can make use of it

06:44.780 --> 06:51.710
because now when prodded into our javascript code and we see that there's a lot of the same types of

06:51.710 --> 06:52.490
values.

06:52.640 --> 06:57.930
And the one that I want to look at in particular for this lesson is this one here the inner text or

06:57.970 --> 06:59.610
inner to go out.

06:59.660 --> 07:07.340
So now that we've selected it and we've put it put into an object we can make use of that object and

07:07.400 --> 07:13.280
we can specify just as we did with other objects where we specify a value.

07:13.280 --> 07:19.280
So if this one contained a value right off the bat it would be within that inner HVM L..

07:19.400 --> 07:23.180
So we saw with objects that we can actually overwrite the value.

07:23.270 --> 07:24.400
So let's overwrite.

07:24.410 --> 07:26.160
Hello world.

07:26.270 --> 07:27.920
And we'll see what happens.

07:27.920 --> 07:34.670
So I go back and refresh the page and we see that initially within our source code output has a value

07:34.670 --> 07:42.480
of Hello within it but we've actually grabbed that element and we've updated the value of inner h to

07:42.480 --> 07:45.010
melt and we've set it up as world.

07:45.350 --> 07:47.550
And with each team.

07:47.780 --> 07:51.820
That basically means that it actually accepts each team.

07:51.920 --> 07:58.570
So let's refresh that again and we can write each DML content within our elements.

07:59.090 --> 08:02.750
And there was another one as well that was called in or text.

08:02.900 --> 08:08.990
So we show you what the difference is and if we try to write this now as you are taxed you can see that

08:08.990 --> 08:12.970
when you refresh it it's actually going to take those each to mail tags.

08:13.080 --> 08:16.000
It's going to simply output it as text.

08:16.430 --> 08:21.190
So what I want you to do now is pause the video and this is where the challenge comes in.

08:21.320 --> 08:29.770
Open up your editor and create a simple div give it an ID for instance output and then update the content.

08:29.770 --> 08:36.340
So start out with some plain content here and say within your javascript.

08:36.440 --> 08:43.150
So all you're going to have is a simple blank each time element using javascript.

08:43.190 --> 08:48.920
Grab that element and add within that element.

08:48.930 --> 08:55.020
Welcome to my page using javascript so we use javascript to accomplish this.

08:56.060 --> 09:00.400
And I hope you get an opportunity to give it a go try it for yourself.

09:00.470 --> 09:02.660
And now let me show you the solution is.

09:02.830 --> 09:10.490
So I already had that output document element by ID but I can actually shorten this because I don't

09:10.490 --> 09:17.750
want to put it in a variable and I can't simply do it by document element by id and then I can specify

09:17.750 --> 09:19.220
the interface to Mel.

09:19.280 --> 09:22.630
It can be inner text as well so both of them would be correct.

09:22.700 --> 09:24.990
And we want to write out a message.

09:25.010 --> 09:29.940
So welcome to my page and close off that statement.

09:30.050 --> 09:34.340
And then the rest of this will just simply remove it go back.

09:34.400 --> 09:36.990
Refresh your browser and there you go.

09:37.270 --> 09:44.290
So it's as easy as that to create those interactions within the content of your age Tim Page and the

09:44.300 --> 09:45.310
next lesson.

09:45.410 --> 09:48.290
I can assure you even more that you can do using that on.
