Congratulations on making it to the end of this section this lesson is going to be all about applying

00:07.250 --> 00:14.460
what we've learned in the previous lessons and taking some action and making things happen using javascript.

00:14.510 --> 00:20.840
So we're going to be creating an h him l file as well as Janus file or javascript file.

00:20.960 --> 00:26.090
So that's going to be the first action that I want you to take it with in this exercise.

00:26.210 --> 00:27.930
So create both of these files.

00:28.100 --> 00:32.310
And of course that each team will file it doesn't have to be very elaborate.

00:32.330 --> 00:35.180
It can be a very simple simple template.

00:35.300 --> 00:40.890
And then the javascript file always remember that you just need to call it Dot G.

00:40.930 --> 00:47.210
So the h t m l as they passed him L is h t m l the javascript is dot g as.

00:47.240 --> 00:54.560
So the next thing is I want you to apply some javascript into that aged him L and I want you to set

00:54.560 --> 00:58.380
up an output a welcome message to the page.

00:58.460 --> 01:01.000
So something that says Welcome to the page.

01:01.140 --> 01:04.730
Next have a pop up that says hello.

01:04.880 --> 01:14.380
And then lastly I put information into the console that the code actually worked and ran.

01:14.440 --> 01:20.560
And if you want to get really creative make sure you add in some comments along the way on your thoughts

01:20.650 --> 01:24.680
and notes as the script is being executed.

01:24.730 --> 01:26.280
So go ahead.

01:26.320 --> 01:30.270
Pause the video and I'm going to show you the solution.

01:31.410 --> 01:32.520
Starting Up next

01:36.740 --> 01:42.470
so I hope you had an opportunity to try out this exercise because it is really important when you're

01:42.470 --> 01:48.590
learning javascript to try it for yourself and get familiar with the syntax that we're using in order

01:48.590 --> 01:49.870
to write code.

01:50.090 --> 01:52.720
So now I'm going to show you the solution.

01:52.760 --> 01:58.610
So the first thing was to create an H Tim L and a javascript file and actually am cheating a little

01:58.610 --> 02:03.770
bit because I already have an age to mail and a javascript file but you can go ahead and make sure you

02:03.770 --> 02:06.970
do create these on your own system.

02:07.280 --> 02:13.050
So next step was to add a welcome message that prints to each time a file.

02:13.310 --> 02:20.030
So what we need to do is we need to link our javascript file to our HVM L and the way that we're going

02:20.030 --> 02:23.710
to do that is using the script tag.

02:24.170 --> 02:26.660
And we need to specify the source.

02:26.660 --> 02:32.170
So wherever your file is located then make sure that you're linking to that file.

02:32.180 --> 02:34.620
Next we want to specify the type.

02:34.850 --> 02:42.230
And as mentioned earlier this is something that you don't necessarily need to do but you can include

02:42.710 --> 02:52.140
Furthermore for the older browsers so that they can to also render this javascript but as we know modern

02:52.140 --> 02:54.630
browsers it's not necessary.

02:54.840 --> 02:57.620
So now save that index each each team out.

02:57.720 --> 03:00.840
And now you can go over to your javascript file.

03:00.930 --> 03:07.370
So open that up and the first order of business was to write a welcome message that prints out in each

03:07.400 --> 03:08.070
to mail.

03:08.220 --> 03:12.540
And we saw that we can do that using a document right now.

03:12.570 --> 03:17.850
And although as you progress this course I can assure you a much better way to do this.

03:18.000 --> 03:28.200
But for now let's do something like welcome to my site and close that off with a semi-colon and the

03:28.200 --> 03:37.270
next thing that we want to do is we want to maybe add in some comments pop up message.

03:37.960 --> 03:45.610
And next we want to do over here we want to add in console message.

03:45.610 --> 03:48.690
So those are the two actions that we still need to undertake.

03:48.850 --> 03:56.570
So now let's go into the pop up message and the way that we did that was with the alert function.

03:56.770 --> 04:00.640
So we wanted to just have an alert that said Hello.

04:01.090 --> 04:03.460
So we can go ahead and type that in there.

04:03.550 --> 04:10.300
And then lastly let's actually refresh the page and see how far we've got with all of the action items

04:10.540 --> 04:14.870
we see we've got the halo message we've got we've got Welcome to my site.

04:15.100 --> 04:20.830
So not lastly we want to be able to take a look within the console and we want to have another message

04:20.880 --> 04:23.800
out there that it actually worked and it ran.

04:24.010 --> 04:26.830
So basically we didn't run into any errors.

04:26.890 --> 04:28.740
Everything went smoothly.

04:28.900 --> 04:39.130
So I'm going to type out it worked and then we'll go back and refresh the browser and open up that console

04:39.160 --> 04:46.100
and we see that we've got the last auction item it worked being displayed within our console log

04:49.960 --> 04:51.760
so do try it for yourself.

04:51.790 --> 04:57.930
Experiment a little bit try out different syntax and different ways of bringing that code into your

04:57.940 --> 04:59.010
Each team.

04:59.410 --> 05:00.440
Try it all.

05:00.550 --> 05:05.890
What you've learned in the previous lessons and the coming section is going to get a whole lot more

05:05.920 --> 05:09.650
interesting because I'm going to show you the real power of Javascript.

05:09.730 --> 05:11.740
So that's coming up in the next section.
