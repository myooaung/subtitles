WEBVTT

00:00.700 --> 00:05.520
We'll come back and this is going to be a really super exciting lesson because we're going to create

00:05.520 --> 00:08.160
some interaction with javascript.

00:08.160 --> 00:11.690
I've got my browser open here too.

00:11.700 --> 00:13.290
Indexed on h t m-L.

00:13.350 --> 00:15.760
So I've got that one open here on the right hand side.

00:15.780 --> 00:20.200
And I've got brackets my script editor here on the left hand side.

00:20.220 --> 00:24.920
So what I want it to do is create interaction using javascript.

00:24.930 --> 00:32.040
So first of all let's start by creating a variable and this is also going to illustrate how useful variables

00:32.040 --> 00:34.830
can be containing information.

00:34.860 --> 00:37.110
So we're going to say what is your name.

00:37.110 --> 00:42.170
So basically we want to ask a question that we want to get a response for.

00:42.330 --> 00:44.850
So this is just a basic question.

00:44.850 --> 00:49.110
It can be any string value that you want and notice that it's contained within a string.

00:49.260 --> 00:51.660
And we're just asking that string value.

00:51.660 --> 00:53.220
So the quotes around it.

00:53.220 --> 01:00.270
And now if I go out to my console and I'm going to actually open up my console and I'm going to open

01:00.270 --> 01:05.000
it up at the bottom because I want to keep it all within that same page for now.

01:05.310 --> 01:08.970
So let's refresh this page.

01:08.970 --> 01:14.790
And now when I type question I can see that I've got access to the information contained within the

01:14.790 --> 01:15.540
variable.

01:15.750 --> 01:20.920
So the next thing that I want to do is actually want to ask for a prompt.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.340
So let's show you what prompt does.

01:23.340 --> 01:28.230
So this is similar to what I said what those other methods did.

01:28.260 --> 01:34.200
When we looked at alert and of there's another builtin method that's ready to go and then javascript

01:34.530 --> 01:40.110
and it's got a set of code that's going to execute behind the scenes so it knows what to do when you

01:40.110 --> 01:46.690
type in prompt and I'm using the variable question and I'm dropping it in to prompt.

01:46.770 --> 01:48.290
So see what happens.

01:48.300 --> 01:56.850
So when I press prompt we get a pop up type window here plopping up but we've also got that question

01:56.850 --> 02:00.330
there so this is actually the value that's coming from.

02:00.330 --> 02:05.460
The question variable that I ventured into prompt and this is the format of prompt.

02:05.460 --> 02:10.290
When you add in a string value over here it places it here at the top.

02:10.410 --> 02:17.220
And then we've got an input field here where we can input some information so I can type in and we see

02:17.220 --> 02:19.240
that we get a return value.

02:19.650 --> 02:23.530
So much like what we saw earlier where we're looking at the data types.

02:23.640 --> 02:29.390
When we were typing in different string values we get those return values we saw.

02:29.460 --> 02:36.740
We can also add in something like my name and we can assign a string value to it.

02:37.050 --> 02:38.480
So we could do it like this.

02:38.610 --> 02:42.790
And now when we typed in my name we get that return value.

02:43.140 --> 02:51.030
So this we can take one step further because we see what prompt is actually returning back is the result

02:51.030 --> 02:54.790
here of that prompt pop up box.

02:54.930 --> 03:01.260
So it's returning back into the value just like what we saw over here where we call back to my name

03:01.260 --> 03:02.730
we get the value back.

03:02.730 --> 03:08.840
We get the same thing here with question so we can use that within a variable and we can store this

03:08.850 --> 03:14.840
information essentially capturing that information capturing that user's response.

03:14.970 --> 03:17.440
So let's try that within our editor.

03:17.460 --> 03:20.400
We're going to do my name and we're going to equal it.

03:20.430 --> 03:22.090
So that's not going to be of value.

03:22.090 --> 03:26.550
So this is going to be a dynamic value that we're going to be picking up and we're going to use the

03:26.550 --> 03:27.600
prompt method.

03:27.810 --> 03:36.060
So basically this displays that pop up message box and we could just as easily take our string value

03:36.060 --> 03:42.100
here and we could enter it in prompt but that would make it don't that wouldn't make it dynamic.

03:42.120 --> 03:48.390
And the objective of javascript is that we want to write nice clean code that's easy to read and we

03:48.390 --> 03:53.850
try to separate out all as much as possible when we write code.

03:53.850 --> 04:00.840
So over here we have a distinct function here or distinct value here that we're setting a question and

04:00.840 --> 04:07.060
then the next one we're using prompt and we're utilizing that question from that first variable.

04:07.110 --> 04:08.640
So let's save this.

04:08.640 --> 04:10.470
And let me show you how this works.

04:10.470 --> 04:15.450
So now when I get asked for my name I can type in my name.

04:15.640 --> 04:23.100
And now when I call back to him my name variable I've got a value that's being held in there and I can

04:23.160 --> 04:28.320
use this over and over and over again as many times as I want.

04:28.860 --> 04:37.200
So lastly let's actually do one more thing here that I didn't show you earlier but I also want to introduce

04:37.200 --> 04:43.290
in this lesson how you can concatenate together various string values.

04:43.290 --> 04:49.610
If we had a second part to that question and we had something like.

04:49.610 --> 04:55.860
Question ans let's just do question 1 and Question 2.

04:55.890 --> 05:03.120
So we want to keep the your name and so we're going to add in in the second part of the string.

05:03.180 --> 05:10.200
So we wanted to maybe have our string change and we want to make something different happen within the

05:10.200 --> 05:15.870
strings so in case we want to change it from your name to your age or something like that.

05:15.960 --> 05:19.350
We can just as easily change that over here.

05:19.350 --> 05:25.020
So this is the latter part of the question and we've got this question mark so we know that every question

05:25.020 --> 05:31.060
is going to have a question mark and maybe we can include your over here as well.

05:31.140 --> 05:34.040
And we're just keep the page down here at the bottom.

05:34.470 --> 05:37.730
So lastly how do you combine them together.

05:37.950 --> 05:46.430
And again we can turn to variables and variables are the answer to this as well where we can equal questions

05:46.610 --> 05:52.510
so just as we did with the prompt we can use the returned response.

05:52.530 --> 05:54.820
So we certainly got a return and response.

05:54.870 --> 05:59.360
So we've got a return response for question 1 return response for question 2.

05:59.430 --> 06:06.010
The first one is what is your what the space at the end and loss and the question 2 is age.

06:06.180 --> 06:09.040
So we can just as easily concatenate them together.

06:09.150 --> 06:16.190
So we use the plus side you're not adding to them together you're concatenating two string values together.

06:16.290 --> 06:23.940
And then lastly let's add in that question mark so I can create another string here at the end and when

06:23.940 --> 06:32.670
I go back and if I refresh it that we've got that full question there concatenated together and this

06:32.670 --> 06:43.650
is one of the ways we can begin to use different variable values and utilize them within our code by

06:43.650 --> 06:50.460
simply setting another variable using the initial variable values so that we know within our code we

06:50.460 --> 06:52.350
don't necessarily need to be.

06:52.380 --> 06:58.610
Maybe we only want to change this one value of question 2 and we can change it back to name or.

06:58.650 --> 07:02.450
What is your favorite color or something like that.

07:02.460 --> 07:08.790
We've got a lot of flexibility here in the second part of the question and if we had the ability to

07:08.790 --> 07:16.830
change it dynamically we could do even more where we could have something like one of the prompts

07:19.480 --> 07:20.140
would be

07:24.090 --> 07:32.400
and maybe you and here we're going to ask so Question So we're going to essentially have two prompts

07:32.580 --> 07:36.860
the first one is going to ask us what question we want to ask.

07:36.960 --> 07:44.930
What is your so either age or what age or name as an example.

07:44.970 --> 07:49.740
And then over here we're going to bring it all together and then we're going to ask another prompt with

07:49.740 --> 07:50.520
a question.

07:50.640 --> 07:56.830
And then lastly we're going to place we're going to place an alert here.

07:57.070 --> 07:59.690
So let's try this out first.

07:59.860 --> 08:01.140
So refresh it.

08:01.400 --> 08:08.590
So what type of extension do we want to add to this question so let's do age and we see that we can

08:08.590 --> 08:10.810
dynamically change that prompt.

08:10.810 --> 08:12.930
So we have got what is your age.

08:13.120 --> 08:21.610
So I'll just see an age in there and now we see that my name has the value of 40 and noticed that it's

08:21.610 --> 08:23.610
a string value as well.

08:23.650 --> 08:29.440
So I want you to try this out for yourself and combine what we learned earlier.

08:29.500 --> 08:40.170
And the challenge here is going to be to ask a question pick up their response for the question so ask

08:40.170 --> 08:47.310
a question ask the person's name coming to your Web site and then build a welcome message an alert welcome

08:47.310 --> 08:55.240
message responding back to the user as they enter in their name coming into your web page.

08:55.270 --> 08:56.650
So Plus the video.

08:56.880 --> 09:03.180
And on another site I'm going to show you what the solution to that is and think back to the different

09:03.180 --> 09:10.920
methods that we've used within the earlier lessons where we used to alert and use that in combination

09:11.010 --> 09:14.080
with the variables and the prompt.

09:14.280 --> 09:19.860
And you should be able to come up with the solution in order to create that welcome message to users

09:20.040 --> 09:20.900
to your Web site

09:24.140 --> 09:27.870
so I hope you had the opportunity to try this for yourself.

09:28.040 --> 09:30.170
And now I'm going to show you the solution.

09:30.170 --> 09:35.750
So most of the work is already done here where we're trying out all the different variations of the

09:35.750 --> 09:37.480
question and so on.

09:37.670 --> 09:44.120
So basically what I wanted to do is just keep it as what is your name and I'm going to use comments

09:44.120 --> 09:48.740
here comment this out and I can change this one to a question.

09:48.920 --> 09:50.090
So what is your name.

09:50.110 --> 09:55.810
It's going to prompt a question and then lastly we need to add in that alert method.

09:56.240 --> 10:07.440
So let's put on alert and here we need to combine a string with the my name response.

10:07.480 --> 10:12.000
So welcome to my Web site.

10:12.280 --> 10:14.470
And then let's let's

10:18.040 --> 10:23.680
let's hide in the name there that we picked up from the response so basically let's do a quick run through

10:23.680 --> 10:24.260
here.

10:24.520 --> 10:28.150
So we are creating a string value that's asking for the name.

10:28.210 --> 10:35.050
We're utilizing that variable within the prompt where we're asking we're setting another variable with

10:35.050 --> 10:37.020
the response back from the prompt.

10:37.180 --> 10:44.590
And then lastly we're using alert we're concatenating one the string value here which is a message and

10:44.590 --> 10:49.920
then we're concatenating it to the response that we get back from the prompt.

10:49.920 --> 10:52.840
So let's try this out and see how this works.

10:52.840 --> 10:58.180
So what is your name and let's type in a name here and then we see it.

10:58.180 --> 11:00.360
Welcome to my Web site Lawrence.

11:00.700 --> 11:01.580
So there you go.

11:01.600 --> 11:05.220
So I hope that you got an opportunity to try that out.

11:05.440 --> 11:13.570
And I do encourage you to try out different different variations combining variables as well as the

11:13.570 --> 11:19.430
prompt and alert and see what types of different functionality you can create coming into your web site

11:19.630 --> 11:26.500
creating some interaction between your web user and your script.

11:26.500 --> 11:30.450
So coming up we're going to look at even more we can do with javascript.
