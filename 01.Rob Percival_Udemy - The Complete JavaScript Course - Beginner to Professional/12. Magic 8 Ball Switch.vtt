00:00.760 --> 00:01.600
Welcome back.

00:01.630 --> 00:08.160
And in this lecture size we're going to be using switch and we're going to create a really nice interesting

00:08.220 --> 00:09.650
magic 8 ball.

00:09.660 --> 00:15.480
So basically it will help us predict what our answer is going to be and what's going to happen in the

00:15.480 --> 00:16.000
future.

00:16.080 --> 00:16.430
OK.

00:16.470 --> 00:17.340
Not really.

00:17.340 --> 00:19.730
It's going to just be a random response.

00:19.740 --> 00:27.330
So what I want you to do is to create a prompt asking the user to ask their question and then create

00:27.420 --> 00:36.650
a random value where we can return back some kind of random statement to the user using switch take

00:36.650 --> 00:44.750
the value of that random number and generate my response back to the user and then output response by

00:45.110 --> 00:54.310
using the using the question as well as what was responded to so pause the video give it a try and I'm

00:54.310 --> 00:56.980
going to show you the solution coming up.

00:57.010 --> 01:03.130
So the first thing that we need to do is we need to ask a question and we saw this earlier that we can

01:03.130 --> 01:10.560
do this via the prompt as your or we just say Ask me anything.

01:12.140 --> 01:17.110
So basically this is a very open ended and we're just asking a user to ask.

01:17.130 --> 01:23.600
I asked a question and we to create some fun responses that we can send back to the user.

01:23.600 --> 01:29.390
So next we needed to create a random number so let's create a random

01:32.330 --> 01:33.710
and this number.

01:33.710 --> 01:40.670
So depending on how many responses we were expecting to do we could have various random numbers.

01:40.670 --> 01:45.380
So if you got really creative you probably have quite a few random numbers.

01:45.380 --> 01:51.650
So for this one it's always good to decide how many random numbers I'm doing.

01:51.650 --> 01:57.820
So let's do random numbers and let's do six different responses.

01:58.280 --> 02:00.070
So we're rounding it down.

02:00.140 --> 02:05.050
So I get I have values coming back anywhere from 0 to 5.

02:05.360 --> 02:11.090
So I know that I can apply this within my switch statement set up switch

02:14.650 --> 02:21.630
and we know that what the value that we want to pass is random number.

02:21.720 --> 02:23.770
So let's pass that value in.

02:23.860 --> 02:27.900
And now let's evaluate that and make something happen with it.

02:28.170 --> 02:31.480
And we saw earlier that we can set cases.

02:31.680 --> 02:38.400
So this one is going to be really straightforward because we're going to have Case case 0 2 5 and then

02:38.400 --> 02:40.560
we'll also have a default case.

02:40.650 --> 02:46.960
So also let's let's do an answer.

02:47.490 --> 02:53.730
And for the answer actually we could still make him Let's update that to answer.

02:53.730 --> 02:56.200
So you could just say something went wrong.

02:56.790 --> 03:02.400
And again hopefully we never see that that something went wrong but just in case we got that sitting

03:02.480 --> 03:03.330
in there.

03:03.330 --> 03:07.060
So that case number one let's update answer.

03:07.380 --> 03:10.130
So we'll set.

03:10.150 --> 03:17.200
So if if it's case number one then what we're going to do so this is the auction that we're going to

03:17.200 --> 03:25.750
do and we're going to take answer and we're going to equal answer to this is where you got to be something

03:25.750 --> 03:32.950
creative and it will work out.

03:33.120 --> 03:39.780
And that is generally in this eight ball should be very vague because we don't actually know what type

03:39.780 --> 03:42.340
of question the user is asking.

03:42.360 --> 03:51.120
So we just want to have some type of interesting generally funny maybe provocative response for the

03:51.120 --> 03:52.170
users.

03:52.170 --> 03:59.860
So next let's do another one where maybe and maybe not.

04:00.330 --> 04:01.960
So this is our response.

04:02.010 --> 04:07.560
And then again don't forget those breaks because those are those breaks are really important when you're

04:07.560 --> 04:13.020
building out these cases otherwise as we saw earlier it will just continue to run through.

04:13.260 --> 04:14.340
So next

04:17.090 --> 04:20.980
we'll say probably not.

04:21.200 --> 04:29.270
So just trying to think of just some very vague types of responses and maybe just do one more and then

04:29.270 --> 04:31.930
I'll just leave it up to the default.

04:32.360 --> 04:36.750
So I don't want to spend too much time on coming up with some creative answers here.

04:36.770 --> 04:38.840
So just so that you get the idea.

04:38.930 --> 04:42.710
So the likely

04:45.390 --> 04:47.580
and we'll break it again.

04:48.440 --> 04:55.520
And then lastly let's do our default and if we only had if we had two more than we generally wouldn't

04:55.520 --> 04:56.830
have to do that default.

04:57.110 --> 05:00.380
But let's just do one just anyway just in case.

05:00.590 --> 05:04.290
So use in the colon again and this time with us to answer.

05:04.490 --> 05:07.430
And this one will be

05:13.110 --> 05:15.850
I don't know about that.

05:16.090 --> 05:23.210
So again something very vague so that we can return something back to the user as they get the question.

05:23.250 --> 05:27.330
And then lastly Now we just need to put it into court.

05:27.720 --> 05:30.750
And this one is in each year now.

05:31.240 --> 05:33.070
And then let's put.

05:33.060 --> 05:42.630
So first of all let's say you asked me and then here is the question.

05:46.440 --> 05:52.200
And let's do a line break so do some H.J. himself here because we are using it or H Tim L

05:57.040 --> 06:05.200
I think that is not so just leave it at that.

06:05.250 --> 06:08.620
And I'm just hoping that my answers do work.

06:12.410 --> 06:13.060
So there we go.

06:13.100 --> 06:14.810
So let's give it a shot.

06:14.840 --> 06:17.140
So refresh ask me anything.

06:20.260 --> 06:37.000
Is javascript's going to be around so the two rounds in 100 years put some spaces in there.

06:37.310 --> 06:43.080
So we're going to say you asked me is javascript going to be around in 100 years.

06:43.400 --> 06:45.260
I think it should be.

06:45.260 --> 06:48.610
I think I think I think that I don't know about that.

06:48.870 --> 06:55.250
So yeah we can have a number of different kind of funny responses and the whole idea is just to have

06:55.250 --> 07:01.880
some fun with this and see see what different kinds of responses you can generate.

07:01.910 --> 07:08.390
So do try it for yourself I create some interesting creative responses tend to make them as generic

07:08.390 --> 07:16.930
enough so that whatever the user is asking essentially we can respond back and have a fairly funny response

07:16.940 --> 07:24.620
but for the user entertaining response back to the user using switch and a number of other javascript

07:24.830 --> 07:26.290
that we've learned earlier.
