00:01.420 --> 00:06.550
Welcome back and and the next set of lessons were going to be building out a memory game.

00:06.550 --> 00:12.790
So this is going to be a game where you flip tiles and you try to remember where the matching tile is

00:13.060 --> 00:15.990
and then you go out and try to flip that same tile.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.700
So let's set up first of all let's set up our game board.

00:20.020 --> 00:24.060
And within this game we need a basic game area.

00:24.130 --> 00:29.490
So it's create a div for that and I'm going to give it an ID and I'm just going to call it a wrapper.

00:29.490 --> 00:33.920
So this is going to be where all of our main game contents are going to go.

00:34.150 --> 00:37.150
So first thing that we need is we need a start button.

00:37.150 --> 00:45.080
So from previous lessons we saw that a start button is a great way to initiate and start our game.

00:45.170 --> 00:46.720
I'm going to give it a class.

00:46.750 --> 00:52.570
So this is just because basically a div we're going to add an event listener to this and we're going

00:52.570 --> 00:56.910
to then have the ability to click on that and actually start our game.

00:56.920 --> 00:59.170
So there we go there is our start button.

00:59.170 --> 01:05.530
We also every game should have a scoring mechanism so let's create another div.

01:05.530 --> 01:11.090
Given an ID of score and we're going to keep our score in here.

01:11.440 --> 01:15.490
Another thing that I usually include within a game is a message area.

01:15.490 --> 01:21.640
So this is an area that if something is happening or we want the user to take some type of action then

01:21.640 --> 01:24.970
this is where it usually I place those types of messages.

01:25.210 --> 01:28.690
And then last but not least let's create a game board.

01:28.690 --> 01:32.770
So this is where all of our tiles are actually going to go and set.

01:32.920 --> 01:34.890
So let's just create all of this out.

01:34.960 --> 01:43.090
So we've built out our basic structure and this is done the H to Mel and the rest of the game mechanics

01:43.090 --> 01:47.380
are going to be all done using javascript.

01:47.380 --> 01:50.660
A few other really quick things that we're going to add in.

01:50.710 --> 01:53.550
And I don't want to focus a lot on the styling.

01:53.560 --> 02:00.850
Just as before I want to really quickly kind of set up some styling here and not spend a whole lot of

02:00.850 --> 02:05.490
time on styling because we want to focus this course on Javascript.

02:05.650 --> 02:08.210
So I'm just doing some basic styling.

02:08.430 --> 02:11.710
A center align that text.

02:11.710 --> 02:14.950
Let's create a border radius.

02:14.950 --> 02:21.650
So this gives that rounded edge to the button because we are creating a button.

02:22.240 --> 02:23.640
Let's do a font size

02:26.420 --> 02:29.050
so do one for us.

02:29.070 --> 02:38.560
Font size that should be size not and next our lets out in some padding so buttons usually look good

02:38.680 --> 02:40.150
with a bit of padding.

02:40.290 --> 02:42.230
So let's try 15 pics.

02:44.050 --> 02:46.250
And so let's try that.

02:46.270 --> 02:48.380
Refresh the page see what it looks like.

02:48.520 --> 02:49.030
So there I go.

02:49.030 --> 02:50.630
Got a nice big start button.

02:50.650 --> 02:54.490
And let's also change this color so that it's white.

02:54.970 --> 03:02.770
And also I want to have a hover effect so we can do that with CSX where we play hover.

03:02.970 --> 03:09.630
So pseudo class and if anyone hovers over this button let's turn it a darker red.

03:09.630 --> 03:13.110
So let's see what we got here and maybe we do.

03:13.120 --> 03:14.070
Crimson.

03:14.440 --> 03:15.770
Crimson is a good color.

03:15.800 --> 03:19.010
And so now let's refresh it again.

03:19.140 --> 03:23.530
And whenever we hover over it so we get this kind of nice button effect.

03:23.590 --> 03:24.670
We're also going to need

03:27.560 --> 03:34.130
a bunch of game tiles and I want to put these game tiles I want them I got to use divs but I want them

03:34.130 --> 03:38.340
to inline block so basically a line next to each other.

03:38.390 --> 03:41.660
So I'm going to simply add an inline block.

03:41.660 --> 03:47.570
Now there's quite a lot you can always do with styling and really you can make things look way way better

03:47.570 --> 03:51.950
just by applying C Ss but I'm not going to spend a lot of time on that.

03:51.950 --> 03:53.280
So if you want.

03:53.300 --> 03:59.360
After we finished up with the javascript you can spend a little bit of time and update the CSA us and

03:59.420 --> 04:01.840
make this game look a whole lot nicer.

04:03.550 --> 04:07.630
So the first thing that we want to do is connect our start button.

04:07.660 --> 04:13.360
So I want you to pause the video and add an event listener to the start button.

04:13.360 --> 04:19.150
So it created a start button given an ID of start and now we want something to happen when we click

04:19.150 --> 04:25.810
that button we want to launch a function and create the function.

04:25.810 --> 04:31.240
The function is going to be called strt game and then this is our starting point to the game.

04:31.240 --> 04:35.860
So go ahead paused the video and add in that event listener for the start button and I'll show you how

04:35.860 --> 04:38.470
to do that coming up.

04:38.470 --> 04:45.550
So this site challenge was to add an event listener to the start button.

04:45.660 --> 04:54.790
So let's create a variable or call it espie for a start button will do document get element by ID and

04:54.790 --> 04:56.300
they all have IDs.

04:56.320 --> 05:00.490
So they're nice and easy to select using javascript.

05:00.490 --> 05:08.530
So just grab that button and then over here let's create event listener so start button add a listener

05:09.400 --> 05:12.930
and we'll add an event listener of click to it.

05:13.090 --> 05:18.160
And if the button gets clicked then we want to start the game function.

05:18.160 --> 05:18.670
So that's it.

05:18.670 --> 05:25.130
So now we should be ready to have something actually happen and maybe we just want to test this.

05:25.180 --> 05:29.730
So I got to set up a few other variables here.

05:29.800 --> 05:32.490
So one for message and.

05:32.680 --> 05:40.640
And this is document you get element by id and let's grab that element with the ID message.

05:40.780 --> 05:45.340
And then one thing here let's put something into the message.

05:45.340 --> 05:51.130
So let's just say it it's working.

05:51.880 --> 05:53.460
So I put a message in there.

05:53.470 --> 05:54.440
So let's try it.

05:54.490 --> 05:58.720
So start click start and it is working.

05:58.720 --> 06:03.080
So that's one of them important things to do when you are developing applications.

06:03.310 --> 06:09.550
Always take a second try it out and just make sure that your code is working up to this point and then

06:09.580 --> 06:14.880
you can continue building out the rest of the logic for the application.

06:14.880 --> 06:19.980
So I wanted to set up a few other variables here while we have the opportunity.

06:20.070 --> 06:23.630
So we did have one four score sledged set up.

06:23.850 --> 06:32.070
So document get element by id and let's grab it and score.

06:32.180 --> 06:35.080
And let's also do the game board

06:37.840 --> 06:40.780
so do gameboard or make a upper case.

06:40.820 --> 06:42.580
Sort of camel case.

06:43.480 --> 06:53.200
So gameboard and this one he calls to document get element ID and we're going to grab that element with

06:53.200 --> 06:57.910
the ID gameboard so that we have them all nicely laid out here.

06:58.220 --> 07:05.330
Another thing that I usually like to add in when I'm setting up a game is a way to lock it out or to

07:06.010 --> 07:06.830
complete it.

07:06.880 --> 07:12.160
So I have one that I'm going to use I'm going to call it play it lock code and by default we're going

07:12.160 --> 07:13.360
to set it to false

07:16.440 --> 07:17.410
and then we can use it.

07:17.410 --> 07:26.650
Use this one to toggle it back and forth as we enable the player to interact with some of our content.

07:28.390 --> 07:30.840
And I'm also going to do one more as well.

07:30.850 --> 07:32.970
I'm going to call it game play.

07:33.580 --> 07:37.540
So this one as well we started out as false.

07:38.320 --> 07:43.030
And then once the game play starts then we're going to take a look.

07:43.180 --> 07:46.900
So basically you're not going to be able to hit the start button more than once.

07:47.140 --> 07:50.980
So what we want to happen we only want that start button to be hit once.

07:51.010 --> 07:53.440
So we'll check to see if gameplay

07:56.630 --> 07:58.260
is not true.

07:58.760 --> 08:04.820
So if game play or essentially saying the same thing if game play is false then the person that I want

08:04.820 --> 08:09.450
to do is I want a certain game played to true.

08:09.500 --> 08:11.480
So basically we're toggling it.

08:11.480 --> 08:16.070
And so the first time you classic click the Start message

08:19.320 --> 08:27.090
say it's working and I'm going to have game play here or maybe I'll just leave it up here at the top

08:27.750 --> 08:29.690
and let's refresh it.

08:29.700 --> 08:32.870
So the first time we click it we see game play us false.

08:32.880 --> 08:37.210
Next time we click it we're seeking players for.

08:37.250 --> 08:40.520
So let me outline the next steps that we need to take.

08:40.530 --> 08:46.340
So once we start the game what I want to do is I want to hide the start button.

08:46.450 --> 08:51.990
So hide start button so that the user can't keep pressing start.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.760
And once the game play starts they don't really need the start button anymore.

08:55.840 --> 08:57.600
So it's good and hide that.

08:57.880 --> 09:04.780
And next let's grab within the game play so now that we've got the game play started we need to build.

09:04.990 --> 09:10.090
We're going to build an array of tiles.

09:10.390 --> 09:16.240
So these are all of the different tiles that we're going to have next and that we need to do is we need

09:16.240 --> 09:18.520
to shuffle those tiles.

09:18.820 --> 09:22.300
And we've seen this before how we can shuffle or raise.

09:22.300 --> 09:27.840
So we're going to do that and then we need to build the board.

09:28.160 --> 09:31.230
So those are the three items that we need to take care of.

09:31.310 --> 09:36.700
And basically that's going to set the user up and get them ready to play the game.

09:36.710 --> 09:38.890
So that's what we're going to be doing in the next lesson.

09:38.900 --> 09:45.320
We're going to be setting up some more variables and building out our tiles shuffling our tiles and

09:45.380 --> 09:49.700
outputting them visually for the game area for the gameboard area.

09:49.700 --> 09:50.510
So it's coming up.
