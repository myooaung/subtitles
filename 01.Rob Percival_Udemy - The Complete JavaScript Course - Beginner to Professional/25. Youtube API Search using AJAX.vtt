00:01.710 --> 00:07.960
In this lesson we're going to be showing you how you can set up access to a very large API and that's

00:07.960 --> 00:11.350
the YouTube API grab information from there.

00:11.350 --> 00:18.060
Pull it back using AJAX pull it back via javascript Ajax as Jason data.

00:18.220 --> 00:24.820
So you are going to need to have a Google account because one of the ways to access YouTube is through

00:24.820 --> 00:29.460
their API and in order to access it you need to have a Google account.

00:29.470 --> 00:37.290
So this is a mandatory thing if you want to get a YouTube API and to access the API you need a key.

00:37.810 --> 00:42.100
So if you dont have a Google account you can go out and sign up for a Google account.

00:42.100 --> 00:46.200
Its available at Google dot com accounts account its free to set up.

00:46.360 --> 00:51.430
And if you dont want to set up a Google account Unfortunately you wont be able to get an API key in

00:51.430 --> 00:55.210
order to pull back the data from the YouTube API.

00:55.210 --> 00:59.590
So you can just follow along within the lesson if you dont want to set up a Google account.

00:59.710 --> 01:06.340
And if you do want to set up a Google account or if you already have one then feel free to follow along

01:06.340 --> 01:13.390
in the next set of steps in order to get your developer key to access your youtube API.

01:13.570 --> 01:19.660
So the API has a lot of information in it and its a great API to practice and get familiar with.

01:19.720 --> 01:23.660
To get more familiar with what you can do with Ajax and Jaison.

01:23.980 --> 01:31.040
So once you have your Google account you're ready to go go over to developers console its console developers.

01:31.070 --> 01:37.020
Google will provide all of the links as well and that will bring you over to this page.

01:37.030 --> 01:43.630
So this is your dashboard that you can enable API eyes and services.

01:43.780 --> 01:50.020
So it may look slightly different but the part that you're looking for is enable API and services so

01:50.020 --> 01:55.630
you can go in and click that one and then from there make sure that you're also logged into your Google

01:55.630 --> 01:58.990
account and you can see they've got a ton of API here.

01:58.990 --> 02:04.270
So we saw earlier in one of the earlier lessons that we were looking at the Maps API.

02:04.330 --> 02:09.790
So there's got a lot of really cool ones here that you can make use of within your applications.

02:09.820 --> 02:12.280
So the one we wanted to look at is YouTube.

02:12.310 --> 02:15.510
So let's grab YouTube data API.

02:15.520 --> 02:17.200
So go ahead and click that link.

02:20.200 --> 02:23.880
And what that does is that opens up the API.

02:23.890 --> 02:28.660
So basically it gives you an illustration of how to use the API key.

02:28.710 --> 02:34.930
We've got our application we use the API key we get access to Google services and then we can retrieve

02:34.930 --> 02:38.520
that information back and use it within our application.

02:38.530 --> 02:45.170
So the next step enable it and there's a lot of details and in youtube and the developers.

02:45.280 --> 02:47.990
So there's just tons of information and pages.

02:48.250 --> 02:52.690
And that's why I do say that it might look different if you already set one up or if you've got set

02:52.690 --> 02:54.580
up it might look different.

02:54.580 --> 02:55.510
So there we go.

02:55.510 --> 03:03.760
So we've got our YouTube data API v3 key all ready to go and we're ready to start using it.

03:03.760 --> 03:11.740
So now we can go over into our credentials or actually our dashboard and that dashboard will show us

03:11.830 --> 03:13.580
YouTube data API.

03:13.630 --> 03:19.200
And so now we're ready to get credentials for this API.

03:19.570 --> 03:21.270
So we need to create credentials

03:24.800 --> 03:28.060
and the one that we want to do is the API key.

03:28.370 --> 03:36.290
So just select the API key and click and you can also select no restrictions.

03:36.310 --> 03:38.380
So basically it gives you this key.

03:38.410 --> 03:43.920
With this number and so grab that number you're going to need to make use of it.

03:43.930 --> 03:50.470
You can copy it this way or you can grab it and copy it and if you actually if you if you lose it you

03:50.470 --> 03:55.060
can always come back into your developer's console the Google console as well.

03:55.090 --> 03:58.870
So good and close that and you can also grab the key from there as well.

03:58.870 --> 03:59.980
So now we're ready.

03:59.980 --> 04:05.410
Let's go ahead and paste our key within our application and we're all ready to go.

04:05.410 --> 04:12.030
So we've set up and we're going to get access to the YouTube API within this format.

04:12.310 --> 04:18.390
So first thing we want to do is we want to actually just maybe make sure that this is working.

04:18.430 --> 04:25.300
So there is a path in all of this documentation that you can search through to the Google API and I'm

04:25.300 --> 04:30.680
going to just simply copy and paste the path it was available within the documentation.

04:30.700 --> 04:38.960
So this is the base you are l and then what you need to do is you need to also add in the key.

04:39.220 --> 04:44.710
So the key is this one here.

04:44.830 --> 04:51.620
So I ask going to go back a bit ad in the key and we also have some other parameters that we can enter

04:51.620 --> 04:52.040
in.

04:52.160 --> 04:54.290
So we've got one for Querrey.

04:54.290 --> 04:58.550
So that skew is query and then whatever that query might be.

04:58.550 --> 05:01.970
So let's let's go ahead and let's try this out first.

05:02.150 --> 05:07.280
And we see that once we enter this in that we're still missing a few parameters.

05:07.280 --> 05:12.380
So we need to do we need to add in part snippet.

05:12.470 --> 05:15.880
So no that's so part snippet.

05:16.010 --> 05:17.660
So I just added that in.

05:17.840 --> 05:25.130
And now once we add that in we actually get all of this information and you see that it's nicely presented

05:25.130 --> 05:29.640
and Jaison and that basically means that we're ready to go.

05:29.750 --> 05:36.400
We also have another parameter here that we can enter in and that's going to be the max results.

05:36.470 --> 05:40.940
So this gives us the ability to control how many results we want to get back.

05:40.970 --> 05:46.970
So if I set the max results to 20 that's going to return back more results I've got results per page

05:47.270 --> 05:48.370
total results.

05:48.390 --> 05:50.320
There's over a million items here.

05:50.450 --> 05:53.960
So a lot of Tanit information we've got.

05:53.960 --> 06:01.150
The next page tokin we've got the kind and just there's just a ton of stuff here.

06:01.160 --> 06:06.170
So if we want to move on to the next page we'd use the next page token and we could literally sift through

06:06.230 --> 06:11.930
all of these results that we've got here and we see we've got a lot of great information we can make

06:11.930 --> 06:12.740
use of.

06:12.830 --> 06:21.410
We've got description's titles we've got thumbnails so we can pull back all of this and make it in make

06:21.410 --> 06:24.070
use of it within our javascript application.

06:24.110 --> 06:26.510
So it does look like we're ready to go.

06:26.510 --> 06:29.560
So let's build out our application accordingly.

06:29.600 --> 06:31.630
And what are we going to do is I going to copy this.

06:31.640 --> 06:37.670
You are L and I'm going to simply place it here within my javascript so we can refer to it as we're

06:37.670 --> 06:39.420
building out the application.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.000
So usually that's what I like to do.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.190
Just make sure my API key is ready.

06:43.280 --> 06:44.920
Make sure everything is working.

06:44.960 --> 06:46.790
See the results coming in.

06:46.790 --> 06:50.930
Using a web browser and then I know I'm ready to go with my javascript.

06:51.170 --> 06:53.860
So what do we need in order to make this run.

06:53.900 --> 06:56.150
We need an input area for the user.

06:56.210 --> 07:10.230
So let's say you type Let's do a text input area and give it an idea of search YouTube and there we

07:10.230 --> 07:10.460
go.

07:10.500 --> 07:18.300
So next let's do an input and type button and so Button is going to search YouTube.

07:18.390 --> 07:30.560
So Id and well just do a search and give it a value of search youtube stereo so we're all ready from

07:30.560 --> 07:37.170
our h tim L point of view and we also need an area a div in order to output the results.

07:37.170 --> 07:41.650
So let's just call that's put one.

07:41.900 --> 07:46.010
So we're going to output all of the results from the search into output.

07:46.020 --> 07:47.580
One.

07:47.780 --> 07:50.500
So next let's add our window on load.

07:50.550 --> 07:53.770
So window on load.

07:53.770 --> 07:58.430
And we're going to launch in I.T. and then within I N I T.

07:58.700 --> 08:00.120
So let's set up a function.

08:00.140 --> 08:02.660
I N I T and within here.

08:02.660 --> 08:04.920
So this is where we can add the event handlers.

08:05.030 --> 08:08.680
So the the one that we initiate the search.

08:08.900 --> 08:10.010
So let's add that in.

08:10.010 --> 08:17.390
So if you want to pause the video at this point go ahead and set up your youtube API get that API key

08:17.690 --> 08:25.250
and have it on the ready and just go over to the web you are l with this format here and just make sure

08:25.250 --> 08:28.270
that your your API key is working.

08:30.580 --> 08:35.980
And set up the application where you've got a text input a button and you're all ready to go and then

08:36.040 --> 08:37.390
add that event listener.

08:37.390 --> 08:39.520
So show you how to do that coming up.

08:39.530 --> 08:44.400
So documents and we're just going to do a get element by ID.

08:44.430 --> 08:46.770
So we're going to grab that button.

08:48.420 --> 08:54.190
And once that gets clicked suicide or event listeners we're all going to do it within this one statement.

08:54.510 --> 09:03.720
So on click let's do the Y search so searching YouTube.

09:06.660 --> 09:13.680
And so false and clean this up a bit so it's more readable.

09:13.690 --> 09:18.470
So there's our event listener and then next we need to set up a function so call it.

09:18.560 --> 09:19.280
Why search.

09:19.300 --> 09:22.010
So this is where we're actually going to search YouTube.

09:22.450 --> 09:25.690
So we need to set up.

09:25.750 --> 09:32.350
We need to grab the search term let's do variable search term and we're going to grab the value that's

09:32.350 --> 09:35.030
contained within search YouTube.

09:35.470 --> 09:44.470
So let's do a document get element by id and YouTube search and then what we need to do is we need that

09:44.470 --> 09:45.270
value.

09:45.280 --> 09:48.780
So this now we can use that as our search term.

09:48.790 --> 09:52.510
Let's also set up a you are also variable you are l.

09:52.630 --> 09:56.530
And for now when a set that you are EL-TIBI this

10:00.690 --> 10:04.330
and then we'll update the parameters once we get things working.

10:04.800 --> 10:11.250
So we're going to use that callback method that we did earlier with when we're getting the Jason data

10:11.490 --> 10:13.040
when we're using that callback.

10:13.230 --> 10:18.840
So I want to use that same format because I want to make sure that we can pull the results pop up properly

10:19.170 --> 10:24.070
into our into our Javascript.

10:24.080 --> 10:25.390
So let's just call it good.

10:25.400 --> 10:33.360
Jason and we're going to pass over some parameters with Passover that you are l and then the other part

10:33.360 --> 10:36.690
of it is the actual callback function.

10:36.690 --> 10:37.980
So do data.

10:38.040 --> 10:40.300
So a back in data within here.

10:43.930 --> 10:47.290
And for now let's just console log that data.

10:47.350 --> 10:53.380
So whatever we're retrieving back we're just going to log that into the console and then once we get

10:53.380 --> 10:58.510
that information coming back via Jaison then we know that we can make use of it.

10:58.540 --> 11:02.010
So the next thing is that we need to actually.

11:02.180 --> 11:08.230
So we're going to close that one up a bit and actually don't need to duplicate it any more because I

11:08.230 --> 11:12.520
already have all of the content there so I can get rid of that part now.

11:12.550 --> 11:19.870
So next let's set up a function and this function is the actual get Giese on function.

11:19.870 --> 11:23.790
So much like what we did earlier was set this one up from scratch.

11:23.800 --> 11:30.070
So it's going to do that callback and it's going to use that built in function here that we've added

11:30.070 --> 11:32.630
into the get Jaison as the callback function.

11:34.330 --> 11:35.940
So paused the video.

11:36.100 --> 11:40.300
And what I want you to do is create the AJAX call.

11:40.330 --> 11:46.360
So remember the first thing that we do is we create that X MLH TTP request object.

11:46.360 --> 11:48.950
Then we open we can use get.

11:49.030 --> 11:57.660
In this case to get the information from YouTube because we saw that the URL works here within our browser.

11:57.670 --> 12:00.480
So that means that it's going to work within get.

12:00.490 --> 12:07.570
So we don't have to post and then we need to we can set the response type So a set the response type

12:07.600 --> 12:14.360
as Jason and then the onload and we'll do the callback method as well within that function.

12:14.380 --> 12:17.550
So go ahead and add that in I'll show you the solution coming up.

12:19.130 --> 12:24.290
So we've seen this before where we set you or else we're passing you are l and the next.

12:24.290 --> 12:30.350
We've got our callback function and this is that function that we're doing over here and right now we're

12:30.350 --> 12:34.890
just going to log it out into the console because this is going a this is getting fairly complex so

12:34.890 --> 12:43.820
we want to make sure that as everything is working once we've finished making H.T. ex-MIL HTP request

12:43.820 --> 12:44.870
object.

12:44.870 --> 12:48.990
So it's the first thing that we always start when we creating our Ajax request.

12:49.220 --> 12:53.450
The next one is where we can do the open.

12:53.450 --> 13:03.880
So this is where we set the path of the file that we're opening up and let's use get and let's pass

13:03.880 --> 13:09.610
that you are all parameters so we're sending that within the function so we're grab that as well.

13:09.610 --> 13:12.560
And next let's assume that this is true.

13:12.700 --> 13:17.920
So it's a synchronous and we also have to send.

13:18.270 --> 13:25.400
So send us the one that initiate set and this one is new so there's that.

13:25.440 --> 13:28.010
We can set up the response type.

13:28.080 --> 13:38.190
So this is the response type that we're expecting back from the server and the response type is Jason.

13:38.230 --> 13:41.650
And then last but not least we have to set the onload.

13:41.650 --> 13:49.060
So basically whenever the onload fires off we're going to fire off this function and this function is

13:49.330 --> 13:52.360
the one that's going to do the callback.

13:55.090 --> 14:03.780
So let's just let's do a check to make sure that SH our status is equal to 200.

14:03.910 --> 14:05.320
So this is that double check.

14:05.320 --> 14:06.890
So kind of like that.

14:07.240 --> 14:10.630
The one we did earlier where we're looking at the ready state.

14:10.630 --> 14:17.740
So same thing the status the ready state make sure that it's at 200 and then we're ready to do the callback.

14:18.300 --> 14:21.420
So call back and within the callback.

14:21.430 --> 14:24.040
All we're doing is we're passing in.

14:24.070 --> 14:33.110
So that first parameter is null within the callback.

14:33.410 --> 14:38.990
Actually what we're doing is we're just sending back that response so it's not actually know it's we're

14:38.990 --> 14:42.500
sending back x x H.R. response object.

14:42.500 --> 14:46.640
So all of that response information is going to get sent back into data.

14:46.730 --> 14:51.780
And that should that should then display within the console log.

14:51.980 --> 14:53.890
So I think we're ready to give it a go.

14:53.990 --> 14:55.130
So let's try that out.

14:56.030 --> 15:00.020
And let's just put in test and search and there we go.

15:00.020 --> 15:05.690
So it did look like it worked and we were able to retrieve back 20 items there.

15:05.870 --> 15:12.670
And that means that we're ready to output that information into our web page using javascript.

15:12.920 --> 15:19.880
So what I want you to do now is set this up try and make sure that you can send over that request object

15:19.910 --> 15:25.310
and that you retrieving information and then you're ready to simply output it within your web page to

15:25.310 --> 15:29.420
loop through the Jason information and output into your web page.

15:29.420 --> 15:34.220
So once you're at this point the rest of it is just going back to the plain old javascript where we're

15:34.280 --> 15:35.820
outputting that content.

15:37.210 --> 15:42.660
In the portrait part here is that get Giese on so this is the same thing that we did earlier where we

15:42.660 --> 15:49.000
were doing the function we're passing in the function call back and that gives us the ability to utilize

15:49.000 --> 15:52.340
that data directly within this earlier function.

15:52.340 --> 15:58.580
So we don't have to do the console log of the ex-teacher our response only within this function we can

15:58.580 --> 16:00.090
have it here as well.
