00:00.610 --> 00:03.480
In this lesson we're going to be looking at Jaison.

00:03.510 --> 00:06.540
So this is a javascript object notation.

00:06.540 --> 00:13.710
And the short format is Jason and we've seen this before that basically it's very similar to javascript

00:13.800 --> 00:20.700
objects although it's slightly different and it's primarily used as a way to transfer information and

00:20.700 --> 00:22.880
data across the Internet.

00:22.890 --> 00:26.510
So previously we might have used x M-L as a format.

00:26.550 --> 00:35.970
And now Jason is quickly replacing SML as the primary way to communicate data between different applications.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.390
There's more information on Wikipedia about Jason and they've got all the whole history Ajay's on here

00:42.480 --> 00:43.380
as well.

00:43.380 --> 00:44.450
And down.

00:44.470 --> 00:46.670
They've got an example of on.

00:46.710 --> 00:53.400
So the main difference and this is what we saw as well earlier that the main difference is that we know

00:53.400 --> 01:00.330
when we're setting a javascript object that we don't need the double quotes around the key.

01:00.360 --> 01:02.400
We only need it around the value.

01:02.520 --> 01:09.180
So it's the same idea that we get these key and these paired values that we have a key and it identifies

01:09.370 --> 01:12.490
translates into a value that's associated with it.

01:12.630 --> 01:16.130
And then with us on we do have the coded around it.

01:16.140 --> 01:21.240
So this is the way that we know that we're actually formatting proper Jaison format.

01:22.740 --> 01:29.310
And that really is just the main difference that the saw in values get the quotes around it and the

01:29.310 --> 01:32.130
regular javascript objects don't need them.

01:32.130 --> 01:38.000
So that's where they resemble each other and the structure is very similar and of course it's also human

01:38.160 --> 01:40.840
readable just like javascript objects.

01:41.260 --> 01:46.770
So let's open up our editors and practice some Jaison so we can set this up.

01:46.800 --> 01:54.110
So we're going to call it my work call it my object 1 and the first one that I'm going to do here.

01:54.110 --> 01:57.640
So this is going to be just a regular javascript object.

01:57.710 --> 02:03.800
So we have the curly brackets and then inside the curly brackets we have these paired values so we have

02:03.800 --> 02:06.870
a key and a value that gets associated with it.

02:07.130 --> 02:15.050
So let's create so I'll call it first and then we separate it with the colon and then afterwards we

02:15.050 --> 02:22.300
can use either we can use a string a number or a boolean.

02:22.300 --> 02:28.680
So let's just create a string here and let's close this one off.

02:28.720 --> 02:29.630
So variable.

02:29.650 --> 02:33.630
And I'm going to do a second one and this one is going to look very similar.

02:33.640 --> 02:37.720
So same idea that we use the square the curly brackets.

02:37.720 --> 02:40.840
And then within sight here I'm going to do first.

02:40.960 --> 02:47.230
But this time I'm not going to use the quotes so I'm just going to do first and colon and then type

02:47.230 --> 02:50.000
in a value that gets associated with it.

02:50.020 --> 02:52.270
So let's refresh the page.

02:52.270 --> 02:54.360
We've got our console opened up here.

02:54.490 --> 03:04.100
So now if I type in my object so if I type in my object 1 or if I type in my object to

03:08.290 --> 03:11.470
we'll see that it returns the exact same thing.

03:11.500 --> 03:13.040
So it looks identical.

03:13.120 --> 03:15.930
And this is why we say it's very similar.

03:16.030 --> 03:25.250
But if I go into and if I take these values into a Linter and the one I get to use is JS song lint dot

03:25.250 --> 03:25.940
com.

03:25.940 --> 03:33.200
So basically what this does is this gives you the ability to basically type add in some code here and

03:33.230 --> 03:34.290
see if it's valid.

03:34.310 --> 03:35.660
JS on format.

03:35.660 --> 03:41.390
So this is also very useful if you've got Jason or javascript object and it's hard to read then you

03:41.390 --> 03:43.790
could paste it in here and make it a lot more readable.

03:43.790 --> 03:45.230
So let me show you what happens.

03:45.230 --> 03:51.050
So first of all we're going to take this one here and you think this one is going to be a valid Jaison

03:51.100 --> 03:51.870
object.

03:51.890 --> 03:54.110
So remember we're looking for quotes.

03:54.110 --> 03:59.770
So if I do validate Jaison I get return back that this is a valid Giese object.

03:59.780 --> 04:00.770
So the second one.

04:00.790 --> 04:04.670
So do you think that this is going to validate or are we going to throw an error.

04:04.670 --> 04:08.670
So what do you think is going to happen when I correct when I press the validate Jaison.

04:08.870 --> 04:14.810
And we know that with Jason The difference is the double quotes and I know I've spent a little bit of

04:14.810 --> 04:19.800
time on this but it's really important to understand that there is a difference between the two.

04:19.880 --> 04:25.620
But when it comes to javascript and once you bring it into javascript they're going to work interchangeably.

04:25.640 --> 04:33.030
So they're going to both work the same way and there's a number of resources like this Jason lint that

04:33.030 --> 04:37.530
you can go to online and you can make use of JS saw in content.

04:37.710 --> 04:42.690
There's another really great resource that I'm also going to be making use of in the upcoming lessons

04:42.930 --> 04:45.540
and this is my face on dot com.

04:45.570 --> 04:53.220
So basically the same idea but it actually allows us to create an online Valot Jase on file so the same

04:53.220 --> 05:00.030
thing that if I type in some Jason it actually creates the on file and then that gives me a URL that

05:00.030 --> 05:04.010
I can go to and I can actually see the Jaison output.

05:04.110 --> 05:09.300
And this is also really useful when we're trying out and we're working with Jason and we're trying to

05:09.300 --> 05:15.560
get comfortable with it that we do have the ability to grab that content online and then we can pull

05:15.560 --> 05:19.240
it into our application so it can get used to looping through.

05:19.240 --> 05:27.420
JS on from external files that are actually not attached into the application so it creates a separation

05:27.480 --> 05:31.790
of the data and the application directly using javascript.

05:31.830 --> 05:37.590
And this is also really important because this gives us the ability to have a lot more dynamic type

05:37.590 --> 05:41.270
applications when we're building these applications online.

05:41.990 --> 05:46.130
And also in the upcoming lessons we're going to be looking at Ajax.

05:46.190 --> 05:54.110
So Ajax gives us a way to transfer Jaison data from one application to another so bringing it into our

05:54.110 --> 06:01.940
javascript and its ideal work using these two together because Ajax looks for data and allows us to

06:01.940 --> 06:09.590
transmit data and then the Jason is a great format for transmitting and transferring data between applications.

06:09.680 --> 06:13.720
And we're going to see a whole lot more of that coming up in upcoming lessons.

06:13.850 --> 06:22.010
So what I want you to do now is to open up your editor create a jigsaw in file and then go to one of

06:22.010 --> 06:33.170
these Web sites either on dot com or on lint or search Google for a Jason Linter and just try it out

06:33.500 --> 06:40.250
type in and paste in some Jason files and see what it looks like when you're pulling that information

06:40.250 --> 06:40.660
out.

06:40.820 --> 06:43.940
And the other thing that I also want you to do as well.

06:43.940 --> 06:48.810
So we're going to create a jigsaw file that's going to be a little bit longer.

06:48.920 --> 06:51.260
So you can go to the one at Wikipedia.

06:51.260 --> 06:55.400
This is a great example because it's got all of this information.

06:55.400 --> 07:01.270
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to create my case on file.

07:01.520 --> 07:03.970
That's going to contain this Jason information.

07:04.130 --> 07:07.300
And then in the next lesson we're going to be queering to it.

07:07.310 --> 07:09.680
So that's what I want you to do is to

07:12.450 --> 07:19.140
create an online my Giese on file so that we can access it in the upcoming lessons.

07:19.230 --> 07:24.900
And this is also real important just to kind of get familiar with the format of the sun.

07:25.080 --> 07:31.270
So all of this and more on Jason is coming up in upcoming lessons.
