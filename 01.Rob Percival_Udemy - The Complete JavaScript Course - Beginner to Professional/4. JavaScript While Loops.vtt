00:00.670 --> 00:01.790
Well come back.

00:01.850 --> 00:05.520
And this lesson we're going to look at while loops.

00:05.660 --> 00:13.550
So we saw earlier that the do while loop and what happens with the do while loop is that the statement

00:13.760 --> 00:16.120
is done before the expression.

00:16.250 --> 00:23.510
So we got this statement over here and we always run through this statement at least one time.

00:23.510 --> 00:24.760
So there was no escape for it.

00:24.780 --> 00:34.430
And even when the value of that answer that we had the prompt was not a number it would still always

00:34.490 --> 00:38.710
run through once and then it would realize that condition is not met.

00:38.960 --> 00:44.100
So the while loop is going to be slightly different.

00:44.250 --> 00:52.110
So we need to include for all of the loops we always need to have those seem three parts to it.

00:52.290 --> 00:57.530
So we need to have an increment so that a way that it's actually changing.

00:57.600 --> 01:00.720
We also need to have an initial value.

01:00.840 --> 01:03.130
So the starting point for the loop.

01:03.180 --> 01:09.150
And then over here we also need to have a condition that's meant to give the ability to actually break

01:09.210 --> 01:10.400
out of the loop.

01:10.470 --> 01:17.010
So let's set that up again and this time we're just going to use the while loop so we can get rid of

01:17.010 --> 01:19.200
some of this information here.

01:21.770 --> 01:23.570
And if we're using that number.

01:23.600 --> 01:29.450
So this is where we enter in the code that's going to run through here and there is going to be a difference

01:29.450 --> 01:31.640
to the way that the code is being output.

01:31.640 --> 01:34.190
So we see that the condition is over here.

01:34.190 --> 01:39.850
Our STARTING POINT OF X is zero and we need to increment X by 1.

01:39.890 --> 01:45.620
So this gives us our way out of our loop and eventually this condition will no longer be true.

01:45.650 --> 01:47.590
And that's when the loop is going to break.

01:47.900 --> 01:55.630
So let's put some content so put in her age 2 now and we'll add to the existing Internet age to melt.

01:55.690 --> 02:04.610
So it's going to look a lot like what we had before value of x is equal to.

02:04.740 --> 02:06.960
And then let's put the value of x

02:09.740 --> 02:12.980
and then we'll do a line break.

02:14.150 --> 02:15.940
So let's see what happens.

02:15.950 --> 02:21.830
So going over here rumor again that we're starting with X incrementing it.

02:21.960 --> 02:30.430
So if we place this increment after this which will typically make more sense let's do it that way.

02:30.940 --> 02:37.840
So this time let's increment X after we've actually run through it and then let's also do that final

02:37.900 --> 02:39.070
output of x

02:42.600 --> 02:52.260
so final value of x firehall value of X is going to be equal to whatever the value X is leaving the

02:52.260 --> 02:52.770
loop.

02:53.010 --> 02:54.340
So let's see what happens.

02:54.350 --> 02:57.870
We refreshed it and we're starting at zero.

02:57.930 --> 03:03.740
We're looping through and we see that we do still do that increment and then we break out of the loop.

03:04.020 --> 03:10.340
So this is slightly different because previously what we are doing the do while loop.

03:10.500 --> 03:18.780
We saw that even we had the prompt that we still ended up looping through all of the values.

03:18.940 --> 03:23.250
So let's recreate that but this time within the while loop.

03:23.500 --> 03:30.070
So remember we had a prompt We were asking how many times that we want to loop through.

03:30.250 --> 03:35.010
And then we were looping through the number whatever was being returned and the answer.

03:35.200 --> 03:36.970
So let's pause the video.

03:37.090 --> 03:43.420
Open up your editor and in that prompt asking for how many times you want to loop through here and then

03:43.420 --> 03:49.140
we're going to do relatively the same thing we did for the do while the.

03:49.390 --> 03:52.240
So now let me show you the answer here.

03:52.240 --> 03:59.560
So we're going to do the same thing that we did before what we're doing prompt we're going to ask how

03:59.710 --> 04:05.790
many times should I lose.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.050
So that's the question I ask you.

04:08.050 --> 04:10.150
How many times that we need to loop.

04:10.450 --> 04:14.460
And we saw earlier that we can just put the answer in there.

04:14.590 --> 04:20.790
So that will give us a breaking point to get out of the loop and also maybe we can start at 1.

04:21.160 --> 04:26.530
So we know that the first time going through there it's going to hit one and then we'll leave that final

04:26.530 --> 04:28.180
value of x.

04:28.210 --> 04:29.500
So let's see what happens.

04:29.590 --> 04:33.210
So we can ask the question how many times should we loop.

04:33.230 --> 04:34.440
So let's say seven.

04:34.840 --> 04:42.200
And so we see what's happened here is that we're starting at 1.

04:42.550 --> 04:47.650
So we go through and we see that X is less than 1.

04:47.920 --> 04:50.580
So that condition is true.

04:50.740 --> 04:58.760
So it puts one then X is less than or I should say X is less than 7.

04:58.810 --> 05:06.880
So it outputs that X is less than 7 again and it can be used to output it.

05:06.930 --> 05:10.500
And at this point it's already gone through there.

05:10.500 --> 05:11.520
It's I put it.

05:11.620 --> 05:18.160
So I put the 6 and now x is 7 so that it's got to stop executing the code.

05:18.370 --> 05:23.290
So let's go through here again and let's put in something that's not a number.

05:23.410 --> 05:28.870
And basically it doesn't actually loop through X so X did not change.

05:28.870 --> 05:33.010
So this is the big difference between the while loop and the do while loop.

05:33.010 --> 05:39.460
So if you want an opportunity to run through the code that's sitting in here then you can go ahead and

05:40.030 --> 05:42.700
use the do while loop.

05:42.850 --> 05:47.280
Otherwise use the while loop because this code won't get executed.

05:47.440 --> 05:50.150
If this condition is not met.

05:50.860 --> 05:52.720
So now it's time for a challenge.

05:52.720 --> 05:56.330
So we saw that both of these loops works slightly differently.

05:56.500 --> 05:59.200
So let's have a more interesting challenge.

05:59.290 --> 06:06.510
So let's say that we're going to create a secret password.

06:06.620 --> 06:15.550
And what I want to happen is I want this loop to continuously prompt the user until he actually gets

06:15.620 --> 06:16.470
the password.

06:16.580 --> 06:18.590
And that's where the loop is going to break.

06:18.590 --> 06:21.140
So this is going to be slightly different.

06:21.140 --> 06:27.290
We're not actually going to have to set a number because the way out of the loop is the condition for

06:27.290 --> 06:34.850
the loop that it's actually going to break out of it is going to be once we get the correct answer.

06:35.300 --> 06:37.900
So go ahead.

06:37.900 --> 06:40.740
Open up your editor and try that out.

06:40.900 --> 06:46.180
So you know that we do need to set a super password so he can make that anything that you want and I'm

06:46.180 --> 06:47.440
actually going to make mine.

06:47.500 --> 06:50.380
Javascript so you can do the same if you want.

06:50.440 --> 06:58.540
So set up a variable create that secret password and then put the prompt inside the while loop and then

06:58.600 --> 07:03.780
do a condition to check to see if the user guessed correctly.

07:05.910 --> 07:12.420
So open up your editor try that out and I'll show you a solution coming up.

07:12.600 --> 07:16.830
OK so I hope you had an opportunity to try this out.

07:17.070 --> 07:22.620
And so let's update the code for an answer to this.

07:22.620 --> 07:25.730
So look for an answer to our challenge.

07:25.800 --> 07:31.000
So call it secret and let's do a word Zionistic javascript.

07:31.020 --> 07:34.080
I do all lowercase.

07:34.080 --> 07:36.240
So we're not going to make it that difficult.

07:36.290 --> 07:39.520
The user actually asked against the case as well.

07:40.010 --> 07:46.800
So earlier we saw that we were using that variable or something a numeric number were looping through

07:46.800 --> 07:48.180
till we broke out of the loop.

07:48.570 --> 07:55.950
So if we're actually using a condition that is not numeric then we don't actually need to increment

07:56.040 --> 07:56.760
the values.

07:56.790 --> 07:58.550
So you get rid of that stuff there.

07:59.010 --> 08:05.580
So next let's let's initiate this.

08:05.650 --> 08:15.950
So we need a way to actually initiate and ask the user if if they give out what the secret word is and

08:16.190 --> 08:20.310
the way that we're going to do this we're actually going to do this for us outside of the loop.

08:20.450 --> 08:25.830
And then we're going to do one inside of the loop because if I do something inside the loop.

08:26.120 --> 08:27.020
So let's say

08:29.790 --> 08:36.140
crack code and we do something in here where we do a prompt.

08:36.150 --> 08:43.620
The problem is that if we're looking to see if the crack code is equal to the secret

08:48.040 --> 08:52.630
then we're never going to get to the point where we're doing the prompt unless the prompt is actually

08:52.630 --> 08:59.250
sitting outside of the while and we can also have another one inside.

08:59.250 --> 09:06.450
So let's let's set one up we're going to set a variable up and this variable is going to be called crack

09:06.480 --> 09:09.420
code and this is going to be prompt.

09:09.420 --> 09:14.630
So basically this is where we cannot set up that condition that we're going to loop through.

09:14.880 --> 09:22.080
So probably I'm just going to say what is the secret word.

09:23.070 --> 09:28.960
And the user comes in sees this prompt they enter something in the code.

09:29.070 --> 09:33.100
And we're going to check to see if it's equal to secret.

09:33.210 --> 09:36.240
But if it is a secret that's true.

09:36.360 --> 09:39.670
And then we're going to run through the code so that doesn't make sense.

09:39.810 --> 09:55.090
So let's set it to not be equal to secret and next we can say guess I guess.

09:55.130 --> 09:59.570
So basically what's going to happen here is once

10:02.870 --> 10:09.110
the user is presented first with a prompt asking for the secret were if it's not equal to the secret

10:09.110 --> 10:12.620
where we're going to just ask them to guess again.

10:12.670 --> 10:14.050
So we'll see how this works.

10:14.120 --> 10:17.470
And we're going to be doing it within order.

10:17.510 --> 10:18.650
So we know that.

10:18.680 --> 10:27.170
Lastly we can say something like You guessed correct or we can simply have another condition over here.

10:28.130 --> 10:29.360
So let's see how this works.

10:29.360 --> 10:35.540
Before we add the final output and we'll just do something like that as a placeholder.

10:35.750 --> 10:37.450
So let's try it.

10:37.460 --> 10:39.500
So what is the secret word.

10:39.530 --> 10:46.790
I'm going to put in test and it's good to say Guess again and guess again and guess again.

10:46.880 --> 10:50.040
And I continuously have to guess.

10:50.180 --> 10:55.360
And I'll never get to that output because it's going to continue within this loop.

10:55.520 --> 11:00.950
So loops can go on and on and on until you actually get a way to break out of them.

11:01.280 --> 11:08.630
So now when enter in this word this condition is no longer going to be true and we're going to be able

11:08.630 --> 11:10.090
to continue with our script.

11:10.350 --> 11:11.900
Let's see how that works.

11:11.900 --> 11:14.610
So okay and we get the final output.

11:14.990 --> 11:19.560
So the only way to continue is to actually get the word properly.

11:19.690 --> 11:25.670
And if you do then you actually get to continue out and you get that final.

11:26.060 --> 11:28.240
So let's try something else.

11:28.250 --> 11:34.660
So what if we started here and he's already interested the right word.

11:34.880 --> 11:41.650
It still works because of the fact that this statement is not true.

11:41.930 --> 11:44.520
So it just ignores what's happening here.

11:44.660 --> 11:52.130
And if we did this in a do while loop then it wouldn't ignore that prompt and it would mess things up.

11:52.130 --> 11:57.990
So in this case if you do something like this where are you two and a guess a word there.

11:58.010 --> 12:04.640
We know that in this scenario this works out perfectly because we can't continue we can't get to this

12:04.640 --> 12:11.120
line of code unless we break out of the loop and the loop will continue until it gets the word that

12:11.150 --> 12:12.350
we have provided.

12:12.350 --> 12:14.440
So until we get that secret.

12:14.750 --> 12:20.550
So the next lesson we're going to look at the most popular way to do loops and that's the for loop.

12:20.650 --> 12:22.430
So that's coming up in the next lesson.
