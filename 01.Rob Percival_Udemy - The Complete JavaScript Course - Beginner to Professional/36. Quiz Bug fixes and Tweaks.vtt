00:00.920 --> 00:05.150
Welcome back hand in this lesson I want to do some bug fixing and tweaking.

00:05.150 --> 00:11.180
So we saw earlier that we had the ability to move through all the different questions and were able

00:11.180 --> 00:16.950
to select various answers possible answers within the questions by simply clicking them.

00:17.150 --> 00:22.150
And one of the problems was that we don't actually aren't actually removing them.

00:22.430 --> 00:26.590
So that's one of the big problems is that we're not removing them out.

00:26.600 --> 00:35.690
So also when we refresh it if we refresh the page then we can also click that top one as well so we

00:35.690 --> 00:38.420
don't want to be able to click that top one either.

00:38.420 --> 00:44.720
So there's a few things we don't want to add that active class to either as well.

00:44.720 --> 00:50.450
So that's one of the things we need to be mindful of the fact that we don't want to add active class

00:50.600 --> 00:52.330
to that main element.

00:53.620 --> 00:55.600
Or to the question itself.

00:56.480 --> 00:58.270
So we have a few options here.

00:58.280 --> 01:06.710
And one of them I wanted to do is I want to set this one up as QUESTION So that way we can go to the

01:06.710 --> 01:13.350
class list and we can see if the class list has that as the question.

01:13.520 --> 01:18.280
And if not then we can simply grab that and whenever it gets clicked.

01:18.290 --> 01:23.150
So this is another thing that we need to be mindful of the fact is that we don't want to add this user

01:23.180 --> 01:29.290
answer if the user is selecting the top one here because that's going to that's going to actually that's

01:29.300 --> 01:36.660
going to actually cause a problem with that that we've got an identified and Nan and so on.

01:36.680 --> 01:37.700
So not a number.

01:37.730 --> 01:43.490
So this is something that we do need to be mindful of the fact and now that I've got it in that class

01:43.700 --> 01:52.090
we can quickly check to see if the one that was clicked that current element is there is one of the

01:52.090 --> 01:53.110
classes.

01:53.350 --> 01:55.460
So let's do a quick check.

01:55.480 --> 02:01.870
So do a condition and we're only going to apply this stuff

02:05.120 --> 02:07.150
and let me clean that up a little bit.

02:07.340 --> 02:14.670
So we're only going to apply it if the current target has a class name.

02:14.670 --> 02:19.900
So within the class list we've got a class name of it.

02:19.980 --> 02:28.410
If we don't have a class name of question in the list and this is where we can use class list contains.

02:28.430 --> 02:29.450
So let's do

02:31.800 --> 02:33.740
classless or not going at it.

02:33.750 --> 02:36.810
We're going to check to see if it contains.

02:36.990 --> 02:43.920
And the one that we're looking for so the class that we're looking for is going to be question and we

02:43.920 --> 02:46.560
want to do a negative on this.

02:46.560 --> 02:48.950
So this way let's refresh it.

02:49.080 --> 02:52.980
And now we're not able to answer to it on there.

02:53.220 --> 02:55.290
And that actually should be contained.

02:55.320 --> 02:57.880
So it's up to that refresh again.

02:57.990 --> 03:01.820
And now we see that we can't we can't select that.

03:01.950 --> 03:03.630
The main question as a class.

03:03.690 --> 03:06.450
So we don't want to be able to select that question as a class.

03:06.450 --> 03:13.140
And also that means that we can apply some styling to that question so we can do the font size to make

03:13.140 --> 03:19.020
it a little bit bigger so that we can identify that this is actually the question and it's not one of

03:19.020 --> 03:20.500
the possible answers.

03:20.610 --> 03:21.050
We will have.

03:21.050 --> 03:26.070
I want to play a background color to it so that it's more distinct.

03:26.090 --> 03:31.010
So to do a background color of black and we'll do a font color of white.

03:31.230 --> 03:34.050
So a lot of times you build up these applications.

03:34.050 --> 03:36.380
You do need to do a little bit of bug fixing.

03:36.540 --> 03:42.780
So the other one is that we can continue clicking and we know that at this point we should be able to

03:42.780 --> 03:43.780
move further.

03:43.800 --> 03:48.030
So we need to have a way to kind of block that next move.

03:48.030 --> 03:51.760
And we know that we're passing the value of A.

03:51.900 --> 04:02.040
And we know that we also have a link so if we take the value of page it's four and if we take the value

04:02.070 --> 04:10.290
of my data so my data length we've got a value of four.

04:10.440 --> 04:16.360
So we know that we can't move next past that because that's what we're going to throw an error.

04:16.500 --> 04:23.080
So we have to make sure that the value of A is.

04:23.100 --> 04:34.230
So we're going to do a condition here to see if the value of A is equal to or greater than or equal

04:34.230 --> 04:38.200
to the value of my data length.

04:38.850 --> 04:42.960
And if it is then we know that this is the game is over.

04:42.960 --> 04:49.190
So console and what just came over for now.

04:49.400 --> 04:50.610
So the console log out.

04:50.610 --> 04:51.930
Game over.

04:52.320 --> 04:57.780
Otherwise we know we're good to move on to the next the next page.

04:59.340 --> 05:06.620
So we can put these values in here and apply that logic to that statement.

05:06.660 --> 05:08.250
So now let's try that again.

05:08.250 --> 05:11.890
So now we shouldn't be able to actually move past this one.

05:11.920 --> 05:17.490
And while we as game over so we know that at this point this is where we need to do the summary of the

05:17.490 --> 05:18.170
page.

05:18.450 --> 05:25.440
The other challenge too is that we need to record the answers and we know that we can record them and

05:25.440 --> 05:29.470
we're actually recording them in user answer.

05:30.120 --> 05:36.120
So we know that we're recording them in there and as we're moving through there we're able to record

05:36.120 --> 05:37.250
them out.

05:37.260 --> 05:43.170
So one of the things too is that we need to check to see and we need when we're building out the page

05:43.200 --> 05:48.110
we need to add that active CLOS to the answer if it's correct.

05:48.300 --> 05:54.580
So let's do a condition and we're going to loop through user answer.

05:54.690 --> 06:00.480
So we know that whatever page they're on that's the index value that we're looking at.

06:00.480 --> 06:02.250
So let's take a look at that

06:07.520 --> 06:08.570
and save that.

06:08.570 --> 06:15.640
So now every time we build out the page we've got a bunch of undefined there because we haven't selected

06:15.640 --> 06:16.370
anything yet.

06:18.830 --> 06:20.370
And so now we're getting one.

06:20.410 --> 06:28.270
If I go on and if I click this one and if I go back to it we're also seeing that it was 0 was selected.

06:28.360 --> 06:32.890
So we can actually tell which one got selected by using user answer.

06:32.890 --> 06:38.120
So the next challenge is to add that active class into the element.

06:38.230 --> 06:47.440
If the value is there so if it's not undefined and if the value matches whatever value of X is currently

06:47.440 --> 06:53.350
available then we know that we need to add that active class so we could do it in a number of ways.

06:53.470 --> 06:56.080
Let's do it within a territory operator.

06:56.080 --> 07:00.320
So let's just do a class.

07:00.520 --> 07:10.240
And what were you going to do is we're going to check to see if this value is equal to x and if it is

07:10.330 --> 07:13.750
then we know that we need to set an active class.

07:13.960 --> 07:17.170
And if it's not then we're just going to leave it blank.

07:21.290 --> 07:26.050
And now let's add in class.

07:26.210 --> 07:33.740
So now that we're dynamically doing this class here we can add that brain nucleated element

07:36.980 --> 07:38.330
in that type of format.

07:38.360 --> 07:40.130
So let's refresh it again.

07:40.220 --> 07:43.940
Let's make our selection move back and there we go.

07:43.940 --> 07:52.190
So now we actually do have the ability to kind of record what's been selected within our process and

07:52.190 --> 07:55.740
we can see that we can go back we can update those values.

07:55.880 --> 07:58.650
And these are also being reflected within the database.

08:01.220 --> 08:03.160
So we're all ready to do the scoring.

08:03.170 --> 08:10.220
And there was one other bug that still was there that we shouldn't be able to move less than what the

08:10.220 --> 08:11.070
pages.

08:11.090 --> 08:13.930
And again we can handle this part within the move.

08:14.060 --> 08:21.260
So where we know that the value of page is negative 1 and we can't have that.

08:21.260 --> 08:27.980
So basically if the value of a is negative one then we're just going to disable that so we're not going

08:27.980 --> 08:29.670
to do anything to it.

08:29.690 --> 08:31.640
So let's add a condition in there.

08:31.760 --> 08:37.130
So check to see if the value of a is less than zero.

08:39.500 --> 08:45.020
Then we're going to set the value of a to be zero.

08:46.510 --> 08:47.770
So that's all we have to do there.

08:47.810 --> 08:54.260
So let's go back refreshed and now even if we click it it's not going to allow us to move any further.

08:54.260 --> 08:55.250
So that's perfect.

08:55.370 --> 08:56.840
That's exactly what we want.

08:56.960 --> 09:00.830
And we also want to identify all those values.

09:00.950 --> 09:03.410
So everything is there and everything is done.

09:03.590 --> 09:11.500
And the next step is to output the summary.

09:11.510 --> 09:18.110
So what I want you to do now is pause the video and we know that where we've gotten game over this is

09:18.110 --> 09:20.420
where we need to output the summary.

09:20.420 --> 09:25.500
So instead of outputting the next page we need to just build the summary.

09:25.700 --> 09:29.390
So create a function that gets launched here and the game over.

09:29.510 --> 09:37.460
Let's launch the function summary and output that content in the visible area so that basically means

09:37.460 --> 09:38.510
that that's it.

09:38.510 --> 09:40.910
There's no more next page.

09:41.030 --> 09:48.330
We need to compare the answers to the quiz is done.

09:48.350 --> 09:56.500
So it's in that function.

09:56.510 --> 10:02.270
So now what we need to do is we need to loop through the array where we're holding the answers and we

10:02.270 --> 10:10.130
have to compare those answers to the content in my data and do basic output of we'll loop through all

10:10.130 --> 10:13.110
of those and we can see if the answer was correct or not.

10:13.130 --> 10:15.280
And then we're going to create a score out of that.

10:15.290 --> 10:23.200
So why are you take a the video and update that summary so that outputs here with an output one area

10:24.910 --> 10:28.030
and I'll show the solution coming up.

10:28.030 --> 10:36.760
So we know that we need to loop through all of the Wii available data within the my data object and

10:36.790 --> 10:37.900
we can loop through it.

10:37.900 --> 10:42.600
So I'm going to just aboard one of these loops here.

10:43.680 --> 10:51.630
And to save time just make it look better and instead of this we're going to be looping through my data

10:51.690 --> 10:52.230
the length

10:57.390 --> 11:00.330
and we know that with my data.

11:00.330 --> 11:03.110
So let's take a closer look at it within the console.

11:03.210 --> 11:08.400
So we've got we've got a bunch of questions and each one of these.

11:08.550 --> 11:10.420
So as we loop through.

11:10.500 --> 11:14.200
So let's console log out first.

11:14.700 --> 11:22.130
And we know that as we loop through that value we want to have the correct the one that's correct.

11:22.140 --> 11:23.390
So let's do.

11:23.430 --> 11:24.020
Correct.

11:24.120 --> 11:31.530
So whatever the correct one is we want to loop through it and we also let's also console log out another

11:31.530 --> 11:32.220
value.

11:32.310 --> 11:39.930
And this is going to be the corresponding value within the array that we've been saving these user answers

11:39.930 --> 11:40.470
to.

11:41.980 --> 11:45.310
So let's do that and we don't need to have.

11:45.360 --> 11:47.940
There's no object information for that.

11:48.010 --> 11:49.780
So let's try this out.

11:49.870 --> 11:52.570
So now let's make our selections

11:56.330 --> 12:00.690
and we we need to launch summary.

12:00.740 --> 12:01.370
So there we go.

12:01.370 --> 12:03.090
So we've got our summary.

12:03.110 --> 12:07.760
So the first one we got 1 2 1 2 1 8 2.

12:07.760 --> 12:09.640
So we didn't get any correct.

12:09.650 --> 12:13.130
Let's go back and make some updates and then we're going to launch that again.

12:13.130 --> 12:17.850
So red grass green sky is blue.

12:18.110 --> 12:19.490
And five.

12:19.610 --> 12:21.890
So this time we got everything correct.

12:22.010 --> 12:27.080
So now the next thing is that we just need to make sure that we do this comparison and we can output

12:27.080 --> 12:28.820
this within the summary.

12:28.820 --> 12:41.560
So let's complete that and let's build out a variable HMO and we can do one summary.

12:41.920 --> 12:44.450
And now let's add to that each time.

12:44.460 --> 12:52.450
So let's do a check to see if this value is equal to this value.

12:53.020 --> 12:57.020
And if it is then we know that the user got it correct.

13:01.000 --> 13:10.680
So it's h to M M-L and add to h to M..

13:10.900 --> 13:11.400
That will do.

13:11.400 --> 13:12.260
Question

13:14.680 --> 13:19.500
X and we've got to do X plus one because we're starting at zero.

13:22.100 --> 13:24.380
So it's a more readable

13:27.400 --> 13:28.980
and let's leave a space there.

13:28.990 --> 13:30.010
And another one.

13:30.010 --> 13:31.660
And let's

13:35.170 --> 13:36.780
close that off for now.

13:36.820 --> 13:44.370
And we know that if the user got this correct then we need to output that it was correct.

13:48.970 --> 13:49.780
Correct.

13:51.650 --> 13:55.370
And otherwise else let's put wrong

14:00.990 --> 14:11.000
and also Let's score plus plus if the score is increasing and let's set the value of score to zero

14:14.880 --> 14:21.340
and then after we finish doing the loops let's do each Timo.

14:21.480 --> 14:24.160
Your score was.

14:24.320 --> 14:27.600
And now we can put the value of score

14:30.340 --> 14:35.300
and out of and whatever the length of my data was.

14:39.960 --> 14:46.200
And then lastly let's put that content into the inner h him out of output and get rid of some of these

14:46.200 --> 14:47.700
Konsole logs as well.

14:50.250 --> 14:50.910
So there we go.

14:50.910 --> 14:52.380
So now let's try this out.

14:52.410 --> 14:58.440
So first question next question let's get some wrong here.

14:59.810 --> 15:04.020
So your summary question one correct question to correct.

15:04.100 --> 15:07.410
Question 3 wrong question for wrong your score was 2 out of 10.

15:07.520 --> 15:11.870
We should actually have some spacing here as well.

15:12.290 --> 15:18.300
So it can out in line breaks and you could really customize this to look however you want it to look.

15:18.490 --> 15:24.400
So it's refresh.

15:24.440 --> 15:25.130
So there you go.

15:25.130 --> 15:27.620
So we've got question one correct.

15:27.650 --> 15:30.750
Wrong wrong wrong score was 1 out of 4.

15:30.800 --> 15:34.980
And you can let people go back and update their answers as well.

15:35.690 --> 15:36.440
So

15:39.210 --> 15:41.720
we can see that you can update them.

15:41.790 --> 15:46.380
And this is also a matter of preference you could lock this out at this point you could just get rid

15:46.380 --> 15:50.770
of the buttons you could overwrite the H to M L So a number of options here.

15:50.910 --> 15:51.830
Again it's up to you.

15:51.830 --> 15:55.170
Now at this point to summarize it as needed.

15:55.170 --> 15:59.400
And remember this is content that's coming from an API.

15:59.400 --> 16:06.750
So if you had a different set of questions your quiz would still function the same way except the questions

16:06.750 --> 16:07.950
would look different.

16:07.950 --> 16:14.790
And that's what I want you to do now as well to create to go over to my Giese on dot com and keeping

16:14.790 --> 16:20.710
within that same format where we've got a question and we've got a number of possible answers.

16:20.790 --> 16:23.360
And then we just identify which one is correct.

16:23.430 --> 16:29.590
Keeping in that same format buildout AJ saw and file that works within this quiz application.

16:29.600 --> 16:35.700
I asked some really interesting questions and build it up on my son pull it into the quiz up and just

16:36.210 --> 16:37.450
try it for yourself.

16:37.530 --> 16:40.600
And the other thing too is to make this look better.

16:40.640 --> 16:50.600
I had some styling and additional functionality if you want within this quiz.

16:50.690 --> 16:53.130
So do try it for yourself practice.

16:53.240 --> 16:59.880
