00:01.410 --> 00:02.260
Work come back.

00:02.280 --> 00:10.680
And in this lesson what I wanted to do is go over utilizing Jaison So one more time and I want you to

00:10.680 --> 00:16.260
actually take advantage of my J's on dot com and create a Jason File.

00:16.260 --> 00:19.590
So I've got the one that I originally got from Wikipedia.

00:19.590 --> 00:27.290
Got this Giese on file and I've got a r l down here so if I go to it I can access this information.

00:27.330 --> 00:30.190
So what I want to do is make use of this information.

00:30.190 --> 00:32.950
You can literally set up any case on file.

00:33.030 --> 00:38.850
And this is just going to be a quick exercise on retrieving this Jason data and then looping through

00:38.850 --> 00:40.520
it within javascript.

00:40.590 --> 00:47.010
In a lot of it is going to be similar to what we did earlier with the YouTube stuff so we can literally

00:47.010 --> 00:52.800
we can get rid of this and we can keep the button and maybe we can call this load.

00:52.830 --> 01:01.290
So instead of searching it's going to load the data we can add that seem a listener there so we can

01:01.290 --> 01:07.380
keep it a search and basically it'll still load this search file and now we just need to have a new

01:07.380 --> 01:07.990
or l.

01:08.010 --> 01:11.270
So this you URL here is the Jason bin.

01:11.280 --> 01:16.720
So let's open that up and replace it.

01:16.880 --> 01:22.240
And we don't need the search term so we don't need these values anymore and that's it.

01:22.250 --> 01:27.110
So we're going to pass this you r l and then we're going to show the results.

01:27.100 --> 01:36.530
So what I want to do is let's let's update this to console log and do results and then we'll rebuild

01:36.650 --> 01:40.790
that because it depends on what type of data you have.

01:40.970 --> 01:44.500
You might want to have your own customized output of the data.

01:44.630 --> 01:49.910
So it's always going to be different so depending on the data that you want to make use of it could

01:49.910 --> 01:52.360
be any piece of data.

01:52.520 --> 01:56.170
And so looping through it where you take care of that afterwards.

01:56.250 --> 02:00.510
And the good thing about creating this type of function is we can reuse it.

02:00.650 --> 02:05.740
So that's where the beauty of javascript and functions is that they're reusable.

02:05.960 --> 02:13.820
So what we've done is we've done literally a one minute update of what we had earlier and we've connected

02:13.820 --> 02:16.010
it to another Jaison file.

02:16.040 --> 02:18.620
So we're ready to pull that information through.

02:18.770 --> 02:21.670
And I also do encourage you to try it out for yourself.

02:21.830 --> 02:30.060
So it's clear this let's refresh the page and before we load it just get rid of the items because we

02:30.060 --> 02:32.660
don't know what the data is going to look like.

02:32.670 --> 02:36.860
So usually this is how I start I build it out into the console.

02:36.960 --> 02:41.820
And so I can take a closer look at actually what's loading and then I figure out how I'm going to pull

02:41.820 --> 02:42.980
it into the page.

02:42.990 --> 02:45.050
So this was just on file.

02:45.060 --> 02:46.740
We see that all we've got.

02:46.740 --> 02:51.540
We've got a first name we've got a last name we've got an address some information contained within

02:51.540 --> 02:52.090
there.

02:52.410 --> 02:58.530
So what I want you to do now pause the video create your own Giese on file you can create it any type

02:58.530 --> 03:05.700
of structure you want and simply link to it and pull it back into your javascript so you can take what

03:05.700 --> 03:11.190
we learned in the previous lesson with YouTube and you can reuse some of the functions that we used.

03:11.250 --> 03:16.680
Or you can build it from scratch so is a great exercise to start again from scratch however you want

03:16.680 --> 03:22.890
to do it get to the point where you've got a basic file you're pulling in some information.

03:22.890 --> 03:28.130
And next step is to make use of that and put it into that each team they'll show you how to do that

03:28.140 --> 03:28.710
coming up.

03:30.090 --> 03:35.970
So hope you had an opportunity to try this out and I really do encourage you to get familiar with it

03:36.000 --> 03:36.870
try it out.

03:37.020 --> 03:42.870
Create a look up online there's a lot of Jaison files that you could bring in you can place that into

03:42.870 --> 03:48.510
my son bin and you could just try it directly within your browser without even having a server running

03:48.510 --> 03:49.940
or anything like that.

03:50.040 --> 03:54.810
Just launched the file in your browser and take a look at that chase on stuff.

03:54.830 --> 04:02.790
The reason I like my son is that works directly within the local within the file protocol whereas I

04:02.790 --> 04:04.830
don't have to load a local server.

04:05.250 --> 04:11.710
So now we're ready to output that information so you can put that information however you want.

04:11.790 --> 04:18.390
I know that I've got the results here and I've got a couple arrays there so I can loop through the children.

04:18.390 --> 04:22.670
I don't know if there's no information contained in there so there's no point to loop through it.

04:22.830 --> 04:26.490
But sometimes the results might have that.

04:26.490 --> 04:29.450
So let's let's do results.

04:30.280 --> 04:33.630
And let's put some content here.

04:34.500 --> 04:42.820
So to H-1 and close off H1 and this this is again this is subject to your own creativity.

04:42.890 --> 04:49.130
You can output that content however you want your content may be completely different than my content.

04:51.300 --> 04:53.440
So I've got it under it results.

04:53.460 --> 04:54.780
And first name

04:58.260 --> 05:00.410
and then the other just put a space there.

05:03.210 --> 05:09.500
And I got a copy copy some of the sote So that's his last name.

05:09.500 --> 05:12.440
So we saw the first name last name large

05:16.850 --> 05:17.930
so save that.

05:17.960 --> 05:21.660
So now when we refresh it see what happens so there we go.

05:21.680 --> 05:23.840
We have the first name last name.

05:23.840 --> 05:28.750
We can add some more information about the person their address and so on.

05:29.030 --> 05:31.330
So go ahead try it for yourself.

05:31.400 --> 05:34.880
Create that on file and load it into your javascript.

05:34.940 --> 05:39.630
And the more you practice the more familiar become with that the more it's just going to make sense.

05:39.650 --> 05:44.420
And the more you are going to be comfortable with just working with that output.

05:44.420 --> 05:48.830
So as long as you can get it to the point where you've got it and your javascript as a javascript object

05:49.100 --> 05:53.330
you're ready to go and you're ready to output it however you want on your web page.
