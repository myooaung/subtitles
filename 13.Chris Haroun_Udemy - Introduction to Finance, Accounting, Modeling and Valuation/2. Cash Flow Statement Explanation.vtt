00:00:00.720  -->  00:00:04.040
Let's talk about the cash flow statement in more detail.

2

00:00:04.230  -->  00:00:08.650
So with the income statement we know that revenue minus expenses equals net income.

3

00:00:08.730  -->  00:00:12.950
But you know what the income statement is a lie.

4

00:00:13.260  -->  00:00:18.800
It's a lie because it doesn't tell you the real cash balance or cash increase in your pocket.

5

00:00:19.080  -->  00:00:21.160
Income is not cash.

6

00:00:21.180  -->  00:00:21.590
OK.

7

00:00:21.600  -->  00:00:26.490
So that's why we need to have a cash flow statement.

8

00:00:26.610  -->  00:00:33.930
So think about it this way if you get paid right and you have a check and the check is postdated right

9

00:00:33.930  -->  00:00:36.000
you can't cash it for a couple of weeks.

10

00:00:36.180  -->  00:00:37.670
Then you didn't get that cash yet.

11

00:00:37.680  -->  00:00:39.510
And so the income statement is not correct.

12

00:00:39.600  -->  00:00:40.840
That's not revenue yet.

13

00:00:40.860  -->  00:00:44.540
I mean it is revenue but it's not cash revenue.

14

00:00:45.000  -->  00:00:45.730
OK.

15

00:00:46.440  -->  00:00:49.950
So income is not always cash.

16

00:00:49.950  -->  00:00:55.650
So if we take the cash on the balance seat at the end of year 2 and we deduct cash on the balance sheet

17

00:00:56.040  -->  00:01:01.100
at the end of year 1 does that equal net income.

18

00:01:01.110  -->  00:01:02.490
No no it doesn't.

19

00:01:02.550  -->  00:01:03.390
Not at all.

20

00:01:03.390  -->  00:01:03.970
Not at all.

21

00:01:04.020  -->  00:01:05.620
And that's why we have the cash flow statement.

22

00:01:05.720  -->  00:01:05.990
Okay.

23

00:01:05.990  -->  00:01:10.410
So the cash flow statement will tell you why cash increase on the balance sheet from one year or the

24

00:01:10.410  -->  00:01:16.080
next or why cash decreased on the balance sheet when you to the next.

25

00:01:16.140  -->  00:01:19.590
And so here's how you make a cash flow statement.

26

00:01:19.680  -->  00:01:21.430
You start with net income at the top.

27

00:01:21.480  -->  00:01:22.250
Okay.

28

00:01:22.710  -->  00:01:29.190
And then you add back noncash items from the income statement like depreciation and then you add back

29

00:01:29.190  -->  00:01:32.190
noncash items from the balance sheet.

30

00:01:33.110  -->  00:01:33.660
Okay.

31

00:01:33.840  -->  00:01:37.250
So step one was do it get net income from the commission.

32

00:01:37.410  -->  00:01:37.920
Okay.

33

00:01:38.130  -->  00:01:45.600
And we've got there is three primary to that last section step to add back non-cash expenses.

34

00:01:45.660  -->  00:01:46.290
What we've got.

35

00:01:46.290  -->  00:01:48.410
Depreciation of a buck for that truck.

36

00:01:48.450  -->  00:01:51.560
So we'll add that back so for now cut

37

00:01:54.350  -->  00:01:56.310
and we're done with the income saving portion.

38

00:01:56.310  -->  00:02:02.340
Now what we would do is we go to the balance sheet and add the noncash items but tell you what I want

39

00:02:02.340  -->  00:02:07.230
you to watch the next lecture because I'm going to give you an example and then you'll have an exercise

40

00:02:07.320  -->  00:02:09.090
and this will all make perfect sense.
