00:00:05.160  -->  00:00:07.090
Let's talk about financial modeling.

2

00:00:07.680  -->  00:00:09.980
Now we understand financial statements.

3

00:00:09.990  -->  00:00:13.650
Let's talk about how to create and analyze Fanshen models.

4

00:00:14.100  -->  00:00:19.770
So by the end of this section you will understand what financial modeling is what the best practices

5

00:00:19.770  -->  00:00:25.500
are and why this skill is so crucially important for you to be successful analysts and stock picker

6

00:00:25.510  -->  00:00:25.950
.

7

00:00:26.360  -->  00:00:26.980
OK.

8

00:00:27.240  -->  00:00:29.220
So what is financial modeling.

9

00:00:29.250  -->  00:00:35.310
Well it's basically the ability to build out a spreadsheet several years in the future and understand

10

00:00:35.550  -->  00:00:38.800
what the financials will look like in the future for a company.

11

00:00:38.820  -->  00:00:40.590
It's like a crystal ball.

12

00:00:40.980  -->  00:00:42.280
Why do we do this.

13

00:00:42.330  -->  00:00:47.460
Because once we finish with financial modeling in this course we can come up with target prices meaning

14

00:00:47.640  -->  00:00:51.890
what the companies we're analyzing should be worth how we do this.

15

00:00:52.080  -->  00:00:54.220
Well of course we're going to use Excel.

16

00:00:54.420  -->  00:00:55.000
Right.

17

00:00:55.050  -->  00:01:01.600
And we're to use our knowledge of the three financial statements we've already cited.

18

00:01:02.040  -->  00:01:05.640
And we're going to forecast the future for those financial statements.

19

00:01:05.740  -->  00:01:06.470
Okay.

20

00:01:06.990  -->  00:01:12.300
And then what we'll do is we'll ease a little bit of magic longer term and we'll be able to figure out

21

00:01:13.110  -->  00:01:18.030
what the target price is we'll know earnings Well no cash flow and we'll no revenue from the three financial

22

00:01:18.030  -->  00:01:19.080
statements.

23

00:01:19.410  -->  00:01:24.540
And then we'll come up with target prices based on those three metrics from the three financial statements

24

00:01:24.560  -->  00:01:24.710
.

25

00:01:24.840  -->  00:01:25.480
Okay.

26

00:01:25.800  -->  00:01:31.710
And then what we'll do is we'll take the average of three different valuation methodologies one using

27

00:01:32.100  -->  00:01:33.670
earnings per share from the same.

28

00:01:33.890  -->  00:01:39.000
The other we're using cash flow from the cash flow statement and other one using revenue from the income

29

00:01:39.000  -->  00:01:45.600
tax cut and we'll get valuations using those three different methodologies which I'll explain in the

30

00:01:45.600  -->  00:01:47.220
valuation section later.

31

00:01:47.430  -->  00:01:53.970
And then what we'll do is we'll divide them by three and we'll get the blended average of what the target

32

00:01:53.970  -->  00:01:57.300
price should be for the company that we're analyzing now.

33

00:01:57.720  -->  00:02:02.080
In this section we will study modeling in a couple of seconds from now.

34

00:02:02.100  -->  00:02:03.560
We'll talk about valuation.

35

00:02:03.570  -->  00:02:04.710
Let's get started.
