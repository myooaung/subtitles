00:00:00,480  -->  00:00:08,100
Investor Relations Investor Relations helps you understand the company better investor relations submit

2

00:00:08,160  -->  00:00:11,350
press releases and financials to SBC dot gov.

3

00:00:11,370  -->  00:00:16,260
So you and I have the same access to information at the exact same time for free as the big hedge funds

4

00:00:16,260  -->  00:00:21,240
and mutual funds do Investor Relations sets up and leads quarterly earnings calls and we'll look at

5

00:00:21,240  -->  00:00:22,560
an example this soon.

6

00:00:22,560  -->  00:00:26,050
But basically companies have to release earnings four times a year.

7

00:00:26,140  -->  00:00:26,540
OK.

8

00:00:26,580  -->  00:00:27,810
Public companies.

9

00:00:27,900  -->  00:00:32,850
And what happens is investor relations issues a press release four times a year usually when the market

10

00:00:32,850  -->  00:00:33,810
closes.

11

00:00:33,810  -->  00:00:36,870
Half hour later they lead an investor conference call.

12

00:00:36,980  -->  00:00:38,370
You'll see a webcast.

13

00:00:38,370  -->  00:00:42,930
And you and I can get access to it just like everybody else in the world because it's available free

14

00:00:43,050  -->  00:00:49,620
on the open internet and Investor Relations sets up management presentations at events where to look

15

00:00:49,620  -->  00:00:54,650
at Investor Relations and our case study for the remainder of this course is going to be linked in.

16

00:00:54,810  -->  00:01:00,750
Let's check out linked into Investor Relations Web site and most large publicly traded companies have

17

00:01:00,760  -->  00:01:05,450
superb web sites that have Investor Relations resources for everybody.

18

00:01:05,760  -->  00:01:12,360
And in 2002 a new law was created called Regulation F.D. which means fair disclosure and it's awesome

19

00:01:12,690  -->  00:01:19,170
because everybody gets access to financial information and material information at the exact same time

20

00:01:19,470  -->  00:01:24,570
and that's great for you and me because we have the same access to information that everybody on Wall

21

00:01:24,570  -->  00:01:27,300
Street or in the large mutual funds and hedge funds do.

22

00:01:27,300  -->  00:01:27,970
It's awesome.

23

00:01:28,100  -->  00:01:28,560
It's awesome.

24

00:01:28,560  -->  00:01:30,490
They no longer have the edge on us anymore.

25

00:01:30,690  -->  00:01:36,210
Let's check out linked in business and so we can go through here and learn pretty much everything you

26

00:01:36,210  -->  00:01:37,670
need to know about the company.

27

00:01:38,460  -->  00:01:40,190
Letter about the management team.

28

00:01:40,260  -->  00:01:42,030
They've got a superb management team.

29

00:01:42,030  -->  00:01:43,360
Jeff is awesome.

30

00:01:43,760  -->  00:01:46,230
The investor relations group is amazing there too.

31

00:01:46,240  -->  00:01:49,220
And actually I recommend that you sign up for these as well.

32

00:01:49,230  -->  00:01:51,430
Right you can enter in your e-mail address.

33

00:01:51,540  -->  00:01:56,960
And the second they released something to SCC dot gov which will cover in a couple of lectures.

34

00:01:57,300  -->  00:02:01,610
The second they issue a press release and the second they announce a new event.

35

00:02:01,710  -->  00:02:05,540
You will find out at the exact same second as everybody else.

36

00:02:05,640  -->  00:02:10,800
And so it's always a best practice for you to sign up for e-mail alerts for any company you're looking

37

00:02:10,800  -->  00:02:11,040
at.

38

00:02:11,070  -->  00:02:16,770
And so when I worked in the hedge fund industry I would have 30 or 40 companies e-mail alerts hit me

39

00:02:16,770  -->  00:02:18,490
almost every day or every other day.

40

00:02:18,960  -->  00:02:22,510
OK so you can find out more about the management team here.

41

00:02:22,530  -->  00:02:23,030
Right.

42

00:02:23,310  -->  00:02:27,840
You can learn more about linked and obviously you can find out more information about the board of directors

43

00:02:27,900  -->  00:02:33,670
the Investor Relations team and just F-8 cues are frequently asked questions and this here is Matt Sonnenfeld

44

00:02:33,660  -->  00:02:33,680
.

45

00:02:33,690  -->  00:02:37,470
I think he's actually the best investor relations person on the street.

46

00:02:37,470  -->  00:02:39,900
He also heads up investor education there too he's awesome.

47

00:02:39,930  -->  00:02:41,310
Good guy too.

48

00:02:41,310  -->  00:02:41,890
All right.

49

00:02:41,890  -->  00:02:44,630
So let's see what else we can look into.

50

00:02:44,640  -->  00:02:47,140
So we've looked at the management team a little bit.

51

00:02:47,160  -->  00:02:52,730
You've got upcoming events here and anybody can listen these webcasts.

52

00:02:52,740  -->  00:02:55,150
It's incredible just fill this stuff out.

53

00:02:55,170  -->  00:03:01,440
You don't have to get invited to the Palace Hotel in San Francisco to Washington present you and I have

54

00:03:01,440  -->  00:03:03,590
the same access as everybody else now.

55

00:03:03,600  -->  00:03:04,560
It's awesome.

56

00:03:04,830  -->  00:03:05,580
Ok cool.

57

00:03:05,670  -->  00:03:06,960
And the same with Morgan Stanley.

58

00:03:06,990  -->  00:03:08,140
They had an event right.

59

00:03:08,140  -->  00:03:10,320
They had Keynote with the CEO Jeff Weiner.

60

00:03:10,350  -->  00:03:14,320
You can click here and you can watch it or sign up for it again.

61

00:03:14,360  -->  00:03:14,680
Right.

62

00:03:14,680  -->  00:03:17,320
So pretty cool stuff.

63

00:03:17,340  -->  00:03:17,890
All right.

64

00:03:17,910  -->  00:03:23,520
And you can even look at the presentation from past earnings releases that sort of thing that's pretty

65

00:03:23,520  -->  00:03:24,240
neat printing.

66

00:03:24,270  -->  00:03:28,020
So see what else we have here.

67

00:03:28,020  -->  00:03:31,490
All right so we've got their quarterly numbers here as well.

68

00:03:31,610  -->  00:03:35,080
And so when a company issues earnings.

69

00:03:35,100  -->  00:03:41,850
OK what happens is usually at 4:00 New York time a press release will hit and companies release earnings

70

00:03:42,090  -->  00:03:48,260
four times a year once a quarter and the press release hits the tape and then reads it really fast.

71

00:03:48,390  -->  00:03:53,460
And then about a half hour or so later there is an earnings call which we'll talk about later on in

72

00:03:53,460  -->  00:03:54,570
this course.

73

00:03:54,570  -->  00:03:57,360
Let's just take a quick look here at the press release.

74

00:03:57,420  -->  00:03:58,110
OK.

75

00:03:58,440  -->  00:04:05,970
So LinkedIn release fourth quarter numbers and this is pretty much like all press releases you'll see

76

00:04:06,270  -->  00:04:08,490
they always say really good stuff at the beginning.

77

00:04:08,490  -->  00:04:10,330
They had a great quarter Bob law whatever.

78

00:04:10,380  -->  00:04:11,450
All that good stuff.

79

00:04:11,610  -->  00:04:16,830
And then they'll talk about a couple of cool revenue metrics so here revenue increased 34 percent year

80

00:04:16,830  -->  00:04:17,620
over year.

81

00:04:17,670  -->  00:04:20,380
Right in the quarter to that dollar amount.

82

00:04:20,440  -->  00:04:21,330
Okay.

83

00:04:22,020  -->  00:04:25,980
And then they'll talk about their three revenue line items that they have and we'll go through this

84

00:04:26,010  -->  00:04:28,610
in a lot of detail later on in this course.

85

00:04:28,860  -->  00:04:32,920
So they have three major red line items and we'll talk about that at length later.

86

00:04:33,810  -->  00:04:34,950
And this is important.

87

00:04:35,310  -->  00:04:41,130
They offer something called guidance acads the business outlook where they say while we think in the

88

00:04:41,130  -->  00:04:46,620
first quarter we're in a half revenue in earnings of whatever amount it is and they usually give a range

89

00:04:46,620  -->  00:04:46,860
.

90

00:04:46,860  -->  00:04:47,430
Right.

91

00:04:47,790  -->  00:04:51,030
And then they give guidance sometimes for the full year as well.

92

00:04:51,030  -->  00:04:57,260
And if this guidance is better than the Street expected then the stock goes up and vice versa.

93

00:04:57,270  -->  00:05:01,530
And I think they actually gave poor guidance when they released this earnings result the stock went

94

00:05:01,530  -->  00:05:02,520
down.

95

00:05:02,520  -->  00:05:04,140
I thought it was broken.

96

00:05:04,230  -->  00:05:09,360
A broken stock and not a broken company and I get excited when companies that are incredible secular

97

00:05:09,360  -->  00:05:11,860
growth winners like linked and sell off a lot.

98

00:05:11,880  -->  00:05:14,190
It's always a good opportunity to buy in cash.

99

00:05:14,340  -->  00:05:19,380
And it's interesting because Warren Buffett once said that the New York Stock Exchange is the only store

100

00:05:19,380  -->  00:05:22,350
in the world where consumers sell stuff that goes on sale.

101

00:05:22,550  -->  00:05:25,710
And so what happens is you have prepared remarks from the CEO.

102

00:05:25,800  -->  00:05:26,070
Right.

103

00:05:26,070  -->  00:05:29,510
And then the CFO says a couple of cool things about the quarter.

104

00:05:29,880  -->  00:05:33,750
And then what happens is way way down here they have all the financials.

105

00:05:34,270  -->  00:05:36,300
And so we're viewed how this stuff works.

106

00:05:36,300  -->  00:05:40,840
In previous sections in this course here is the balance sheet.

107

00:05:40,860  -->  00:05:41,420
Right.

108

00:05:41,460  -->  00:05:47,010
And they always provide it on a quarterly basis and they provide a couple of other balance sheets from

109

00:05:47,250  -->  00:05:51,960
past periods as well so you can compare quarter over quarter moves like here over here.

110

00:05:52,110  -->  00:05:57,330
Or you can even compare your year moves like here over here like look at that cash increase by that

111

00:05:57,330  -->  00:05:59,150
amount year over year in cash.

112

00:05:59,480  -->  00:06:03,270
And so this is the entire balance sheet.

113

00:06:03,450  -->  00:06:08,400
And then here we have the statement of operations and this is basically an income statement.

114

00:06:08,410  -->  00:06:13,680
Can they get revenue the top and they've got all the expenses just like we covered.

115

00:06:13,680  -->  00:06:14,550
Right.

116

00:06:14,670  -->  00:06:20,880
And then there's noncash stuff like depreciation cash and then they have information on the cash flow

117

00:06:20,880  -->  00:06:22,870
statement right here.

118

00:06:23,450  -->  00:06:28,520
And so just like we created in the last section we start off with net income right.

119

00:06:28,530  -->  00:06:32,810
This is cash flow from operations net income from the income statement and then we add back all this

120

00:06:32,850  -->  00:06:38,250
other stuff including this which is from the income statement and a bunch of other things as well.

121

00:06:38,250  -->  00:06:41,360
Most of them are from the balance sheet of cash.

122

00:06:41,580  -->  00:06:46,910
And then they have financing activities investing activities just like we talked about before.

123

00:06:48,330  -->  00:06:53,700
And then they have supplemental information and this is really important because they only gave us total

124

00:06:53,700  -->  00:06:58,710
revenue up above in the income statement but here it's cool because they are now giving us a number

125

00:06:58,710  -->  00:07:00,500
of different revenue line that it is.

126

00:07:00,600  -->  00:07:05,130
So that total revenue number is broken down into a couple of different sections.

127

00:07:05,160  -->  00:07:05,700
Okay.

128

00:07:05,940  -->  00:07:09,700
Right here they have all their major revenue line items.

129

00:07:09,880  -->  00:07:12,210
And then here they have it by geography.

130

00:07:12,210  -->  00:07:12,670
Okay.

131

00:07:12,840  -->  00:07:17,850
And sometimes I don't know if I'm going to use this stuff in my model but I put in my model anyway just

132

00:07:17,850  -->  00:07:19,680
in case I use it in the future.

133

00:07:19,770  -->  00:07:25,080
Can and then have revenue by channel field sales versus online sales and these are basically quota carrying

134

00:07:25,080  -->  00:07:25,870
sales reps.

135

00:07:25,950  -->  00:07:26,130
Right.

136

00:07:26,130  -->  00:07:27,760
They have a quota each quarter.

137

00:07:28,000  -->  00:07:30,780
And then these might be telephone sales people.

138

00:07:31,240  -->  00:07:36,630
And then there's something called gap in non-HD gap in the financial statements we created so far at

139

00:07:36,630  -->  00:07:40,020
least the income that we created so far was a gap.

140

00:07:40,150  -->  00:07:43,620
Okay and I'll explain what this means in more detail in future lessons.

141

00:07:43,620  -->  00:07:45,860
But let me mention it quickly here.

142

00:07:46,350  -->  00:07:50,120
So gap is generally accepted accounting principles.

143

00:07:50,190  -->  00:07:50,780
Okay.

144

00:07:51,030  -->  00:07:57,330
And it includes every item cash items non-cash items like depreciation etc. and then there's something

145

00:07:57,330  -->  00:08:03,060
called non-GAAP and non-GAAP is another set of financial statements that's easier to understand than

146

00:08:03,060  -->  00:08:03,520
the income.

147

00:08:03,530  -->  00:08:10,890
We looked at because non-GAAP only has stuff that is cash base so depreciation would not be included

148

00:08:10,890  -->  00:08:17,460
in non-GAAP and it only includes stuff that's ongoing So if there's a one time legal issue that was

149

00:08:17,460  -->  00:08:23,880
in one quarter non-GAAP wouldn't really have that because non-GAAP is used by many Wall Street analysts

150

00:08:23,880  -->  00:08:26,450
to model recurring stuff longer term.

151

00:08:26,460  -->  00:08:33,040
And again we'll come and see it later but this year is just a table telling you how to reconcile between

152

00:08:33,030  -->  00:08:35,060
the non-GAAP and the gap.

153

00:08:35,390  -->  00:08:42,840
And so the way you get non-GAAP in this case here is you take the accounting earnings and then you add

154

00:08:42,850  -->  00:08:44,730
back stuff that was noncash.

155

00:08:44,740  -->  00:08:44,970
Right.

156

00:08:44,970  -->  00:08:50,550
So if you gave employee stock based compensation that's not really a cash based line item.

157

00:08:50,910  -->  00:08:56,350
And the same thing goes with not cash other stuff like depreciation etc. We covered that already.

158

00:08:56,410  -->  00:08:56,880
Correct.

159

00:08:56,940  -->  00:09:01,970
And then at the bottom here of the press release they say hey we're going to have our results webcast

160

00:09:01,990  -->  00:09:04,230
in conference call very soon blah blah.

161

00:09:04,240  -->  00:09:07,990
So it looks like it was access when he was an hour after the market closed that day.

162

00:09:08,180  -->  00:09:08,480
OK.

163

00:09:08,500  -->  00:09:14,370
That's 2 p.m. San Francisco Temperatures 5 p.m. New York time which is an hour after 4:00 p.m. and then

164

00:09:14,380  -->  00:09:16,920
they say here put this on your radar screen.

165

00:09:16,920  -->  00:09:22,660
We're going to have pretty cool events that you can come to or you can listen to over the Internet.

166

00:09:22,840  -->  00:09:27,260
And then there's a bunch of legal disclosures and if you have additional questions you can contact LinkedIn

167

00:09:27,270  -->  00:09:28,140
investor relations.

168

00:09:28,140  -->  00:09:31,510
There are Alington press right there as well.

169

00:09:31,850  -->  00:09:37,440
So let's see what else they have when it comes to financials interactive statements.

170

00:09:37,500  -->  00:09:38,260
Looks cool.

171

00:09:38,460  -->  00:09:39,540
Ok cool.

172

00:09:39,540  -->  00:09:46,300
So what you can do here is you can look at every line item in all their financial statements and there

173

00:09:46,300  -->  00:09:47,860
are cool charts that pop up.

174

00:09:47,860  -->  00:09:50,730
I think you know the rights of sales and marketing.

175

00:09:50,730  -->  00:09:55,350
Remember the best analysts in the world look for trends in the data you know learn to read financial

176

00:09:55,360  -->  00:09:56,970
statements like a good book.

177

00:09:57,100  -->  00:10:03,290
And here we have sales and marketing trends over the past several quarters whatever it is.

178

00:10:04,020  -->  00:10:08,260
And this is all the raw data here a lot of times it's easier to look at charts because you can pick

179

00:10:08,250  -->  00:10:09,020
up trends.

180

00:10:09,220  -->  00:10:09,530
Right.

181

00:10:09,530  -->  00:10:16,830
So looks like all their expenses are increasing revenue is to see revenue here revenues increase and

182

00:10:16,840  -->  00:10:18,070
of course.

183

00:10:18,720  -->  00:10:19,550
Okay.

184

00:10:19,920  -->  00:10:24,870
And then oh cool this is new you can build the chart can actually map out everything here.

185

00:10:24,930  -->  00:10:30,270
I usually do it directly in Microsoft Excel but you can actually create them here directly.

186

00:10:30,270  -->  00:10:31,960
That's pretty cool.

187

00:10:32,160  -->  00:10:37,770
There must be no cash flow as well and an earnings per share in diluted earnings per share just means

188

00:10:37,860  -->  00:10:39,030
non gap.

189

00:10:39,030  -->  00:10:40,870
And again we'll cover that more detail.

190

00:10:41,250  -->  00:10:43,090
And this is what I love right here.

191

00:10:43,090  -->  00:10:45,500
You can export the financials directly.

192

00:10:45,730  -->  00:10:51,280
OK so that you don't have to go and create the financial statements from scratch and it's pretty pretty

193

00:10:51,270  -->  00:10:52,730
good idea for you.

194

00:10:53,040  -->  00:10:56,720
Well let me just pull this into view.

195

00:10:57,160  -->  00:10:58,950
You know you've got a lot of great information here
