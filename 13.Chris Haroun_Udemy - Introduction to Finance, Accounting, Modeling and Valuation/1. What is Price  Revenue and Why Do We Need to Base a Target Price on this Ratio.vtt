00:00:01.980  -->  00:00:04.700
Let's talk about valuing companies using price to revenue.

2

00:00:04.810  -->  00:00:10.470
OK so by the end of this section you'll understand what price to revenue is why it's important value

3

00:00:10.470  -->  00:00:12.960
a company and how the process works.

4

00:00:13.110  -->  00:00:13.840
OK.

5

00:00:14.130  -->  00:00:21.660
So how should we value companies that are going public but aren't yet profitable like Air B and B or

6

00:00:21.780  -->  00:00:23.900
snap chat or super great companies.

7

00:00:23.910  -->  00:00:25.200
But there's no profits.

8

00:00:25.200  -->  00:00:27.250
How do we value them.

9

00:00:27.270  -->  00:00:30.950
There's no cashflow there's no earnings but they have revenue.

10

00:00:31.080  -->  00:00:37.040
So the answer is price to revenue price to revenue is a great valuation technique.

11

00:00:37.170  -->  00:00:39.350
When a company is not profitable.

12

00:00:39.460  -->  00:00:40.350
OK.

13

00:00:41.130  -->  00:00:46.530
If you think logically about price to revenue it really is the same thing as market capitalization divided

14

00:00:46.530  -->  00:00:47.110
by revenue.

15

00:00:47.140  -->  00:00:48.440
Right it's just a price.

16

00:00:48.510  -->  00:00:49.030
Right.

17

00:00:49.320  -->  00:00:50.300
OK.

18

00:00:50.610  -->  00:00:57.060
So let's talk about market cap to revenue or Prester revenue for Twitter and Facebook.

19

00:00:57.560  -->  00:00:57.990
OK.

20

00:00:58.020  -->  00:01:02.130
Of course we'll be using Yahoo Finance which is awesome go to finest yahoo dot com.

21

00:01:02.300  -->  00:01:02.840
Right.

22

00:01:03.240  -->  00:01:08.900
And here we can get the market cap for these companies which is the price right and the revenue.

23

00:01:09.510  -->  00:01:12.750
And as you can see there's no earnings for Twitter.

24

00:01:12.750  -->  00:01:15.160
So how are we to compare these two companies.

25

00:01:15.810  -->  00:01:20.120
Well we've got the market cap and we've got the revenue.

26

00:01:20.180  -->  00:01:24.630
Okay let's go into finance dot yahoo dot com and get the revenue for both those companies.

27

00:01:24.630  -->  00:01:25.800
All right let's grab it here.

28

00:01:25.800  -->  00:01:26.820
There you go.

29

00:01:26.880  -->  00:01:31.460
You have revenue for both companies here and we're to take price to our revenue or the market catamite

30

00:01:31.480  -->  00:01:32.110
by revenue.

31

00:01:32.310  -->  00:01:34.170
Okay let's do it.

32

00:01:34.170  -->  00:01:34.440
All right.

33

00:01:34.440  -->  00:01:39.850
So Twitter is five times revenue and Facebook is 18 times revenue.

34

00:01:39.990  -->  00:01:41.880
Facebook's a much better company.

35

00:01:41.890  -->  00:01:47.010
Obviously Twitter's had a lot of management issues lately and turnover and people are questioning the

36

00:01:47.010  -->  00:01:47.990
business about a little bit.

37

00:01:48.000  -->  00:01:49.090
I think it's a great company.

38

00:01:49.320  -->  00:01:49.560
OK.

39

00:01:49.560  -->  00:01:51.650
So there you go.

40

00:01:51.780  -->  00:01:53.850
So be uber.

41

00:01:53.910  -->  00:01:57.380
Snapchat should trade I guess closer to one of these.

42

00:01:57.540  -->  00:02:02.340
But because those companies are growing faster than Facebook I would say that they should trade to the

43

00:02:02.340  -->  00:02:05.100
right of Facebook or at a higher price revenue multiple.

44

00:02:05.120  -->  00:02:05.510
Right.

45

00:02:05.680  -->  00:02:09.780
So it's debatable it's debatable but this is a cool methodology to use if you don't know what earnings

46

00:02:09.780  -->  00:02:10.630
or cash flow is
