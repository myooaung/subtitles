1

00:00:00,480  -->  00:00:06,370
It's really important to do your own due diligence on companies meaning try the product if you can.

2

00:00:06,480  -->  00:00:12,810
And so let's do this with linked and let's do advanced search and let's search for people that work

3

00:00:12,870  -->  00:00:13,830
at Google.

4

00:00:13,830  -->  00:00:15,550
See if we know anybody there.

5

00:00:15,630  -->  00:00:19,600
And so there's three red line items when it comes to in.

6

00:00:20,040  -->  00:00:25,890
And the first line item we look at is the premium subscriptions which basically gives the opportunity

7

00:00:25,890  -->  00:00:28,190
to send messages.

8

00:00:28,290  -->  00:00:32,250
The next one is talent solutions so let's look into this.

9

00:00:32,250  -->  00:00:33,410
Let's check this out.

10

00:00:33,420  -->  00:00:40,590
It looks like this is for our professionals or human resources professionals to be able to find candidates

11

00:00:40,650  -->  00:00:42,490
or post candidates online.

12

00:00:43,080  -->  00:00:47,250
And you can get a free trial as well I do this all the time when I'm doing due diligence on companies

13

00:00:47,260  -->  00:00:47,800
.

14

00:00:47,800  -->  00:00:48,960
Oh good question Mo.

15

00:00:49,020  -->  00:00:50,190
What is linked in marketing.

16

00:00:50,190  -->  00:00:50,810
Let's check it out.

17

00:00:50,820  -->  00:00:55,990
Well when you go to Linked In There are commercials on the sides of the pages sometimes.

18

00:00:56,050  -->  00:01:00,990
So what I did was for one of my courses an entire MBA and one course I tried to promote it.

19

00:01:01,170  -->  00:01:08,250
And you can set the audience so in this case I said a bunch of states and then I also explained what

20

00:01:08,250  -->  00:01:12,690
industries to use or to target and the age group is actually pretty powerful.

21

00:01:12,720  -->  00:01:13,750
Do they have competitors.

22

00:01:13,770  -->  00:01:15,810
Good question.

23

00:01:15,870  -->  00:01:21,070
We've covered this before but just go to as you see talk of do a search on the 10-K.

24

00:01:21,300  -->  00:01:26,610
Open up that document and just search for the word competitor and then you can just search through the

25

00:01:26,610  -->  00:01:31,440
rest of the document to see who their competitors really are.

26

00:01:31,440  -->  00:01:36,730
Let's see if Facebook really has a competitive product.

27

00:01:37,140  -->  00:01:40,070
So let's just do a search to see if they have competition.

28

00:01:40,110  -->  00:01:43,980
And here's a force article talking about Facebook at work.

29

00:01:43,980  -->  00:01:48,750
I know there is a plug in for Facebook years ago called branch in I believe that was a dud.

30

00:01:48,750  -->  00:01:50,280
They try to compete.

31

00:01:50,280  -->  00:01:57,780
But the problem with Facebook is that it's just not as trustworthy as linked in as OK so looks like

32

00:01:57,780  -->  00:02:01,380
there's a competitor here called for a day of dot com.

33

00:02:01,410  -->  00:02:02,860
Here we go.

34

00:02:03,060  -->  00:02:05,190
Let's check it out for the group.

35

00:02:05,190  -->  00:02:05,460
All right.

36

00:02:05,460  -->  00:02:08,670
So I've got 720000 recruiters and professionals.

37

00:02:08,670  -->  00:02:14,460
We can try it and we can sign up for free and let me sign up here and so funny I told you I don't trust

38

00:02:14,460  -->  00:02:17,250
Facebook privacy and yet here I go I'm signing up.

39

00:02:17,370  -->  00:02:18,470
Anyway I think you get the idea.

40

00:02:18,480  -->  00:02:22,300
Just trying to test as many competing products as you can.
