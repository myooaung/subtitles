00:00:02.430  -->  00:00:07.590
Let's talk about discounted cash flow or DCF valuation.

2

00:00:07.590  -->  00:00:13.830
So by in this section you will understand DCF and why it's important to valuing a company and how the

3

00:00:13.830  -->  00:00:15.860
entire process works.

4

00:00:15.870  -->  00:00:18.890
OK so let's assume you have $5 today.

5

00:00:18.930  -->  00:00:19.640
OK.

6

00:00:20.040  -->  00:00:22.340
That's literally a $5 bill from Canada.

7

00:00:22.350  -->  00:00:26.900
How awesome is it that we have kids playing hockey on the back of our currency represent.

8

00:00:26.940  -->  00:00:27.440
Love it.

9

00:00:27.630  -->  00:00:29.730
OK so that's $5 today.

10

00:00:29.730  -->  00:00:30.750
All right.

11

00:00:30.750  -->  00:00:35.420
And we have five dollars in 10 years and that's the other side of our $5 bill.

12

00:00:35.580  -->  00:00:38.840
And you know God bless Leonard Nimoy Spock.

13

00:00:38.880  -->  00:00:40.090
Right.

14

00:00:40.230  -->  00:00:43.350
But he actually looked a lot like one of our former prime ministers.

15

00:00:43.350  -->  00:00:46.230
And so a lot of people and you can Google this is pretty funny.

16

00:00:46.320  -->  00:00:49.320
Have been drawing Spock on our money.

17

00:00:49.380  -->  00:00:49.780
Right.

18

00:00:49.890  -->  00:00:50.810
OK cool.

19

00:00:51.210  -->  00:00:55.010
So this is worth five bucks today.

20

00:00:55.320  -->  00:00:58.930
OK so what is Spock $5 worth today.

21

00:00:58.980  -->  00:00:59.430
OK.

22

00:00:59.550  -->  00:01:02.650
What is that five dollar bill in ten years worth today.

23

00:01:02.730  -->  00:01:03.210
OK.

24

00:01:03.450  -->  00:01:06.450
So let's let's try to find a valuation for Spock today.

25

00:01:07.050  -->  00:01:10.920
OK so Spock is worth five bucks in ten years right.

26

00:01:10.920  -->  00:01:11.670
That $5 bill.

27

00:01:11.670  -->  00:01:13.040
So what's it worth today.

28

00:01:13.410  -->  00:01:22.620
Well if we assume the interest rate is 7 percent over time just accept it and we can discount Spock

29

00:01:22.710  -->  00:01:24.050
into today's money.

30

00:01:24.570  -->  00:01:31.890
And the way you discount is you divide your dollar figure five bucks in this case by one plus the interest

31

00:01:31.890  -->  00:01:35.700
rate to the power of the number of years you want to discount.

32

00:01:35.700  -->  00:01:43.350
So if we had $5 Spock given to us next year the value of $5 sparked today would be $5 divided by one

33

00:01:43.440  -->  00:01:45.430
plus 7 percent the power of one.

34

00:01:45.930  -->  00:01:51.400
But because we want to get $5 Spock quickly I'm saying this because we want to get $5 Spock.

35

00:01:51.600  -->  00:01:52.580
In today's terms.

36

00:01:52.680  -->  00:01:57.690
Ten years from now today we're going to discount him by 10 years.

37

00:01:57.730  -->  00:01:58.330
OK.

38

00:01:58.590  -->  00:02:01.850
So that's five bucks divided by one plus seven of the power of ten.

39

00:02:02.130  -->  00:02:02.370
OK.

40

00:02:02.400  -->  00:02:08.460
And that's discounting that money into today's terms.

41

00:02:08.460  -->  00:02:12.210
So discounting to today is the simple formula.

42

00:02:12.210  -->  00:02:12.420
Right.

43

00:02:12.420  -->  00:02:16.820
So in this case $5 Spock divided by one plus seven percent insures the power of 10.

44

00:02:16.950  -->  00:02:17.770
OK.

45

00:02:18.780  -->  00:02:24.840
So money in the future divided by one plus the interest rate to the power of time the number of years

46

00:02:25.200  -->  00:02:27.070
is how you discount to today.

47

00:02:27.090  -->  00:02:28.190
OK.

48

00:02:28.290  -->  00:02:29.550
Pretty simple.

49

00:02:29.550  -->  00:02:29.720
All right.

50

00:02:29.730  -->  00:02:30.750
Let's file that away.

51

00:02:30.750  -->  00:02:33.770
We'll ignore that for now and let's build the rest of this.

52

00:02:33.930  -->  00:02:34.530
OK.

53

00:02:34.740  -->  00:02:39.140
So how much money do we put in our pocket every single year.

54

00:02:39.210  -->  00:02:40.260
Right.

55

00:02:40.260  -->  00:02:47.580
Well we know that net income minus money we spend on stuff is supposed to be what we put in our pocket

56

00:02:47.580  -->  00:02:48.120
every year.

57

00:02:48.180  -->  00:02:48.860
Right.

58

00:02:49.320  -->  00:02:55.680
So the way it works with companies is net income minus money they spend investing in the company is

59

00:02:55.680  -->  00:02:57.620
how much money they put in their pocket every year.

60

00:02:57.690  -->  00:02:59.190
OK. stay with me on this.

61

00:02:59.470  -->  00:03:00.200
OK.

62

00:03:00.210  -->  00:03:05.740
So net income minus factories and equipment.

63

00:03:05.820  -->  00:03:08.150
Right Stuff you spend in factories and equipment.

64

00:03:08.250  -->  00:03:10.650
Right.

65

00:03:10.950  -->  00:03:16.770
Which is the same thing as saying net income minus capital expenditures to net income modest cap ex

66

00:03:16.770  -->  00:03:17.670
same thing.

67

00:03:17.670  -->  00:03:19.620
Wait for it.

68

00:03:19.740  -->  00:03:27.710
So you take net income and you subtract non-cash stuff and then you deduct what you invested in like

69

00:03:27.720  -->  00:03:29.290
Cap X..

70

00:03:30.480  -->  00:03:31.960
That's called operating cash flow.

71

00:03:32.370  -->  00:03:38.340
So maybe that from a casual statement I bring cash for minus cap x is free cash flow.

72

00:03:38.550  -->  00:03:39.480
Okay.

73

00:03:40.010  -->  00:03:46.500
And so cash in our pocket each year it equals operating cash flow which is the first section of of the

74

00:03:46.500  -->  00:03:49.840
cash flow statement minus CapEx.

75

00:03:50.010  -->  00:03:52.590
Take the first section again of the cash flow statement.

76

00:03:52.620  -->  00:03:55.610
Operating cash flow minus CapEx.

77

00:03:55.860  -->  00:03:56.430
Right.

78

00:03:56.820  -->  00:03:58.640
And that's going to give you cash flow.

79

00:03:59.010  -->  00:04:02.800
And for some reason they actually call it free cash flow.

80

00:04:03.780  -->  00:04:04.050
All right.

81

00:04:04.050  -->  00:04:10.110
So operating cash flow is right here right remember we got that on the linked in cash flow statement

82

00:04:10.320  -->  00:04:11.020
right.

83

00:04:11.580  -->  00:04:16.500
And then you deduct CapEx which is property or plants or equipment.

84

00:04:16.500  -->  00:04:16.700
Right.

85

00:04:16.700  -->  00:04:21.550
Really understand finance don't memorize it understand it and then you remember it.

86

00:04:21.690  -->  00:04:22.160
Okay.

87

00:04:22.370  -->  00:04:31.200
So operating cash flow minus cap x cap their IGA operating cash flow minus cap ex there it is.

88

00:04:31.200  -->  00:04:32.370
That equals free cash flow.

89

00:04:32.370  -->  00:04:34.060
Now you see why we put that at the bottom there.

90

00:04:34.080  -->  00:04:35.480
It's a simple calculation.

91

00:04:35.480  -->  00:04:35.990
Okay.

92

00:04:36.240  -->  00:04:38.170
All right let's stop ignoring the blue box.

93

00:04:38.190  -->  00:04:38.970
OK.

94

00:04:38.970  -->  00:04:42.270
So remember we discounted Spock from 10 years to today.

95

00:04:42.420  -->  00:04:45.770
Well we got to do that with every single year of free capital Burlington as well.

96

00:04:45.840  -->  00:04:46.340
Okay.

97

00:04:46.530  -->  00:04:48.480
And that's how we find out the value of the company.

98

00:04:48.480  -->  00:04:48.720
Right.

99

00:04:48.720  -->  00:04:54.480
So if you take the future cash that any company makes and discounted today that's the value the company

100

00:04:54.710  -->  00:04:55.280
got.

101

00:04:55.610  -->  00:04:56.540
So let's do it.

102

00:04:56.580  -->  00:05:00.430
Let's discounts all those free cash flows to today.

103

00:05:01.170  -->  00:05:06.910
We'll discount that over the number years in the future it is same with every single year.

104

00:05:06.960  -->  00:05:07.970
Right.

105

00:05:08.190  -->  00:05:11.020
There you go.

106

00:05:11.550  -->  00:05:14.610
And this is basically just like the spot example there we go.

107

00:05:14.720  -->  00:05:17.690
We get our dollar amounts.

108

00:05:19.140  -->  00:05:24.360
All right just simple find the math for you here and you can always speed this up or slow it down and

109

00:05:24.360  -->  00:05:26.490
you to me if you wanted to.

110

00:05:27.720  -->  00:05:28.460
All right cool.

111

00:05:28.620  -->  00:05:30.540
Here's a better way to do it though.

112

00:05:30.630  -->  00:05:34.410
Now that you know how to discount free cash flow I wanted to a trick.

113

00:05:34.410  -->  00:05:35.760
This is awesome.

114

00:05:36.060  -->  00:05:39.270
In Excel there is a formula called net present value.

115

00:05:39.300  -->  00:05:42.090
What's the present value of those future cash flows to it.

116

00:05:42.090  -->  00:05:45.060
And you just type in Excel equals NPV right.

117

00:05:45.060  -->  00:05:47.280
Open brackets and Excel is awesome.

118

00:05:47.280  -->  00:05:48.580
It's going to say what's the rate.

119

00:05:48.690  -->  00:05:49.080
Right.

120

00:05:49.080  -->  00:05:54.270
You'll go and click on the rate 7 percent or whatever it is and then what you do is you hit come and

121

00:05:54.270  -->  00:06:00.360
Ill say what cash flows and you'll go and highlight all the cash flows and then hit enter and you've

122

00:06:00.360  -->  00:06:02.430
got discounted cash flow to today.

123

00:06:02.430  -->  00:06:04.630
How awesome is that.

124

00:06:05.970  -->  00:06:10.650
So if we take the net present value right and we put 7 percent there.

125

00:06:10.720  -->  00:06:11.360
Right.

126

00:06:11.940  -->  00:06:13.650
And those are the cash flows right there.

127

00:06:13.680  -->  00:06:17.070
Then we get the same answer and that is cash flow
