00:00:01.890  -->  00:00:06.050
Let's talk about price to earnings now which is my favorite valuation methodology.

2

00:00:06.090  -->  00:00:11.630
So by the end of this section you will understand what PE is or price to earnings. Why it's important

3

00:00:11.650  -->  00:00:14.540
value a company and how the process works.

4

00:00:14.560  -->  00:00:21.960
OK so price to earnings is very similar to price to revenue except the company is profitable and you

5

00:00:21.960  -->  00:00:28.020
really factor in the growth rate more often when you do see them when you do price to revenue and that's

6

00:00:28.020  -->  00:00:30.140
called a PEG ratio or PDG.

7

00:00:30.210  -->  00:00:31.770
I'll show you in a second.

8

00:00:31.990  -->  00:00:32.310
Okay.

9

00:00:32.310  -->  00:00:37.880
So a couple of the company using trades on a P that's in line with its growth rate.

10

00:00:37.980  -->  00:00:39.870
Okay that's just the way it works.

11

00:00:39.960  -->  00:00:46.860
And so an example is that a company that has earnings growing at 20 percent per year usually trades

12

00:00:46.860  -->  00:00:50.130
at a price earnings multiple or a P E multiple of 20 times earnings.

13

00:00:50.130  -->  00:00:50.960
Right.

14

00:00:51.030  -->  00:00:52.910
Close enough.

15

00:00:53.010  -->  00:00:58.050
It's a company that has earnings growing at only 10 percent per year.

16

00:00:58.200  -->  00:01:00.150
Trades at 10 times earnings.

17

00:01:00.150  -->  00:01:00.670
OK.

18

00:01:00.870  -->  00:01:06.120
So it trades at a discounted price earnings valuation because it's growing at half the growth of the

19

00:01:06.120  -->  00:01:07.490
other company listed above there.

20

00:01:07.730  -->  00:01:11.500
So should trade at a 50 percent discount because growth is 50 percent lower.

21

00:01:11.910  -->  00:01:12.340
All right.

22

00:01:12.420  -->  00:01:12.890
Great.

23

00:01:12.900  -->  00:01:16.650
So the stock market usually trades around 15 times earnings.

24

00:01:16.650  -->  00:01:17.100
OK.

25

00:01:17.130  -->  00:01:22.830
Around that amount and that's because the stock market usually has earnings growing at around 15 percent

26

00:01:22.830  -->  00:01:23.210
.

27

00:01:23.220  -->  00:01:26.150
This methodology is very easy.

28

00:01:26.160  -->  00:01:32.250
OK so if a company misses earnings estimates by say 20 percent like say they report earnings after hours

29

00:01:32.700  -->  00:01:36.510
and they missed by 20 percent the stock usually gaps down 20 percent.

30

00:01:36.810  -->  00:01:39.150
There's a gap in the chart and vice versa.

31

00:01:39.810  -->  00:01:45.990
Ok so price earnings is the same thing as market capitalization divided by net income.

32

00:01:47.390  -->  00:01:55.530
And a PEG ratio as PDG or price earnings to growth measures that P relative to its growth rate.

33

00:01:55.650  -->  00:01:56.230
OK.

34

00:01:56.460  -->  00:02:03.560
So stocks that usually have a PEG ratio below one are cheap and stocks have a PEG ratio above two are

35

00:02:03.570  -->  00:02:04.580
expensive.

36

00:02:04.770  -->  00:02:08.090
And it all depends on what market environment we're in.

37

00:02:09.000  -->  00:02:16.200
So a company that trades at 20 times earnings right and has earnings growing at 20 percent has a peg

38

00:02:16.230  -->  00:02:17.420
of one times.

39

00:02:17.450  -->  00:02:26.280
OK that's good value and a company that has that is it 20 times earnings growth double that or 40 percent

40

00:02:26.520  -->  00:02:29.590
trades at a price earnings to growth rate a point five times.

41

00:02:29.700  -->  00:02:31.710
And this is often a bargain right.

42

00:02:31.710  -->  00:02:35.730
Usually a good buy idea.

43

00:02:35.880  -->  00:02:43.470
Now a company that trades at 20 times earnings and has a growth rate of 10 percent is expensive right

44

00:02:43.470  -->  00:02:43.740
.

45

00:02:43.740  -->  00:02:45.060
Is that a peg of two.

46

00:02:45.150  -->  00:02:48.150
And quite often hedge funds look to short this type of company
