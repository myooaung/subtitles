00:00:02.880  -->  00:00:07.990
Let's talk about the balance sheet by the end of this section you'll understand why a balance sheet

2

00:00:08.040  -->  00:00:12.810
is very very important and it's crucial that you understand how to analyze that balance sheet so that

3

00:00:12.810  -->  00:00:16.560
it'll make much more sense to you when we create financial models.

4

00:00:16.720  -->  00:00:21.810
And I mentioned the same thing in the income statement section and what we're modeling our balance sheet

5

00:00:21.810  -->  00:00:27.660
you'll see in a couple of sections from now what happens is most items are quite simply a percentage

6

00:00:27.690  -->  00:00:28.490
of revenue.

7

00:00:28.500  -->  00:00:29.530
So let's get started.

8

00:00:29.880  -->  00:00:33.510
So in this section I'll talk about why they call a balance sheet.

9

00:00:33.510  -->  00:00:34.950
Both sides have to equal each other.

10

00:00:34.950  -->  00:00:38.420
You'll see it'll make sense in terms of why do we do a balance sheet.

11

00:00:38.410  -->  00:00:43.230
Well similar to why we need to create an income statement if we don't create a balance sheet and forecast

12

00:00:43.230  -->  00:00:43.580
it.

13

00:00:43.680  -->  00:00:49.170
It's harder to come up with a target price meaning what is our company worth and in terms of how we're

14

00:00:49.170  -->  00:00:54.000
going to do this well we're going to go through an x an Excel example and this will make a lot of sense

15

00:00:54.000  -->  00:00:55.070
to you very soon.

16

00:00:55.070  -->  00:00:58.270
And so there's so many different moving pieces when you're creating a model.

17

00:00:58.470  -->  00:01:04.860
There's the income statement the balance sheet the cash flow statement drivers assumptions that sort

18

00:01:04.860  -->  00:01:05.590
of thing.

19

00:01:05.970  -->  00:01:09.260
This will all make perfect sense to you in a couple of sections.

20

00:01:09.300  -->  00:01:10.410
So let's start with the Belge
