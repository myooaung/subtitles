And what you're going to do is you're just going to paste them into these sections here and this one

00:00:20.160  -->  00:00:21.370
is a little bit different actually.

00:00:21.510  -->  00:00:26.220
What I want you to do is I want to tell me where you got this information from.

00:00:26.220  -->  00:00:28.960
OK was it the income statement or the balance sheet.

8

00:00:29.010  -->  00:00:29.440
OK.

00:00:29.550  -->  00:00:32.070
And when you're done please look at the answers here.

00:00:32.070  -->  00:00:33.870
