00:00:04.390  -->  00:00:09.450
Data sources for our model where we get the information from well by the end of this section you will

2

00:00:09.450  -->  00:00:10.960
understand where to get information.

3

00:00:10.980  -->  00:00:17.520
They'll help you build rock solid Austin financial goals where we look at three resources too and a

4

00:00:17.520  -->  00:00:18.440
bonus one.

5

00:00:18.840  -->  00:00:21.580
The first resource is Investor Relations.

6

00:00:21.600  -->  00:00:26.670
Every publicly traded company has to disclose a lot of information on their websites and their Web sites

7

00:00:26.730  -->  00:00:28.740
are called Investor Relations Web sites.

8

00:00:28.740  -->  00:00:29.200
I'll show you.

9

00:00:29.210  -->  00:00:30.500
It will make much more sense.

10

00:00:31.020  -->  00:00:32.960
And we'll also go to FCC dot gov.

11

00:00:32.970  -->  00:00:38.160
The FCC is an awesome resource K that stands for the Securities Exchange Commission and they set this

12

00:00:38.160  -->  00:00:38.430
law.

13

00:00:38.430  -->  00:00:43.650
That means that all companies that are publicly traded have to disclose information at the same time

14

00:00:43.650  -->  00:00:44.740
to all investors.

15

00:00:44.760  -->  00:00:50.130
So you and I have the same access to information that this huge mutual funds and hedge funds do.

16

00:00:50.180  -->  00:00:50.550
OK.

17

00:00:50.580  -->  00:00:54.100
In fact timing wise we get access to it at the exact same second.

18

00:00:54.150  -->  00:00:55.540
It's a beautiful thing.

19

00:00:55.920  -->  00:00:59.740
And the third resource we're going to talk about is one that's near and dear to me.

20

00:00:59.920  -->  00:01:02.290
I used to spend thousands of dollars every year.

21

00:01:02.400  -->  00:01:02.690
Right.

22

00:01:02.700  -->  00:01:07.680
Actually every month right for my hedge fund Amite my analysts for Bloomberg access I pay thousands

23

00:01:07.680  -->  00:01:08.340
of dollars.

24

00:01:08.340  -->  00:01:09.220
What a waste.

25

00:01:09.510  -->  00:01:15.690
It was a waste because you can get most of that for free from finance at yahoo dot com and I will show

26

00:01:15.690  -->  00:01:16.030
you.

27

00:01:16.110  -->  00:01:21.540
I know it sounds crazy but all this information that I can be sharing with you you can get for free

28

00:01:21.550  -->  00:01:21.710
.

29

00:01:21.870  -->  00:01:27.660
You don't have to pay for anything in terms of why we're doing this well quite simply so we can forecast

30

00:01:27.660  -->  00:01:32.460
the future so we can forecast what we think financial statements will look like in the future how we

31

00:01:32.460  -->  00:01:32.960
can do this.

32

00:01:32.970  -->  00:01:35.990
Well you're going to have a couple of mall exercises.

33

00:01:36.240  -->  00:01:40.860
I'm also going to go through linked in in detail to a company I've always loved and I created a gazillion

34

00:01:40.860  -->  00:01:46.400
financial statements for this course and we're going to analyze the heck out of LinkedIn as well.
