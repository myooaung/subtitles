1

00:00:00,450  -->  00:00:03,320
All right this is my favorite part valuation.

2

00:00:03,360  -->  00:00:05,060
I absolutely love it.

3

00:00:05,340  -->  00:00:10,350
And you need to know what kind of an investor you are though or what kind of investor your clients are

4

00:00:10,350  -->  00:00:10,370
.

5

00:00:10,370  -->  00:00:13,940
And quite often they're quite different from what you are.

6

00:00:14,350  -->  00:00:17,360
And so let's look at two real examples here.

7

00:00:17,360  -->  00:00:24,390
You've got General Electric I'm one in the spectrum and Tesla on the other end and General Electric

8

00:00:24,480  -->  00:00:30,570
is for value investors meaning investors that like to get a dividend yield and buy stuff that's relatively

9

00:00:30,570  -->  00:00:31,740
cheap.

10

00:00:31,740  -->  00:00:36,960
And on the right side on the other end of the spectrum you've got Tesla which is for growth investors

11

00:00:36,990  -->  00:00:42,000
and growth investors love companies that are growing very fast and they don't want the companies to

12

00:00:42,000  -->  00:00:47,670
be very profitable today because they wanted to grow they wanted to hire a lot of sales people grow

13

00:00:47,670  -->  00:00:52,570
revenue quickly and they can be profitable one day many years from now kind of like Amazon.

14

00:00:52,890  -->  00:00:57,840
OK so you need to know who you are and what your investors are and of course the quintessential example

15

00:00:57,840  -->  00:01:00,420
of a value investor is Mr. Warren Buffett.

16

00:01:01,290  -->  00:01:06,780
So just know where you are on the spectrum and in the middle of the spectrum.

17

00:01:06,990  -->  00:01:10,110
Sometimes people are what are called Garp.

18

00:01:10,110  -->  00:01:12,960
They're not value they're not growth in the middle.

19

00:01:12,960  -->  00:01:21,570
And that stands for growth at a reasonable price growth at a reasonable price and all growth investments

20

00:01:21,660  -->  00:01:28,110
eventually become value investments and so for years and years and years Microsoft was an incredible

21

00:01:28,110  -->  00:01:33,270
growth investment and then it entered a period of purgatory for 10 years.

22

00:01:33,270  -->  00:01:38,400
It wasn't growth that wasn't value was stuck in the middle and now it's finally more of a value investment

23

00:01:38,850  -->  00:01:44,070
than it was before and stocks that get caught in the middle are never worth investing in.

24

00:01:44,250  -->  00:01:45,450
Ok cool.

25

00:01:45,810  -->  00:01:50,200
So this is the end product don't get too bogged down in this yet.

26

00:01:50,220  -->  00:01:50,840
OK.

27

00:01:51,030  -->  00:01:55,650
I just want to know that there's three different valuation methodologies that we're going to tackle

28

00:01:55,650  -->  00:01:56,460
in this section.

29

00:01:56,520  -->  00:01:57,050
OK.

30

00:01:57,240  -->  00:01:58,620
Three of them let me cover it up though.

31

00:01:58,790  -->  00:01:59,330
OK.

32

00:01:59,640  -->  00:02:03,180
So there's three different types of methodologies we'll be looking at.

33

00:02:03,180  -->  00:02:04,690
The first is price to revenue.

34

00:02:04,740  -->  00:02:05,090
Okay.

35

00:02:05,100  -->  00:02:10,290
And that's basically for companies that don't have earnings and so obviously growth investors love it

36

00:02:11,160  -->  00:02:14,490
then there's a price to earnings ratio which will we'll analyze as well.

37

00:02:14,490  -->  00:02:15,710
That's my favorite.

38

00:02:16,140  -->  00:02:20,610
And then there's something called discounted cash flow which is what the value investors like and we

39

00:02:20,610  -->  00:02:24,340
can look at a gazillion different types of valuation methodology.

40

00:02:24,360  -->  00:02:29,340
If we wanted to like price to book or enterprise value or even multiples as well.

41

00:02:29,360  -->  00:02:30,630
But let's just keep it simple.

42

00:02:30,630  -->  00:02:32,340
Look at these three for now.

43

00:02:32,730  -->  00:02:33,710
Okay great.

44

00:02:33,720  -->  00:02:40,770
So price to revenue is again one that growth investors love to look at.

45

00:02:40,950  -->  00:02:44,210
Okay and it's great for value on profitable companies.

46

00:02:44,460  -->  00:02:51,990
Great for companies or pardon me for comparing to similar firms especially those that are also not profitable

47

00:02:51,990  -->  00:02:52,120
.

48

00:02:52,200  -->  00:02:56,080
And again growth unless investors love price or revenue.

49

00:02:56,670  -->  00:03:02,300
And then we've got price to earnings and this is really good for valuing relative earnings growth rates

50

00:03:02,310  -->  00:03:04,380
and this is called a PEG ratio.

51

00:03:04,500  -->  00:03:10,510
And so if a company is growing earnings at 10 percent and it Taitt trades at 10 times earnings it's

52

00:03:10,530  -->  00:03:12,750
kind of peg of one.

53

00:03:12,780  -->  00:03:17,880
If a company is growing earnings at 10 percent and has got a price earnings ratio of 20 times then it's

54

00:03:17,880  -->  00:03:18,900
got a peg of two.

55

00:03:18,930  -->  00:03:19,740
You've got it.

56

00:03:19,890  -->  00:03:26,790
So growth and value investors love P and then the last one here is discounted cash flow.

57

00:03:26,790  -->  00:03:33,090
This is where cash is king and this kind of cash flow is really all about what future money the company

58

00:03:33,090  -->  00:03:34,380
is going to make is worth today.

59

00:03:34,380  -->  00:03:40,220
And so you have to discount future cash in today's terms and we'll do this in a minute or so.

60

00:03:40,230  -->  00:03:44,840
Value investors love DCF and and growth investors do not.

61

00:03:45,030  -->  00:03:46,520
Ok cool.

62

00:03:47,160  -->  00:03:54,870
So what we're going to do is we're actually going to get the average of all three of these methodologies

63

00:03:54,870  -->  00:03:56,900
to come up with our target price.

64

00:03:57,100  -->  00:04:02,460
Price to earnings plus discount cashflow plus Prester only divided by 3 is de-value rent.

65

00:04:02,580  -->  00:04:07,470
We're going to get here for our company and the reason I like to choose at least three different valuation

66

00:04:07,470  -->  00:04:12,870
methodologies and investment bankers do this a lot to an IPO's is because there's going to be a margin

67

00:04:12,870  -->  00:04:13,660
for error.

68

00:04:13,670  -->  00:04:15,530
One of your valuations is going to be off.

69

00:04:15,540  -->  00:04:16,710
You don't know which one it is.

70

00:04:16,800  -->  00:04:21,540
But this will kind of normalize your margin of error so to speak.
