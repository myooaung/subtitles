1

00:00:01,380  -->  00:00:04,970
All right are you ready for the financial model exercise.

2

00:00:05,010  -->  00:00:07,470
This is a long one and Ken has a lot of work in this one.

3

00:00:07,470  -->  00:00:15,180
I hope you enjoy it and if you haven't already watched the linked in model session in the previous section

4

00:00:15,420  -->  00:00:18,280
please watch it particularly on how to forecast.

5

00:00:18,540  -->  00:00:23,090
And if you haven't already watched all of the cash flow balance sheet and income statement sections

6

00:00:23,100  -->  00:00:23,280
.

7

00:00:23,430  -->  00:00:28,290
Also please make sure to watch those because this is really a crescendo this will be kind of an aha

8

00:00:28,290  -->  00:00:29,150
moment.

9

00:00:29,160  -->  00:00:33,660
Everything we've done so far in the course builds up to this and once we complete this and once you

10

00:00:33,660  -->  00:00:40,020
feel comfortable with the concepts in this section meaning financial modeling then we'll move on to

11

00:00:40,020  -->  00:00:43,250
the next section and we'll cover valuation which is even more fun.

12

00:00:43,440  -->  00:00:47,910
OK so let me explain how to do this exercise you can either read this or I can walk you through it.

13

00:00:48,330  -->  00:00:52,440
So when you model there's two really big important rules.

14

00:00:52,440  -->  00:00:57,420
Number one is most things you model is a percentage of revenue that's why spend so much time forecasting

15

00:00:57,420  -->  00:00:57,940
revenue.

16

00:00:58,140  -->  00:01:03,960
And the second thing is really important is to make sure to look for trends in the data that's all financial

17

00:01:03,960  -->  00:01:04,890
modeling is right.

18

00:01:04,920  -->  00:01:10,620
It's forecasting based on a number of data points in the past know one data point doesn't make a trend

19

00:01:10,620  -->  00:01:11,520
but a bunch do.

20

00:01:11,630  -->  00:01:11,930
OK.

21

00:01:11,940  -->  00:01:17,340
So Step 1 is optional you can read through the modeling guideline and best practices.

22

00:01:17,520  -->  00:01:18,280
Okay.

23

00:01:18,750  -->  00:01:24,890
And step two is there are many many gray shaded boxes like this guy here.

24

00:01:24,900  -->  00:01:25,620
OK.

25

00:01:25,860  -->  00:01:29,340
And what I recommend is come up with the answer first.

26

00:01:29,370  -->  00:01:29,640
OK.

27

00:01:29,640  -->  00:01:36,510
Do your own calculations and then take the box off to see if you're right.

28

00:01:37,800  -->  00:02:00,060
Oh can you say OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH.

29

00:02:00,680  -->  00:02:00,890
OH

30

00:02:03,780  -->  00:02:04,080
OK.

31

00:02:04,080  -->  00:02:06,980
And I'll go through all the answers in the next lecture.

32

00:02:07,410  -->  00:02:09,590
And then please play around.

33

00:02:09,590  -->  00:02:15,630
Step three play around with the model OK because these four tabs they're similar to what we did in the

34

00:02:15,630  -->  00:02:18,450
LinkedIn model in the last section.

35

00:02:18,450  -->  00:02:22,980
But I want to play around with them and see if you understand the relationships between all four.

36

00:02:22,980  -->  00:02:25,590
OK so it changed a couple of numbers around.

37

00:02:25,590  -->  00:02:30,100
See what happens if you change up the balance sheets that the items don't balance anymore.

38

00:02:30,300  -->  00:02:31,280
That sort of thing.

39

00:02:31,290  -->  00:02:36,000
OK and then you can take this with this model as well and you can make your own financial models based

40

00:02:36,000  -->  00:02:36,950
on this as well.

41

00:02:36,970  -->  00:02:39,930
Remember every model for every company is a little bit different.

42

00:02:39,930  -->  00:02:40,460
OK.

43

00:02:40,610  -->  00:02:44,030
A little bit different but this is actually a pretty good framework for you.

44

00:02:44,400  -->  00:02:50,580
And again in the next lecture I will give a comprehensive review of the answers as well as how all the

45

00:02:50,580  -->  00:02:53,940
financial statements are linked and exactly what each item means.

46

00:02:53,940  -->  00:02:55,090
All right.

47

00:02:55,110  -->  00:02:55,640
Cool.

48

00:02:55,770  -->  00:03:02,040
So what you'll do again is you'll just go through all four tabs and you'll calculate everything you

49

00:03:02,040  -->  00:03:06,530
think goes under this gray box here and then remove it and see if you got the right answers.

50

00:03:06,600  -->  00:03:09,020
And if you don't know the right answer just click through to see the formulas.

51

00:03:09,030  -->  00:03:09,330
OK.

52

00:03:09,340  -->  00:03:14,670
And you know this is nicely set up so you can always look in the formula bar here you know where you

53

00:03:14,670  -->  00:03:16,900
might be right or wrong that sort of thing.

54

00:03:17,030  -->  00:03:22,530
And the same thing goes with the income statement and the balance sheet and the cash flow statement

55

00:03:22,560  -->  00:03:24,270
as well.

56

00:03:24,270  -->  00:03:29,120
And one last thing what ever you do don't remove this box.

57

00:03:29,120  -->  00:03:30,090
OK.

58

00:03:30,720  -->  00:03:30,920
All right.

59

00:03:30,920  -->  00:03:31,820
Enjoy the exercise
