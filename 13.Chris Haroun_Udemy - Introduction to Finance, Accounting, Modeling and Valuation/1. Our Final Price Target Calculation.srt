00:00:01,290  -->  00:00:05,660
This guy goes down here and we take the average siak us over here.

2

00:00:05,760  -->  00:00:07,790
We take the average of all three.

3

00:00:07,860  -->  00:00:09,940
Right right there.

4

00:00:10,080  -->  00:00:14,100
And that means we have an average upside of 141 percent to our target price.

5

00:00:14,100  -->  00:00:17,550
I love this here when I ran my hedge fund my analysts who was brilliant.

6

00:00:17,730  -->  00:00:22,340
He said once Chris I don't know the path but I know the destination I love.

7

00:00:22,350  -->  00:00:23,720
I thought I was kind of a cool saying.

8

00:00:23,910  -->  00:00:30,030
So the average of all three of our methodology is gives us a hundred and forty one percent to our upside

9

00:00:30,030  -->  00:00:31,380
target price.
