00:00:00.990  -->  00:00:08.430
Additional valuation methodologies we've talked about price earnings price to revenue DCF and net present

2

00:00:08.430  -->  00:00:09.480
value.

3

00:00:09.480  -->  00:00:15.450
Let's talk about some new ones and it's easier to introduce these new concepts now that you understand

4

00:00:15.750  -->  00:00:18.140
the other concepts from a valuation perspective.

5

00:00:18.510  -->  00:00:21.110
So let's kick it off with enterprise value to it.

6

00:00:21.420  -->  00:00:25.820
This one is very similar and price to earnings except in the numerator.

7

00:00:25.980  -->  00:00:30.570
You include debt and used cash and denominators but that in earnings.

8

00:00:30.570  -->  00:00:31.320
Okay.

9

00:00:31.660  -->  00:00:37.570
Now enterprise value which is the numerator is market capitalization plus that minus cash.

10

00:00:38.010  -->  00:00:43.230
And this one is actually used by lot of investment bankers and also corporate finance departments when

11

00:00:43.230  -->  00:00:49.230
they're looking to buy other companies because in M&A or mergers and acquisitions situations the acquire

12

00:00:49.290  -->  00:00:51.570
we need to pay back the debt.

13

00:00:51.570  -->  00:00:56.820
So they like to look at to even the next step.

14

00:00:56.820  -->  00:01:02.070
We've got Eevee to sales and this is similar to price to revenue except in the numerator.

15

00:01:02.070  -->  00:01:04.530
You're also accounting for debt and deducting cash.

16

00:01:04.740  -->  00:01:10.240
And again enterprise value which is numerator equals market cap plus that minus cash.

17

00:01:10.380  -->  00:01:16.320
And I repeat this on purpose is used in M&A situations as you Choire would need to pay back the debt

18

00:01:18.390  -->  00:01:19.300
price cash flow.

19

00:01:19.380  -->  00:01:24.770
This is a lot like price to earnings but as absolutely loves by value investors for obvious reasons

20

00:01:24.780  -->  00:01:30.960
because value investors like to buy stuff that's cheap price to book.

21

00:01:30.990  -->  00:01:35.520
This is another one loved by value investors and basically price to book means.

22

00:01:35.550  -->  00:01:38.640
What's the value of the company if you liquidate and sold everything
