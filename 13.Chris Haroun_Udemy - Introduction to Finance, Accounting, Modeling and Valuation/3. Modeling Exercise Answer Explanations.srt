1

00:00:00,980  -->  00:00:03,400
All right let's talk about the financial model exercise.

2

00:00:03,400  -->  00:00:06,130
Answers we'll kick it off with the revenue tab.

3

00:00:06,300  -->  00:00:10,160
So right here what goes under this box for all four corners.

4

00:00:10,200  -->  00:00:15,450
Well it's actually just an addition of revenue line one into from below.

5

00:00:15,460  -->  00:00:17,870
And in terms of what goes under this box here.

6

00:00:18,120  -->  00:00:20,060
Well it's just a percent total.

7

00:00:20,070  -->  00:00:22,740
So this is total revenue up here right.

8

00:00:22,860  -->  00:00:27,120
Which is that plus that well it's just this divided by that.

9

00:00:27,120  -->  00:00:28,460
That's the percent.

10

00:00:28,790  -->  00:00:31,920
Ok cool.

11

00:00:32,160  -->  00:00:38,010
In terms of revenue line item one of two right here while looking at pattern recognition.

12

00:00:38,070  -->  00:00:43,090
This here would be 80 percent right because we went from 110.

13

00:00:43,110  -->  00:00:45,690
Hundred ninety eight.

14

00:00:45,830  -->  00:00:46,410
OK.

15

00:00:46,680  -->  00:00:51,220
So right here this would be 80 percent.

16

00:00:51,340  -->  00:00:53,110
All right.

17

00:00:53,670  -->  00:01:00,120
And then here we'll just follow the same pattern 70 60 50 40 percent.

18

00:01:01,230  -->  00:01:04,920
And then here it's just 80 percent times revenue in under here.

19

00:01:04,920  -->  00:01:07,050
Again just pattern recognition.

20

00:01:07,050  -->  00:01:09,420
This would be 80 percent as well.

21

00:01:09,420  -->  00:01:14,160
All right let's go through the income statement now so depreciation is 5 percent sales across the board

22

00:01:14,160  -->  00:01:14,380
.

23

00:01:14,490  -->  00:01:18,360
Therefore it's also going to be 5 percent right here.

24

00:01:18,660  -->  00:01:22,590
And in terms of what numbers go under this box for all four quarters.

25

00:01:22,890  -->  00:01:28,230
Well it's just revenue from the previous tab right and it's green which means it links to another tab

26

00:01:28,340  -->  00:01:33,130
and it has just toll revenue adds up revenue one in two from the previous tab.

27

00:01:33,150  -->  00:01:34,050
Okay cool.

28

00:01:34,050  -->  00:01:36,210
So in terms of cost a good saw percent of revenue.

29

00:01:36,210  -->  00:01:37,980
Again we look at pattern recognition.

30

00:01:37,980  -->  00:01:40,550
30 percent 28 26.

31

00:01:40,620  -->  00:01:46,040
Well these will be 26 for all four quarters as well.

32

00:01:46,050  -->  00:01:46,390
All right.

33

00:01:46,410  -->  00:01:52,560
And then sales and marketing goes from 60 percent of revenue to 15 to 14.

34

00:01:52,560  -->  00:01:52,830
Right.

35

00:01:52,830  -->  00:02:00,390
So it's just going to be 14 percent times sales right and that will give you sales and marketing as

36

00:02:00,390  -->  00:02:01,240
a percent of revenue here.

37

00:02:01,260  -->  00:02:02,770
Okay.

38

00:02:02,850  -->  00:02:09,260
And then then we have product development as a percent of revenue we go from 15 to 14 percent to 13

39

00:02:09,270  -->  00:02:17,700
so under here is 13 as well as pattern recognition and then sales and marketing under here will just

40

00:02:17,700  -->  00:02:20,460
be 13 percent times revenue right.

41

00:02:20,490  -->  00:02:26,750
And again you can double click on any formula here or box here to find out what the formula is.

42

00:02:27,800  -->  00:02:30,450
Okay.

43

00:02:31,050  -->  00:02:36,240
All right TOSCAN sold as a percent of revenue we go from 24 to 22 at 20.

44

00:02:36,310  -->  00:02:38,910
Therefore here on a quarterly basis it's also 20

45

00:02:43,350  -->  00:02:50,350
22 20 18 16 14 12.

46

00:02:51,420  -->  00:02:53,280
Okay.

47

00:02:54,570  -->  00:02:57,340
Now sales and marketing goes into this box here.

48

00:02:57,510  -->  00:03:01,250
Well it's just 12 percent because we are 13 12 in the quarter.

49

00:03:01,250  -->  00:03:05,340
The numbers are the same in this example as the annual numbers.

50

00:03:05,640  -->  00:03:07,690
And then here we go 12 11.

51

00:03:07,710  -->  00:03:13,630
Again it's 11 percent under here.

52

00:03:15,900  -->  00:03:19,840
And then depreciation is always 5 percent.

53

00:03:20,850  -->  00:03:21,990
Same here.

54

00:03:21,990  -->  00:03:25,250
And then GNAS here is just going to be 10 percent.

55

00:03:25,710  -->  00:03:27,050
Okay.

56

00:03:27,750  -->  00:03:32,090
And then sales marketing here it's expensive ones who cause 11 10 9 8.

57

00:03:32,160  -->  00:03:32,880
Okay.

58

00:03:33,240  -->  00:03:39,570
And then with product development again pattern recognition 12 11 10 9 8 7.

59

00:03:39,650  -->  00:03:40,350
OK.

60

00:03:40,740  -->  00:03:45,220
So margins are improving and we're actually getting margin expansion here.

61

00:03:45,720  -->  00:03:50,140
And then DNA goes from 11 to ten nine eight seven six.

62

00:03:50,400  -->  00:03:50,630
Right.

63

00:03:50,640  -->  00:03:53,300
Nice leverage kicking in.

64

00:03:55,440  -->  00:04:01,800
And then with other income that's pretty small so it's it's ones all the way across for a total of 4

65

00:04:01,800  -->  00:04:02,770
for the year.

66

00:04:03,270  -->  00:04:07,180
And of course the same thing here for the annual numbers in the future.

67

00:04:07,370  -->  00:04:08,260
Okay.

68

00:04:08,760  -->  00:04:12,750
And then for tax we know it's 30 percent across the board.

69

00:04:12,870  -->  00:04:14,010
Right.

70

00:04:14,100  -->  00:04:21,740
And then what goes under this one here it's just 30 percent times pre-tax income.

71

00:04:22,310  -->  00:04:24,850
And then here 30 percent across the board.

72

00:04:24,870  -->  00:04:27,530
And same with this one here.

73

00:04:27,570  -->  00:04:28,160
Okay.

74

00:04:28,320  -->  00:04:36,450
And then for the share count Ulos it hasn't changed at all right so it's still 11 65 for every single

75

00:04:36,810  -->  00:04:38,250
quarter in year.

76

00:04:38,330  -->  00:04:42,270
So I think we covered everything here that we were good.

77

00:04:42,300  -->  00:04:44,080
All right moving on.

78

00:04:44,130  -->  00:04:47,620
And remember don't touch this one.

79

00:04:47,670  -->  00:04:48,170
All right.

80

00:04:48,210  -->  00:04:49,330
Moving on to the balance sheet.

81

00:04:49,590  -->  00:04:56,880
Total current assets is simply an addition of all these non-present items here in cap ex is 10 percent

82

00:04:56,940  -->  00:04:58,140
of revenue here right.

83

00:04:58,160  -->  00:05:02,030
So we just multiply by 10 on the previous tab Okay.

84

00:05:02,310  -->  00:05:06,660
And here CapEx is always 10 percent of revenue.

85

00:05:06,660  -->  00:05:12,420
In our example cancer was always 5 percent across the board.

86

00:05:12,480  -->  00:05:14,580
Okay.

87

00:05:14,610  -->  00:05:16,690
Now we can actually do the same thing here.

88

00:05:16,920  -->  00:05:17,730
Same for here.

89

00:05:17,760  -->  00:05:24,400
5 percent across the board and then accounts receivable is just 5 percent time sales.

90

00:05:24,400  -->  00:05:25,070
Right.

91

00:05:25,190  -->  00:05:31,960
And then is always 11 percent of sales so he even carried this one here and this one is just 11 percent

92

00:05:31,960  -->  00:05:35,460
across the board.

93

00:05:36,060  -->  00:05:43,270
And in terms of cash Well the difference between this year and this year is cash is quite simply cash

94

00:05:43,270  -->  00:05:47,810
here plus the cash addition from the cash flow statement.

95

00:05:47,990  -->  00:05:52,710
Remember the cash flow statement always explains the difference in cash in one year and the next and

96

00:05:52,940  -->  00:05:55,470
if you're confused you can always just double click here.

97

00:05:55,500  -->  00:05:59,620
It'll take you directly to the appropriate cash flow statement field.

98

00:06:00,760  -->  00:06:09,680
Now in terms of equipment CapEx as a percent of revenue is always 10 percent is pretty easy.

99

00:06:10,190  -->  00:06:14,660
And then depreciation we got it from the income statement remember.

100

00:06:14,690  -->  00:06:18,920
So that would just get pulled over directly and it's green because it's from another tab.

101

00:06:19,450  -->  00:06:24,910
And then the calculation for equipment we own native Huli depreciation and inclusive of cut backs is

102

00:06:24,910  -->  00:06:29,490
quite simply this You take last year's equipment.

103

00:06:29,500  -->  00:06:29,910
Okay.

104

00:06:29,920  -->  00:06:32,410
Net of all depreciation items.

105

00:06:32,440  -->  00:06:33,180
Okay.

106

00:06:33,580  -->  00:06:40,300
And then what you do is you deduct depreciation from this year and then add back CapEx from this year

107

00:06:43,490  -->  00:06:47,240
and accounts payable as a percent of revenues always 3 percent.

108

00:06:47,410  -->  00:06:52,820
It's just pattern recognition here and CapEx when it comes to depreciation you're just looking directly

109

00:06:52,810  -->  00:06:55,920
to the income statement here.

110

00:06:55,910  -->  00:06:56,310
All right.

111

00:06:56,330  -->  00:06:59,460
And then see if I forgot anyone here know or get a Coke.

112

00:06:59,620  -->  00:07:05,530
All right long term debt here is just five across the board in this example.

113

00:07:06,740  -->  00:07:14,160
And then shareholders equity is just retained earnings plus common shares and calculate retained earnings

114

00:07:14,170  -->  00:07:17,370
you just basically look for the difference in net income year over year.

115

00:07:17,380  -->  00:07:22,080
So you take the most recent quarter or years retained earnings.

116

00:07:22,510  -->  00:07:24,660
And then you add net income.

117

00:07:24,660  -->  00:07:24,980
Okay.

118

00:07:25,060  -->  00:07:29,320
And again if you're confused or just double click and go to the other tab and understand the logic that

119

00:07:29,320  -->  00:07:35,800
way cool long term debt here is 5 am retained earnings here.

120

00:07:35,800  -->  00:07:42,150
Again it's just last periods retained earnings plus net income from the income statement up.

121

00:07:42,430  -->  00:07:44,080
And one more over here.

122

00:07:44,290  -->  00:07:45,040
Okay.

123

00:07:45,580  -->  00:07:50,460
Total liabilities and shareholder's equity it's quite simply an addition of total liabilities Sheryl's

124

00:07:50,480  -->  00:07:50,820
equity.

125

00:07:50,820  -->  00:07:51,190
Right.

126

00:07:51,190  -->  00:07:53,670
So that plus that.

127

00:07:53,760  -->  00:07:55,940
All right we are done with the balance sheet.

128

00:07:55,930  -->  00:07:57,700
Let's move on to the cash flow statement.

129

00:07:57,700  -->  00:08:02,500
This is actually easier than you think because it's just numbers that are automatically linked to the

130

00:08:02,500  -->  00:08:05,060
income statement and then the balance sheet.

131

00:08:05,430  -->  00:08:09,230
And in terms of depreciation you pull it directly off of the income statement.

132

00:08:09,270  -->  00:08:10,270
Okay.

133

00:08:10,580  -->  00:08:16,960
Scared of this all right now in terms of accounts receivable looks like accounts receivable actually

134

00:08:16,960  -->  00:08:22,490
went down and that's a good thing cash wise because we have a little more cash in our pocket.

135

00:08:22,490  -->  00:08:26,140
Same thing with inventory in terms of accounts payable.

136

00:08:26,170  -->  00:08:28,180
The inverse logic is true.

137

00:08:28,750  -->  00:08:35,520
Now purchases of equipment you just linked directly to catbox from the previous tab.

138

00:08:36,750  -->  00:08:45,520
And if you ever confuse what you can do is you hold commands on a Mac and square brackets see and it

139

00:08:45,520  -->  00:08:49,520
goes directly here to cap.

140

00:08:49,570  -->  00:08:52,370
It links directly it's a cool cool little trick.

141

00:08:52,370  -->  00:08:53,090
All right.

142

00:08:53,090  -->  00:08:59,230
Now cash in beginning a period and cash and in a period you just take beginning period plus the increase

143

00:08:59,240  -->  00:09:00,270
or decrease in cash.

144

00:09:00,280  -->  00:09:01,970
I'll show you what that means here.

145

00:09:01,960  -->  00:09:02,750
OK.

146

00:09:03,280  -->  00:09:05,790
And then you link directly to the cash flow statement.

147

00:09:05,800  -->  00:09:11,500
So this here is the cash balance in the Cashell statement okay all the way across.

148

00:09:11,550  -->  00:09:12,270
Right.

149

00:09:12,400  -->  00:09:18,280
And this is cash from last balance sheet and cash from current balance sheet.

150

00:09:18,280  -->  00:09:19,500
Okay.

151

00:09:19,540  -->  00:09:25,360
And then here this is just a cool little calculation a test to see if these two are equal.

152

00:09:26,300  -->  00:09:27,570
Right.

153

00:09:27,710  -->  00:09:33,330
And in terms of net increase or decrease in cash it's just cash flow from operations plus cash flow

154

00:09:33,340  -->  00:09:36,010
for investing plus cash flow for financing.

155

00:09:36,430  -->  00:09:39,930
And then here similar to what we talked about here in the quarterly basis.

156

00:09:39,940  -->  00:09:47,110
But on the annual basis you just take depreciation on an annual basis directly from the income statement

157

00:09:47,710  -->  00:09:48,920
increase receivables.

158

00:09:48,940  -->  00:09:51,390
Same logic you get it directly from the balance sheet.

159

00:09:51,620  -->  00:09:54,060
And if it goes up then it hurts our cash.

160

00:09:54,090  -->  00:09:55,100
It's negative.

161

00:09:56,060  -->  00:10:01,250
And then increase in accounts payable is actually the opposite logic member that so if we owe more money

162

00:10:01,580  -->  00:10:06,720
then we have more temporary cash in our pocket and that's a wrap
