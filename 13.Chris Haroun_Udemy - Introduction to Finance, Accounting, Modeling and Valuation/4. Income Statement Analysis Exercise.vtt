Now it's time for the income statement exercise this income statement exercise is attached in Excel

2

00:00:06.930  -->  00:00:14.050
format to the current lecture and basically all you do is you copy these items.

3

00:00:14.070  -->  00:00:14.340
Right.

4

00:00:14.340  -->  00:00:22.650
These white boxes here and then you're going to put them into these boxes these three OK and the next

5

00:00:22.650  -->  00:00:26.760
tab right here here and here.

6

00:00:26.790  -->  00:00:27.360
All right.

7

00:00:27.600  -->  00:00:33.570
And then what you're going to do is you're going to write down if the percent change year over year

8

00:00:33.570  -->  00:00:35.790
which will automatically be calculated here.

9

00:00:35.790  -->  00:00:36.760
Right.

10

00:00:36.810  -->  00:00:41.070
If the percent change is a concern yes or no.

11

00:00:41.250  -->  00:00:44.810
And if you answer yes then please write down here why.

12

00:00:45.020  -->  00:00:45.780

15

00:00:51.540  -->  00:00:54.060
I want to go through the answer is a much more detail.

16

00:00:54.060  -->  00:01:00.330
So one last thing I want to say is that these items are sorted alphabetically so again just copy and

17

00:01:00.330  -->  00:01:03.850
paste them into the appropriate boxes here.

18

00:01:03.900  -->  00:01:05.770
Tell me if that's a concern yes or no.

19

00:01:05.790  -->  00:01:07.350
If the answer is yes then right why
