00:00:00.600  -->  00:00:09.930
Let's discuss the results of the exercise cash down 50 percent which is absolutely terrifying absolutely

2

00:00:09.930  -->  00:00:10.860
terrifying.

3

00:00:11.160  -->  00:00:16.650
What you have material declined like this in cash it could signal that the company could go belly up

4

00:00:16.650  -->  00:00:16.680
.

5

00:00:16.680  -->  00:00:22.950
Of course you need one more year of data to analyze it as one data point does make a trend.

6

00:00:23.040  -->  00:00:28.950
OK cancer Siebel is up 74 percent that's concerning as well because we're extending favorable terms

7

00:00:29.250  -->  00:00:30.660
to our customers.

8

00:00:30.750  -->  00:00:31.020
Right.

9

00:00:31.020  -->  00:00:36.350
And so it's a cash crunch for us because they're not paying us the cash yet.

10

00:00:36.360  -->  00:00:37.670
Okay inventory.

11

00:00:37.680  -->  00:00:39.820
Oh my goodness.

12

00:00:39.900  -->  00:00:40.650
Wow.

13

00:00:40.860  -->  00:00:43.950
Inventory was up over 4300 percent.

14

00:00:43.950  -->  00:00:46.560
This could bankrupt the company.

15

00:00:46.590  -->  00:00:52.290
There's a great example of this with Atari which was a videogame maker back in the early 1980s.

16

00:00:52.320  -->  00:00:58.260
They made this game called E.T. based on the movie E.T. and it was such a horrific failure that they

17

00:00:58.260  -->  00:01:02.880
actually buried hundreds and hundreds of thousands if not millions of copies in the desert.

18

00:01:02.940  -->  00:01:03.600
Right.

19

00:01:03.630  -->  00:01:07.780
So a lot of times we have a spike in inventory because something went wrong.

20

00:01:07.800  -->  00:01:08.040
Right.

21

00:01:08.040  -->  00:01:10.020
No one's buying that product.

22

00:01:10.110  -->  00:01:13.820
That's terrifying OK I'll keep going here long term assets.

23

00:01:13.830  -->  00:01:16.620
I'm not that where there's really no change that's fine.

24

00:01:16.620  -->  00:01:21.500
The building went down $5000 because of the pressure which we covered in an earlier section.

25

00:01:21.570  -->  00:01:23.320
Let's talk about current liabilities.

26

00:01:23.320  -->  00:01:30.240
I'm really going to focus here on debt so debt was up by over $30000 a short term debt.

27

00:01:30.360  -->  00:01:30.970
Right.

28

00:01:31.230  -->  00:01:32.580
That's that's a concern.

29

00:01:32.580  -->  00:01:33.750
Let's see what else we have here.

30

00:01:33.750  -->  00:01:34.770
Oh goodness.

31

00:01:34.770  -->  00:01:37.010
Long term debt was up 300 grand.

32

00:01:37.020  -->  00:01:38.490
So that's frightening.

33

00:01:38.490  -->  00:01:44.220
So maybe we took this debt and we're finding it seen a material increase in inventory with partially

34

00:01:44.220  -->  00:01:45.520
that debt.

35

00:01:45.570  -->  00:01:46.140
Frightening.

36

00:01:46.170  -->  00:01:46.630
Frightening.

37

00:01:46.650  -->  00:01:47.100
OK.

38

00:01:47.280  -->  00:01:49.650
Let's go to retained earnings.

39

00:01:49.650  -->  00:01:53.540
All right so we can tell our net income from the income statement was one hundred fifty seven thousand

40

00:01:53.530  -->  00:01:53.980
dollars.

41

00:01:54.010  -->  00:01:57.900
Eight hundred seventy five for county or 2016.

42

00:01:57.920  -->  00:02:03.960
And we had a small increase here in common share So what really worries me about this is the material

43

00:02:03.960  -->  00:02:06.110
spike in inventory.

44

00:02:06.270  -->  00:02:08.850
It's absolutely terrifying.

45

00:02:08.850  -->  00:02:13.620
Even Tory spikes like this can of course destroy a company last thing I'll say is this looks like our

46

00:02:13.620  -->  00:02:15.820
balance sheet bounce which is a good thing right.

47

00:02:15.820  -->  00:02:18.800
At least we got the math right here which is which is great.

48

00:02:18.840  -->  00:02:19.680
Ok cool.

49

00:02:19.770  -->  00:02:24.630
While we are done with the balance sheet section now and let's move on to the cash flow section which

50

00:02:24.630  -->  00:02:26.120
is much easier than you think.

51

00:02:26.120  -->  00:02:31.380
And once we understand how all three financial statements talk to each other or how they're all related

52

00:02:31.380  -->  00:02:37.970
or linked to each other then creating financial models from scratch is very easy.
