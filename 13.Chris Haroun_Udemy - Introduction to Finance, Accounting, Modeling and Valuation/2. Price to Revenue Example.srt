1

00:00:00,300  -->  00:00:06,480
The next methodology that we're going to look at is this dude right here and this is price to revenue

2

00:00:06,840  -->  00:00:13,290
and this is great if a company is not profitable and won't be for long time and growth investors love

3

00:00:13,290  -->  00:00:13,920
this.

4

00:00:14,020  -->  00:00:14,400
Right.

5

00:00:14,450  -->  00:00:17,750
And what you do is you basically look at the price to revenue.

6

00:00:17,760  -->  00:00:20,880
You think the company will be under three different scenarios.

7

00:00:20,970  -->  00:00:21,800
Right.

8

00:00:21,810  -->  00:00:28,770
So if we're bearish and you know Internet stocks U.S. trade at higher price revenue multiples than this

9

00:00:28,780  -->  00:00:28,970
.

10

00:00:29,100  -->  00:00:30,870
But let's just say it's five times.

11

00:00:31,140  -->  00:00:33,940
So this is five times revenue right.

12

00:00:34,080  -->  00:00:36,760
In each each one of those years that's revenue up there OK.

13

00:00:37,080  -->  00:00:41,440
And then this is just five times that five times that amount.

14

00:00:41,460  -->  00:00:41,800
Right.

15

00:00:41,820  -->  00:00:45,640
And then 2020 that's our revenue estimate five times that amount.

16

00:00:45,840  -->  00:00:46,380
Okay.

17

00:00:46,590  -->  00:00:49,280
And then we take this divided by numbers shares right.

18

00:00:49,380  -->  00:00:51,500
And that's the target price.

19

00:00:51,950  -->  00:00:58,470
And so this is the bear scenario at five times in a bullish scenario which is too bullish obviously

20

00:00:58,470  -->  00:01:01,160
but I'm listening anyway 10 times revenue.

21

00:01:01,410  -->  00:01:04,430
And again 10 times revenue here would be 10 times revenue.

22

00:01:04,440  -->  00:01:08,250
That's a market demand of a number of shares for that price.

23

00:01:08,320  -->  00:01:08,950
Okay.

24

00:01:09,420  -->  00:01:11,570
But we've got to discount them.

25

00:01:11,580  -->  00:01:17,040
Let me get there in a second the just right one is in between the five and 10 times in this hypothetical

26

00:01:17,040  -->  00:01:20,210
example and that's 7 1/2 times armed.

27

00:01:20,700  -->  00:01:28,740
And so in this case we're in it take 7 1/2 times revenue and the target price by that year of that amounts

28

00:01:28,740  -->  00:01:29,000
.

29

00:01:29,010  -->  00:01:33,190
But we got to discount that 484 bucks to today's price.

30

00:01:33,540  -->  00:01:40,000
And so we do that by dividing by 1 plus the whac right from the previous tap to the power forks or just

31

00:01:40,030  -->  00:01:42,680
you know in that over 1 2 3 4 years.

32

00:01:42,920  -->  00:01:43,740
And that's our price
