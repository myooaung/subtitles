00:00:04,980  -->  00:00:08,320
Let's talk about the income statement but hold on a second.

2

00:00:08,490  -->  00:00:11,740
I'm going with the income save on hold for a couple of sites.

3

00:00:11,880  -->  00:00:15,150
I want to give you a very quick accounting introduction.

4

00:00:15,240  -->  00:00:18,260
There's three financial statements that we'll be looking at.

5

00:00:18,280  -->  00:00:23,060
There's the balance sheet which tells you what do we want.

6

00:00:23,130  -->  00:00:29,450
Then there's the income statement that tells you how much money do you make.

7

00:00:29,700  -->  00:00:34,170
And then there is the cash flow statement and hold on a second.

8

00:00:34,230  -->  00:00:36,110
How much money do I really make.

9

00:00:36,120  -->  00:00:41,530
See the income statement doesn't tell you how much more cash you're getting in your pocket cash.

10

00:00:41,880  -->  00:00:43,610
It's actually not accurate.

11

00:00:43,680  -->  00:00:47,370
Right and so we knew third final statement called the cash flow statement and that will tell you how

12

00:00:47,370  -->  00:00:50,140
much you really have cash wise.

13

00:00:50,250  -->  00:00:50,830
OK.

14

00:00:51,030  -->  00:00:53,980
And it will basically look at the income statement and correct it for you.

15

00:00:54,200  -->  00:00:54,650
OK.

16

00:00:54,750  -->  00:00:55,670
I want to put that in your.

17

00:00:55,680  -->  00:00:57,200
I want to put that on the radar screen.

18

00:00:57,210  -->  00:00:58,630
We'll come back to that shortly.

19

00:00:58,780  -->  00:01:00,690
OK great.

20

00:01:00,690  -->  00:01:03,070
Back to the income statement.

21

00:01:03,150  -->  00:01:09,840
So by the end of this section you will understand why an income statement is really important and how

22

00:01:09,840  -->  00:01:14,370
to analyze an income statement so that you can create and understand financial modeling.

23

00:01:14,430  -->  00:01:14,920
OK.

24

00:01:15,060  -->  00:01:17,850
So we're into an accounting background for the next three sections.

25

00:01:17,850  -->  00:01:20,580
The income set the balance sheet the cash flow statement.

26

00:01:20,610  -->  00:01:21,410
Okay.

27

00:01:21,450  -->  00:01:25,470
And then once we tie all that together then we can model companies.

28

00:01:25,800  -->  00:01:28,210
OK let's just start with the income statement.

29

00:01:28,260  -->  00:01:32,760
So in the section we're going to talk about what is the income statement and what purpose does it have

30

00:01:32,770  -->  00:01:33,560
.

31

00:01:34,350  -->  00:01:40,020
We're also going to talk about why we create the income statement and the reason is if you don't create

32

00:01:40,020  -->  00:01:44,490
an income statement and model into the future you'll never know how much a company is worth and what

33

00:01:44,490  -->  00:01:46,140
the target price is going to be.

34

00:01:47,010  -->  00:01:52,200
And the way we're going to do this is we're going to go through a number of different Excel spreadsheet

35

00:01:52,200  -->  00:01:52,890
examples
