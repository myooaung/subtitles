1

00:00:00,870  -->  00:00:06,630
Let's talk about financial modeling best practices and I'll include a PTF of all these best practices

2

00:00:06,630  -->  00:00:08,090
for you to take with you.

3

00:00:08,640  -->  00:00:11,570
The two most important rules are very very easy.

4

00:00:11,580  -->  00:00:12,740
Rule number one.

5

00:00:13,110  -->  00:00:19,050
Almost every single projection on your financial statements is a percent of revenue.

6

00:00:19,050  -->  00:00:20,200
Rule number 2.

7

00:00:20,310  -->  00:00:22,390
Look for patterns in the data.

8

00:00:22,410  -->  00:00:25,230
One data point doesn't make a trend but a couple does right.

9

00:00:25,230  -->  00:00:27,720
And so a good way to think about it is this.

10

00:00:27,720  -->  00:00:34,050
If I throw a ball across the room an object in motion will stay in motion for a long period of time

11

00:00:34,050  -->  00:00:34,080
.

12

00:00:34,080  -->  00:00:34,690
Right.

13

00:00:34,930  -->  00:00:35,520
OK.

14

00:00:36,060  -->  00:00:42,310
So most public companies have revenue growth that is slowing right that objects in motion right.

15

00:00:42,330  -->  00:00:43,860
Revenue growth is slowing.

16

00:00:43,920  -->  00:00:44,720
It's not their fault.

17

00:00:44,730  -->  00:00:49,200
They're just big companies and so private companies that are backed by venture capital firms have revenue

18

00:00:49,200  -->  00:00:50,970
growth that accelerating.

19

00:00:51,120  -->  00:00:55,440
And once revenue growth is decelerating a bit the company goes public.

20

00:00:55,440  -->  00:01:00,520
And so a lot of great companies that are publicly traded have revenue growth that's slowing.

21

00:01:00,520  -->  00:01:02,070
So it's their fault.

22

00:01:02,130  -->  00:01:07,000
So if you see that revenue growth is really accelerating for a company that publicly traded there's

23

00:01:07,020  -->  00:01:09,430
a very good chance they bought a company.

24

00:01:09,450  -->  00:01:09,970
OK.

25

00:01:10,110  -->  00:01:13,160
They made an acquisition and that's not or cannot grow.

26

00:01:13,170  -->  00:01:14,590
That's nonorganic growth.

27

00:01:14,700  -->  00:01:16,440
And you have to know the difference between the two of them.

28

00:01:16,500  -->  00:01:18,110
We'll look at that in an exercise.

29

00:01:18,540  -->  00:01:19,610
Number five.

30

00:01:19,920  -->  00:01:24,570
If revenue growth is down a lot what happens is the company focuses on improving profits.

31

00:01:24,570  -->  00:01:25,500
Why.

32

00:01:25,500  -->  00:01:30,300
Because the growth investors want revenue growth to be high but revenue if revenue growth is slowing

33

00:01:30,300  -->  00:01:33,070
too much then growth investors will buy the stock.

34

00:01:33,070  -->  00:01:37,900
And so management will basically try to make profits go up more.

35

00:01:37,920  -->  00:01:39,940
So value investors will buy the stock.

36

00:01:40,140  -->  00:01:44,810
Number six Don't talk to the CFO or CEO or I are.

37

00:01:44,820  -->  00:01:46,530
Until you built your model we covered this before.

38

00:01:46,530  -->  00:01:48,190
They're great salespeople.

39

00:01:48,270  -->  00:01:54,690
Number seven if a company has a lot of cash they'll buy shares or other companies and sometimes issue

40

00:01:54,690  -->  00:01:56,020
a dividend as well.

41

00:01:56,220  -->  00:02:02,310
And if the company has too much cash then what happens is activist investors might buy the stock get

42

00:02:02,310  -->  00:02:08,190
on the board and force the company to restructure or issue big dividends or heck somebody could take

43

00:02:08,190  -->  00:02:09,340
a private event.

44

00:02:09,960  -->  00:02:13,690
OK number eight forecasting tax is really really hard.

45

00:02:13,710  -->  00:02:15,170
Just use the historical tax rate.

46

00:02:15,180  -->  00:02:15,750
OK.

47

00:02:16,080  -->  00:02:20,350
And you can find that in the S.E.C. filings which will cover will cover sin.

48

00:02:20,940  -->  00:02:21,970
OK.

49

00:02:22,050  -->  00:02:25,530
Number nine hard coded items right and you'll see these on all the financials statements.

50

00:02:25,570  -->  00:02:29,670
We're in a great hard quarter I'd items mean non formulas.

51

00:02:29,670  -->  00:02:33,840
They should be in blue means you hardcore and the type that don't worry this makes sense soon.

52

00:02:34,080  -->  00:02:38,090
Number 10 items linked to another Excel tab should be in green.

53

00:02:38,100  -->  00:02:39,690
This is just a standard I created.

54

00:02:39,780  -->  00:02:45,630
I really think it makes sense because the whole modeling process gets so complicated if you don't have

55

00:02:45,630  -->  00:02:46,980
different color coding.

56

00:02:47,100  -->  00:02:50,910
I'll show you in a minute and many comments on your model.

57

00:02:50,910  -->  00:02:51,680
Right.

58

00:02:51,690  -->  00:02:57,320
In Windows you type shipped up to an Excel and you can add comments in iMac.

59

00:02:57,450  -->  00:03:00,210
What you do is you right click on a cell and you can add a comment.

60

00:03:00,210  -->  00:03:03,890
And the reason you do this is because you'll come back and revisit this model in the future.

61

00:03:03,990  -->  00:03:08,490
And it's really confusing if you don't know what you were thinking at that point in time when you entered

62

00:03:08,490  -->  00:03:10,030
information in that model.

63

00:03:10,230  -->  00:03:10,790
Okay.

64

00:03:11,070  -->  00:03:16,050
And if you work in on big teams and you entering comments you should put your initials first at the

65

00:03:16,050  -->  00:03:20,640
beginning and the date as well just so your team knows who wrote what number 12.

66

00:03:21,090  -->  00:03:26,250
If the model is too complicated for you dumb it down by grouping items together and I'll show this to

67

00:03:26,250  -->  00:03:27,790
you in the example.

68

00:03:28,080  -->  00:03:32,580
Modeling isn't art and science and I promise you you'll never be 100 percent right.

69

00:03:32,580  -->  00:03:33,960
You want to be directionally correct.

70

00:03:33,960  -->  00:03:34,540
OK.

71

00:03:34,800  -->  00:03:37,430
Don't get worried if you're not 100 percent right.

72

00:03:37,470  -->  00:03:42,300
Nobody ever is number 14 when you're done with your model.

73

00:03:42,300  -->  00:03:45,300
Sleep on it and then revisit it the next morning.

74

00:03:45,300  -->  00:03:45,730
Right.

75

00:03:45,750  -->  00:03:50,550
And if you still feel great about what you've created then you're done.

76

00:03:50,610  -->  00:03:53,960
Number 15 No the size of the markets right.

77

00:03:53,970  -->  00:03:58,830
The total addressable market for a sanity check and I'll be doing this with the LinkedIn case study

78

00:03:58,950  -->  00:04:00,900
soon.

79

00:04:00,900  -->  00:04:03,530
Number 16.

80

00:04:03,600  -->  00:04:08,040
Add every little piece of data that the company provides you in the quarterly earnings press releases

81

00:04:08,040  -->  00:04:08,520
to your model.

82

00:04:08,520  -->  00:04:09,960
Even if you don't use it.

83

00:04:10,590  -->  00:04:15,590
Number 70 percent item should be italicized right.

84

00:04:15,750  -->  00:04:21,150
Number 18 spend a lot of time printing up your model make it look perfect right.

85

00:04:21,240  -->  00:04:26,910
Even the formatting and everything I know it sounds crazy but just take pride in having a perfect model

86

00:04:26,940  -->  00:04:29,700
or a model that's easy to read I should say.

87

00:04:30,240  -->  00:04:33,980
Number 19 you have the same access as the professionals do.

88

00:04:34,050  -->  00:04:34,630
OK.

89

00:04:34,740  -->  00:04:36,100
Have fun doing this.

90

00:04:36,120  -->  00:04:38,010
They don't have an edge on us anymore.

91

00:04:38,070  -->  00:04:38,490
Right.

92

00:04:38,490  -->  00:04:43,140
You get access to the same information that they do because of the Internet and because of government

93

00:04:43,140  -->  00:04:46,710
regulations called Reg F.D. or fair disclosure.

94

00:04:46,950  -->  00:04:49,880
You have the same access as everybody else.

95

00:04:50,220  -->  00:04:51,830
Name your rose cat.

96

00:04:52,140  -->  00:04:54,500
And this is what I mean.

97

00:04:54,510  -->  00:04:59,910
What you can do is you can highlight a row like Row 9 see and then go up to the top left corner of Excel

98

00:05:00,360  -->  00:05:01,270
and type in revenue.

99

00:05:01,440  -->  00:05:05,120
And that way it's like using English instead of code.

100

00:05:05,160  -->  00:05:07,040
Right and searcing divide.

101

00:05:07,170  -->  00:05:11,090
X by so why whenever you can say divide it by revenue.

102

00:05:11,220  -->  00:05:11,820
Right.

103

00:05:11,970  -->  00:05:12,990
And Eckels in your formulas
