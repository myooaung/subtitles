1

00:00:00,300  -->  00:00:03,660
Now that we know what an income statement is let's take a look at an example.

2

00:00:03,720  -->  00:00:08,940
And so it statements always start with revenue at the top and that's why they call it the top line.

3

00:00:08,940  -->  00:00:11,670
What's your top line at the bottom.

4

00:00:11,670  -->  00:00:14,370
Is earnings or net income that's called The bottom line.

5

00:00:14,370  -->  00:00:15,690
Because it's on the bottom.

6

00:00:16,080  -->  00:00:19,600
And so let's take a look at all of our expense items.

7

00:00:20,220  -->  00:00:26,040
And so we always start off with the first expense being the cost of goods sold which is basically what

8

00:00:26,040  -->  00:00:32,310
it costs us to make that stuff make our product and then revenue minus that cost is called gross profits

9

00:00:32,910  -->  00:00:38,490
and gross profits divided by revenues called gross margin that we have these three expenses which are

10

00:00:38,490  -->  00:00:44,730
expenses to operate our business and that sales and marketing research and development and general and

11

00:00:44,760  -->  00:00:46,260
administrative.

12

00:00:46,260  -->  00:00:48,640
And so whenever I don't know where to put something.

13

00:00:48,750  -->  00:00:50,870
Expense wise I just throw it in this bucket.

14

00:00:50,920  -->  00:00:52,180
That's G and A.

15

00:00:52,410  -->  00:00:58,970
And so revenue minus all these expenses so far is called operating profit or E.B.I.T.D.A.

16

00:00:59,250  -->  00:01:01,780
And it stands for earnings before interest.

17

00:01:01,910  -->  00:01:02,100
Right.

18

00:01:02,100  -->  00:01:07,420
Their taxes their depreciation and amortization there.

19

00:01:07,440  -->  00:01:14,430
And the reason we have this line item is because in many countries the interest rate and tax rates are

20

00:01:14,430  -->  00:01:16,680
different versus other countries.

21

00:01:16,680  -->  00:01:21,540
So how do we compare two companies that might be similar but are in different countries and have different

22

00:01:21,540  -->  00:01:23,070
tax rates and different interest rates.

23

00:01:23,070  -->  00:01:29,130
Well we look at this line here and I'll show you a lot more information on this later in the course

24

00:01:29,130  -->  00:01:31,210
when we model and value our companies.

25

00:01:31,470  -->  00:01:35,440
All right next up we have interest that we're paying on debt or interest we're receiving.

26

00:01:35,610  -->  00:01:38,000
And then we have depreciation and amortization.

27

00:01:38,130  -->  00:01:40,310
And these are non-cash items.

28

00:01:40,350  -->  00:01:45,360
And what that means is basically in the last lecture when we were talking about that truck.

29

00:01:45,420  -->  00:01:45,660
Right.

30

00:01:45,660  -->  00:01:51,630
So if we buy a truck or a piece of machinery the government is basically giving it a tax incentive to

31

00:01:51,630  -->  00:01:52,750
do that stuff.

32

00:01:52,770  -->  00:01:58,090
They're saying hey go spend money on cool new equipment and you'll pay less taxes.

33

00:01:58,110  -->  00:01:58,730
What does that mean.

34

00:01:58,740  -->  00:02:03,230
Well you'll pay less taxes because depreciation is a non-cash expense.

35

00:02:03,240  -->  00:02:08,540
It doesn't really exist but it's basically wear and tear on an annual basis on a machine or a truck

36

00:02:09,120  -->  00:02:10,530
and it makes your taxes less.

37

00:02:10,730  -->  00:02:13,190
And he's got profit before taxes and the taxes.

38

00:02:13,320  -->  00:02:19,230
And then here is net profit which is also called net income or just profit or just income it's all the

39

00:02:19,230  -->  00:02:20,470
same thing.

40

00:02:20,790  -->  00:02:26,960
And so earnings per share is just this earnings basically divided by the number of shares.

41

00:02:27,090  -->  00:02:28,850
And let's go through an example now.

42

00:02:29,190  -->  00:02:29,460
OK.

43

00:02:29,460  -->  00:02:35,360
So we're going to monitor what our income statement numbers were in 2014 and then 2015 and then we look

44

00:02:35,360  -->  00:02:40,200
at it all or change year over year and a percent change year over year and then we'll talk about whether

45

00:02:40,200  -->  00:02:43,980
or not that percent change is a concern or not.

46

00:02:43,980  -->  00:02:49,320
And the reason I really want to talk about this is when you're looking at financial statements I just

47

00:02:49,320  -->  00:02:51,050
want to look for trends in the data right.

48

00:02:51,110  -->  00:02:53,670
One data point does make a trend but a couple does.

49

00:02:53,820  -->  00:02:58,670
And later on in this course we'll do financial modeling financial modeling is really easy.

50

00:02:58,680  -->  00:03:00,260
It's basically predicting the future.

51

00:03:00,270  -->  00:03:02,120
What's the company going to look like in the future.

52

00:03:02,130  -->  00:03:03,730
What are their numbers going to be in the future.

53

00:03:04,050  -->  00:03:09,380
Well we'll cover this in great detail later but I want to put this on your radar screen right now.

54

00:03:09,540  -->  00:03:15,540
All you got to do is forecast all revenue numbers in the long run many many years from now and then

55

00:03:15,660  -->  00:03:20,430
almost every other line item on every financial statement becomes a percent of revenue and you're done

56

00:03:20,660  -->  00:03:21,200
right.

57

00:03:21,210  -->  00:03:24,380
It's really easy and he walked through that in more detail later.

58

00:03:24,660  -->  00:03:24,900
All right.

59

00:03:24,900  -->  00:03:26,880
Now let's take a look at the numbers.

60

00:03:27,010  -->  00:03:29,830
So let me just delete a couple of these boxes.

61

00:03:29,870  -->  00:03:36,180
OK so we've got our numbers there in there and we're going to be analyzing the year over year trends

62

00:03:36,190  -->  00:03:36,230
.

63

00:03:36,270  -->  00:03:40,360
OK so now look at that increase in earnings per share.

64

00:03:40,380  -->  00:03:41,040
Amazing.

65

00:03:41,040  -->  00:03:41,340
Amazing.

66

00:03:41,340  -->  00:03:41,840
Okay.

67

00:03:42,120  -->  00:03:45,990
And let me just uncover this so that dollar change year over year and I'll provide you with a spreadsheet

68

00:03:45,990  -->  00:03:47,900
as well if you want to play around with it.

69

00:03:48,390  -->  00:03:53,070
If you just double click it's that your mind is saying it's just that sort of thing it's pretty understand

70

00:03:53,080  -->  00:03:53,380
.

71

00:03:53,550  -->  00:03:57,450
And if I get rid of this box here this is a percent change over year.

72

00:03:57,660  -->  00:04:01,250
It's simply the percent change year over year from 14 to 15.

73

00:04:01,260  -->  00:04:02,890
So he tells of 14 to 15.

74

00:04:03,240  -->  00:04:04,710
And then we'll talk about it.

75

00:04:04,710  -->  00:04:07,690
Are any of these line items concerns or not and why.

76

00:04:08,170  -->  00:04:11,230
Okay so let's kick it off by analyzing revenue.

77

00:04:11,320  -->  00:04:12,110
Wow check that out.

78

00:04:12,110  -->  00:04:13,860
Man revenue increase.

79

00:04:13,860  -->  00:04:16,290
An astonishing 38 percent year over year.

80

00:04:16,290  -->  00:04:17,390
That's incredible.

81

00:04:17,610  -->  00:04:20,220
Let's look at the bottom line here is the bottom line.

82

00:04:20,760  -->  00:04:27,570
So we had a 133 percent increase wow in earnings.

83

00:04:27,720  -->  00:04:28,410
That's amazing.

84

00:04:28,410  -->  00:04:29,040
OK.

85

00:04:29,130  -->  00:04:37,230
Why the heck did net income increase 133 percent in revenue increased only 38 percent.

86

00:04:37,230  -->  00:04:38,340
It's a good thing it's amazing.

87

00:04:38,370  -->  00:04:40,050
Well let's find out why.

88

00:04:40,290  -->  00:04:46,230
Whenever you see that when we see net income or earnings or profits going up way higher than revenue

89

00:04:46,230  -->  00:04:51,130
on a percent basis we call that margin expansion or leverage in the model.

90

00:04:51,240  -->  00:04:52,140
Okay.

91

00:04:52,170  -->  00:04:59,060
And so the cost of goods sold me and the cost to make that stuff we sold only went up 17 percent.

92

00:04:59,190  -->  00:05:00,600
Wow that's incredible.

93

00:05:00,600  -->  00:05:03,270
It went up basically half as much as this.

94

00:05:03,270  -->  00:05:04,410
The revenue growth.

95

00:05:04,470  -->  00:05:07,980
So we're being much more efficient I guess in producing our product.

96

00:05:07,980  -->  00:05:10,510
Now let's look at sales and marketing and research and development.

97

00:05:10,530  -->  00:05:15,510
They both increase 20 percent which is about half of the revenue growth that's amazing so I guess that

98

00:05:15,510  -->  00:05:21,260
means our sales people were twice as effective as they were in the previous period.

99

00:05:21,810  -->  00:05:25,220
And then DNA increased only 13 percent that's even better.

100

00:05:25,230  -->  00:05:31,200
So you had even a smaller increase in general and administrative expenses yet a much bigger increase

101

00:05:31,200  -->  00:05:32,390
in revenue that's incredible.

102

00:05:32,700  -->  00:05:34,240
And then operating profit.

103

00:05:34,380  -->  00:05:39,440
My goodness look at that it grew over 100 percent that's incredible year over year leverage right.

104

00:05:39,540  -->  00:05:44,040
The Ebbitt or operating profits same thing grew over 100 percent here.

105

00:05:44,040  -->  00:05:50,230
And the reason it grew much faster than revenue is because the expenses grew at a much slower pace.

106

00:05:50,250  -->  00:05:50,520
Right.

107

00:05:50,520  -->  00:05:53,070
That's astonishing and it gets even better.

108

00:05:53,070  -->  00:05:55,940
Why is net income even better than operating profit.

109

00:05:56,340  -->  00:06:02,370
Well because our interest is lower it looks like we paid off five thousand five hundred dollars of our

110

00:06:02,490  -->  00:06:03,460
debt here.

111

00:06:03,570  -->  00:06:04,290
Right.

112

00:06:04,290  -->  00:06:05,300
That's incredible.

113

00:06:05,490  -->  00:06:10,650
And depreciation amortization is the same and our taxes remain.

114

00:06:10,650  -->  00:06:13,690
What does our tax rate at 25 percent.

115

00:06:13,780  -->  00:06:14,220
Right.

116

00:06:14,390  -->  00:06:15,000
Yeah yeah.

117

00:06:15,140  -->  00:06:15,590
Okay.

118

00:06:15,750  -->  00:06:23,250
So are our taxes the same and that is where you get the leverage from so this is an absolutely perfect

119

00:06:23,490  -->  00:06:29,970
perfect income statement and there's there's really no concerns there's no concerns at all.

120

00:06:29,970  -->  00:06:35,340
And before you go to the next lesson I want to show you one more thing we love to look at the rate of

121

00:06:35,340  -->  00:06:38,490
change and the percent of revenue for stuff.

122

00:06:38,490  -->  00:06:39,390
Check this out.

123

00:06:39,630  -->  00:06:40,590
OK.

124

00:06:40,590  -->  00:06:49,540
So it looks like our gross margin right which is gross profit divided by revenue.

125

00:06:49,650  -->  00:06:50,000
Right.

126

00:06:50,020  -->  00:06:51,320
I was double clicking that cell here.

127

00:06:51,350  -->  00:06:58,820
I'm sorry to that that my site and it's just that divided by that and see what I do I named my rose

128

00:06:58,820  -->  00:06:59,020
.

129

00:06:59,040  -->  00:06:59,260
Right.

130

00:06:59,250  -->  00:07:02,190
So right here I clicked on this and that's called revenue.

131

00:07:02,370  -->  00:07:06,240
And the reason I did that is because it just gets more intuitive.

132

00:07:06,330  -->  00:07:12,420
I can kind of speak English to excel by saying this divided by revenue instead of remembering that line

133

00:07:12,420  -->  00:07:12,900
there.

134

00:07:13,060  -->  00:07:16,630
And again you click in there and then you enter in whatever you want that text to be.

135

00:07:17,100  -->  00:07:17,600
OK.

136

00:07:17,730  -->  00:07:26,450
So our gross profit margin right went from 45 percent to 54 percent that's incredible.

137

00:07:27,180  -->  00:07:34,110
Let's look at the other margin numbers are operating profit margin or Ebbitt margin same thing went

138

00:07:34,110  -->  00:07:38,780
from 27 percent of revenue all the way up to 37 percent.

139

00:07:38,790  -->  00:07:40,350
That's incredible leverage.

140

00:07:40,410  -->  00:07:46,320
Great leverage and we'll cover margin structures in much more detail later in this course.

141

00:07:46,330  -->  00:07:53,280
Okay let's take a look at a couple of more line items so our profitability margins are improving materially

142

00:07:53,570  -->  00:07:53,970
now.

143

00:07:53,990  -->  00:07:56,040
Never before I said look at everything as a percent of revenue.

144

00:07:56,040  -->  00:07:57,600
Let's take that out.

145

00:07:57,630  -->  00:08:02,250
Well we already talked about this gross margins a percent of revenue so that each expense of sales and

146

00:08:02,250  -->  00:08:06,690
marketing as a percentage of revenue went from 9 percent down to 8 percent.

147

00:08:06,690  -->  00:08:07,410
That's incredible.

148

00:08:07,410  -->  00:08:07,650
Right.

149

00:08:07,650  -->  00:08:09,020
That's called leverage.

150

00:08:09,240  -->  00:08:14,820
And the same thing can be said for research and development right there as a percent of revenue.

151

00:08:14,910  -->  00:08:15,390
Right.

152

00:08:15,390  -->  00:08:17,780
It went down from 5 percent to 4 percent.

153

00:08:18,020  -->  00:08:18,340
Okay.

154

00:08:18,360  -->  00:08:20,590
And the same thing with GNN expenses.

155

00:08:20,640  -->  00:08:29,520
Right general minister I went from 7 to 6 so net net if we look at the year over year change in expenses

156

00:08:29,520  -->  00:08:35,610
they're way lower than the over change in revenue and we love to see that and stuff as a percent of

157

00:08:35,610  -->  00:08:41,250
revenue went down as well meaning expenses and that basically led to a lot of margin expansion and there's

158

00:08:41,310  -->  00:08:46,980
absolutely no issues with this income statement at all this is an absolutely perfect income statement
