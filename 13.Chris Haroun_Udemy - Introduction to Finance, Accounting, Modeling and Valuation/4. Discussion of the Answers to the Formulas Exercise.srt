1

00:00:00,330  -->  00:00:03,240
Let's look at the answers together for the formula exercise.

2

00:00:03,270  -->  00:00:07,470
Let's kick it off with these ones here and I'm sure he took all these off.

3

00:00:07,470  -->  00:00:10,650
Let's do it right now.

4

00:00:12,330  -->  00:00:14,210
All right cool.

5

00:00:14,280  -->  00:00:15,710
And we'll start off here.

6

00:00:15,870  -->  00:00:22,140
So before I go into too much detail here I want to talk about these formulas and so these are profitability

7

00:00:22,140  -->  00:00:27,060
formulas and they're from the income statement and the other reason I bring that up is because you start

8

00:00:27,060  -->  00:00:29,740
at the top gross margin than half way down.

9

00:00:29,760  -->  00:00:31,860
You look at operating margins right.

10

00:00:31,860  -->  00:00:35,640
How profitable is your business after deducting operating expenses.

11

00:00:35,910  -->  00:00:39,170
And then what's the bottom line profitability net profit margin on the bottom.

12

00:00:39,180  -->  00:00:43,980
These are from the income set and these ones here are awesome because they're from the income statement

13

00:00:44,220  -->  00:00:45,270
and the balance sheet.

14

00:00:45,330  -->  00:00:48,880
And this is basically telling you for every dollar in assets you have.

15

00:00:49,020  -->  00:00:50,460
How much money are you making.

16

00:00:50,820  -->  00:00:54,840
And for every dollar an equity you have how much money are you making net income.

17

00:00:55,380  -->  00:00:58,250
So these are profitability formulas.

18

00:00:58,560  -->  00:00:58,960
All right.

19

00:00:58,980  -->  00:01:03,580
And I include a couple of different years because I always got to look at trends in the data.

20

00:01:03,600  -->  00:01:06,350
One data point does make a trend but a couple does.

21

00:01:06,840  -->  00:01:09,360
All right.

22

00:01:09,360  -->  00:01:16,440
So gross margin improvement look at that 200 basis points each year member 100 basis points is 1 percent

23

00:01:16,530  -->  00:01:18,030
200 basis points each year.

24

00:01:18,030  -->  00:01:20,460
That's finance and or talk.

25

00:01:20,460  -->  00:01:20,820
All right.

26

00:01:20,820  -->  00:01:27,870
So I should probably freeze these pains and you go to view so on view unfreeze freeze panes that we

27

00:01:27,970  -->  00:01:29,450
got all.

28

00:01:29,490  -->  00:01:36,140
And let's actually because we're going to be looking at it's here for King 15:16 right.

29

00:01:36,390  -->  00:01:41,390
Cisco here I mean make it a bit bigger so we can also sorry about that.

30

00:01:41,460  -->  00:01:42,100
All right here go.

31

00:01:42,120  -->  00:01:45,520
So gross margins look at that getting better.

32

00:01:46,050  -->  00:01:47,580
And remember we are modeling this.

33

00:01:47,580  -->  00:01:53,170
We assumed it would just keep getting better because you take a couple of data points in the past and

34

00:01:53,220  -->  00:01:56,130
member an object in motion stays in motion.

35

00:01:56,130  -->  00:01:57,430
So it looks like it's improving.

36

00:01:57,500  -->  00:01:58,060
Okay.

37

00:01:58,590  -->  00:01:59,730
Done.

38

00:01:59,730  -->  00:02:02,490
Next step we've got operating margins.

39

00:02:03,350  -->  00:02:04,320
Okay.

40

00:02:05,040  -->  00:02:05,680
There you go.

41

00:02:05,850  -->  00:02:09,540
Well it's good get better to healthy looking chart ups.

42

00:02:09,710  -->  00:02:10,230
Okay.

43

00:02:10,740  -->  00:02:18,480
So operating margins we got down here and operating margins is just E.B.I.T.D.A. margins.

44

00:02:18,480  -->  00:02:19,070
Okay.

45

00:02:19,350  -->  00:02:22,710
And we could looked at non E.B.I.T.D.A. margins like this one here.

46

00:02:22,890  -->  00:02:30,060
And the reason I don't like doing that right is because this includes non-cash stuff like depreciation

47

00:02:30,210  -->  00:02:33,440
right into what I'm looking at profitability metrics.

48

00:02:33,450  -->  00:02:39,750
I like to look at as close to cash as possible and even that is close to the cash then not even the

49

00:02:40,170  -->  00:02:41,510
operating profit cut.

50

00:02:41,880  -->  00:02:47,740
So it's a pretty sales like most things and we improve from 37 to 42 to 47 that's great.

51

00:02:47,860  -->  00:02:48,780
That's great.

52

00:02:48,840  -->  00:02:51,690
What is driving that improvement in operating profit.

53

00:02:51,780  -->  00:02:55,400
Let's see here sales marketing pro-development.

54

00:02:55,460  -->  00:03:02,810
Okay sales and marketing is improving a percent each year looks like all three of them are kind of almost

55

00:03:02,820  -->  00:03:04,090
equally helping out.

56

00:03:04,340  -->  00:03:04,770
Okay.

57

00:03:04,890  -->  00:03:06,420
That's called leverage in model.

58

00:03:06,420  -->  00:03:08,680
Great.

59

00:03:08,790  -->  00:03:12,260
So let's go back here then what is the net profits.

60

00:03:12,870  -->  00:03:18,360
And that's obviously at the bottom it looks like it's getting well really good really good.

61

00:03:18,360  -->  00:03:22,550
And what's interesting here is you can tell that this one is usually lower than that and this one's

62

00:03:22,560  -->  00:03:23,300
usually lower than that.

63

00:03:23,310  -->  00:03:27,730
And the obvious reason is because up here you've only deducted one expense line.

64

00:03:27,840  -->  00:03:34,920
It's gross you know gross profits are caskets Walsh said and here you deducting caskets sold as well

65

00:03:34,920  -->  00:03:38,740
as sales of market research development in R&D.

66

00:03:39,210  -->  00:03:43,580
And down here you're deducting all that stuff I just mentioned plus taxes and interest.

67

00:03:43,590  -->  00:03:44,260
Okay.

68

00:03:44,610  -->  00:03:49,260
So 23 percent net profit margins let's go here and check it out.

69

00:03:49,780  -->  00:03:51,920
Right down we go here.

70

00:03:52,590  -->  00:03:57,150
Okay so we've got some to get a lot better with that each year we ran it up to 30 there.

71

00:03:57,340  -->  00:04:01,360
Okay crates.

72

00:04:01,410  -->  00:04:05,590
Next up we've got what's the return on assets that's net income divided by assets.

73

00:04:05,590  -->  00:04:08,780
And what's the return on equity that's net income divided by equity.

74

00:04:08,810  -->  00:04:10,550
It looks like this has cost us down.

75

00:04:10,560  -->  00:04:13,260
I'm not too worried not to worry that kind of looks on change.

76

00:04:13,300  -->  00:04:14,760
Anyway is going here.

77

00:04:14,930  -->  00:04:15,930
Let's return on equity

78

00:04:19,540  -->  00:04:22,250
Calix say return equity is getting a bit worse.

79

00:04:22,290  -->  00:04:24,370
Inventory days on hand.

80

00:04:24,570  -->  00:04:28,650
Can you believe that shows still on TV.

81

00:04:28,980  -->  00:04:31,020
This is amazing.

82

00:04:31,050  -->  00:04:32,030
Ok cool.

83

00:04:32,160  -->  00:04:32,780
All right.

84

00:04:32,850  -->  00:04:36,650
83 days on hand to 90 to nine nines a bit of a concern.

85

00:04:36,660  -->  00:04:41,420
It is a concern but given our amazing profitability is not the end of the world.

86

00:04:41,700  -->  00:04:41,960
All right.

87

00:04:41,970  -->  00:04:46,070
So we've got 99 days of amatory on hand.

88

00:04:46,470  -->  00:04:48,660
Our profitability is pretty decent.

89

00:04:48,660  -->  00:04:50,510
I'm not too worried about it.

90

00:04:50,550  -->  00:04:53,520
And then we've got debt to assets.

91

00:04:53,520  -->  00:04:53,950
Right.

92

00:04:53,970  -->  00:04:55,310
We're looking at tunnelled that

93

00:04:59,040  -->  00:05:04,470
debt to equity and debt Tass that's very similar to these formulas here.

94

00:05:04,500  -->  00:05:04,740
Right.

95

00:05:04,740  -->  00:05:08,140
Except you don't have the income saved in corporate.

96

00:05:08,470  -->  00:05:08,820
All right.

97

00:05:08,820  -->  00:05:13,440
So we know how much debt we're finds actually going down very healthy debt to equity.

98

00:05:13,440  -->  00:05:14,530
It's healthy as well.

99

00:05:14,670  -->  00:05:15,800
We're in good shape here.

100

00:05:15,810  -->  00:05:17,510
We are a healthy company.

101

00:05:17,580  -->  00:05:18,470
All right.

102

00:05:18,470  -->  00:05:22,260
And then we've got the price earnings based on this dude here.

103

00:05:22,440  -->  00:05:25,480
I mean just get rid of all these at the same time for us.

104

00:05:25,880  -->  00:05:28,150
OK.

105

00:05:28,680  -->  00:05:34,640
So price earnings getting dramatically better because we are a high growth company very healthy.

106

00:05:34,800  -->  00:05:35,740
What's our peg.

107

00:05:35,760  -->  00:05:37,120
This is ridiculously low.

108

00:05:37,120  -->  00:05:43,890
Look at that bargain bargain you'll never see rarely see a pegged that low anything under one's a screaming

109

00:05:43,890  -->  00:05:44,250
bias.

110

00:05:44,250  -->  00:05:49,650
You obviously know I like this company a recovery us as we just met up price to revenue looks pretty

111

00:05:49,650  -->  00:05:52,830
darn cheap as well given the growth rates.

112

00:05:53,040  -->  00:05:55,750
But it looks decent decent Right.

113

00:05:55,800  -->  00:06:04,810
But obviously even if it is higher than price earnings because you've got it that doesn't include a

114

00:06:04,830  -->  00:06:08,610
lot of the expenses that we have a net earnings here.

115

00:06:08,940  -->  00:06:12,340
And so even you but is remember investment bankers love it.

116

00:06:12,370  -->  00:06:17,850
But in sort of big companies corporate finance departments because big companies have corporate finance

117

00:06:17,850  -->  00:06:20,040
departments are looking to buy other companies.

118

00:06:20,040  -->  00:06:26,850
And the reason we look at it that it's our favorite formula is because the enterprise value is market

119

00:06:26,850  -->  00:06:31,890
cap plus debt minus cash and short term investments and what that means is this if you're looking to

120

00:06:31,890  -->  00:06:38,430
buy a company that is publicly traded you get to pay for it well you're not going to pay whatever the

121

00:06:38,430  -->  00:06:42,230
stock is out on the market usually plus 30 percent that's a going rate usually.

122

00:06:42,780  -->  00:06:47,040
And then what you do is you figure oh gosh I got to figure if they have decks are going to pay that

123

00:06:47,040  -->  00:06:47,870
debt back.

124

00:06:48,150  -->  00:06:54,120
So I'll add the debt and then you're like well if I add the debt I could probably pay back some of that

125

00:06:54,120  -->  00:06:57,410
debt with some of the cash and short term investments have on hand.

126

00:06:57,630  -->  00:06:59,690
So let me deduct cash and short term assets.

127

00:06:59,730  -->  00:07:05,090
That's why you look at that right and if you work in M&A this is more important to you than this.

128

00:07:05,130  -->  00:07:06,000
Right.

129

00:07:06,120  -->  00:07:10,710
And you always assume at least a 30 percent increase in the price of the company in the market cap at

130

00:07:10,710  -->  00:07:13,520
least when you're looking at a potential like this.

131

00:07:13,980  -->  00:07:14,360
OK.

132

00:07:14,430  -->  00:07:18,290
A sales looks looks pretty good as well.

133

00:07:19,710  -->  00:07:22,990
And also we have price to be cash flow it looks healthy as well.

134

00:07:23,280  -->  00:07:28,560
It's pretty got a lot of high growth companies like ours here don't have free cash flow or it's very

135

00:07:28,560  -->  00:07:28,760
low.

136

00:07:28,760  -->  00:07:31,220
We're in healthy shape here.

137

00:07:32,130  -->  00:07:36,880
Price to book is attractive because we're a growth stock.

138

00:07:36,970  -->  00:07:39,200
Our company is not cheap right.

139

00:07:39,390  -->  00:07:42,630
And that's why our price to book is way way way above 1.

140

00:07:43,530  -->  00:07:46,560
All rights and I right here.

141

00:07:46,640  -->  00:07:52,080
Company X is the biggest competitor of the company that we are analyzing in this exercise and has the

142

00:07:52,080  -->  00:07:54,740
following three competition metrics.

143

00:07:55,050  -->  00:07:59,550
Okay so comp company X is our biggest enemy.

144

00:07:59,550  -->  00:08:04,080
That one's got a P of some point nine times each year.

145

00:08:04,390  -->  00:08:04,760
Okay.

146

00:08:04,800  -->  00:08:07,710
I guess earnings aren't growing right.

147

00:08:07,830  -->  00:08:11,740
Debt to equity for that company is 99 percent US.

148

00:08:11,880  -->  00:08:13,450
It's pretty darn high.

149

00:08:13,680  -->  00:08:19,610
And the net profit margin for all three years is 10 percent.

150

00:08:20,500  -->  00:08:21,230
OK.

151

00:08:21,720  -->  00:08:23,200
They got a heck of a lot of debt.

152

00:08:23,400  -->  00:08:26,850
Way more now with our debt issue anyway.

153

00:08:27,960  -->  00:08:30,030
We're at WOW or we're really low man.

154

00:08:30,300  -->  00:08:31,450
OK.

155

00:08:31,620  -->  00:08:32,370
OK.

156

00:08:32,760  -->  00:08:38,250
And their net profit margin is 10 percent when we had the profit margin.

157

00:08:38,250  -->  00:08:41,570
Now we're kicking their butts and we're growing too.

158

00:08:41,830  -->  00:08:43,080
Right.

159

00:08:43,650  -->  00:08:45,050
This means they're not growing.

160

00:08:45,100  -->  00:08:46,630
They have a lot to and they're not growing.

161

00:08:46,650  -->  00:08:48,310
What's the peg of the company.

162

00:08:48,390  -->  00:08:49,240
Right.

163

00:08:49,810  -->  00:08:57,360
So 16 I don't think it's really a placable because there's no growth used to be divided by zero.

164

00:08:57,360  -->  00:08:58,020
We're not here

165

00:09:00,970  -->  00:09:02,170
yet.

166

00:09:02,190  -->  00:09:04,340
Zero no growth based on the P.

167

00:09:04,410  -->  00:09:09,280
Is this a better investment than a.

168

00:09:09,960  -->  00:09:15,400
I would say our company is a better investment because they're at seven point nine times right.

169

00:09:15,420  -->  00:09:18,160
But there's no growth.

170

00:09:18,270  -->  00:09:22,650
So if there's there's some point i'm times for all three years in a row and they're probably not going

171

00:09:22,650  -->  00:09:27,630
to go next year and you're after then in a year or two will be cheaper than them anyway.

172

00:09:27,630  -->  00:09:28,000
Right.

173

00:09:28,050  -->  00:09:29,190
Let's show you.

174

00:09:29,820  -->  00:09:30,150
OK.

175

00:09:30,150  -->  00:09:34,130
So if we go up to here we're right here.

176

00:09:35,110  -->  00:09:35,720
Sorry about that.

177

00:09:35,880  -->  00:09:36,090
OK.

178

00:09:36,090  -->  00:09:37,420
So we're right here.

179

00:09:37,760  -->  00:09:42,660
But this has fallen by 50 percent every year right now.

180

00:09:42,870  -->  00:09:47,750
So that means next year if the stock stays flat probably won't but if it does that means we'll be at

181

00:09:47,760  -->  00:09:51,610
like eight a point four times and then 4.2 times etc..

182

00:09:51,630  -->  00:09:54,810
So no way man we're way better investment than this one.

183

00:09:54,810  -->  00:09:58,090
That one's not growing trap.

184

00:09:58,170  -->  00:09:59,090
All right.

185

00:09:59,430  -->  00:10:03,300
Is the debt to equity of X better than the company we're looking at.

186

00:10:03,300  -->  00:10:05,250
No way no way.

187

00:10:05,250  -->  00:10:06,730
Their debt is 99 percent.

188

00:10:06,730  -->  00:10:08,250
Ours is single digits

189

00:10:11,120  -->  00:10:17,620
is a net profit margin for this company better than ours.

190

00:10:17,640  -->  00:10:20,540
No 10 percent we're way higher.

191

00:10:20,870  -->  00:10:21,140
All right.

192

00:10:21,150  -->  00:10:22,100
There you go.

193

00:10:22,140  -->  00:10:23,850
That's the conclusion of the excess
