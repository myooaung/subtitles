1

00:00:02,640  -->  00:00:06,720
Financial model exercise introduction we're getting there.

2

00:00:06,730  -->  00:00:12,450
OK so by the end of this section you'll understand how to forecast an income statement a balance sheet

3

00:00:12,570  -->  00:00:14,370
and the cash flow statement.

4

00:00:14,910  -->  00:00:16,150
So what are we going to do.

5

00:00:16,170  -->  00:00:19,170
We're going to model the three aforementioned financial statements.

6

00:00:19,170  -->  00:00:19,720
OK.

7

00:00:19,770  -->  00:00:24,300
And you'll have a good understanding of how the three statements worked together as well.

8

00:00:24,300  -->  00:00:25,670
There's a link between all of them.

9

00:00:25,740  -->  00:00:26,650
OK.

10

00:00:27,240  -->  00:00:31,890
In terms of why we're doing this well we know so that we can move on to the next section after modeling

11

00:00:31,920  -->  00:00:33,120
which is valuation.

12

00:00:33,270  -->  00:00:39,500
So we can find a target price for the company that we're analyzing and in terms of how we're going to

13

00:00:39,500  -->  00:00:42,040
do this well we're going to continue to use Excel.

14

00:00:42,080  -->  00:00:46,170
We're going to use the financial modeling skills that I've taught you in this course.

15

00:00:46,320  -->  00:00:51,780
And so that instead of eating watermelon like a boss you'll be able to modify initials like a boss.
