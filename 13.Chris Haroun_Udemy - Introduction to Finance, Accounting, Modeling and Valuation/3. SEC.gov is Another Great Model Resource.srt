1

00:00:00,360  -->  00:00:03,040
Now let's talk about ESI seacock in more detail.

2

00:00:03,190  -->  00:00:08,490
OK and we can use LinkedIn as an example because this is our case study in this course.

3

00:00:08,490  -->  00:00:13,810
So there's a number of different filings that companies have to file with SCC dot gov.

4

00:00:13,860  -->  00:00:14,310
OK.

5

00:00:14,370  -->  00:00:20,740
In fact every copy has publicly traded has to submit files on a regular basis to FCC dot gov so that

6

00:00:20,740  -->  00:00:26,250
you and I have the same access information for free that all the large hedge funds and mutual funds

7

00:00:26,250  -->  00:00:26,970
do.

8

00:00:27,510  -->  00:00:30,600
So there's a bunch of different reports let me kick it off with the 10-Q.

9

00:00:30,810  -->  00:00:35,040
This is a quarterly report and I'll show you an example in a couple of slides of this.

10

00:00:35,040  -->  00:00:41,220
Companies have to file this quarterly and then there's an annual report called a 10-K 10-Q is Coralee

11

00:00:41,490  -->  00:00:42,450
10-Ks annual.

12

00:00:42,570  -->  00:00:43,080
OK.

13

00:00:43,200  -->  00:00:46,620
And these are just lengthy reports that will tell you everything needs to know about a company.

14

00:00:46,620  -->  00:00:46,920
Right.

15

00:00:46,920  -->  00:00:50,450
The finance stuff the quality of stuff the management team the risks.

16

00:00:50,460  -->  00:00:53,930
There's lots of lawyers in this country which is why all the risks are disclosed.

17

00:00:54,000  -->  00:00:55,130
It's not about them.

18

00:00:55,770  -->  00:00:56,100
OK.

19

00:00:56,100  -->  00:01:01,320
And then an AK is basically a very important press release that has material information that might

20

00:01:01,320  -->  00:01:02,160
move the stock.

21

00:01:02,250  -->  00:01:02,910
Right.

22

00:01:02,940  -->  00:01:10,500
They'll file press releases like this directly on sec dot gov called 8K and then you have an s one document

23

00:01:10,500  -->  00:01:12,080
which is one of my favorite ones.

24

00:01:12,120  -->  00:01:18,420
And this is basically an IPO prospectus and what that means is this when a company goes public investment

25

00:01:18,420  -->  00:01:22,520
bankers write a lengthy document that will tell you everything you know about the company.

26

00:01:22,740  -->  00:01:26,620
So you can make an informed investment decision as to whether or not to invest.

27

00:01:26,730  -->  00:01:27,020
OK.

28

00:01:27,030  -->  00:01:32,840
All this information is free and then there's a bunch of other filings called the three four or five

29

00:01:32,880  -->  00:01:33,630
and 13-D.

30

00:01:33,630  -->  00:01:38,850
This basically tells you who owns the shares or which executives at the company might have been selling

31

00:01:38,850  -->  00:01:40,080
shares or buying shares.

32

00:01:40,080  -->  00:01:40,970
OK.

33

00:01:41,370  -->  00:01:42,300
All right.

34

00:01:42,450  -->  00:01:44,090
Let's now go to Iraq.

35

00:01:44,120  -->  00:01:48,660
Gov and I will show you how to navigate documents for Linked In.

36

00:01:48,780  -->  00:01:54,630
This is your one stop shop for all information need to know about financials on the company you're analyzing

37

00:01:54,650  -->  00:01:54,890
.

38

00:01:55,110  -->  00:01:59,450
OK so so click here for company filings.

39

00:02:00,630  -->  00:02:04,990
And then here I like to always enter in the Ticker it's faster.

40

00:02:05,010  -->  00:02:06,810
L and K D.

41

00:02:07,180  -->  00:02:07,680
Fairlington

42

00:02:10,380  -->  00:02:14,680
and there's just a wealth of information here and this is sorted by date.

43

00:02:14,740  -->  00:02:15,390
Okay.

44

00:02:15,690  -->  00:02:20,820
And an 8 K as I mentioned earlier means a material for important press release.

45

00:02:20,940  -->  00:02:26,540
This is the quarterly report called the 10-Q and this is an awesome one called The 10 k.

46

00:02:26,580  -->  00:02:27,150
Right.

47

00:02:27,450  -->  00:02:32,600
And before we do any of this let me do a search on the S one.

48

00:02:32,610  -->  00:02:40,870
So when a company goes public by law they have to file what's called an s one.

49

00:02:40,990  -->  00:02:41,820
OK.

50

00:02:41,880  -->  00:02:45,180
And LinkedIn went public I think was during the summer of 2011.

51

00:02:45,180  -->  00:02:49,260
So a couple of months before they go public they usually file the last one.

52

00:02:49,290  -->  00:02:53,330
Let's take a look and let's click here.

53

00:02:53,670  -->  00:02:59,400
And the last one is amazing because it basically tells you everything you need to know about a company

54

00:02:59,880  -->  00:03:05,940
before you consider investing and there's so many lawyers in the U.S. which makes sure that every risk

55

00:03:05,940  -->  00:03:09,960
is listed in this document which is a good thing for investors of course.

56

00:03:09,960  -->  00:03:10,780
OK.

57

00:03:11,190  -->  00:03:16,170
So this is what an IPO filing prospectus looks like.

58

00:03:16,170  -->  00:03:21,730
And so Morgan Stanley was the leader OK on this IPO.

59

00:03:21,960  -->  00:03:27,540
That's called Top left top right or the second and lead on this IPO is J.P. Morgan and these are the

60

00:03:27,540  -->  00:03:29,640
other firms that were involved.

61

00:03:29,670  -->  00:03:35,520
So usually you get a pretty cool visual understanding what the business is in the first couple of slides

62

00:03:35,520  -->  00:03:38,630
here for an S1 and then you jump right into the text.

63

00:03:38,700  -->  00:03:38,960
Right.

64

00:03:38,970  -->  00:03:44,190
And you can read about the risk factors the use of proceeds from the IPO what would they do with all

65

00:03:44,190  -->  00:03:44,910
that cash.

66

00:03:44,940  -->  00:03:45,690
Right.

67

00:03:45,720  -->  00:03:49,220
You can learn all but the management team the business model et cetera.

68

00:03:49,230  -->  00:03:51,900
It's just an incredible document right.

69

00:03:51,900  -->  00:03:57,360
Legal issues as well and all the financial stuff you need to know exactly compensation.

70

00:03:57,360  -->  00:03:58,460
All good stuff.

71

00:03:58,710  -->  00:04:05,080
Let me go back and just take a look at the most recent filing for the annual report which is the 10-K

72

00:04:06,000  -->  00:04:06,820
and.

73

00:04:06,910  -->  00:04:08,490
OK go.

74

00:04:09,240  -->  00:04:10,200
OK cool.

75

00:04:10,200  -->  00:04:16,200
So since the company's long in public since 2011 it doesn't have that many annual reports filed the

76

00:04:16,200  -->  00:04:19,350
most recent one was filed in February of 2016.

77

00:04:19,350  -->  00:04:20,980
Let's take a look.

78

00:04:21,990  -->  00:04:23,830
Let's open it up here.

79

00:04:24,630  -->  00:04:26,880
And this document is amazing.

80

00:04:26,890  -->  00:04:30,630
I mean you've got everything you need to know about the company listed here.

81

00:04:30,630  -->  00:04:33,760
This is a great way for you to get up to speed on a company.

82

00:04:33,840  -->  00:04:38,790
You can read all about the business the risk factors everything you need to know right and of course

83

00:04:38,790  -->  00:04:40,640
lots of financial stuff.

84

00:04:40,650  -->  00:04:40,970
All right.

85

00:04:40,970  -->  00:04:44,340
So they always kick it off with what is their business.

86

00:04:44,340  -->  00:04:44,730
Right.

87

00:04:44,760  -->  00:04:48,880
They are the world's largest professional network or 4 million subscribers.

88

00:04:48,880  -->  00:04:50,350
Yadi at all good stuff.

89

00:04:50,430  -->  00:04:53,260
And here's where you go to find out more about the competition.

90

00:04:53,340  -->  00:04:53,610
Right.

91

00:04:53,610  -->  00:04:59,160
So they mentioned that Facebook is a competitor Google to lesser extent Microsoft and Twitter.

92

00:04:59,190  -->  00:05:02,930
I don't really think that LinkedIn has any credible competition.

93

00:05:02,940  -->  00:05:09,000
And I actually can't think of another technology company out there that doesn't have any competition

94

00:05:09,000  -->  00:05:09,780
literally.

95

00:05:09,810  -->  00:05:14,470
I mean Google obviously is dominant in search but some people still use Yahoo.

96

00:05:14,520  -->  00:05:16,050
I don't know who they are but they do.

97

00:05:16,150  -->  00:05:18,340
And on some people use Bing whatever from Microsoft.

98

00:05:18,350  -->  00:05:21,250
But but LinkedIn really doesn't have much competition.

99

00:05:21,270  -->  00:05:22,110
It's incredible.

100

00:05:22,110  -->  00:05:26,910
Here they talk about seasonality in the business which means some quarters are better than others.

101

00:05:27,660  -->  00:05:30,280
And then we get into risk factors here.

102

00:05:30,420  -->  00:05:33,870
And one of the risk highlighted his security right.

103

00:05:34,090  -->  00:05:35,870
There's Web attacks all the time.

104

00:05:36,270  -->  00:05:38,460
Here's another risk which is mobile.

105

00:05:38,520  -->  00:05:43,260
I find that sometimes the mobile apps I've used in the past LinkedIn weren't that robust although it

106

00:05:43,260  -->  00:05:44,640
is getting a lot better now.

107

00:05:44,640  -->  00:05:46,410
And let's go back to the table of contents.

108

00:05:46,440  -->  00:05:50,010
OK so we we looked in the business learned a little bit about the risks.

109

00:05:50,010  -->  00:05:55,890
I always recommend reading the management discussion and analysis of the financial condition of the

110

00:05:55,890  -->  00:05:56,690
company.

111

00:05:56,760  -->  00:05:57,350
Right.

112

00:05:57,510  -->  00:06:02,460
And you can read through this if you want but here is where they disclose more information on how each

113

00:06:02,460  -->  00:06:07,560
region is doing and recall that was also in the earnings press release when we went to investor relations

114

00:06:07,680  -->  00:06:08,280
.

115

00:06:09,080  -->  00:06:13,680
And there's a lot of great data in here that's also included in the earnings press releases.

116

00:06:13,920  -->  00:06:17,380
But this has much more additional details.

117

00:06:17,460  -->  00:06:22,770
And here we have revenue by product and here's where we can go to read more about the financial statements

118

00:06:22,790  -->  00:06:22,930
.

119

00:06:23,130  -->  00:06:27,540
But we covered a lot of this in the Investor Relations section in this course but this is actually a

120

00:06:27,540  -->  00:06:28,350
good resource.

121

00:06:28,350  -->  00:06:34,920
If you can't get historical data going back many years on some companies right so sometimes they only

122

00:06:34,920  -->  00:06:37,820
provide a couple of years of data on the Investor Relations Web site.

123

00:06:37,830  -->  00:06:43,290
But you can always go to talk of and look back as far as you can and here's what we can read more about

124

00:06:43,290  -->  00:06:44,930
the management team right.

125

00:06:44,950  -->  00:06:48,060
Can they even actually disclose the salaries or know why they do that.

126

00:06:48,060  -->  00:06:53,630
But anyway it's there and that is a 10-K and there's just a wealth of additional information on sec dot gov

127

00:06:53,870  -->  00:06:54,190
.

128

00:06:54,390  -->  00:07:02,140
If you have any questions about different filings please let me know.
