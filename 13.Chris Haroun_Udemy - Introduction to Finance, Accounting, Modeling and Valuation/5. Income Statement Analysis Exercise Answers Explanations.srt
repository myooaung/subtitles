1

00:00:00,300  -->  00:00:03,190
Let's discuss the answers to the income statement exercise.

2

00:00:03,300  -->  00:00:03,710
OK.

3

00:00:03,720  -->  00:00:06,420
So let's just look at trends in the data.

4

00:00:06,420  -->  00:00:08,960
So I'll kick it off with the top line which is revenue.

5

00:00:09,240  -->  00:00:16,570
So it looks like revenue decreased 120000 or so year over year down 8 percent.

6

00:00:16,680  -->  00:00:18,190
That's obviously a concern.

7

00:00:18,300  -->  00:00:20,780
It's always a concern when revenue declines.

8

00:00:20,800  -->  00:00:23,970
Let's take a look at the cost of goods sold or the cost.

9

00:00:23,970  -->  00:00:26,330
It took us to produce our stuff.

10

00:00:26,830  -->  00:00:28,990
And wow that's brutal.

11

00:00:29,310  -->  00:00:30,300
OK look at that.

12

00:00:30,300  -->  00:00:35,590
We had an increase of 14 percent year over year in the cost of goods sold despite the fact that revenue

13

00:00:35,590  -->  00:00:36,810
was down.

14

00:00:37,170  -->  00:00:41,740
So obviously that's concern the cost of make our product increases despite a decrease in revenue.

15

00:00:42,540  -->  00:00:49,350
And then gross profit obviously is down as well because that's just a formula that minus that revenue

16

00:00:49,350  -->  00:00:56,520
minus the cost to produce that stuff for Coggs concern sales and marketing increased at a pace of 17

17

00:00:56,520  -->  00:00:57,890
percent year over year.

18

00:00:57,900  -->  00:01:04,620
Frightening because revenue is down 8 percent but this expense item was up 17 percent year over year

19

00:01:04,800  -->  00:01:06,160
and it gets worse.

20

00:01:06,300  -->  00:01:11,900
R&D was up 33 percent year over year despite an 8 percent decline in revenue.

21

00:01:11,910  -->  00:01:13,870
Gina was bad as well.

22

00:01:13,920  -->  00:01:23,310
And so what happens is our operating profit margin went down from 37 percent to 20 percent.

23

00:01:23,310  -->  00:01:29,910
Leverage can work against you big time as well so we have a 50 percent decline year over year in our

24

00:01:29,910  -->  00:01:36,480
operating profit despite a revenue decline of only 8 percent and it looks like we took on more debt

25

00:01:36,480  -->  00:01:36,990
here.

26

00:01:36,990  -->  00:01:37,320
Right.

27

00:01:37,320  -->  00:01:41,250
So we're paying $10000 more in interest.

28

00:01:41,250  -->  00:01:48,780
So we had a spike in our profit before taxes was down 58 percent year over year which is worse than

29

00:01:48,780  -->  00:01:53,550
the operating profit year over year decline because of the increase in interest.

30

00:01:53,550  -->  00:01:54,270
Okay.

31

00:01:54,660  -->  00:02:00,010
And then so are our net income was actually down 58 percent your Veeru still positive.

32

00:02:00,120  -->  00:02:00,340
Right.

33

00:02:00,340  -->  00:02:02,660
One hundred fifty seven thousand eight hundred seventy five.

34

00:02:02,850  -->  00:02:05,840
But it decreased that much year over year.

35

00:02:05,850  -->  00:02:12,180
So Ouch 58 percent decline year over year in earnings per share or net income same thing or net profit

36

00:02:12,180  -->  00:02:12,820
same thing.

37

00:02:13,230  -->  00:02:16,210
Despite the fact that revenue is only down 8 percent.

38

00:02:16,440  -->  00:02:22,170
So the results from this exercise is basically the opposite from when we looked at the income statement

39

00:02:22,170  -->  00:02:22,250
.

40

00:02:22,320  -->  00:02:28,710
Example right in the example there is no concerns but in this case there are many concerns obviously

41

00:02:28,710  -->  00:02:34,110
so play around with the data like DoubleClick on different entries and just see how how we got to those

42

00:02:34,110  -->  00:02:37,260
numbers and how all of this flows through.

43

00:02:37,530  -->  00:02:42,390
That's the best way for you to really learn and master the whole income statement process.

44

00:02:42,390  -->  00:02:47,370
And now that we have this nailed what we can do is go on to talk about the balance sheet.

45

00:02:47,850  -->  00:02:53,160
And then much much later in the course after we understand financials perfectly well we'll talk about

46

00:02:53,160  -->  00:02:56,530
modeling and then we'll talk about valuation which is a lot of fun
