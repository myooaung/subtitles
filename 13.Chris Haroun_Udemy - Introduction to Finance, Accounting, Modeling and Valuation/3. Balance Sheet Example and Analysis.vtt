00:00:00.660  -->  00:00:07.740
Let's talk about the balance sheet and so the balance sheet has assets at the top and assets must equal

2

00:00:07.740  -->  00:00:09.460
liabilities plus equity.

3

00:00:09.600  -->  00:00:14.030
And so let's get rid of these guys here.

4

00:00:14.040  -->  00:00:14.310
All right.

5

00:00:14.310  -->  00:00:23.310
So underneath assets we have current assets in long term assets and current assets are sorted by stuff

6

00:00:23.310  -->  00:00:29.910
we can convert to cash first and stuff that takes us longer to convert to cash so cash can obviously

7

00:00:29.910  -->  00:00:36.720
be converted to itself right away and then comes short term investments which could be Treasury bills

8

00:00:37.560  -->  00:00:43.170
and then accounts receivable meaning money that's owed to us by customers so instead of a customer paying

9

00:00:43.170  -->  00:00:48.450
us cash for something we basically told hey don't worry about it you can pay me in 27 or 28 days from

10

00:00:48.450  -->  00:00:49.010
now.

11

00:00:49.290  -->  00:00:53.070
And so we're actually at a cash deficit because of that.

12

00:00:53.100  -->  00:00:53.670
Don't worry.

13

00:00:53.670  -->  00:00:54.520
That doesn't make sense.

14

00:00:54.530  -->  00:00:57.200
We'll cover that in the cash flow section next section.

15

00:00:57.720  -->  00:01:04.710
And then we have inventories here and so current assets are stuffed with it to cash in less than one

16

00:01:04.800  -->  00:01:05.510
year.

17

00:01:05.850  -->  00:01:11.890
Long term assets is stuff that will most likely take us longer than one year to convert into cash.

18

00:01:12.230  -->  00:01:14.990
And so we already talked about depreciation.

19

00:01:15.360  -->  00:01:22.500
But what we do on the balance sheet is we list what our asset is valued at today meaning after we subtracted

20

00:01:22.890  -->  00:01:25.630
all of the depreciation from prior years.

21

00:01:25.680  -->  00:01:26.230
Okay.

22

00:01:26.520  -->  00:01:27.350
So that's assets.

23

00:01:27.350  -->  00:01:30.760
And so total assets is basically current assets plus long term US.

24

00:01:31.170  -->  00:01:37.650
Let's move on to liquidity and equity and we group these together because assets always has equal liabilities

25

00:01:37.680  -->  00:01:39.470
plus equity.

26

00:01:40.570  -->  00:01:47.580
So in the liability section we have accounts payable which basically means money we owe to other people

27

00:01:47.580  -->  00:01:48.420
today.

28

00:01:48.600  -->  00:01:55.860
And I always encourage companies to pay their bills as late as possible without incurring a penalty

29

00:01:55.860  -->  00:01:55.890
.

30

00:01:55.890  -->  00:02:03.180
And the reason is that you need to think of yourself as a bank because if you pay your bills as late

31

00:02:03.180  -->  00:02:09.390
as you can without incurring interest expenses or penalties then you get to collect that little bit

32

00:02:09.390  -->  00:02:13.540
of interest on that cash until you pay it back in.

33

00:02:13.620  -->  00:02:17.850
I know interest rates are low today so it doesn't seem to matter but it does matter when interest rates

34

00:02:17.880  -->  00:02:25.620
are 12 percent or so are much higher because if you think about it if you paid all of your debts right

35

00:02:26.280  -->  00:02:28.970
one or two days before they were do instead of read again the month.

36

00:02:28.980  -->  00:02:33.930
So if you paid them at the end of month then what that would mean is you would save 1 percent every

37

00:02:33.930  -->  00:02:37.120
month times 12 months as 12 percent that's a big deal.

38

00:02:37.140  -->  00:02:38.440
It's a big deal.

39

00:02:39.030  -->  00:02:45.600
And we have short term debt and these items here are due in less than one year and then similar to long

40

00:02:45.600  -->  00:02:51.120
term assets when it comes to long term liabilities long term debt is stuff or debt that's due in greater

41

00:02:51.110  -->  00:02:55.770
than one year and so total liabilities of course equals current liabilities plus long term liabilities

42

00:02:55.770  -->  00:02:56.040
.

43

00:02:56.040  -->  00:03:02.490
Let's move on equity to K equity is composed of a couple of items retained earnings which basically

44

00:03:02.700  -->  00:03:05.850
this is actually the link between the income statement and the balance sheet.

45

00:03:05.850  -->  00:03:10.590
They talk to each other because you have earnings and you retainer and it's right you don't pay them

46

00:03:10.590  -->  00:03:11.390
out right.

47

00:03:11.400  -->  00:03:12.720
You can pay out dividends if you want.

48

00:03:12.720  -->  00:03:14.020
Let's assume we're not.

49

00:03:14.190  -->  00:03:19.470
If we don't pay out our earnings and we just keep it for ourselves in our company then we retain those

50

00:03:19.470  -->  00:03:25.770
earnings and retained earnings is simply what was net income last quarter that sort of thing.

51

00:03:25.770  -->  00:03:26.320
Okay.

52

00:03:26.400  -->  00:03:28.260
And I'll explain that more detail in a second.

53

00:03:28.470  -->  00:03:30.980
And this is the issuing of common shares or stock.

54

00:03:31.050  -->  00:03:32.100
Right.

55

00:03:32.170  -->  00:03:38.410
And so of course assets has to equal liabilities plus equity.

56

00:03:38.460  -->  00:03:43.080
Now what we're going to do is we're going to analyze similar to what we did with the income stream exercise

57

00:03:43.890  -->  00:03:46.280
a couple of years 2014 2015.

58

00:03:46.360  -->  00:03:48.740
Then look at the dollar change year over year.

59

00:03:48.780  -->  00:03:53.250
Remember faience is all about looking at the rate of change and looking for patterns and then look at

60

00:03:53.250  -->  00:03:59.650
the percent change year over year and then we'll flag these items the percent changes.

61

00:03:59.910  -->  00:04:04.570
Are those concerns or not and if there is a concern that will explain why.

62

00:04:05.000  -->  00:04:08.220
Okay let's take a look at our numbers here.

63

00:04:08.340  -->  00:04:14.270
As you can see liabilities in equity here equals assets here.

64

00:04:14.280  -->  00:04:19.280
Same can be said for 2015 assets here is equal to liabilities plus equity.

65

00:04:19.440  -->  00:04:24.750
And I've got this really cool formula set up for you and I'm including this file in this current lecture

66

00:04:25.350  -->  00:04:33.790
and you can actually use this see that it basically says if this doesn't equal that then say hey balance

67

00:04:33.790  -->  00:04:37.090
sheet doesn't balance otherwise do the opposite.

68

00:04:37.090  -->  00:04:43.590
And I'll show you how that formula works so if I just delete a bunch of stuff here she there it says

69

00:04:43.590  -->  00:04:44.070
no.

70

00:04:44.070  -->  00:04:46.420
The balance sheet doesn't balance read salts.

71

00:04:46.430  -->  00:04:51.510
Control-C to do that and the same token here if I do that stuff.

72

00:04:51.510  -->  00:04:53.020
No the balance sheet doesn't balance.

73

00:04:53.160  -->  00:04:54.350
And that's our little check.

74

00:04:54.390  -->  00:04:55.270
That's what's called a belt.

75

00:04:55.290  -->  00:04:55.740
Right.

76

00:04:55.740  -->  00:04:57.930
Assets has to balance with liability in equities.

77

00:04:57.960  -->  00:05:01.440
OK let's look at the dollar change over year.

78

00:05:01.800  -->  00:05:04.880
And I also want to look at the percent change year over year.

79

00:05:05.010  -->  00:05:08.400
And so our cash balance goes up $200000.

80

00:05:08.520  -->  00:05:13.260
You might ask yourself we asked second Chris doesn't that just mean our net income was $200000 for the

81

00:05:13.260  -->  00:05:14.370
year.

82

00:05:14.430  -->  00:05:17.090
The answer is absolutely not right.

83

00:05:17.100  -->  00:05:20.790
Because cash and net income are different things.

84

00:05:20.790  -->  00:05:25.580
Right because maybe there's non-cash expenses like depreciation and other stuff like that.

85

00:05:25.680  -->  00:05:30.840
Don't worry if that sounds complicated by the end of the cashflow section which is next section there

86

00:05:30.840  -->  00:05:33.560
will be an aha moment and all of this will make perfect sense.

87

00:05:33.870  -->  00:05:35.760
OK so let's look at trends.

88

00:05:35.760  -->  00:05:38.760
So Cash was up a healthy 50 percent year over year.

89

00:05:38.760  -->  00:05:39.690
That's awesome.

90

00:05:39.850  -->  00:05:40.450
OK.

91

00:05:40.650  -->  00:05:46.020
And our accounts receivable is up less than cash which I always like to see in inventory was up a bunch

92

00:05:46.020  -->  00:05:46.470
as well.

93

00:05:46.470  -->  00:05:48.680
That's been I guess this kind of concern but you know what.

94

00:05:48.750  -->  00:05:49.970
It's such a small number.

95

00:05:49.970  -->  00:05:51.250
I'm not too concerned.

96

00:05:51.390  -->  00:05:52.060
OK.

97

00:05:52.260  -->  00:05:57.540
But if you have too much human toy it's a massive number too much inventory can actually bankrupt a

98

00:05:57.540  -->  00:05:58.230
company.

99

00:05:58.230  -->  00:06:00.320
I'll talk about that later.

100

00:06:00.330  -->  00:06:02.060
Moving on to long term assets.

101

00:06:02.190  -->  00:06:07.830
Looks like our building went down 5 percent year over year and the reason is because remember during

102

00:06:07.830  -->  00:06:10.910
the same exercise our depreciation was $5000.

103

00:06:11.010  -->  00:06:11.250
Right.

104

00:06:11.250  -->  00:06:18.060
So that's why that's why it looks like we bought $10000 more of land here and for the first time we

105

00:06:18.060  -->  00:06:20.030
bought a machine here as well.

106

00:06:20.280  -->  00:06:21.120
OK.

107

00:06:21.120  -->  00:06:25.370
So assets went up 20 percent year over year.

108

00:06:25.380  -->  00:06:29.450
Now let's try and understand why assets went up that much.

109

00:06:29.490  -->  00:06:35.100
So let's look at the liability section first accounts payable mean the money we owed others went up

110

00:06:35.100  -->  00:06:36.920
17 percent year over year.

111

00:06:36.960  -->  00:06:39.810
Our short term debt went down 11 percent year over year.

112

00:06:39.810  -->  00:06:40.590
That's awesome.

113

00:06:40.590  -->  00:06:41.770
I love to see that.

114

00:06:42.210  -->  00:06:44.820
And then our long term debt went down $1000.

115

00:06:44.840  -->  00:06:45.580
Also awesome.

116

00:06:45.600  -->  00:06:46.340
Love to see that.

117

00:06:46.340  -->  00:06:48.420
That's that's great.

118

00:06:48.420  -->  00:06:52.530
And then retained earnings here went up huge.

119

00:06:52.610  -->  00:06:53.120
Wow.

120

00:06:53.190  -->  00:06:56.530
That went up 80 percent year over year.

121

00:06:56.550  -->  00:06:57.360
That's amazing.

122

00:06:57.360  -->  00:06:58.030
That's amazing.

123

00:06:58.080  -->  00:06:59.410
Ok cool.

124

00:06:59.460  -->  00:07:00.780
And then common shares.

125

00:07:00.780  -->  00:07:06.550
Looks like we issued shares for an additional $60000 went up 40 percent year over year.

126

00:07:06.750  -->  00:07:12.870
But it looks like the bulk of the increase of the 20 percent for liabilities in equities this section

127

00:07:13.950  -->  00:07:15.400
came from retained earnings.

128

00:07:15.450  -->  00:07:16.650
Right.

129

00:07:16.830  -->  00:07:20.670
And that will tell us basically why this side increased.

130

00:07:20.670  -->  00:07:25.800
Right so here we have cash and equivalents increasing $200000.

131

00:07:25.840  -->  00:07:27.290
Right a lot of that will be explained by this.

132

00:07:27.300  -->  00:07:29.190
But there's something it doesn't make sense to me.

133

00:07:29.460  -->  00:07:34.110
And it won't make sense to us until we see the cash flow statement exercise in the next section which

134

00:07:34.110  -->  00:07:40.110
is this why is retained earnings or net income up 375 thousand dollars.

135

00:07:40.110  -->  00:07:40.380
Right.

136

00:07:40.380  -->  00:07:45.720
Which it was if you go back to our income statement exercise increase that much for that year.

137

00:07:46.320  -->  00:07:47.380
Why is that the case.

138

00:07:47.400  -->  00:07:50.620
And Cash was only up $200000.

139

00:07:51.150  -->  00:07:53.950
Just keep that in mind I want to put that on your radar screen right now.

140

00:07:54.030  -->  00:07:57.290
Don't worry about it we'll cover that once we get to the cash flow statement.

141

00:07:57.570  -->  00:08:02.850
And let's look actually at the income statement to see just to verify that that's right see retained

142

00:08:02.850  -->  00:08:03.380
earnings.

143

00:08:03.420  -->  00:08:03.660
Right.

144

00:08:03.660  -->  00:08:05.590
So it's the earnings that you retained.

145

00:08:05.830  -->  00:08:12.590
It was up 3 or 75000 1750s let me just go over here and drag in my income statement.

146

00:08:13.110  -->  00:08:14.490
That's what I'm talking about.

147

00:08:14.550  -->  00:08:15.200
Here we go.

148

00:08:15.480  -->  00:08:16.140
Yes that's right.

149

00:08:16.140  -->  00:08:20.160
So it looks like net income or profit was 75000 here.

150

00:08:20.160  -->  00:08:23.230
So let me say bye bye to that.

151

00:08:23.250  -->  00:08:24.330
Great.

152

00:08:24.330  -->  00:08:25.420
Okay cool.

153

00:08:25.650  -->  00:08:27.860
So are there any concerns here.

154

00:08:27.870  -->  00:08:28.850
Not really.

155

00:08:28.850  -->  00:08:35.670
I mean I might I might conclude that inventory was a concern but it's not because it's so small.

156

00:08:35.670  -->  00:08:38.600
That is an explanation of the balance sheet
