Hello everyone and welcome to this python tutorial in the last week.

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:08,910
So we loaded our data set for Apple stocks.

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:15,390
But now before we proceed to the training gloop let's define the model in a few hyper parameters to

4
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:20,090
use the first hyper parameter is the window size.

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,650
Let's define window size is equal to 10.

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:30,750
That means that we are going to use 10 previous days to predict the current one in the previous sections.

7
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:37,410
We used word epochs and in the reinforcement learning that is same as episode.

8
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:44,190
So we need to define how many times we are going to run for the whole dataset or the whole environment.

9
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,150
In this case we'll say episode is equal to 1000.

10
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,590
The algorithm is going to run very slowly.

11
00:00:52,590 --> 00:01:01,560
So we want to wait for all of them to pass then we'll specify 32 for the batch size and in the end with

12
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:06,890
data samples is going to be equal to land on data minus one.

13
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:11,920
Since we are trying to predict the next day we can't use the last one.

14
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,820
So let's say you look at the cell and our hyper parameters are defined.

15
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:24,220
Now it's time to define our trade there but let's call it trader and that is going to be equal to our

16
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:24,940
class.

17
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:29,460
A trader if you remember it takes a lot of arguments.

18
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:36,070
But since we defined the action space to be free as default and the model name to be a trader by default

19
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:42,400
we won't change that so only thing that we have to specify is the state's size.

20
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:50,320
And for us that is our window size execute a cell and it is going to take some time to define the model.

21
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,170
And here we go.

22
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,170
We are ready to go to the next step.

23
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:57,910
Let's track the model structure before we end this year.

24
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,830
To do that.

25
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,320
Right.

26
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:07,690
Trader dot model and there's always dot summary execute a cell as you can see we have three layers as

27
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:18,680
we defined 30 to 64 and 128 units the output layer has only three units for our by stay and sell actions.

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,520
And that's our model in the next video we are going to start by defining our trading loop.

29
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:30,880
It will take two videos because the code is a bit longer but it is going to be very exciting to videos

30
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:34,110
if you have any questions or comments so far.

31
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,500
Please post them in the comments section otherwise I'll see in the next tutorial.
