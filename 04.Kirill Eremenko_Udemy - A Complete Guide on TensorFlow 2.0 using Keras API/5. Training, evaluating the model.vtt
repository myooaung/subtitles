Hello everyone and welcome to this python tutorial in the previous video we defined our model and now

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.500
it's time to train it and evaluate it to see how well it performs on the test set.

3
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:20.060
Let's start by training it model that fit in this function requires a few arguments.

4
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:29.950
The first argument is for features in our case x train then for our targets why train the further argument

5
00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.260
here is batch size but we don't have to provide it.

6
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.070
We can leave it at none.

7
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.870
And finally said epochs to five execute a cell.

8
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:45.660
It will take around 30 seconds to complete all five e-books okay.

9
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.790
Our training process is done.

10
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:55.920
It was very fast about 30 seconds as we estimated not only dead but we achieved around 88 percent accuracy

11
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.380
on our training set.

12
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:05.420
Now it's time to see how well it performs on unseen data or our data set right.

13
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:16.550
That's loss come our test accuracy equals to model dot evaluate and provide x test and Y test to it.

14
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.080
Below is a simple print statement that I've written beforehand.

15
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:29.070
The only thing left to do here is to provide test accuracy inside the brackets execute the cell and

16
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.490
we have eighty seven point two percent accuracy on the test set which is incredible.

17
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:42.680
We didn't order a fit or under feet at all let's say that we are pretty happy with this model and we

18
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.280
don't want to improve it even further.

19
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:53.000
Now that we have trained our model that is generalized enough we can put it on some device and headed

20
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.020
to our customer and that's exactly what we are going to do in the next video.

21
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:04.660
We are we are going to convert it into tens of Flo light version if you have any questions or comments

22
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.300
please pause that in the comments section.

23
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.370
Otherwise I'll see seen the next tutorial.
