Hello everyone and welcome to despite an editorial in this video we are going to start with our distributed

2
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.670
training project in the first video.

3
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.730
We are going to set up our environment and install all the penises that we are going to need for the

4
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:15.430
project.

5
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:23.490
Let's start by setting up the environment to use a Jeep you instead of you like we did in the previous

6
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.210
sections.

7
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.150
We are going to do that by going to edit.

8
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:35.260
Then go down to no settings instead of none under hardware accelerator select the Jeep you and click

9
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.920
save.

10
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.440
Now we have connected to the Jeep you environment.

11
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.750
The first and only thing that we have to install for this project is tens a flow 2.0.

12
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.780
So let's do that in the first free cell type.

13
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:58.870
Exclamation mark followed by pip install and then we are going to say there is a flow dash debut because

14
00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:08.900
we want the GPO version of it equals equals to two point zero point zero point alpha zero execute a

15
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.640
cell.

16
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.540
It will take some time to install this dependency.

17
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.930
So as you can see here I have already installed tens of float 2.0.

18
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:24.950
But if you haven't it is going to take up to one minute and that's it that's all what we have for this

19
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:25.690
video.

20
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.900
If you have any questions or comments please post them in the comments section.

21
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.030
Otherwise I assume the next tutorial.
