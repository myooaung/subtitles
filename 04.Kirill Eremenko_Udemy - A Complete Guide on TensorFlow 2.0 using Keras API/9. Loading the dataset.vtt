Hello everyone and welcome to this python tutorial.

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.350
In the previous video we created our state create their function.

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:14.970
I know it was a lot of taking but now that we have that information we are ready to go with our data

4
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:22.570
set loading process and create our a trader in the next video in this video we will create our data

5
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:31.440
set loader function that we created two videos ago to load our stock market data but before we do that

6
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.760
let's define a new variable called stock name and that stock name variable is going to be set to in

7
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:47.680
this case Apple we are going to use that information to load our data so define this data variable and

8
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:54.100
that is going to be equal to data set loader function that takes a single argument and that is our stock

9
00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:00.680
may execute a cell and let's quickly visualize before we proceed any further.

10
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:08.180
And as you can see we have that information about the closed column for each day from 2010 to today

11
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.940
when the video was recorded and that's it for our data loader function.

12
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.530
We can delete this line now and we are ready to proceed to the next step in the next video we are going

13
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:29.030
to define our trader and to see what hyper parameters to use for the multiple if you have any questions

14
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.360
or comments so far.

15
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.880
Please post them in the comments section otherwise I'll see you in the next tutorial.
