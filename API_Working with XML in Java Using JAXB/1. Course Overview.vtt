Hi everyone.

2
00:00:01.126 --> 00:00:10.072
My name is Jesper de Jong, and welcome to my course,

3
00:00:10.072 --> 00:00:13.664
Working with XML in Java Using JAXB.

4
00:00:13.664 --> 00:00:16.081
I'm an independent software developer,

5
00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:20.102
and I have a lot of experience with designing and building

6
00:00:20.102 --> 00:00:23.196
enterprise software systems in Java.

7
00:00:23.196 --> 00:00:27.986
XML is a very widely used data format, and as a Java developer,

8
00:00:27.986 --> 00:00:32.220
you'll definitely need to know how to work with XML in Java.

9
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.221
Java has extensive support for working with XML and JAXB.

10
00:00:37.221 --> 00:00:43.753
The Java architecture for XML binding is Java standard high-level API,

11
00:00:43.753 --> 00:00:49.320
which bridges the gap between XML and the object-oriented Java world.

12
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.853
This course is for all Java developers who want to expand

13
00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:56.782
their knowledge of working with XML in Java.

14
00:00:56.782 --> 00:01:00.950
Some of the major topics that we'll cover include

15
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.163
converting XML to Java objects and vice versa,

16
00:01:05.163 --> 00:01:09.451
using JAXB annotations and bindings files,

17
00:01:09.451 --> 00:01:15.599
the code-first and the schema-first approach to working with JAXB,

18
00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:19.663
integrating JAXB into your build process,

19
00:01:19.663 --> 00:01:24.360
and using JAXB for JAX-WS webservices.

20
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.776
By the end of this course,

21
00:01:25.776 --> 00:01:29.494
you'll have a solid understanding of how to work with XML

22
00:01:29.494 --> 00:01:33.152
using JAXB and the underlying concepts.

23
00:01:33.152 --> 00:01:34.526
Before beginning the course,

24
00:01:34.526 --> 00:01:37.487
you should be familiar with the Java programming language

25
00:01:37.487 --> 00:01:40.100
and have a basic understanding of XML.

26
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:47.757
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn JAXB with the

27
00:01:47.757 --> 00:01:55.000
Working with XML in Java Using JAXB course, at Pluralsight.
