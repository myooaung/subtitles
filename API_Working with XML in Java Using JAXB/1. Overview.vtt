00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.341
Welcome to the last module of this course.

2
00:00:05.341 --> 00:00:08.423
You've now learned a lot about JAXB.

3
00:00:08.423 --> 00:00:11.535
JAXB is useful for many different applications,

4
00:00:11.535 --> 00:00:18.912
and one application where it is often used is XML-based web services.

5
00:00:18.912 --> 00:00:20.074
In this module,

6
00:00:20.074 --> 00:00:25.242
we'll create a simple web service and the client so that you get

7
00:00:25.242 --> 00:00:29.562
an idea of how JAXB is used for web services.

8
00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:29.984
First,

9
00:00:29.984 --> 00:00:33.362
I'll give you some background information about web

10
00:00:33.362 --> 00:00:36.949
services so that you understand the context.

11
00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:40.240
Then we'll look at two examples.

12
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.030
First, we'll create a simple web service for purchase orders using JAX-WS,

13
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:52.907
the standard Java API for working with XML-based web services and JAXB.

14
00:00:52.907 --> 00:01:04.000
Then we'll create a small client program which calls the web service. Let's start with a quick overview of web services.
