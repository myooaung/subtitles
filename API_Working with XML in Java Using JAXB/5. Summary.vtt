00:00:02.615 --> 00:00:08.054
In this module, you learned about XML-based web services and JAX-WS,

2
00:00:08.054 --> 00:00:13.090
which is Java standard API for working with web services.

3
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.089
You've learned that XML-based web services use SOAP as the

4
00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:22.221
format for exchanging XML messages and WSDL to describe the

5
00:00:22.221 --> 00:00:25.470
operations that a web service provides.

6
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.351
Using JAX-WS, it's very easy to get a web service up and running.

7
00:00:31.351 --> 00:00:36.604
JAX-WS automatically provides a WSDL for your web service.

8
00:00:36.604 --> 00:00:41.790
You can use the wsimport tool to generate Java classes from the WSDL,

9
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.656
which you can then use to create a client that uses the web service.

10
00:00:46.656 --> 00:00:52.607
JAX-WS uses JAXB to marshal and unmarshal the content of the SOAP messages,

11
00:00:52.607 --> 00:00:59.671
and wsimport uses xjc to generate domain model classes.

12
00:00:59.671 --> 00:01:02.922
One of the possible paths to follow after this course

13
00:01:02.922 --> 00:01:05.628
is to learn more about web services.

14
00:01:05.628 --> 00:01:08.910
If this is what you're looking for,

15
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.923
then one other course you might want to follow is Building JAX-WS

16
00:01:13.923 --> 00:01:17.784
Web Services with Apache CXF by Michael Hoffman,

17
00:01:17.784 --> 00:01:23.548
which I also mentioned in the beginning of this course.

18
00:01:23.548 --> 00:01:27.694
Now we are at the end of this course about JAXB.

19
00:01:27.694 --> 00:01:28.478
Thanks for watching.

20
00:01:28.478 --> 00:01:36.000
I hope you enjoyed it, and I wish you a lot of success with your new knowledge of JAXB.
