00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:06.759
Here's an overview of the subjects we'll cover in this course.

2
00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:08.003
After this introduction module,

3
00:00:08.003 --> 00:00:12.731
you'll start with how to read and write XML using the JAXB API.

4
00:00:12.731 --> 00:00:17.770
We'll start with a simple data model and examples so that you

5
00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.074
can get familiar with how the API works.

6
00:00:21.074 --> 00:00:23.735
There will be lots of examples throughout the course,

7
00:00:23.735 --> 00:00:27.370
and you can download the source code for all the

8
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.118
examples on the course page at Pluralsight.

9
00:00:30.118 --> 00:00:33.422
I recommend that you follow along with the code and play with it yourself

10
00:00:33.422 --> 00:00:38.440
because working with the code hands-on is a great way to learn.

11
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.366
JAXB works with annotations.

12
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:45.295
After you've learned the basics of how to read and write XML,

13
00:00:45.295 --> 00:00:50.294
we'll take a closer look at the available annotations and how you can use them

14
00:00:50.294 --> 00:00:53.807
to control the mapping between your Java classes and XML.

15
00:00:53.807 --> 00:00:59.437
Then we'll take a look at the two approaches to working with JAXB,

16
00:00:59.437 --> 00:01:02.883
the code-first and the schema-first approach.

17
00:01:02.883 --> 00:01:05.845
We'll first take a look at the code-first approach where

18
00:01:05.845 --> 00:01:11.044
you use the schemagen tool from the JDK to generate an XML

19
00:01:11.044 --> 00:01:13.439
schema from your Java classes.

20
00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.972
And then we'll look at the schema-first approach where you use

21
00:01:16.972 --> 00:01:21.564
the xjc tool from the JDK to do the opposite,

22
00:01:21.564 --> 00:01:25.055
generate Java source files from an XML schema.

23
00:01:25.055 --> 00:01:26.648
With both these approaches,

24
00:01:26.648 --> 00:01:32.143
we'll take a close look at the Java code and the XML schema so that

25
00:01:32.143 --> 00:01:36.985
you understand clearly how JAXB maps between Java classes and

26
00:01:36.985 --> 00:01:40.085
fields and XML elements and attributes.

27
00:01:40.085 --> 00:01:45.120
After that, we'll take a look at more advanced usage of JAXB.

28
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.797
You can customize what JAXB does in a number of different ways.

29
00:01:49.797 --> 00:01:51.841
We'll take a look at an example,

30
00:01:51.841 --> 00:01:54.794
which will be practically useful for your own applications

31
00:01:54.794 --> 00:02:00.038
and that is how to map XML date and time types to the

32
00:02:00.038 --> 00:02:02.985
standard Java 8 date and time classes.

33
00:02:02.985 --> 00:02:05.374
When you're working on a real Java project,

34
00:02:05.374 --> 00:02:09.560
you'll most likely be using one of the standard build tools,

35
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.842
Maven or Gradle.

36
00:02:10.842 --> 00:02:13.040
When you use JAXB in your project,

37
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.536
you'll at some point need to call the JDK tools to generate

38
00:02:17.536 --> 00:02:21.214
an XML schema or to generate Java code.

39
00:02:21.214 --> 00:02:25.606
There are plugins available for Maven and Gradle to call these tools.

40
00:02:25.606 --> 00:02:28.791
We'll take a look at how to use the plugins so that you can

41
00:02:28.791 --> 00:02:31.314
integrate JAXB into your build process.

42
00:02:31.314 --> 00:02:36.150
Finally, you'll learn about how JAXB is used with JAX-WS,

43
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:42.095
which is the standard API for working with XML-based web services.

44
00:02:42.095 --> 00:02:47.661
We will not dive really deep into XML-based web services because that's a big

45
00:02:47.661 --> 00:02:51.426
topic that could easily fill a complete course by itself.

46
00:02:51.426 --> 00:02:55.737
But since this is one of the areas in which JAXB is used in many applications,

47
00:02:55.737 --> 00:03:00.223
I want to at least show you the basics of how JAXB is

48
00:03:00.223 --> 00:03:02.648
used with web services in practice.

49
00:03:02.648 --> 00:03:07.782
At the end of this course, you'll understand exactly how to use JAXB,

50
00:03:07.782 --> 00:03:12.625
and you'll also have practically useful know about how to integrate it into your

51
00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:24.000
build process and how it is used in XML-based web services. You'll be ready to use JAXB in your own projects.
