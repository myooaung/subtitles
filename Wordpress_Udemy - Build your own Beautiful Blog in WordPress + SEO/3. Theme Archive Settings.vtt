00:00.580 --> 00:05.070
Helga's welcome to this video in this video we will work on a live setting.

00:05.250 --> 00:11.370
So for those of you who don't know what a guy is let me tell you what our time is and time is basically

00:11.370 --> 00:17.890
the age where we see our posts from them on this Hellcat agree we see both.

00:17.890 --> 00:19.120
They need to be held.

00:19.320 --> 00:24.530
If we go to homepage we will see we will see all of our posts.

00:24.530 --> 00:32.090
This page is basically the archive of the bit where we see our boss is a guy page where all of the archives

00:32.090 --> 00:37.970
that we can get said exactly to this page for example these days we see this Gregory these comments

00:38.040 --> 00:40.870
this article about this decade this picture.

00:40.870 --> 00:46.140
So all of these archived settings will be covered in their own settings will get so well with Jamiat

00:46.190 --> 00:50.060
by setting you will see what difference will it have on this page.

00:50.450 --> 00:51.040
OK.

00:51.230 --> 00:52.820
So let's go to the settings.

00:52.970 --> 00:59.710
The first thing we see here is the settings that are to the guys and first is Bosch so shell buttons

00:59.970 --> 01:01.670
alag you can see this archive.

01:01.730 --> 01:02.790
This is the archive page.

01:02.810 --> 01:07.550
And we don't have any social button social sharing we're like Facebook Twitter.

01:07.610 --> 01:14.460
So if we're on this button we will see the social icons and the fresh

01:17.020 --> 01:21.670
sea we have Facebook Twitter all of the share icon.

01:21.730 --> 01:27.950
But I would recommend you to turn this off because it doesn't look good to have this shit icon deposed.

01:27.970 --> 01:28.790
OK.

01:28.900 --> 01:31.540
Let's turn this off OK.

01:31.570 --> 01:34.590
The next thing we have here is excerpting Lent.

01:34.780 --> 01:35.520
OK.

01:35.620 --> 01:39.250
Except it really is a soap is basically the text we see.

01:39.250 --> 01:40.940
This is the XO.

01:41.000 --> 01:41.550
OK.

01:41.680 --> 01:43.120
And this is also the excerpts.

01:43.120 --> 01:46.210
This is the excerpt that we faced to remove these.

01:46.230 --> 01:46.910
OK.

01:47.320 --> 01:47.770
OK.

01:47.980 --> 01:56.890
So this is the expert excerpt expert this excerpt you can just increases so let's make it.

01:57.020 --> 01:58.120
And now what we have.

01:58.130 --> 02:03.680
But the size of this excerpt really increased and this read more button would be pushed down to let

02:03.680 --> 02:05.920
me fish it deceived.

02:06.360 --> 02:12.040
See now we have more excerpt you can do whatever you want.

02:12.490 --> 02:14.090
OK let me see what else we have.

02:14.090 --> 02:19.820
You can see this is the dead this is to get angry and this is the comments we continue to get.

02:19.820 --> 02:26.050
We have author Matt Outremer is basically the name of the author that roared the boss.

02:26.130 --> 02:29.690
Right now we don't have automatize you can turn this on if you want.

02:30.030 --> 02:34.550
And no we will see the author dead rule this post.

02:34.570 --> 02:38.390
So let me flesh and see more wrote this post.

02:38.390 --> 02:42.890
OK so this is the author Matt Matt is basically the information Medhurst else for information.

02:42.920 --> 02:47.210
You can see OK but is the information related to anything.

02:47.600 --> 02:54.310
So these are rumors and these are very if you are dead matter ok it is also turned on you can see there

02:54.340 --> 02:57.230
you can turn this off if you want correct that this murder is turned on.

02:57.230 --> 03:03.020
Is he going to get his comments amortised or not we see comments views that are a comment to make this

03:03.080 --> 03:10.030
of OK with basically the number of viewers that just viewed this post.

03:10.100 --> 03:13.640
I recommend you do this all over the post detail page.

03:13.640 --> 03:14.180
OK.

03:14.240 --> 03:16.490
But it will look good here again.

03:16.560 --> 03:18.690
You can to this on according to you what you want.

03:18.710 --> 03:19.550
OK.

03:20.000 --> 03:20.270
OK.

03:20.270 --> 03:24.140
The next is the lay out setting how you want your boss to appear.

03:24.140 --> 03:26.240
We have four or five sittings here.

03:26.240 --> 03:30.260
First is the default setting to set the second.

03:30.530 --> 03:33.260
And now you will see how both appear

03:36.310 --> 03:39.240
See this is how our posts are appearing.

03:39.250 --> 03:47.720
So this is the guy the next thing we have is this this layout is the picture.

03:48.010 --> 03:49.610
Will not be shown.

03:49.730 --> 03:52.900
Let me see if Janey's and refresh

03:55.540 --> 03:58.430
see there's no picture here but it doesn't look cool.

03:58.630 --> 04:06.960
So the thing otherly or is this where we have two boys in one row at 15 years

04:12.420 --> 04:13.240
OK.

04:15.190 --> 04:19.990
Do post in one go and terrible fifth one is the time line.

04:20.120 --> 04:22.890
So I recommend you do it first.

04:22.920 --> 04:27.730
OK first looks cool you finish

04:31.230 --> 04:32.400
OK.

04:32.900 --> 04:33.350
All right.

04:33.350 --> 04:35.750
Next is the category page settings.

04:35.750 --> 04:36.690
OK.

04:36.980 --> 04:38.540
We don't have this.

04:38.600 --> 04:41.940
These settings are on the page.

04:41.960 --> 04:42.450
OK.

04:42.470 --> 04:48.080
So we have to change settings on how technology motivation because these are also the archive like I

04:48.080 --> 04:54.170
said a guy with a page where we have all the settings related to archive setting.

04:54.170 --> 04:54.700
OK.

04:54.710 --> 05:00.490
So let's go to the health and now if you want to change the settings.

05:00.490 --> 05:02.210
Go to this category page settings.

05:02.380 --> 05:02.980
OK.

05:02.980 --> 05:05.620
Now we have a great description.

05:05.690 --> 05:09.600
This the settings is change from team to team.

05:09.640 --> 05:13.820
But this setting is not here OK description will not appear again.

05:14.020 --> 05:20.820
So just keep this of RSS icon RSS is this icon if you want it just keep it.

05:20.820 --> 05:22.830
If you don't want it just disable it.

05:22.870 --> 05:25.800
The next thing is the lay out.

05:25.810 --> 05:26.760
Similar to health.

05:26.770 --> 05:29.860
OK similar to me similar to home page.

05:29.860 --> 05:31.570
OK you can change it if you want.

05:31.660 --> 05:33.760
Continue to does this or this.

05:33.760 --> 05:40.250
So let's keep it this and see if it's fresh.

05:42.050 --> 05:44.380
And see now you see this again.

05:44.430 --> 05:45.750
Is also archive.

05:45.760 --> 05:46.690
OK.

05:47.100 --> 05:56.350
So OK skipping the first I like this well connected database settings.

05:56.890 --> 05:58.860
I recommend you to keep it as it is OK.

05:58.930 --> 06:06.280
This is also because this is basically the text filtering that is similar to categories but bag are

06:06.280 --> 06:06.750
random.

06:06.760 --> 06:08.870
OK categories not random.

06:09.420 --> 06:09.760
OK.

06:09.790 --> 06:16.740
The next is the author page settings or settings with the information to the author when we go to post.

06:17.740 --> 06:21.740
And at the bottom we see about the author.

06:21.800 --> 06:22.140
OK.

06:22.150 --> 06:24.900
There is no copyright here in here on this box.

06:24.910 --> 06:25.240
OK.

06:25.240 --> 06:30.670
We do nothing about the author can update our protection by going to users.

06:30.670 --> 06:35.590
Your profile and you can add all of your information your brother biography everything anything you

06:35.590 --> 06:35.950
want.

06:35.950 --> 06:36.330
OK.

06:36.340 --> 06:40.010
So you can Jaynie ought to be sitting through this box right here.

06:40.030 --> 06:45.520
You can change the format and get an author by turning on or off but keep it keep it on.

06:45.520 --> 06:48.170
But if you've done this off you will not see this box.

06:48.190 --> 06:49.150
OK.

06:49.700 --> 06:50.010
OK.

06:50.020 --> 06:51.300
Keep it as it is.

06:51.340 --> 06:54.020
The next we have in such pain settings it as it is.

06:54.250 --> 06:54.800
OK.

06:55.030 --> 06:58.810
Let's see if Jinny's and move to the port settings.

06:58.970 --> 07:04.070
So I think we will cover the both settings in the next video game who think what's in this video.

07:04.080 --> 07:05.510
We'll see you in the next video.
