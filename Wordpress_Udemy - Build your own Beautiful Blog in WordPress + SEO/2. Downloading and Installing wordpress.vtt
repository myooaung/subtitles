Hello welcome to this video in this video.

00:03.350 --> 00:04.780
Tell you something.

00:05.130 --> 00:12.390
Every web developer when ever they create websites what they do they create websites on their local

00:12.390 --> 00:19.890
host and after creating the websites uploaded on the live server and we will do the same Lohman upload

00:19.890 --> 00:24.810
the website first on the live server and then they create and they upload the team and then they do

00:24.810 --> 00:27.060
all this stuff and setting what they do.

00:27.060 --> 00:32.940
They always go to the website or a local host they apply their team they apply the settings they set

00:32.940 --> 00:36.910
up all the website and then they upload on the live server.

00:37.170 --> 00:38.580
Thats what we do.

00:38.580 --> 00:41.920
All right we will install the word press on the local host.

00:41.940 --> 00:48.090
We will apply our team would apply saying we will do everything and then we will upload it on the live

00:48.090 --> 00:50.980
server again to set up the Wordpress or local host.

00:51.120 --> 00:57.990
We need to do one thing and that is we need to download the server that was bought but based on our

00:58.000 --> 00:59.540
local machine.

00:59.580 --> 01:00.350
OK.

01:00.600 --> 01:03.250
And the name of the software is exempt.

01:03.300 --> 01:03.700

01:03.720 --> 01:11.020
You can use them or whatever you want now to download them all you need to do is go to Google Google

01:48.070 --> 01:50.820
I have already installed it on my local machine.

01:50.820 --> 01:57.090
All you need to do is just don't read and install it wherever you are installing it what you need to

01:57.090 --> 02:01.010
do is open before you install it.

02:01.970 --> 02:09.650

02:09.650 --> 02:11.270

02:37.340 --> 02:43.970
No all you need to do is get a new folder and type the name of the website that you want to create.

02:43.970 --> 02:45.990
Or the blog that we want to create.

02:46.010 --> 02:50.650
So I'm going to go for just word press.

02:51.170 --> 02:53.290
You can type the name of blog that you want to create.

03:50.820 --> 03:54.970
Go to your two dogs comment.

03:56.750 --> 04:01.040

letter to lead it

04:16.320 --> 04:17.020
open it.

04:17.210 --> 04:18.280
No.

04:18.840 --> 04:21.450
As we have already good press for her.

04:21.600 --> 04:23.260
We don't need any of that for lunch.

04:23.290 --> 04:28.160
So it's going to just cut all of these flyers and I'm going to be a hit here.

04:29.070 --> 04:30.880
I remove this folder.

04:31.170 --> 04:31.900
OK.

04:32.460 --> 04:37.560
So here is our Web site which is we're present open it and here's all of our files.

04:37.750 --> 04:41.550
Know what we need to do is open the exam

04:44.740 --> 04:49.020
open an exam and then be able to set up our press.

04:49.080 --> 05:01.400
So I'm going to run them can crawl leg you can see these two surfaces or are already started but it

05:01.400 --> 05:05.370
will not be the case if you are just installed the exam.

05:05.390 --> 05:08.560
So these are really based on medical reason.

05:08.630 --> 05:15.950

05:45.230 --> 05:50.270
We need some information on that because you will need to know the following item before proceeding.

05:50.270 --> 05:55.970
So what best for us to create a database to clear the areas and look the host.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.710

06:57.390 --> 07:00.340
It has created indices or press.

07:00.610 --> 07:01.940
OK.

07:02.610 --> 07:03.820
First step is done.

07:04.190 --> 07:05.330
Let's go.

07:06.640 --> 07:07.090
OK.

07:07.120 --> 07:12.700
No is asking about the database name that we created the name of the database is WordPress.

07:12.980 --> 07:21.430
So it's OK but press no it is asking about the use of name of our local host this local host.

07:21.440 --> 07:27.890
I never use the name but I don't have a password the user name is basically for almost all the local

07:27.890 --> 07:34.440
who is gay and I don't have a password to my local host.

07:34.450 --> 07:40.270
And I hope you will also have a password if you if you have done the same thing like I did.

07:40.300 --> 07:41.000
OK.

07:41.260 --> 07:43.130
But if you have a password you can write it.

07:43.150 --> 07:44.530
But we're here.

07:44.790 --> 07:46.100

I'm going to submit

08:00.510 --> 08:01.400

08:01.460 --> 08:02.800

08:02.810 --> 08:04.130
Everything is OK.

08:04.280 --> 08:05.710
Now it's a good start.

10:18.380 --> 10:21.920
So this is different and this is where our blog will be.

10:21.920 --> 10:27.430
This looks totally weird because this is basically the default team over breste we don't want this.

10:27.470 --> 10:36.900
We will play our blog team OK and we will do everything that a blog must have like share button and

10:38.690 --> 10:41.570
amazingly design sideboards in Boston.

10:41.580 --> 10:44.480
Everything OK so guess me through.

10:44.490 --> 10:50.480
I hope you have followed this and you would set up the right breast like I did on the local host and

10:50.480 --> 10:58.070
we will do everything for the local host and then at the end we will upload our blog with the live server

10:58.100 --> 10:59.740
and I will show you how you can upload.

10:59.810 --> 11:02.560
OK so just stick with me like I'm doing.

11:02.600 --> 11:06.110
