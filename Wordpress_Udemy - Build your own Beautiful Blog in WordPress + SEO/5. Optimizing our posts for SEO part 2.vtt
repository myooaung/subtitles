00:00.540 --> 00:05.410
So these are for read and these on the green beans These are amazing.

00:05.520 --> 00:08.430
These for sure can be.

00:08.820 --> 00:12.480
These foods can be made these these like these green.

00:12.510 --> 00:13.020
OK.

00:13.290 --> 00:20.550
So you need to fill all these are you have to do all these things get it in before these four points

00:20.570 --> 00:23.150
again make it different reverse.

00:23.170 --> 00:24.810
So let's do it.

00:24.810 --> 00:32.390
I'm just going to copy and paste it to make it get into words and let's see what it is.

00:32.420 --> 00:34.800
See that one is going.

00:34.800 --> 00:36.470
We know you have three.

00:36.510 --> 00:40.290
It is saying there are no outbound links appear in the page.

00:40.290 --> 00:44.330
Consider adding some appropriate links me link to some other websites.

00:44.340 --> 00:51.630
There's no link to some other Web site in this post and consider adding some further let's add the link

00:51.690 --> 00:55.140
to the blog where we just took this post.

00:55.150 --> 01:03.900
OK just a demonstration but it is not that important but it is good if your post has some external links.

01:03.900 --> 01:13.520
So for example check out the full article here.

01:13.590 --> 01:16.320
So let's add girdling to this.

01:16.320 --> 01:18.770
Here is here.

01:19.310 --> 01:26.480
Just highlight it and click on the link there and paste the link here.

01:26.660 --> 01:29.050
Call Airlink can see here.

01:29.070 --> 01:30.840
Now we have an Barbara link.

01:30.880 --> 01:35.780
OK let me edit this link and click on Open link in new double.

01:35.790 --> 01:40.170
We don't want our window to appear to go to some other website.

01:40.170 --> 01:47.550
OK we want to go we want to have another tab for this link so we have an oddball reading.

01:47.550 --> 01:50.140
Ok now we have only 2 points.

01:50.150 --> 01:52.290
Ok that is also gone.

01:52.410 --> 01:57.060
No but we have the focus Givre doesn't appear in the queue for this bit.

01:57.060 --> 02:02.830
If you decide to rename the Eurail be sure to check the old you are running redirects to the new one.

02:02.990 --> 02:09.240
OK what are you saying that it is saying that this is basically the JERYL of our boss but it doesn't

02:09.300 --> 02:15.480
have the focus GIBBERD It is had it has the boss number which is 51 but we voided the title to be here

02:15.480 --> 02:16.100
OK.

02:16.290 --> 02:23.380
To do that what you need to do is go here and that is starting off the post and click on this edit OK

02:24.010 --> 02:27.120
and less added the title or you are out of our workforce.

02:27.330 --> 02:28.360
What I'm going to do.

02:28.530 --> 02:32.560
Copy this and I'm going to paste it here again.

02:32.880 --> 02:38.730
OK and this is going to be the link and you can see the focus word is no is in the link.

02:38.730 --> 02:39.700
Symptoms.

02:39.860 --> 02:41.630
Let's see what it says.

02:42.390 --> 02:43.990
OK that error is gone.

02:44.130 --> 02:48.690
But now we have another error by adding the diff.

02:49.190 --> 02:55.230
Adding the symptoms in the UL but it says it's is LUGG for this page contains one or more stop Verd

02:55.260 --> 02:57.650
consider removing them.

02:57.670 --> 03:04.950
Though a lot of people don't understand this error what error this is but what I'm going to tell you

03:04.950 --> 03:05.480
here.

03:05.490 --> 03:06.720
Keep that in mind.

03:06.730 --> 03:12.550
OK never forget this again because this is the line that most of the people don't understand what is

03:12.630 --> 03:17.340
thing missing that the slot for this bit slug is basically this.

03:17.380 --> 03:19.140
This one started with just added.

03:19.180 --> 03:21.520
Right now this is the slug.

03:21.540 --> 03:24.620
The slug for this page contains one or more Stoppard's.

03:24.690 --> 03:32.220
It says that this data here can be one or more one or more stop words remove them stop words or stop

03:32.230 --> 03:36.950
words are words like the of a.

03:36.960 --> 03:39.680
These kinds of words are stop words OK.

03:39.900 --> 03:44.240
R and R These words are stop words.

03:44.240 --> 03:45.780
Now you can see we have off here.

03:45.780 --> 03:49.920
Let's remove this and see what happens and.

03:50.880 --> 03:54.040
OK we still have.

03:54.230 --> 04:01.690
Let's move this summer to see that that era is gone.

04:01.690 --> 04:03.320
Some of us stoppered.

04:03.370 --> 04:05.070
We'll get to those are they Stopford.

04:05.080 --> 04:08.760
Make sure to move don't move though as far as you can.

04:08.770 --> 04:15.380
And you can see all these are green and me this means that this board is going to be great for you.

04:15.880 --> 04:16.600
OK.

04:16.720 --> 04:18.560
Now we have only one error.

04:18.700 --> 04:20.870
That is it isn't absolutely the error.

04:20.890 --> 04:27.490
Like I said these are not the errors but make but keep the settings as good as possible.

04:27.540 --> 04:33.820
Sometimes it is not possible to make these settings good because we have some because the post is not

04:33.910 --> 04:41.010
that awesome because you cannot write that awesome post or we can not do some of the settings that dissing

04:41.050 --> 04:42.560
us to do but.

04:42.880 --> 04:44.910
But do whatever you can.

04:44.930 --> 04:45.430
OK.

04:45.560 --> 04:48.760
What is what is possible to work at what is possible.

04:48.790 --> 04:54.620
OK so now we have the desk contains two sixty eight words slightly below the tune.

04:54.640 --> 04:55.260
OK.

04:55.600 --> 05:02.640
I copied and pasted it but still it is still it is less so let's add copy paste again.

05:02.690 --> 05:04.000
It is slightly liberal just a word.

05:04.000 --> 05:04.990
Come on man.

05:05.120 --> 05:06.910
OK so let's copy paste again

05:13.330 --> 05:15.880
and let's see what we have.

05:15.880 --> 05:16.590
OK.

05:16.600 --> 05:20.650
See now our cost is really amazing.

05:20.650 --> 05:21.850
Far as.

05:21.900 --> 05:22.390
Oh.

05:22.480 --> 05:25.490
So this is how you optimize your post for.

05:25.590 --> 05:26.600
Or no.

05:26.620 --> 05:28.850
This is the green signal for our post.

05:28.990 --> 05:30.910
This post is going to be amazing.

05:30.910 --> 05:39.360
Far as he ordered the search engines like Google being now you can see we have two more options.

05:39.500 --> 05:43.890
But we the most important one is this Are we just done.

05:43.940 --> 05:44.220
OK.

05:44.230 --> 05:48.120
This is the most important one we can this and see what we have.

05:48.360 --> 05:52.270
Good As It Is this is basically the settings that you don't want to use.

05:52.300 --> 05:53.060
OK.

05:53.140 --> 05:53.550
All right.

05:53.560 --> 05:58.720
These are basically a follow are not disposed to or don't know but these are.

05:58.720 --> 06:01.980
It is called these are vast and you don't want to mess with this.

06:02.280 --> 06:02.530
OK.

06:02.560 --> 06:03.910
So next we have is sharing.

06:03.920 --> 06:13.150
For example Bideford whenever someone shared this Borst this does appear in on Facebook this description

06:14.570 --> 06:18.040
the way is we see this description.

06:18.040 --> 06:20.230
This one will appear on Facebook.

06:20.240 --> 06:25.520
This study appeared this link will appear but if you want to override the sendings override means.

06:25.720 --> 06:34.780
If you want to choose some other titles some other description on Facebook you can do that by going

06:34.780 --> 06:43.380
to this and reading catalyses appear on Facebook and this description will appear on Facebook and fordable

06:43.390 --> 06:48.520
you want to use that image instead of feature the image upload that image and that image will appear

06:48.520 --> 06:49.380
on Facebook.

06:49.490 --> 06:49.960
OK.

06:50.080 --> 06:52.750
But it does if you don't want to use these.

06:52.750 --> 06:57.950
Always keep them to you get the next thing we have is what do we do the same thing you can do is for

06:57.970 --> 06:59.700
the Twitter right here OK.

06:59.980 --> 07:08.110
So now I hope you guys got the idea how we can optimize our boss for as eat or and make sure you install

07:08.110 --> 07:12.450
this plugin add all the settings that I have during the previous What do you earn in this video.

07:12.700 --> 07:17.930
And so tell us what is real in the next video we're going to do some more for as well.

07:17.980 --> 07:20.250
So I think you were watching this video I will see you in the next video.
