Hello Guys welcome to this video you are now almost done with the blog.

00:04.680 --> 00:08.970
OK now it's time to talk about some other things.

00:09.020 --> 00:11.770
Comments for those of you guys who are new to WordPress.

00:11.790 --> 00:16.050
I'm about to comment to the few who know how to respond to a comment.

00:16.310 --> 00:17.370
How come it's delivered.

00:17.400 --> 00:19.840
OK so in this video I will show you how.

00:20.190 --> 00:20.500
OK.

00:20.520 --> 00:23.110
Let's log out of our panel first.

00:26.420 --> 00:33.170
Because on your blog it would only show the comment box do not show that users will see OK someone refresh.

00:33.170 --> 00:35.300
Now you will see this board will also be removed.

00:35.310 --> 00:38.780
Ok this one is only for the administrators.

00:38.780 --> 00:42.040
When you are logged in this body will all be visible then.

00:42.050 --> 00:44.130
OK so that is very efficient.

00:48.250 --> 00:49.210
OK.

00:49.360 --> 00:49.980
Awesome.

00:50.170 --> 00:52.660
You can see this.

00:52.720 --> 00:55.530
This is the view that you will see.

00:55.570 --> 00:58.460
This is the blog that you really see OK.

00:58.770 --> 00:59.580
All right.

00:59.720 --> 01:01.230
So this is it.

01:01.630 --> 01:03.860
You can see this is me.

01:04.000 --> 01:10.030
If you don't want it to show here OK you're getting closer.

01:10.080 --> 01:11.270
It is also showing you right now.

01:11.290 --> 01:17.920
But if you wanted to completely disable it to show on the front end what you to do is go to the settings

01:17.950 --> 01:22.780
of this tsunami and to go to the settings you have.

01:22.780 --> 01:27.580
You need to be logged in but let's see if it the place settings.

01:27.580 --> 01:30.290
No we can go to the settings we can go to settings.

01:30.720 --> 01:31.720
OK.

01:32.380 --> 01:33.150
We have to be signed in.

01:33.160 --> 01:33.450
OK.

01:33.450 --> 01:37.560
Then you will go to the settings by clicking on the lake on the set.

01:37.560 --> 01:40.510
Settings there will be an option of showing it here or not.

01:40.510 --> 01:42.680
OK just disable that option it is very easy.

01:42.850 --> 01:45.400
But if you don't find that up here just let me know.

01:45.430 --> 01:46.540
I will show you how to do that.

01:46.550 --> 01:52.010
OK but very easy I know you will do that but just go to settings and find the option.

01:52.030 --> 01:54.860
And there will be option of turning this off.

01:55.090 --> 01:55.860
OK.

01:56.290 --> 01:58.090
So let's work on the comments.

01:58.240 --> 02:02.920
So this is how I use to really comment on other boards.

02:03.080 --> 02:06.220
For that you want to comment on this post.

02:06.280 --> 02:10.030
All he need to do is write his name.

02:10.150 --> 02:18.710
So I'm going to write my name for them and I'm going to write my e-mail and I'm going to write my reps.

02:18.850 --> 02:20.950
Right now that's the way it is.

02:20.970 --> 02:21.940
This is optional.

02:21.940 --> 02:22.260
OK.

02:22.280 --> 02:26.250
If you want friend don't ride up to him or her OK.

02:26.770 --> 02:27.020
Right.

02:27.030 --> 02:33.160
Decremental I'm going to say this is a great post.

02:33.280 --> 02:33.940

03:23.910 --> 03:24.530
OK.

03:24.730 --> 03:28.180
And we can also approve this not to get approved we have to approve the comments.

03:28.180 --> 03:28.810
