Help guys come to this video and this video we're going to talk about the post and pages.

00:05.310 --> 00:08.450
First let me explain the difference between posts and pages.

00:08.450 --> 00:14.620
You guys may already know about the boys and baby boys are just like we see your Facebook news feed

00:15.000 --> 00:21.120

00:21.120 --> 00:21.770
blog.

00:21.960 --> 00:29.440
We create some content with images and text and video and we posted it and that will show on our homepage.

00:29.450 --> 00:31.340
And that is basically the post.

00:31.330 --> 00:32.940
Ok that is Garlett post.

00:32.940 --> 00:35.120
You can read as many posts as you want.

00:35.130 --> 00:35.560
OK.

00:35.610 --> 00:42.390

00:42.390 --> 00:48.740
about your company that is basically the big game legacy about us or contact us on some Web sites.

00:48.750 --> 00:53.740
So let's talk about how we can add posts and pages to our blog.

00:53.790 --> 00:55.190
Go to your Edmond Bendel.

00:55.280 --> 01:01.960
President Bennell and to create a post people post and new OK.

01:02.200 --> 01:04.340
This is where you create your post.

01:04.370 --> 01:12.070
OK enter your post article here and the text are the images or everything related to the post you can

01:12.070 --> 01:14.500
add this in this text field right here.

01:14.500 --> 01:16.510
And these are your options.

01:16.510 --> 01:17.750
These options.

01:18.070 --> 01:20.030
This line is basically hidden.

01:20.230 --> 01:21.350
It is like this.

01:21.350 --> 01:23.790
To show this line what you need to do here.

01:23.810 --> 01:25.670
OK then this toolbar will show.

01:25.720 --> 01:29.850
These are some other options that we can apply to other post.

01:29.860 --> 01:35.200
Ok so now let's create an amazing post to write the data here.

01:35.230 --> 01:43.020
I'm going to said this is the first use of my blog.

01:43.210 --> 01:45.690
OK so this is going to be the title.

01:45.790 --> 01:48.340
Let's write some text about it.

01:48.560 --> 02:01.670
These Buist is amazing because in my first post I guess I'm going to copy this and pasted a couple of

02:01.670 --> 02:02.290
times.

02:02.290 --> 02:06.090
Third I want my boys to look a little bit big again.

02:06.200 --> 02:12.550
You just demonstration of how to show you guys who get this is how you write a post to add image to

02:12.790 --> 02:14.390
add images to your post.

02:14.390 --> 02:15.660
All you need to do.

02:15.750 --> 02:19.950
Click on the word at Image for word and image.

02:21.060 --> 02:26.640
Here in this area I am going to put up some space and color and image here.

02:26.640 --> 02:29.870
Now to add image add media right here.

02:29.940 --> 02:33.000
OK now this box will pop up.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.220
These are two images that I added before.

02:36.390 --> 02:38.580
Just to check if everything is working or not.

02:38.580 --> 02:42.240
This will not show basically if you are doing this to know what you need to do.

02:42.340 --> 02:44.290
Could upload files OK.

02:44.400 --> 02:46.690
Nope it could select files.

02:46.950 --> 02:49.020
No select the file that you want to upload.

02:49.020 --> 02:57.120
It can be an image or it can be a really you know we are going to upload the picture or image.

02:57.120 --> 03:02.010
I have some wallpapers left and direct wallpapers.

03:04.800 --> 03:09.760
OK that is fun open ended is going to be applauded.

03:11.290 --> 03:17.100
And click on insert into the post I'm just showing you how you can add both.

03:17.140 --> 03:18.540
If you can do it already.

03:18.540 --> 03:22.600
OK this is very easy just like working on a mix of it.

03:22.600 --> 03:23.220
OK.

03:23.290 --> 03:25.250
See all these options here.

03:25.270 --> 03:29.230
This is to make the next board select some text and click on it.

03:29.230 --> 03:36.250
The text will become bored if you want some text to be a DELICH selected and click this icon and it

03:36.250 --> 03:38.970
will become DELICH if you want to create a heading.

03:39.050 --> 03:41.700
For example let's execute a heading.

03:41.830 --> 03:47.020
I'm going to say this is the heading

03:49.590 --> 03:57.960
of my number make it heading just call here and click whatever heading you want to do heading what heading

03:57.990 --> 03:59.480
to is too much big.

03:59.490 --> 04:03.090
I always do heading to but it depends on you whatever you want to do.

04:03.090 --> 04:08.230
I'm going to heading to and see what becomes heading you can as many headings you want.

04:08.250 --> 04:11.300
OK now you guys know how to add picture.

04:11.790 --> 04:15.880
Let's let's reposition the image file.

04:15.930 --> 04:18.540
You want the image to appear on the right side.

04:18.540 --> 04:21.140
These are the position options click on it.

04:21.310 --> 04:23.690
See it is now in the right side.

04:23.750 --> 04:25.410
Make it look in the center.

04:25.410 --> 04:28.070
Click on this and it will be in the center.

04:28.080 --> 04:33.480
Now for the left side click on this and see it in the left third of over text.

04:33.510 --> 04:36.300
Ok this is how we add images known.

04:36.300 --> 04:41.780
For example you want to insert this image somewhere else that will blow the text.

04:41.880 --> 04:45.880
You can't simply drag it on it and drag it right here.

04:45.890 --> 04:49.320
You notice here you can add it wherever you want.

04:49.650 --> 04:51.030
Just drag it.

04:51.060 --> 04:53.310
This is how we'd write a post.

04:53.320 --> 04:57.400
Now let's talk a little a little bit about the groggery we will.

04:57.590 --> 05:00.030
I will explain categories in the next with you.

05:00.030 --> 05:04.360
I will explain when I get in dept in the next room to you know for the pools.

05:04.590 --> 05:07.470
The category is necessary to talk about here.

05:07.920 --> 05:10.390
Categories are basically doors.

05:10.980 --> 05:15.000
You can see the categories are very important for a page.

05:15.150 --> 05:20.270
You might read about technology and health health and technology will be your category.

05:20.640 --> 05:22.470
This post is related to the health.

05:22.500 --> 05:23.660
I click on.

05:23.680 --> 05:28.090
Categories are shown here again and they will be held and they will be declawed you.

05:28.290 --> 05:31.310
This post helped me select the health category.

05:31.560 --> 05:38.220
Then I would publish my post and this board will be under health category so I will explain this in

05:38.220 --> 05:44.340
the next video how we can create categories delete categories how we can add balls to a certain category.

05:44.370 --> 05:50.640
Right now we have only one category and that is Uncategorized because we have not created a category.

05:50.670 --> 05:52.980
We get to go to it in the next video.

05:53.430 --> 05:57.480
OK now we have goodies from going to Uncategorized.

05:57.480 --> 06:03.020
OK so this is the first team that you need to select the category.

06:03.030 --> 06:09.090
The second thing that you need to do after creating post is to select the featured image or upload the

06:09.090 --> 06:10.900
featured image featuring me.

06:10.940 --> 06:14.010
Basically demonstrate our features your boss.

06:14.250 --> 06:19.850
This boss is related to the heart disease and heart disease.

06:19.860 --> 06:22.360
So select relevant image about heart disease.

06:22.360 --> 06:23.770
What is a person.

06:23.930 --> 06:29.690
He has his hand on his chest and that shows about heart heart disease.

06:29.700 --> 06:36.230
OK that is just I'm just telling you that your post missed your picture must be related to your post.

06:36.330 --> 06:43.320
So forgivable this post is about technology so the feature must be relevant to the technology.

06:43.320 --> 06:45.970
OK so you got the idea what I'm saying.

06:45.990 --> 06:47.010
To me you're very important.

06:47.030 --> 06:53.770
OK all with the Mr Good post so I'm going to click Set featured image.

06:53.900 --> 06:56.530
I'm going to upload a file for my featured image.

06:56.550 --> 07:01.970
It looks like a wallpaper is just for demonstration but upload a random picture but your picture must

07:01.970 --> 07:03.650
be relevant to your post.

07:03.650 --> 07:05.350
Make sure they're OK.

07:05.400 --> 07:08.990
So this is just a demonstration of will upload and image

07:13.410 --> 07:15.820
this throughout is.

07:16.410 --> 07:17.190
I hope you believe that.

07:17.190 --> 07:18.380
Q ready next year.

07:18.540 --> 07:19.280
OK.

07:19.320 --> 07:24.870

07:25.120 --> 07:27.000
OK this is our featured image now.

07:27.000 --> 07:27.470

07:27.570 --> 07:36.570
So first thing is you'd get bored at night and media whatever you want to do on your boss whatever you

07:36.570 --> 07:40.020
want to write every media add pictures or videos.

07:40.020 --> 07:42.640
Second thing you need to do is select the category.

07:42.780 --> 07:50.160
And third important thing is featured in these things only you need these three teams to make a post

07:50.480 --> 07:53.450

07:53.460 --> 07:58.180
