00:00.610 --> 00:06.560
Hello guys that come to this with you in this video we're going on about how you can write a best or

00:06.730 --> 00:07.340
OK.

00:07.560 --> 00:13.750
The boss that is really good in the eyes or on the eyes of our in the eyes of search engines again.

00:14.210 --> 00:17.840
And we really check that post by using this as open again.

00:17.890 --> 00:23.540
So all you need to do is go to the post to lead the polls that we just wrote the polls.

00:23.550 --> 00:26.980
These is the better looking both.

00:26.980 --> 00:29.730
These are just bad examples that I just showed you.

00:29.910 --> 00:30.390
OK.

00:30.560 --> 00:32.870
Get a room somewhere to move these balls.

00:32.870 --> 00:41.880
I'm going to go to our post and we're going to move to trash apply.

00:41.890 --> 00:44.220
So these are going to be deleted.

00:45.430 --> 00:46.210
OK.

00:46.600 --> 00:49.820
I'm going to go to trash.

00:49.880 --> 01:00.240
I mean I'm going to move these permanently permanently like.

01:00.590 --> 01:02.660
Gay boys are going to loners.

01:02.690 --> 01:03.850
Add a new boys

01:06.950 --> 01:13.650
so like I said Never be content from some other blogs but for the demonstration purpose here how to

01:13.720 --> 01:15.430
best blog post.

01:15.430 --> 01:19.590
I'm just going to add some content from a blog just for demonstration purpose.

01:19.750 --> 01:22.750
Because right now I don't have a lot of content right here.

01:22.750 --> 01:23.180
OK.

01:23.320 --> 01:27.920
So I'm going to copy someone from some other blog and I will show you that how we can optimize that.

01:27.970 --> 01:30.660
But don't ever copy from somewhere else.

01:30.670 --> 01:31.210
OK.

01:31.330 --> 01:35.010
So I'm just doing it for example for showing you.

01:35.190 --> 01:35.690
OK.

01:35.860 --> 01:40.630
We are just going to copy some text and you don't have to do it again.

01:41.410 --> 01:45.130
For example this is a nice looking blog a really nice blog.

01:45.400 --> 01:49.930
And you can see what we have here.

01:49.960 --> 01:56.520
Like us on Facebook blogging and recent polls the one that we just added.

01:56.710 --> 02:01.810
And these are my coming posts and these shared icons is a good blog.

02:01.810 --> 02:05.470
You can just make the big blog just looking like this.

02:05.510 --> 02:09.870
This is an awesome first ad all in one blog you can see.

02:10.070 --> 02:10.930
OK.

02:11.130 --> 02:16.400
So the thing is that the settings that I have just showed you in the previous videos you can apply to

02:16.440 --> 02:19.010
selfies to make up an amazing blog like this.

02:19.040 --> 02:19.930
OK.

02:20.110 --> 02:25.170
So let's copy the first post and this is for just the demonstration.

02:25.180 --> 02:31.630
But I'm seeing this again and again I'm forcing you to never copy of content of someone else.

02:31.630 --> 02:32.420
OK.

02:32.650 --> 02:34.430
Because Google really is not like this.

02:34.450 --> 02:35.300
OK.

02:35.890 --> 02:38.500
So you can see this volume this board.

02:38.500 --> 02:42.760
It has pictures and headings make sure you add headings and pictures.

02:42.850 --> 02:44.050
If you don't have the video.

02:44.080 --> 02:44.940
No problem.

02:45.040 --> 02:51.780
But if you have a video of the boss it will be more amazing that people will really like it.

02:51.790 --> 02:56.490
All right so let's copy some of the content.

02:56.740 --> 02:58.360
Let's copy this first.

02:58.350 --> 03:01.750
Better get a copy and even a piece

03:06.230 --> 03:09.340
p.

03:10.010 --> 03:16.000
And then we're going to go to the third paragraph.

03:16.100 --> 03:17.110
I'm not writing.

03:17.240 --> 03:19.360
I'm not writing any headings.

03:19.400 --> 03:19.890
We will write.

03:19.910 --> 03:23.480
We will do the headings from these decks that I'm going to go be.

03:24.180 --> 03:25.990
OK.

03:31.170 --> 03:35.860
We tried to I of if it was not got read.

03:36.350 --> 03:38.090
OK.

03:38.140 --> 03:40.210
So we have ended that paragraph.

03:40.490 --> 03:41.160
OK.

03:41.250 --> 03:46.730
The verdict is enough I'm going to close it.

03:46.930 --> 03:47.740
All right.

03:47.860 --> 03:49.840
Let's also be the

03:52.450 --> 03:53.540
featured image.

03:53.560 --> 03:59.470
You can see this is the featured in which I'm also going to copy this and the word on the next.

04:00.540 --> 04:02.130
OK.

04:02.140 --> 04:07.480
So let's set up an image and make sure you get a jury.

04:07.540 --> 04:08.950
It's going to be in the.

04:09.580 --> 04:14.290
And yes upload applaud the image upload applaud files

04:17.490 --> 04:18.300
made it the

04:23.480 --> 04:27.750
OK we can image OK.

04:27.960 --> 04:29.210
Featured images.

04:29.640 --> 04:31.520
Gregory's done.

04:31.580 --> 04:33.120
Next is Nurse load.

04:33.150 --> 04:36.250
Let's write some headings for them.

04:36.270 --> 04:38.740
I'm going to make this first line as heading.

04:38.790 --> 04:42.170
Make sure you have some headings like the headings.

04:42.580 --> 04:48.680
OK let's make this heading two or three I think.

04:48.870 --> 04:49.870
Make under that heading.

04:49.910 --> 04:50.940
And I'm going to use

04:54.790 --> 04:55.860
this one as heading.

04:55.890 --> 04:59.420
It doesn't make sense but I'm just going to I just want to show you.

04:59.420 --> 05:00.090
OK.

05:00.830 --> 05:02.280
Adding three.

05:02.660 --> 05:03.690
What else we have here.

05:03.710 --> 05:09.210
OK let's make this a heading heading 3.

05:09.230 --> 05:10.130
OK.

05:10.500 --> 05:12.890
All right headings are enough.

05:13.020 --> 05:18.960
We have the image headings and some good text you never paused we just select the selected the category.

05:18.990 --> 05:19.950
All right.

05:20.060 --> 05:22.300
Now what you need to do here.

05:22.530 --> 05:22.920
OK.

05:22.920 --> 05:26.700
Just watch carefully what I'm going to do that is very important for me.

05:26.720 --> 05:33.920
Or you just create a report that said if all is done learn to optimize it for you the maze.

05:33.930 --> 05:35.650
The main purpose of this video.

05:35.760 --> 05:42.450
The first thing that you need to do here on this the most often these these these options are just for

05:42.450 --> 05:43.290
these 40.

05:43.290 --> 05:50.420
These are not as far as this used Plug-In but it's also important for the athlete.

05:50.750 --> 05:54.560
Now you see this display on this featured image.

05:54.690 --> 05:58.090
What will you do it will display your frigid image.

05:58.100 --> 06:04.620
When ever someone paste the link to Facebook or Twitter or some other social media we will always see

06:04.620 --> 06:10.170
our featured image in the U.S. whenever someone pasted you for all of our posts.

06:10.170 --> 06:11.620
We will see the featured media.

06:11.700 --> 06:14.580
So make sure you can contribute in making this display.

06:14.760 --> 06:17.790
So next thing keep everything as it is.

06:17.800 --> 06:27.900
Now here is the main part used as we see this because of this other nice new blogging as we all know

06:27.930 --> 06:33.600
this is how our post will look in the search engine.

06:33.600 --> 06:35.310
This is how we look in the Google.

06:35.310 --> 06:39.200
Now you can see we don't have the title of our boss.

06:39.240 --> 06:41.770
I forgot I just forgot to write the title.

06:42.070 --> 06:43.780
OK so let's write the title.

06:43.830 --> 06:53.310
This post is about the symptoms and symptoms of some diseases are getting less right.

06:55.830 --> 07:07.020
Of these symptoms some dangerous diseases.

07:07.060 --> 07:11.540
OK this is the director of her post.

07:11.590 --> 07:13.980
The symptoms of some dangerous disease.

07:14.160 --> 07:20.060
So what you can think the most focused Virk what could be the most focus Verd of our posts.

07:20.150 --> 07:22.620
Again what would be the most focused word.

07:22.830 --> 07:28.270
I think the symptoms can be the most focused Verd of this post because we are talking about the symptoms.

07:28.380 --> 07:31.880
Symptoms of something you just did is we're talking about the symptoms.

07:31.980 --> 07:38.460
So the focused word for this post can be symptoms you can see this is symptoms and symptoms of symptom.

07:38.460 --> 07:44.710
Word here well guess at the end of the symptom or so symptom could be the focus of this post.

07:44.710 --> 07:46.230
OK so keep focused word.

07:46.260 --> 07:48.010
Word is important for you.

07:48.060 --> 07:52.100
OK so now here is our we.

07:52.260 --> 07:56.000
Or you can see we have our symptoms of somebody and you just it.

07:56.010 --> 08:04.640
We have the title again no we want entered the focus giver for our boards focused gibbered is important.

08:04.650 --> 08:07.070
Like I said what could be the focus of this post.

08:07.080 --> 08:12.740
It could be symptoms yes.

08:13.790 --> 08:19.920
No you see we have green green beans our s s equal for.

08:19.920 --> 08:21.230
This post is good.

08:21.420 --> 08:25.660
If I just remove this focus gibber and watch what happens.

08:25.950 --> 08:28.740
See it does not show any dating.

08:28.860 --> 08:34.990
It is just showing that it is not good for you or make sure it is green.

08:35.020 --> 08:38.400
OK so the Earth I'm going to add some kind of word here.

08:38.430 --> 08:42.530
OK see it is showing this orange dye.

08:42.540 --> 08:44.970
That means it is not good for the s.

08:44.970 --> 08:48.160
You are just poor again.

08:48.360 --> 08:50.370
It is between the bad and good.

08:50.400 --> 08:54.080
You can see it is just ok for them because we have wrong focus.

08:54.080 --> 08:57.080
We work to make sure you read exect focused giver.

08:57.240 --> 09:00.480
OK so now you can see this is the NLCS.

09:00.480 --> 09:04.100
These are the analyses of our boards.

09:04.100 --> 09:09.880
The first thing that is very bad for this post is no better description has been specified.

09:09.960 --> 09:15.390
But don't worry because the matter is competitive in other medical issues specify the description.

09:15.550 --> 09:21.930
But you can also read the description that is good too good for the.

09:22.090 --> 09:24.370
You are just not really sure the exact reading.

09:24.370 --> 09:30.100
OK so by default it also has a description but you can also write them manually.

09:30.100 --> 09:32.760
What we need to do is read the description.

09:32.860 --> 09:42.490
Copy this text or this text make sure the text that is relevant to this post or what your post about

09:43.030 --> 09:43.850
or you can.

09:43.870 --> 09:52.150
It doesn't have to be the text in the first text or first few lines of your post it doesn't have to

09:52.150 --> 09:53.770
be what you can do.

09:53.770 --> 09:56.360
You can manually write what your post is about.

09:56.360 --> 09:59.360
OK and manually right here what your post is about.

09:59.370 --> 10:00.720
Game this textfield.

10:00.820 --> 10:03.140
I just copied from a former depost.

10:03.160 --> 10:07.780
OK so you can see we don't have the.

10:07.780 --> 10:09.010
That error is gone.

10:09.010 --> 10:09.510
Gone.

10:09.520 --> 10:15.170
OK so now what we are getting a better description haven't specified but it does not contain the full

10:15.170 --> 10:16.170
cost giver.

10:16.180 --> 10:23.120
OK what good is symptoms symptom focused give what is not in this description.

10:23.220 --> 10:26.430
OK better description specified but doesn't exclude it.

10:26.470 --> 10:29.730
Let's add the focus focus keyword.

10:29.770 --> 10:34.380
It is a very long description of some some of it.

10:34.580 --> 10:36.540
OK so let's add the focus.

10:36.580 --> 10:38.150
It may be a sign.

10:38.380 --> 10:44.100
Let's make the sign to symptoms.

10:44.350 --> 10:47.450
It may be a symptom of a serious.

10:47.530 --> 10:48.710
These may be OK.

10:48.730 --> 10:49.570
Keep it as it is.

10:49.620 --> 10:52.450
Are these because we are dumb.

10:52.610 --> 10:56.150
That is OK this is OK.

10:56.170 --> 11:05.230
You can see why it just becomes red because the the length of this description is too much so I'm going

11:05.230 --> 11:08.310
to remove some of it liberally Saunders.

11:08.320 --> 11:12.690
OK now that error is gone because now we have this.

11:12.700 --> 11:14.200
You can see it makes it bored.

11:14.230 --> 11:16.690
That means our focus is here and here.

11:16.700 --> 11:19.320
OK the best is to read Bouvard.

11:19.330 --> 11:22.140
This is below the 300 word ok.

11:22.300 --> 11:30.600
Your text must be greater than 300 but like I said it is good as you get plenty as your post as Leonti

11:30.610 --> 11:39.520
as possible but it should not be too much Leonti for someone to come to your blog and the board is too

11:39.520 --> 11:40.170
much left.

11:40.180 --> 11:42.260
Maybe just go away.

11:42.270 --> 11:49.390
Ok made the post that is not do much Leonti and not too much chartable game make make it look good post

11:49.390 --> 11:51.860
must not be greater than 1000 words.

11:51.880 --> 11:59.350
OK you can see off a few hundred words and make sure it is also not less than three words.

11:59.390 --> 12:05.260
OK so you can see this as using that definition in reverse but it should begin to the of words.

12:05.260 --> 12:06.910
OK but it is not very bad.

12:06.910 --> 12:08.890
It is just OK you can see what it means.

12:08.910 --> 12:11.930
OK and that means dead.

12:12.160 --> 12:12.980
Red means bad.

12:12.990 --> 12:13.310
OK.
