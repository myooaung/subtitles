00:25.350 --> 00:26.940
I'm going to go for the fever again.

00:27.090 --> 00:37.780
I'm going to see what birth team free download OK on the first website you see

00:40.590 --> 00:54.570

00:54.560 --> 00:56.510
Same started on

01:07.690 --> 01:16.570
gay number one includes the our team is in the Downloads folder.

01:16.600 --> 01:20.620
Don't know where it is going next dictate where

01:28.870 --> 01:29.960
recommendation would

01:34.360 --> 01:35.920
OK.

01:36.420 --> 01:41.110
So this is the zip file that we will upload to play over the team.

01:41.120 --> 01:43.280
OK fine.

01:44.040 --> 01:46.770
But best early a zip file for the team.

01:46.770 --> 01:47.100
OK.

01:47.110 --> 01:50.720
And this is this is basically the other team.

01:50.760 --> 01:51.470
OK.

01:51.720 --> 01:58.570
So I'm going to I'm going to be is where we're going to be for.

01:58.920 --> 01:59.220
OK.

01:59.250 --> 02:00.470
This is our team.

02:00.530 --> 02:06.470
I uploaded the file is for M-B.

02:06.590 --> 02:07.760
This is the back end.

02:07.910 --> 02:15.980
Now for those of you guys who are totally new to what press just follow what I do to oblige the team

02:16.090 --> 02:16.840
work best.

02:16.850 --> 02:21.230
All you need do is go to appearance people in teams

02:24.620 --> 02:25.340
Agnew.

02:32.610 --> 02:36.360
Show free team then we can apply our best site.

02:36.380 --> 02:40.810
A lot of free teams see feature.

02:40.850 --> 02:48.440
These are the features that 15 you can go to popular late as you can even feature your features but

02:48.470 --> 02:51.040
I preferred that he found that we just don't know it.

02:51.050 --> 02:51.800
OK.

02:51.800 --> 02:54.040
Or you can search the team you want.

02:54.050 --> 02:54.330
OK.

02:54.350 --> 03:00.630
But we are going to upload it because we have to be the team and we are going to upload on her breast.

03:00.880 --> 03:04.930
Now you could upload now.

03:04.970 --> 03:13.340
One thing that is very important to mention is the upload file size the mix them up and file size for

03:13.340 --> 03:18.570
the local host is and B and B are I think Trium be OK.

03:18.710 --> 03:25.590
And even when you buy the hosting from your hosting provider the upload size will be will be all for

03:25.590 --> 03:26.130
M-B.

03:26.240 --> 03:27.610
When I-bar.

03:28.280 --> 03:36.530
My hosting of upper MX MX upper Phyliss was to me he asked my hosting provider and he increased that

03:36.530 --> 03:37.330
file size.

03:37.340 --> 03:38.250
OK.

03:38.840 --> 03:45.860
So for the local host who can increase these differences on our own IT IS ONLY It is very simple to

03:45.860 --> 03:46.320
do.

03:46.370 --> 03:48.740
All you need to do is good exam

03:51.440 --> 03:53.130
D and get them

03:58.080 --> 04:00.860
whose Herrod is exam.

04:00.860 --> 04:11.540
Now this is the we're best but for the max upload size we need to go to PH before to know find the file

04:11.540 --> 04:13.530
with the name BHB dart.

04:13.690 --> 04:19.990
And I hear it is BHB the extension of this file is ionize you can see a B.

04:20.030 --> 04:21.940
This file is called BHB don't I.

04:21.990 --> 04:27.040
And I are Lippi its physicians are in this in this file.

04:27.140 --> 04:28.930
I'm going to open it.

04:28.970 --> 04:32.520
No we only need to change the size of two things.

04:32.540 --> 04:33.270
OK.

04:33.520 --> 04:35.530
Here it is.

04:35.910 --> 04:38.000
I adore these two things a lot.

04:38.020 --> 04:38.990
So.

04:39.560 --> 04:44.870
So we are going to search for these two in this file and we were going to increase this the first two

04:44.930 --> 04:46.230
is both make sense.

04:46.280 --> 04:50.840
And the second thing is uploader McPharlin says we going to increase the file says of both of these

04:51.010 --> 04:53.280
two games all the entries.

04:53.300 --> 04:57.740
But I'm going to show you how you can find these two and increase them.

04:57.820 --> 05:05.990
I'm going to of this company and a final good this is a huge file so we can just go line by line and

05:05.990 --> 05:07.120
see where it is.

05:07.190 --> 05:13.300
All you can do is you can see you can copy this or you can type it here.

05:13.310 --> 05:22.520
I'm going to copy it and I'm going to go to file at it and find I'm going to paste it here and I'm going

05:22.520 --> 05:24.080
to go fight.

05:24.140 --> 05:27.770
See it just look at you Deporter underscore Northcoast guys.

05:27.820 --> 05:30.190
So you just need repipe here post-release correct.

05:30.230 --> 05:30.670
Right.

05:30.800 --> 05:33.300
Underscore size and it will come here.

05:33.320 --> 05:39.770
You can see all the increase DTG 100 and B be but in your case it will be to immature for me or maybe

05:39.770 --> 05:44.120
for my family OK you can increase the 264 and be hundred every whatever you want.

05:44.130 --> 05:47.600
I agree with you two hundred and be OK.

05:47.690 --> 05:50.730
Mitchell you agree that OK offering using this.

05:50.760 --> 05:53.590
No we need to increase this.

05:53.600 --> 05:56.860
This is basically the boss Mexico is not defined it says I'm sorry.

05:56.860 --> 06:03.320
This is the max size the maximum size that we can send using a proposed size.

06:03.320 --> 06:08.870
If you if you guys are familiar with PSP you guys know what Borst is OK but if you are not doing very

06:08.870 --> 06:11.380
you don't need to care about what both.

06:11.430 --> 06:12.640
You just need to increase that.

06:12.690 --> 06:15.100
OK I'm going to copy this.

06:15.380 --> 06:18.330
Go to edit fine.

06:18.520 --> 06:20.040
What a basted.

06:20.090 --> 06:22.960
You need to type it up and make that file.

06:22.990 --> 06:23.250
Yes.

06:23.300 --> 06:25.240
And click next and see.

06:25.250 --> 06:31.760
I have also Inglese it already increase it to whatever you want and make sure after doing all these

06:31.760 --> 06:32.730
you click save.

06:32.750 --> 06:33.360
OK.

06:33.470 --> 06:34.680
So it will be saved.

06:36.230 --> 06:36.890
OK.

06:36.970 --> 06:37.900
None.

06:38.280 --> 06:41.380
And after doing this one thing that is very important.

06:41.400 --> 06:45.980
After doing after increasing the file size make sure you restart your exam.

06:46.020 --> 06:47.110
OK.

06:47.740 --> 06:54.420
Study them you can you can restart your computer or start restart your computer and then start the exam

06:54.480 --> 06:54.890
again.

06:54.900 --> 06:55.160
OK.

06:55.170 --> 06:56.150
Then it will work.

06:56.190 --> 06:57.480
Otherwise it will not work.

06:57.490 --> 06:58.130
OK.

06:58.470 --> 07:00.140
Then the file size would be reused.

07:00.150 --> 07:02.980
Now we are able to upload heavy teams.

07:03.000 --> 07:03.660
OK.

07:03.970 --> 07:09.020
Otherwise the team with food imbecile's or LMB says we will not be able to upload.

07:09.150 --> 07:11.360
Now we can upload heavy teams OK.

07:11.580 --> 07:21.880
So now to play this team that we have because in the donors for all you need to do is click on File.

07:22.150 --> 07:30.390
Good to know wrote and picante for team and be open and just upload of our team.

07:30.400 --> 07:32.860
No install now.

07:32.860 --> 07:33.820
So when I started.

07:33.850 --> 07:35.900
And then we will do it team.

07:35.920 --> 07:41.530
As you can see it will take a little bit of time because a local host and it is faster than the live

07:41.530 --> 07:42.280
server.

07:42.550 --> 07:45.400
So what we do in in a minute.

07:45.700 --> 07:48.680
But if you go to our lives the road will take some time.

07:49.360 --> 07:54.680
So as you can see it is done now to apply to see for Team.

07:54.700 --> 07:59.280
All you need to do is click put activity to activate it

08:02.520 --> 08:03.660
as you can see.

08:03.720 --> 08:05.920
Our team is activated.

08:06.090 --> 08:09.120
Ok now I'm going to refresh it and see

08:12.680 --> 08:13.370
yes.

08:13.490 --> 08:16.080
Our team is activated.

08:16.910 --> 08:18.350
This is the C for our team.

08:18.380 --> 08:18.720
OK.

08:18.740 --> 08:22.460
And these a very popular and very awesome blog team.

08:22.490 --> 08:28.830
And almost 100 percent or almost 60 percent bloggers with this team.

08:28.850 --> 08:29.190
OK.

08:29.210 --> 08:36.050
And I'd recommend you to use it because it is very easy to use even if you are not totally familiar

08:36.050 --> 08:39.230
with what browser and you don't even know what good press is.

08:39.230 --> 08:41.100
You can't work with this team.

08:41.210 --> 08:41.930
So this is done.

08:41.960 --> 08:44.980
We have applied over the team in the next video.

08:44.990 --> 08:51.780
We will customize our team move to add some cool stuff and we will do everything that discourse goes.

08:51.800 --> 08:52.430
OK.

08:52.460 --> 08:55.840
So you guys are watching this do you see you in the next video.
