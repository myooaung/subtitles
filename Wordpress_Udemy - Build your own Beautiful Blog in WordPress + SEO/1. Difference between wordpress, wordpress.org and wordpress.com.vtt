Hello guys can do this with you in this way to you.

00:03.120 --> 00:08.940
And there's some confusion that most of the beginners face and that is the difference between what breasts

00:09.000 --> 00:12.090
what President or GM and what best dot.com.

00:12.090 --> 00:13.940
So let's start with the vert press.

00:13.940 --> 00:16.900
What press is basically the content management system.

00:16.920 --> 00:22.020
See the front and back and for web site where we manage the whole website that is the best that is the

00:22.020 --> 00:29.160
actual application that we will be using the best just what the vet said that provides that application

00:29.200 --> 00:36.450
what best application would download that from this president who are you upset and also have the forum

00:36.450 --> 00:41.060
where we can post other Curies and ask questions from the community.

00:41.230 --> 00:50.190
And it has a lot of others that we can get in any problem and it has other Legan's that we can download

00:50.190 --> 00:57.530
and teams to divert Brasa does the sports website where we can get help from other experts on hand hand

00:57.700 --> 01:00.980
press dot com is a totally different website.

01:00.990 --> 01:06.560
This better basically provided the free blog we can get free blog on this website when we no longer

01:06.580 --> 01:11.740
divert press and upload all unrepaired there is Guard Ceph self-hosted blog.

01:11.880 --> 01:15.900
But we can also use free blog plus dog.

01:15.930 --> 01:20.520
God provides that service just like Blogger dot com blog and not done by Google.

01:20.560 --> 01:22.420
We create free blog on that website.

01:22.440 --> 01:26.790
But there are a lot of restrictions in there and the same thing is for us dot com.

01:26.790 --> 01:30.800
There are a lot of restrictions there in your blog on WordPress dropped not gone.

01:31.110 --> 01:32.430
So we will not do that.

01:32.460 --> 01:36.740
Don't ever use free blog because there are a lot of restrictions there.

01:36.840 --> 01:42.360
You cannot do anything freely but when you use self-hosted blog you are free.

01:42.360 --> 01:43.760
You can do anything you want.

01:43.760 --> 01:49.760
You can put any or add you are anything but on free blogs.

01:49.860 --> 01:55.830
There are a lot of restrictions you will face and we're Dorte what but dot Dropcam provides us the free

01:55.830 --> 01:57.540
blog that we don't want.

01:57.540 --> 01:58.330
All right.

01:58.560 --> 02:03.250
So I hope no you guys know what press the press dart or best dog gone.

02:03.380 --> 02:10.680
So let me just revise what brass is just the content management system we we manage our website where

02:10.800 --> 02:16.560
there is a friend and a back in and everything else is basically the application and we're president

02:16.730 --> 02:23.450
or basically said that provide support related to the press we can download from this website and would

02:23.460 --> 02:29.070
press dot com the Web site that provide as free blogging service.

02:29.180 --> 02:29.540
Right.

02:29.550 --> 02:31.590
And don't ever use replugging service.

02:31.590 --> 02:36.890
As I mentioned earlier that there are a lot of the sections there already we are not free to do anything.

02:36.930 --> 02:41.700
So I hope you guys don't know the difference between what best what best not what and we're pressed

02:41.750 --> 02:42.840
dotcom.

02:42.930 --> 02:47.460
