00:00.690 --> 00:07.090
Hello guys and welcome to this you in this video we will only work on sidebar and we will make it awesome.

00:07.150 --> 00:07.720
OK.

00:08.010 --> 00:10.470
So log in to your breast and read Bennell.

00:10.620 --> 00:20.130
And good to appearance Bridget's note here we can't change over sidebar settings and settings.

00:20.160 --> 00:20.780
OK.

00:20.790 --> 00:25.960
We can also change the settings in this team but they're also not a lot of settings in there.

00:26.070 --> 00:30.920
But the main settings for footer and sidebar are in here appears in widgets.

00:31.040 --> 00:32.070
OK.

00:32.460 --> 00:35.720
So in this video we will work on this sidebar.

00:35.790 --> 00:39.290
Now you can see we have a lot of widgets on the sidebar resent pause.

00:39.330 --> 00:40.740
The man goes mad.

00:40.740 --> 00:42.090
These are not looking good.

00:42.120 --> 00:46.230
We will remove all of these except recent post and search.

00:46.260 --> 00:46.890
OK.

00:47.160 --> 00:51.760
So here it is Pramer he would get edia this primary widget area is the sidebar.

00:51.780 --> 00:52.400
OK.

00:52.470 --> 00:59.220
And if what were we what did we want here will be appear all over the sidebar.

00:59.220 --> 00:59.820
OK.

00:59.940 --> 01:11.090
Right now we have Sir's Serge recent post recent Post archives archives and other men and Demetra I

01:11.180 --> 01:12.850
can see pros and dimeter.

01:12.860 --> 01:18.080
So this is all right sidebar and these are available widgets we can drag whatever we want here.

01:18.080 --> 01:18.540
OK.

01:18.620 --> 01:26.000
So let's start on the sidebar first let's remove these let's only keep search areas and post let's remove

01:26.000 --> 01:27.090
these three.

01:27.170 --> 01:30.080
These three are not looking good on the side bar to remove.

01:30.080 --> 01:32.490
Just click on this and click delete.

01:33.910 --> 01:35.220
It's gone.

01:35.540 --> 01:42.170
So let's move this to and let's send him to Mento.

01:42.270 --> 01:45.510
So when we click delete it automatically saves the settings.

01:45.520 --> 01:45.780
OK.

01:45.790 --> 01:49.610
So literally freshen see.

01:49.710 --> 01:54.660
We only have search and recent post widgets these are these things are called Widgets.

01:54.660 --> 01:57.410
This is such widget is a recent post.

01:57.420 --> 02:00.750
You know we have only two widgets search and recent posts.

02:00.810 --> 02:03.180
So let's make this decision for some.

02:03.210 --> 02:05.100
Let's make this recent post amazing.

02:05.100 --> 02:06.290
OK this is not looking good.

02:06.290 --> 02:11.760
It is not featured image share and there's no post-date there is only a little text of the balls.

02:11.790 --> 02:13.410
It is not looking good.

02:13.540 --> 02:17.500
Jane this recent post VJ's we need a plug in.

02:17.520 --> 02:21.870
OK we will install that again and that will make this awesome.

02:21.900 --> 02:22.750

02:29.740 --> 02:30.090
is.

02:30.140 --> 02:31.900
Let me tell you what blogging is.

02:31.900 --> 02:38.890
Blogging is then a little piece of software that is added to divert breath that adds some functionality.

02:39.000 --> 02:44.230
For example when we are looking for recent posts it will only make this post more amazing.

02:44.230 --> 02:48.630
You can only add some functionality to over recent posts are kept plugging.

02:48.660 --> 02:56.910
Our little piece of software that we at overprice upset to do something to note at blogging from a recent

02:56.910 --> 02:57.340
post.

02:57.360 --> 02:59.840
All you need to do is be conduced plugins.

03:02.500 --> 03:03.140
And new

03:07.670 --> 03:14.730
here and search for everything and was extended OK.

03:14.820 --> 03:21.460

03:24.710 --> 03:28.420
This is an awesome widget I always install this widget.

03:28.610 --> 03:30.010
Nobody can install low

03:32.580 --> 03:42.210

03:42.420 --> 03:43.920
Now the plugin is ready.

03:43.920 --> 03:47.400
OK now what plugin is ready and know what we need.

03:47.400 --> 03:52.510
Do we need to add the verdict of this plugin to the sidebar.

03:52.500 --> 03:56.860
All we need to do to appear in widgets.

03:57.310 --> 04:01.670
Now you will see we will have an other recent post which is OK.

04:02.400 --> 04:03.790
OK let's see.

04:03.810 --> 04:11.040
Is there a decent post with you that is added by their hatred of recent posts extended that Ligon added

04:11.070 --> 04:11.840
and the widget.

04:11.840 --> 04:17.250
OK so we are going to remove this default recent post that is not good.

04:17.300 --> 04:29.750
OK now we are going to break this supposed extended to our Sidebar OK make sure you drag it right after

04:29.760 --> 04:30.540
the search.

04:30.590 --> 04:31.260
OK.

04:31.650 --> 04:35.210
When you graduate you will see these settings about the recent post widget.

04:35.220 --> 04:35.780
OK.

04:35.820 --> 04:42.710

04:47.580 --> 04:53.160
We don't want to see pages in the sidebar and this is the title What title do you want for them.

04:53.170 --> 04:55.010
Palestine is just different post.

04:55.040 --> 04:55.520

04:55.610 --> 04:57.900
Simple as good as it is.

04:58.060 --> 05:05.610
So I recommend you to keep everything as it is but only thing you want between is this number of posts.

05:05.640 --> 05:06.660
OK.

05:06.930 --> 05:08.300

05:08.310 --> 05:10.200
And again and then hit Save

05:14.180 --> 05:16.070
OK saved.

05:16.080 --> 05:19.550
Now click on this to collapse it.

05:19.630 --> 05:24.750
No it is saved fresh and you will see you know we have a break.

05:24.780 --> 05:28.300
Now we have a great recent post widget that have date.

05:28.380 --> 05:31.680
It has the title of the post and it has the image of the post.

05:31.690 --> 05:32.050
OK.

05:32.070 --> 05:34.670
And it will show us up to five images.

05:34.700 --> 05:38.430
No no we don't have don't have any balls.

05:38.430 --> 05:44.140
That's why it is only showing one what it was five Borst like we said in here OK.

05:44.430 --> 05:48.280
So now the sidebar is looking a little bit good.

05:48.300 --> 05:48.960
OK.

05:49.170 --> 05:51.270
So you can add more plugins you want.

05:51.270 --> 05:52.970
We have a lot of widgets here.

05:52.980 --> 05:55.370
Look at the archives categories.

05:55.680 --> 06:00.150
If you want to show the character that you can add categories we have pages and read with you to show

06:00.150 --> 06:02.200
the page on the side bar.

06:02.460 --> 06:08.010
And these are these are created leggings or widgets that we don't want.

06:08.010 --> 06:08.810
OK.

06:09.180 --> 06:09.800
OK.

06:09.810 --> 06:12.110
So no the side bar looks better.

06:12.120 --> 06:12.730
OK.

06:12.900 --> 06:14.420
So let's work on this for now.

06:14.450 --> 06:15.000
OK.

06:15.120 --> 06:16.380
And maybe a little bit.

06:16.380 --> 06:17.740
Good.

06:17.970 --> 06:21.780
No other footer is divided into three sections.

06:21.780 --> 06:23.630
One section is on the left side.

06:23.640 --> 06:29.030
One section is on the center and one section on the right side that you can see here first for rigid

06:29.040 --> 06:31.640
area that is here on the left side.

06:31.650 --> 06:38.900
Second area that is here on the central third for widget area there on the right side again.

06:39.040 --> 06:45.960
And we can add plugins to these areas and we will look into this wooded area that we come here on the

06:45.960 --> 06:49.290
left side and OK.

06:49.640 --> 06:50.640
And we did.

06:50.770 --> 06:54.870
So let's see what it will look what we did we'll look good on the left side.

06:54.920 --> 07:01.490
Many I have seen many blog bloggers and they are Callander to the left side of her.

07:01.490 --> 07:01.810
OK.

07:01.820 --> 07:08.150
So let's add the calendar and let's see if it looks good or not practical in here and what should be

07:08.150 --> 07:17.610
the title let's and veto battle was fresh.

07:17.680 --> 07:21.520
Now we have a nice calendar on the left side of our future.

07:21.940 --> 07:22.760
OK.

07:22.810 --> 07:25.400
Looks good.

07:25.470 --> 07:34.880
Now you can add more widgets if you want to you want to look good if you also want recent posts on the

07:35.060 --> 07:42.180
on the center of the free you can break it here but it will all look it will not look good.

07:42.370 --> 07:45.070
Let's let's see what else we have let's add pages.

07:45.130 --> 07:47.310
Let's get to this one.

07:47.340 --> 07:47.910
OK.

07:49.860 --> 07:53.730
Want pages to appear on the center not on the left side.

07:54.090 --> 07:54.680
OK.

07:54.690 --> 07:58.940
Let's refresh and see what we got.

07:59.610 --> 08:03.590
Here are our pages about this and contact us.

08:03.640 --> 08:07.340
Can see it Biggie's this widget has a title back.

08:07.680 --> 08:10.450
Kolender we don't have a title all right.

08:10.620 --> 08:15.020
Let's write the title that will look good because it is all to him.

08:15.030 --> 08:18.920
I do not see Killen or

08:22.100 --> 08:26.470

08:36.060 --> 08:39.620
A recent post extended our men.

08:40.390 --> 08:41.640
No not you.

08:41.870 --> 08:45.170
Let's add the categories.

08:45.210 --> 08:46.430
What do we have.

08:46.430 --> 08:55.160
We have a question how to add these and see GURREY

08:57.750 --> 09:00.660
character is OK these players drop down.

09:00.660 --> 09:10.950
Sure postone sure harlotry are stupid as drubbed of the reflash.

09:11.010 --> 09:14.670
OK here we have categories but it's not looking good.

09:14.880 --> 09:15.990
Let's do more.

09:15.990 --> 09:25.690
Destructo and see if now they're looking at how and categorized certain materials we have in here held

09:25.700 --> 09:30.170
technology multi-mission but it is only showing one let me see why it is only showing one

09:35.950 --> 09:43.400
fresh.

09:43.580 --> 09:49.800
Only one because we don't have any Borst in technology and what we wish on that slide.

09:49.830 --> 09:55.970
Only showing one cause we only have one post in health and one post in Uncategorized.

09:55.980 --> 10:01.890
OK I can see when Posten held everyone posting Uncategorized that's why it is only showing held and

10:01.890 --> 10:03.040
categorized or kept.

10:03.180 --> 10:06.460
When you post to acknowledge you and what others show them here.

10:06.460 --> 10:16.400
