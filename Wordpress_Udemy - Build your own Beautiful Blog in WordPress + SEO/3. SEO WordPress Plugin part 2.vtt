00:00.390 --> 00:09.520
Get the post we have the title we will have the title of the post and then we will move this page and

00:09.690 --> 00:15.020
everywhere will not look good if we have that we would really be ok with that.

00:15.060 --> 00:20.980
First we would have died of our post then we would have a separator and then we have the second name.

00:20.990 --> 00:22.560
Awesome we look good.

00:22.560 --> 00:31.170
If you want to have the better description for your post and I really recommend you do it because we

00:31.170 --> 00:35.430
will have the description of our actual proof that.

00:35.430 --> 00:35.820
All right.

00:35.820 --> 00:36.230
OK.

00:36.240 --> 00:37.490
So empty.

00:37.630 --> 00:38.500
OK.

00:38.700 --> 00:40.230
Keep this as it is do.

00:40.320 --> 00:48.500
Don't check this out because we want the search engines to index and follow other posts.

00:48.580 --> 00:53.940
Or should you fly them on Facebook.

00:53.940 --> 00:55.970
You can see there will be some results.

00:56.130 --> 00:57.260
There will be the date.

00:57.270 --> 00:58.060
OK.

00:58.110 --> 00:58.920
See this.

00:58.920 --> 01:02.300
Three days ago and let me see some other desserts.

01:02.300 --> 01:05.430
Further if we search for them.

01:06.240 --> 01:09.400
You can see there will be some posts where they will be the date.

01:09.420 --> 01:14.220
Let me see if we have nor there the date.

01:14.260 --> 01:17.540
But sometimes we see the data before the description right here.

01:17.560 --> 01:20.530
OK just like I just show you two days ago.

01:20.620 --> 01:27.340
Let me see if we have our go nets or something else.

01:27.400 --> 01:28.700
Sir we don't.

01:29.160 --> 01:30.930
Maybe we see the dude here.

01:33.020 --> 01:37.760
See one hour ago nobody knows the go this time and this is basically the time and date.

01:37.760 --> 01:38.450
OK.

01:38.720 --> 01:46.970
So I recommend you to keep this ject OK because people know that how when your post was when your Condren

01:46.970 --> 01:48.200
was posted again.

01:48.530 --> 01:50.290
So it depends on if you want or not.

01:50.310 --> 01:58.820
But I always check this occasionally and see but you know we have the S E for our pages how our pages

01:58.820 --> 02:01.590
will behave in the search engine.

02:01.680 --> 02:07.570
We will have the title of the page then we will have separator and then we will have the second name.

02:07.580 --> 02:08.270
Awesome.

02:08.350 --> 02:11.140
No description I recommend you to do right.

02:11.180 --> 02:13.020
OK sure didn't see that preview.

02:13.070 --> 02:21.350
Then we have media there but we have pictures and some videos on her blog.

02:21.350 --> 02:23.750
And then how did you handle it.

02:23.750 --> 02:24.650
We really do.

02:24.680 --> 02:26.530
We really set up here.

02:26.540 --> 02:27.140
OK.

02:27.230 --> 02:31.820
So first we will have the death of the media and then we will have the separator and then we have the

02:31.820 --> 02:38.920
site keep this empty and check this out and make sure you'll be able to save.

02:42.230 --> 02:42.910
OK.

02:42.920 --> 02:44.680
Now let's go to taxonomies.

02:44.840 --> 02:51.360
Let me tell you that what these really do these are good these days and formats.

02:51.410 --> 02:58.690
We don't want the search engine to to show this in the search is there.

02:58.720 --> 03:01.760
Nobody wants to guess our misery index.

03:01.780 --> 03:05.350
Just follow your next follow follow.

03:05.530 --> 03:08.440
Just keep them as it is and see if is

03:10.970 --> 03:12.580
taxonomies as it is now.

03:12.630 --> 03:14.800
Let's talk about the art guys.

03:14.800 --> 03:25.260
OK guys there are no blogger wired guys to show on the search that is what our archives archives are

03:25.260 --> 03:30.480
basically for the archives that basically you can see this technology getgood even open it.

03:30.480 --> 03:34.210
We see our posted do technology that will be our archive.

03:34.380 --> 03:34.890
OK.

03:34.920 --> 03:40.410
Like I have shown you when we set up hours of fun and we make settings of everything if I showed you

03:40.410 --> 03:46.410
what archive is that is the archive we used to have problem with archive is you can ask me OK but let

03:46.410 --> 03:52.800
me tell you again what a guy is a guy was basically the category where we see all of our boards.

03:52.830 --> 03:57.630
Ok for that particular technology you will see both the technology but we don't have any pause right

03:57.630 --> 03:58.130
now.

03:58.150 --> 03:59.370
Think going can help.

03:59.670 --> 04:01.700
We will see positive to the hand.

04:01.770 --> 04:03.410
So this will be our archive.

04:03.420 --> 04:11.460
We don't want search engines to do to follow or index other archives.

04:11.470 --> 04:16.920
So what you can do here miscible the data based archives miscible archives.

04:16.940 --> 04:17.600
OK.

04:17.880 --> 04:18.960
I always do that.

04:18.990 --> 04:23.810
But if you if you want me you want to follow.

04:23.820 --> 04:25.990
You can always check it.

04:26.010 --> 04:26.580
OK.

04:26.660 --> 04:31.910
I'm going to keep these at it as it is Carol.

04:32.080 --> 04:34.680
No there's another dab either.

04:34.830 --> 04:37.470
So I want you to keep it as it is.

04:37.470 --> 04:39.650
Again is the best setting we have right now.

04:39.840 --> 04:40.360
All right.

04:40.380 --> 04:42.810
We are done early social here.

04:42.810 --> 04:46.490
Now we're done with the general that doesn't notice.

04:46.560 --> 04:48.000
Let's talk about the solution.

04:48.030 --> 04:53.180
Now you can link your blog with your Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Plus account.

04:53.250 --> 04:55.880
It is very important for us.

04:55.950 --> 04:57.690
Oh and I do recommend you do it.

04:57.720 --> 04:58.200
OK.

04:58.290 --> 05:04.590
Then when you will search your blog all Google Google knows that you exist on Facebook Twitter Pinterest

05:04.680 --> 05:08.770
Google Plus So Google will beg you good reg you hire.

05:08.790 --> 05:09.330
OK.

05:09.390 --> 05:12.750
So always provide your provide your profiles.

05:12.810 --> 05:18.360
Here again MySpace profile Facebook you do Google Plus all these.

05:18.390 --> 05:25.030
So if we go to Facebook we can added more settings about Facebook but we if we if you want share that

05:25.040 --> 05:28.410
picture what kind of image you are or description you want.

05:28.500 --> 05:36.490
But I want you to keep these emptied because we will do on the boards that we want to write optimize

05:36.570 --> 05:39.360
it for the for everything for Facebook to dip into.

05:39.370 --> 05:41.730
So keep these settings as it is.

05:42.180 --> 05:42.780
OK.

05:42.870 --> 05:48.280
But you can also make Also this setting up if you want.

05:48.510 --> 05:53.670
These are basically the title description and image used in the Open Graph text in the front of your

05:53.670 --> 05:54.230
site.

05:54.240 --> 05:55.030
OK.

05:55.130 --> 06:01.560
This whenever someone shares your site image with a better image will appear that you upload here right

06:01.560 --> 06:02.840
here OK.

06:03.330 --> 06:07.560
That is right in your description of a library that is right here but don't update it because we have

06:07.560 --> 06:13.080
just done in general OK we have just abridged setting of four of our website so you don't need to write

06:13.110 --> 06:15.020
extra settings for especially Facebook.

06:15.120 --> 06:21.750
But if you want when someone shares your post or your specialty reps or not especially upset when someone

06:21.750 --> 06:28.070
shows your she has your website what information you need to be on the Facebook you can provide here.

06:28.080 --> 06:33.170
But if you keep these M-B your general information yet be just write on the general Dubonnet me open

06:33.180 --> 06:34.060
this.

06:34.170 --> 06:35.220
This right here.

06:35.260 --> 06:36.510
Get this.

06:36.580 --> 06:43.320
Oops not this Idylls intimate as the information that was just right here the site name and everything

06:43.320 --> 06:46.270
that we just wrote that information will appear OK.

06:46.440 --> 06:50.630
Site name title of the site and description of the search that is just right.

06:50.650 --> 06:56.010
OK this information appeared before it but if you want a special function to appear you can write those

06:56.220 --> 06:56.950
settings here.

06:56.980 --> 06:59.830
Facebook Twitter for Pink just for a special setting.

06:59.840 --> 07:00.800
OK.

07:01.500 --> 07:04.890
So I hope you guys got the idea what we can do in social.

07:05.040 --> 07:07.700
So we have some other advanced settings.

07:08.010 --> 07:10.410
And I recommended you to keep these settings as it is.

07:10.410 --> 07:13.260
We only need these three important settings to be changed.

07:13.260 --> 07:13.770
OK.

07:13.890 --> 07:15.400
And we are done with these settings.

07:15.600 --> 07:18.600
And you guys know how to use this as you that.

07:18.630 --> 07:19.210
So thank you guys.
