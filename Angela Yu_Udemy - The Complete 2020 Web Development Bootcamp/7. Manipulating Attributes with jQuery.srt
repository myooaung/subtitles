00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:07,620
Now in the last lesson we looked at how we can use jQuery to manipulate text in our web page.
1

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,720
But in this lesson we're going to look at how we can also use it to manipulate attributes.
2

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:19,050
Now attributes are things such as, for example, if you had an image then it would have a source, right?
3

4
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,700
So, for example, drum.png.
4

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,300
And if you had a anchor tag, then that might be the href, right?
5

6
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,250
https://www.google.com.
6

7
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:41,310
So if we wanted to be able to get and set these attributes on the fly using Javascript and jQuery,
7

8
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,670
then we have a really simple method that we can tap into.
8

9
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:52,790
So we can select our image and we can use attr for the attribute method.
9

10
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:59,100
Then inside the parentheses, we're going to give the name of the attribute that we want.
10

11
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:04,240
So, for example, for our image that will be the src or the source.
11

12
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,550
And now I can console.log this result.
12

13
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:15,870
And if I hit save and go to our web site and refresh, you'll see that we failed to load our resource
13

14
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,690
because in our project we currently don't actually have an image.
14

15
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:26,850
But if we wanted to diagnose this then we could have simply used .attr to get our source printed
15

16
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:32,690
out, and we can see that it's a file called drum.png which we clearly do not have
16

17
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,680
in the current project folder.
17

18
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:41,100
Now in addition to getting the value of the attribute you could also set the value of the attribute.
18

19
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:50,100
So for example, let's select our anchor tag this time, and we're going to use the attr method, attribute method,
19

20
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:56,490
again, and this time we're going to get the value of the href attribute,
20

21
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,050
but we're also going to set it,
21

22
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:02,460
so that's the second input of this method.
22

23
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,350
If there is a second input then we're going to set it to that,
23

24
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,230
and if there isn't one then we're going to get the value of the attribute.
24

25
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:18,570
So let's say that we've decided that we want to look after the under dogs and we're going to direct
25

26
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:23,290
people towards yahoo.com instead of Google.
26

27
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:28,200
I'm not sure if anybody uses Yahoo anymore but let's give that a go .
27

28
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:36,180
So this code will select all of the anchor tags on our web site and change the href attribute to 
28

29
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,240
yahoo.com,
29

30
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:44,850
whereas previously it was google.com, and I’ll give that anchor tag a value of Search.
30

31
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:52,940
So now if we hit refresh and we click on our anchor tag then it should take us to Yahoo,
31

32
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:59,670
whereas without this line of code then it'll take us to the original destination which was 
32

33
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:00,680
google.com.
33

34
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:06,180
Now remember that a class is also an HTML attribute.
34

35
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:15,090
So that means that if we had our h1. Let’s just apply those awful styles again, big-title and margin-50.
35

36
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:22,370
So class = big-title and margin-50.
36

37
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:34,590
Then if we refresh our web site and go into our console and we select our h1 to get its class attribute,
37

38
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:41,690
then you can see that it'll print out all of the classes that are currently applied to the h1.
