00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:00,460
All right.
1

2
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,400
Time for another challenge.
2

3
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,970
Now currently we've got two inputs inside our form.
3

4
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,470
One is called post body and one is called
4

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:18,060
post title. And we know the inside our app.js we currently can log the post title that gets sent
5

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,590
to our compose route through the post requests that the form initiates.
6

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,980
So when we click the submit button we send over two pieces of data,
7

8
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,910
the text area and the input.
8

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:39,240
So if we wanted to we could console log the post body that's the text that's inside the text area as
9

10
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:39,800
well.
10

11
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:47,520
So now if I go ahead and head over to our compose page and refresh and I just type some stuff in here
11

12
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:54,150
and I hit publish and I go over to my console then you can see that everything I just typed gets logged
12

13
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,530
in here because I'm tapping into that variable
13

14
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:02,600
post body which is what I defined inside the name for our text area.
14

15
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:10,530
The next challenge is instead of console logging the post body or the post title inside this callback
15

16
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:20,040
I want you to create a Javascript object that's simply just called post and it has to store both the
16

17
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,530
title that gets passed over as well as the post body that gets passed over.
17

18
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,450
So pause the video and try to complete that challenge.
18

19
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:38,460
All right so if you've forgotten how Javascript objects look in terms of their syntax then take a look
19

20
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,500
at my first hint.
20

21
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,090
So this is how you would create a standard Javascript object.
21

22
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,100
You would have a var keyword to show that you're creating a new variable.
22

23
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:53,790
And then you would give your new object a name whatever it is you wish.
23

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,630
And then you would have an equal sign and you would open up a set of curly braces.
24

25
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:04,370
Now inside the curly braces you can have key value pairs and as many as you wish.
25

26
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:10,200
You can even nest key value pairs as the value of a particular key.
26

27
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:18,270
The parts in purple are the parts that you would need to change in order to create a custom object.
27

28
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:22,460
So with this hint in mind now try and complete the challenge.
