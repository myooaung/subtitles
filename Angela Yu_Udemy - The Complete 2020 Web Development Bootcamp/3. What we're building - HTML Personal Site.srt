00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:01,160
Right.
1

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:07,410
So in this lesson we're going to be building our very first web site. Now, because we've only talked about
2

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:14,130
HTML so far, so how to structure web sites using HTML elements, and we haven't yet gotten to the part
3

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,710
where we've learnt about styling using CSS, then we're kind of limited in terms of the kind of web sites
4

5
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:20,650
that we can make.
5

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,180
But, fear not, our web sites are going to be right up there with the Internet titans but just way back in
6

7
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,590
1997.
7

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,670
So do you remember what Yahoo looked like when it first launched?
8

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,830
Or do you remember what Google looked like when it first came out?
9

10
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,000
No, don't remember?
10

11
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,270
Well it was a great web site.
11

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,900
I can show you exactly that.
12

13
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:45,270
And it's called The Internet Archive Wayback Machine and you can find it at web.archive.org.
13

14
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:52,240
Now in here you just enter the URL of a Web site that you were interested in, say yahoo.com,
14

15
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:59,280
then it shows you what this web site looks like all the way from 1996 to current day which is 2017.
15

16
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,870
Now let's have a look at what Yahoo looked like originally on the first day it was crawled,
16

17
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,110
so 17th of October 1996.
17

18
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,240
So let's go ahead and click on that snapshot.
18

19
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,870
And this is exactly what it looks like.
19

20
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:22,260
So if we close off this frame you can see it's almost like as if you've time traveled back to 1996 when
20

21
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:26,450
Yahoo first launched and you were visiting this web site for the first time.
21

22
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:31,200
Now as you can see most of this is just pure HTML.
22

23
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,010
It's a lot of structure and a lot of formatting but it looks really ugly.
23

24
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,330
But it's OK because it's a great place to get started with.
24

25
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:44,610
So this is the sort of web site that we're going to be building by the end of this module.
25

26
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,410
Now I hear you say, ‘Oh but this looks terrible.
26

27
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,690
We're in 2017.
27

28
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,090
Surely nobody builds web sites like this anymore.’
28

29
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,970
Well this is an interesting anecdote that you might not know. If you have a look at some of the world's
29

30
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:02,540
top computer science professors and you look at their personal pages that they've built, 
30

31
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:09,690
they all look a little bit like this, not so dissimilar from the web sites in 1996.
31

32
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:14,730
So this is Thomas Cormen who's a serious algorithm guy and this is a web site of Jon Kleinberg,
32

33
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,930
another huge name computer science professor, and of course the king himself
33

34
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:22,110
Donald Knuth has a website that looks like this.
34

35
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:27,180
So if it's good enough for these computer science titans then it's probably good enough also for our
35

36
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,490
very first web site.
36

37
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:33,750
So by the end of this module we're going to build a web site that looks much like this, something that
37

38
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,410
we can put up online to show what we've done,
38

39
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,670
our CV, as well as our hobbies and things that we like to do.
39

40
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:44,300
So you can use it as a personal site or somewhere to list your CV online.
40

41
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:51,570
So I hope you're excited because I'm super excited and once you're ready let's go ahead and create our
41

42
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:52,820
very first web site.
