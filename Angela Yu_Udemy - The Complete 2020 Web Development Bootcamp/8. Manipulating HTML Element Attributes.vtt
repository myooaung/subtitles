00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:07.320
So now that we've seen how you can manipulate the style and the text of an HTML element, the last thing
1

2
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.220
I want to show you how to manipulate are the attributes of any element.
2

3
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.790
So, just a reminder, the attributes are all the things that get colored in orange in Atom,
3

4
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.330
so for example, class is an attribute, or the href for an anchor tag is the attribute, or the src for
4

5
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:32.020
an image. They’re all attributes. Everything that goes inside the tag, other than the tag name itself, are attributes.
5

6
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.250
So we have a link up here that points towards Google,
6

7
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.520
right?
7

8
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.730
It takes us to the Google search page.
8

9
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.910
Now what if we've gone crazy and we decided to point people towards Bing instead?
9

10
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.790
Well, we can get a list of attributes that are attached to the element by saying document.querySelector
10

11
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.080
(“a”), and that of course gets us our first anchor tag which points towards Google.
11

12
00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:03.030
And now if we say .attributes, then that will give us a list of all the attributes that are currently
12

13
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.760
attached to this HTML element.
13

14
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.620
And as you can see there's only one and that is the href.
14

15
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:16.220
So we can now retrieve the current value of that attribute by saying .getAttribute,
15

16
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.710
and notice how this is singular and not plural,
16

17
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.380
so we're only getting back the value of a single attribute, and we have to specify the name of the attribute
17

18
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.400
that we want.
18

19
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.370
So in this case it's the href, and you can see that we get back that currently it's pointing towards
19

20
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.160
google.com.
20

21
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:41.190
So now if we wanted to change this then instead of saying getAttribute, we can say setAttribute, but
21

22
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.220
this method takes two parameters, two inputs essentially.
22

23
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.070
One is which attribute do you want to change,
23

24
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.460
and the second one after the comma is what do you want to change it to,
24

25
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.350
and we're going to say www.bing.com.
25

26
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.910
Wow, I've never typed that in my life before.
26

27
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:08.040
All right. So now if I click on this link, even though it still says Google, because the innerHTML is Google,
27

28
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.400
if I click on it, you can see it takes me to this wonderful web site that nobody has ever used in their
28

29
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.360
lives before.
29

30
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.140
All right. Cool.
30

31
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:24.570
So this is a really quick and easy way of getting, setting, and seeing what the attributes are for any
31

32
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.640
element you select in the DOM.
