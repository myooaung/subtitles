00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:00,630
All right.
1

2
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:06,300
So in the next lesson you're going to tackle the interactive challenge where you have to write the code
2

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,270
and I will check your solutions
3

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,720
behind the scenes.
4

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,630
So this is what you should see.
5

6
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:17,310
This is the BMI calculator challenge, and there's a little bit of description about what BMIs are and
6

7
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:18,760
what they’re used for.
7

8
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:24,810
Now the most important thing is that I've included the formula to calculate the BMI which is the weight
8

9
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,120
divided by the height squared.
9

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,670
And this is weight in kilograms and height in meters.
10

11
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:37,680
So your challenge is to create a function that takes the weight and the height as inputs, like so,
11

12
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:44,640
and to be able to give the output, which is going to be equal to the BMI, so that if I run this line
12

13
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,850
of code using the function that you create, which is going to be called bmiCalculator, I should be able
13

14
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,300
to get the BMI inside this variable called bmi.
14

15
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:00,810
Now, the order of your inputs matter in this case. You’re going to have to put the weight as an input
15

16
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:05,810
first and then the height as an input in order to satisfy this line of code.
16

17
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:12,270
So you can copy what's inside the index.js file in here, and you can paste it into the Snippets
17

18
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:20,700
tool here to write your code and to test your code inside the Chrome Developer Tools and use the console.
18

19
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:27,210
So, if you’re here, you can activate this line of code, and try to write your function here, so that when
19

20
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:34,820
you console.log your BMI variable, you should be getting the same value back as any BMI calculator online.
20

21
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:40,800
Now once you're happy with your function then you can go ahead and click Check solution in order to
21

22
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,660
check to see if you got it right.
22

23
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,730
And once you're done then you can go ahead and continue on to the next lesson, where I’ll go through the solution
23

24
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:48,780
with you step by step.
