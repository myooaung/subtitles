00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:06.540
Now in order to change the text of a selected element using JQuery, there's two ways of going about
1

2
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.370
this.
2

3
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:16.500
One is you can simply, say, select an element, then .text, and inside the parentheses you'll add the
3

4
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.280
new text that you want it to say,
4

5
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.920
so this will change our hello to a goodbye.
5

6
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:33.090
As we mentioned before, when we use jQuery to select an HTML element, it selects all of the elements
6

7
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.500
that match that selector on your web page.
7

8
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:44.970
So if we were to say .text on the buttons, then when we refresh our page, you can see that every single
8

9
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:53.420
button gets its text updated by simply selecting for all the elements that match this criteria,
9

10
00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.720
and then we're using the .text method to change the text that's inside those buttons, which is this
10

11
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.630
part here.
11

12
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:09.750
Now, if you remember, when we learnt how to do this using plain old vanilla Javascript, we also had something
12

13
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.550
called innerHTML. And using innerHTML,
13

14
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:21.060
we were able to not just update text but we were also able to add HTML. But, as we’re using jQuery, it's
14

15
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.310
a little bit shorter.
15

16
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:32.100
So it's simply .html. And inside here we can add some tags, say for example if we wanted to add the
16

17
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.730
em tag to make our text emphasized, or rather italicised.
17

18
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:47.070
Now when we update our web site you can see that the HTML is also taken into consideration, because we're
18

19
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:56.370
using the .html method instead of simply the .text method which will interpret everything in between
19

20
00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:02.800
the quotation marks as pure text and ignores all of the HTML tags.
20

21
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:09.300
Now by this point you would have noticed that most of the things that you do with jQuery are implemented
21

22
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.910
using methods, and we’re accessing it through the dot notation.
22

23
00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.780
Now remember how, when we were learning about methods and functions,
23

24
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.560
we used it a lot to shorten our code and reduce repetition.
24

25
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.460
Well this is pretty much how jQuery works.
25

26
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:33.730
If you take a look at the library then you'll notice that jQuery is completely written in Javascript,
26

27
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:41.610
but it has all of these methods that shorten the code that we need to write and makes working with Javascript
27

28
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:48.690
to create our web sites much much quicker, much easier, and reduces repetitive strain injury from typing
28

29
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:49.440
so much.
29

30
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:56.090
So I hope that you also realize that without understanding how vanilla Javascript works, then jQuery
30

31
00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.550
just seems like complete magic.
31

32
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:06.150
So it's really important that you needed to get a good foundation in Javascript before we started introducing
32

33
00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:12.360
you to essentially what most web developers will use when they're writing Javascript, which is doing
33

34
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.290
it through jQuery or another library.
34

35
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.790
I hope that by this point you've already realized that this library can make your life as a developer
35

36
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.620
so much easier with less things to type and more intuitive syntax.
36

37
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:30.070
But in the next lesson we're going to dig into jQuery even further and we're going to learn how
37

38
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.070
we can manipulate attributes using jQuery.
38

39
00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.030
So for all of that, stay tuned.
39

40
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.200
I'll see you on the next lesson.
