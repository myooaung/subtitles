All right now we're ready for challenge 7.
1

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:11,110
Now the goal of this challenge is to be able to head over to the path that's localhost:3000
2

3
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:19,380
/compose and be able to render a page that has the same styling as the rest of the pages with
3

4
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,300
our nav bar and our footer
4

5
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:28,140
and to have an h1 that says compose as the title of the page. And then we're going to have a text input
5

6
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,390
here and a button that has the text publish.
6

7
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,530
So pause the video now and complete this challenge.
7

8
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:45,670
Now the hint that I'm going to give you is that in order to achieve this, you'll need to include the
8

9
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:54,180
header and footer partials, you'll need an h1, an HTML  input element as well as an HTML button.
9

10
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,670
So that should be more enough to try to attempt to challenge again.
