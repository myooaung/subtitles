Hey.
1

2
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.600
Well done for making it through another module.
2

3
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.770
I know the last one had a particularly hard challenge. So if you've made it this far then
3

4
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.010
great job! Well done!
4

5
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.320
Now I want to talk to you about
5

6
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.150
I guess like an experience I had when I was younger and I thought it was really formative for me.
6

7
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:32.270
So when I was in my 16th year I really wanted to be the science prefect of the school.
7

8
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:43.430
Basically this position where you get to curate a notice board with science news,
8

9
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.940
you get to plan a science club for the younger children
9

10
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.940
and I for some reason just had my heart set on it.
10

11
00:00:52.950 --> 00:01:03.390
I loved everything to do with science and I spent all my days preparing like trying to be the best possible
11

12
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:12.630
science prefect I could be like you know helping out and planning future experiments that I could do.
12

13
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:26.590
But for some reason, the headmistress of the school she didn't really want this dream of mine I
13

14
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.270
guess to come true.
14

15
00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:40.090
And I remember her telling me, this 16 year old girl, that you know at some point in life you have to
15

16
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.620
experience what it's like to not get what you want.
16

17
00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.400
And you know kind of thinking back on it
17

18
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:59.060
it's kind of cruel but you know especially to somebody who's so young and so bright eyed and so set
18

19
00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.180
on this goal.
19

20
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:11.320
It crushed me like the moment when she said that to me and told me that you know it's gonna go,
20

21
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.850
the job is gonna go to somebody who doesn't even want it.
21

22
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:24.190
I remember going home that day and just bawling my eyes out like I was crying like there was no tomorrow.
22

23
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.570
It's just like the injustice of it all
23

24
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.960
you know the fact that she told me that you know the reason is because you wanted too much.
24

25
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.600
Like that's just crazy.
25

26
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:45.100
And at the time you know my grandfather I remember him telling me that like you know there are so many
26

27
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.840
things that he could have said to me he could've said like, 'Don't worry kid, it's not your fault. It's like--
27

28
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:59.780
it's just because the headmistress is you know racist, because she's sexist or because you know
28

29
00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.230
you're an immigrant,
29

30
00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:08.390
or like-- There's just so many things that he could have that which could have been true. But instead he chose
30

31
00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:15.800
to tell me that you know there are things that you can change in life
31

32
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.050
and there are things that you can't change in life.
32

33
00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.920
The thing that you can't change you usually have to do with other people and the things that you can
33

34
00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:32.660
change are how you view a situation and how you act.
34

35
00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.820
So you can prove other people wrong.
35

36
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.630
You can--
36

37
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:48.340
You can become something. You can do really well at things and you doing really well will make those
37

38
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:57.640
people who've hurt you feel bad more than if you had just been spiteful or something.
38

39
00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:07.590
And I remember him telling me that you know try to get the best possible grades you can to to become
39

40
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.240
the best possible person you can.
40

41
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:16.160
And that's the best way of reenacting  your event is to live a great life and be a great person.
41

42
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:25.620
And I think you know, I think back at like that moments like I had made the wrong conclusions how my
42

43
00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.280
life would have turned out to be you know if I had just decided that you know what?
43

44
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.200
Whatever.
44

45
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.990
I'm not going to do school anymore.
45

46
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.030
I'm just going to go and give up on this whole thing because life isn't fair.
46

47
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:44.620
And you know I think it was really really wise
47

48
00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:52.160
the thing that my grandfather said because it really changed my outlook on life like things aren't fair.
48

49
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.160
But how you interpret it and what you do
49

50
00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.140
are the things that you get to determine.
50

51
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:07.040
So focus on those. And I mean I feel like I'm rambling here but I hope there's something that would
51

52
00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.420
help you too from this story of mine.
52

53
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.080
You know I know that you're probably in a situation where there are things that have happened to you
53

54
00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:21.900
or that are unfair that have made things more difficult and you have a choice to--
54

55
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:28.820
You get to determine how you act and how you view those things, those adversities.
55

56
00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:33.440
And if you make the right choices and live the best possible life you can,
56

57
00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:38.480
that's the best way of showing up to people who've hurt you.
57

58
00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:45.140
So this one's a little bit deep but I hope it was helpful to some of you anyway.
58

59
00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:53.090
Let me on Twitter if it's something that you can relate to. And yeah keep going,
59

60
00:05:53.090 --> 00:06:00.200
keep pushing for your future because you know you're the one who's in charge. you can do it.
