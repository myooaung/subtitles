00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,740
This is an exciting moment.
1

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:07,840
We're finally ready to apply everything that we've learned so far to get started building
2

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,570
our final project, the keeper app.
3

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:17,160
So in this lesson I've got a challenge for you that is going to get as part of the way towards our final
4

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,180
product.
5

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,090
So this is what we're aiming for.
6

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,770
We've got a header component,
7

8
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:28,150
we've got a note component and we've got a footer down here as well.
8

9
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:33,990
Now in the index.js file, I've got all the steps that you need to go through in order to complete
9

10
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,400
this challenge.
10

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:42,600
If you want to work on this project locally instead of on code sandbox, then the simplest way is to go
11

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:50,040
to the link that is listed in the course resources for the starting project and then once you're here,
12

13
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:59,040
go ahead and click on this button to export this project as a zip file and then unzip that file and
13

14
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,480
you should end up with a project folder.
14

15
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:08,400
Now once you've got your project folder, you can click and drag it into your VS code and add it to
15

16
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,070
your workspace. And then you can remove any previous folders that you've been working on.
16

17
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:19,440
And if you expand all the files, you end up with the same starting files.
17

18
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:27,300
So in this case the files that we've got are a index.html which is kept very simple. It's got a title,
18

19
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:30,840
it's got a link to google fonts.
19

20
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:36,330
So if you remember from previously we can simply select the fonts we want from Google and then embed
20

21
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:43,090
the fonts as a style sheet link. And then we've got a link to the style sheet inside styles.
21

22
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:43,980
CSS,
22

23
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:51,180
and finally we've got a link to our index.js as a JSX file. And of course as always we've got
23

24
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,650
that prerequisite div with the idof root.
24

25
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,960
So the other files to take a look at is the styles.css file because in here I've already added a
25

26
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:08,700
bunch of styles and classes which you're going to be applying to the code that you're writing with React.
26

27
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:14,460
It's up to you whether if you want to work on this in code sandbox or on your local environment that
27

28
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,760
you've set up in the last lesson.
28

29
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,870
Now if you do decide to go down this route, I recommend the first thing to do
29

30
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:28,110
once you've downloaded it is to open up your hyperterminal and cd over to the location of your project.
30

31
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:37,440
So in my case it's in download/keeper-app-part-1 and then go ahead and run npm install. This
31

32
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,980
way you'll install the react, the react-dom module and the react-scripta module that's included with
32

33
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,050
the package.
33

34
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:52,200
And once that's done, then you can go ahead and run npm start for it to run the server to be able to
34

35
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,480
view it inside your browser under localhost 3000.
35

36
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:02,190
So it's up to you if you want to complete this challenge using code sandbox or if you want to do it
36

37
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:05,180
locally using your editor of choice.
37

38
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:12,420
But either way, the goals are going to be the same. You're going to be creating a new React app that includes
38

39
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:19,010
a app component. Inside that app component, you can have three components: a header component, a
39

40
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:26,820
footer component and a note component. The header is going to look something like this showing the keeper
40

41
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:32,880
app title or whatever it is that you decide to call it, and then the footer is going to look like this
41

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:41,580
with a dynamically rendered year so not a statically typed number. You're going to use what you've learnt
42

43
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:47,700
about Javascript dates to try and get the actual current year showing up here. And then finally you've
43

44
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:52,930
got this note component which is going to show a title and some content.
44

45
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:59,040
And the final step is just to make sure that the styling is the same for the website that you've created
45

46
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:06,030
and this sample completed app which you can access right here. In order to get the styling right
46

47
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:12,300
you might have to take a look inside these styles.css and see which classes are being targeted
47

48
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:19,310
and which HMTL elements are being targeted in order to render the same style as you see here.
48

49
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,940
So the goal is to test everything that you've learnt so far.
49

50
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:31,230
And if you want to, you can even update the styles.css to whichever style you want it to be to customize
50

51
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:37,500
it if you wish. Or if you want to completely create the styles.css from scratch then you can also
51

52
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,270
just delete that and try to create your own style if you wish.
52

53
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:48,240
But what I recommend is to go through each of these points in the index.js and try to complete
53

54
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,360
it.
54

55
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,640
And once you're done with the challenge, head over to the next lesson and I'll go through the solution
55

56
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,150
with you. Pause the video now and try to complete the challenge.
