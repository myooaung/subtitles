Hey there.
1

2
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:03,300
Well done for completing the last module.
2

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,690
You're really getting along in this course.
3

4
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:13,740
Now I want to share with you another one of my tips for getting yourself down to actually do the work
4

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:19,860
and do the course, because we all know that life very often gets in the way of things, right?
5

6
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:28,410
Like I come home and I'm so tired from work I just want to collapse on the sofa and watch Game of Thrones
6

7
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:35,640
and maybe have a snack next to me and that's so tempting for every single one of us.
7

8
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:43,860
But, you know, we also know that it takes consistent work, consistently applying yourself before you can
8

9
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:50,430
actually learn a skill or master something, so there's like these two things that are always fighting with
9

10
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,000
each other in my head.
10

11
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:59,730
And one of the things that really helped me to be able to do more of the things that I want to do is
11

12
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:09,000
to kind of like trick my brain, just to tell myself I'm going to sit myself down and I'm just going to
12

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,170
do 20 minutes of study or work, whatever it is that is going to get me towards my goal.
13

14
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:21,590
And after the 20 minutes I am a free woman, I can do whatever I want.
14

15
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:26,010
I can binge watch Game of Thrones while eating a tub of ice cream,
15

16
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:27,210
so be it.
16

17
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:36,720
But, the point is, once you've actually sat down and you've gotten started, once you've done that 20 minutes,
17

18
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:41,010
the momentum keeps you going.
18

19
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:47,670
There's so much inertia. There's inertia getting started and there's inertia actually stopping, because
19

20
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,940
if you're choosing to do this, then I bet that it’s actually kind of fun for you,
20

21
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:54,300
right?
21

22
00:01:54,300 --> 00:02:00,660
Like once you're in it and once you're getting the code to do what you want it to do,
22

23
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:02,780
there’s joy in that.
23

24
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,860
And the most difficult part,
24

25
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:11,110
so the most difficult part, is just getting yourself to sit down and get started.
25

26
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:17,760
So try this trick next time when you feel like life is really overwhelming you and you're not getting
26

27
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,240
any time to get into the course.
27

28
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,350
Just sit down for 20 minutes in the evening or in the morning and just tell yourself,
28

29
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:30,030
I'm only going to do 20 minutes. If you end up doing more than 20 minutes then great.
29

30
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,530
But if you only do 20 minutes, that's still 20 minutes, right?
30

31
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:38,970
So have a go at this trick, and let me know if it works for you as well as it works for me.
