00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:01.000
All right.
1

2
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.190
The next topic I want to talk about is typography.
2

3
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.670
Now, I know a lot of students always say to me
3

4
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.460
"But why do I need to learn about typography?
4

5
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.020
I just open up Word, click the dropdown,
5

6
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.450
find Times New Roman,
6

7
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.850
my favorite font.
7

8
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.770
And then just put that on everything. It's done right?"
8

9
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.350
Well let's think about this.
9

10
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:30.030
Well let's say it's Valentine's Day and you decide that you want to write a letter to your beloved Valentine
10

11
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.150
and you change the font to something cursive like this.
11

12
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.490
"You'll always be mine."
12

13
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.530
I don't know if she or he will be
13

14
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.070
but you have a good chance.
14

15
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.350
Now let's say that you chose the wrong font.
15

16
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.730
That's a bit of a problem.
16

17
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.040
Not only do I not think your Valentine is going to take very kindly to this,
17

18
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.230
you might also have the police on your back which is a bit of a problem.
18

19
00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:03.780
So fonts really do matter and it's important to consider not only their mood but also how to combine
19

20
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:04.910
different fonts.
20

21
00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:12.180
And it's a really really easy way to make your designs look very professional and really slick. Out of
21

22
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.520
all of the fonts in the world
22

23
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.020
there's pretty much two large families that you should really know about.
23

24
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:26.700
One is the Serif family where they have these little feet at the end of their central beams.
24

25
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:34.380
And the reason why they have these old feet is because the Serif typeface were inspired by the marble
25

26
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.350
carvings of days of yore.
26

27
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:44.190
So if you next go out and you take a look at the buildings around you especially if you're in a historical
27

28
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:51.810
area, take a look at places where they've carved into stone or marble and you'll notice that they also
28

29
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.560
have these little feet at the end of the central beams.
29

30
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.100
So why is that?
30

31
00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:03.540
I don't know how many of you carved marble in your spare time but if you did you would know that once
31

32
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:12.210
you chisel has gone into the Rock and you need to exit your engraving it's actually not possible to
32

33
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.540
create 90 degree angles when you're carving into rock.
33

34
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.310
So this is where the Serif typeface gets their inspiration from.
34

35
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.780
And this is also the reason why when you're choosing a Serif typeface you're making your design look
35

36
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:34.320
more serious, more authoritative and also a little bit older as well.
36

37
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:41.550
So it's really good if you're designing something like a letterhead for a legal company or a magazine
37

38
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.590
for architectural design.
38

39
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.520
But when we take a look at the big family of Serif typefaces
39

40
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:55.710
they're actually further subdivided into smaller sub families like Old style, Transitional, Modern and
40

41
00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.310
Slab-Serif.
41

42
00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:05.820
Now the really interesting thing is you can actually tell how old a typeface would look by looking at
42

43
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:11.370
the difference between the thickest and the thinnest parts of each letter.
43

44
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.050
So compare the Old Style 'o' versus the Transitional
44

45
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.720
'o' versus the modern
45

46
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:23.070
'o'. And look at how that difference between the thickest part of the letter and the thinnest part gets
46

47
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.650
more and more exaggerated as you get towards a more modern font.
47

48
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:34.920
So if you want something that looks authoritative but modern then maybe you want to go for a modern
48

49
00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:43.980
Serif typeface like Didot. But if you want it to come across as a little bit older, a little bit more aged
49

50
00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.890
maybe you have a winery, maybe you want to go for an Old Style Serif instead.
50

51
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:57.270
Now just as different colors have different moods and emotions, different fonts also have different moods
51

52
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.850
and they also convey a different message to a user depending on which one you choose.
52

53
00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:09.800
So the Serif family generally come across as traditional, stable, respectable, authoritative.
53

54
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.490
These are the words that get thrown around by designers when they're thinking about the Serif typeface.
54

55
00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.370
So for example, the next time you go to a magazine rack pick up the Vogue magazine.
55

56
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:26.480
Take a look at their title and see how it's a modern Serif typeface.
56

57
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:33.000
It's got hugely exaggerated difference between the thick and thin parts of the lettering and it looks
57

58
00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.950
authoritative and it knows what it is talking about.
58

59
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:43.230
Now on the other hand, if we think about the San-Serifs, they're kind of a different family because instead
59

60
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:49.290
of having the Serifs or the little feet at the end the central beams, they have perfect right angles.
60

61
00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:56.100
And it's this right angle that makes the San-Serif family look so much more friendly, more approachable,
61

62
00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.120
more novel and more contemporary.
62

63
00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:06.120
So for example, you will tend to get words like sensible, simple, straightforward. And this is why a lot
63

64
00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.390
of startups love using the San-Serif typeface in their websites.
64

65
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:18.330
For example, a Humanist typeface which is a subfamily of the San-Serifs. It's something that is known
65

66
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:25.740
as a highly readable typeface. And in fact, even within the Serifs and the San-Serifs, you will tend to
66

67
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:32.340
see designers going for the San-Serifs if they want to write body text which needs to be more legible
67

68
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.920
and more readable.
68

69
00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:42.300
Now within this sub family, there's even differences in terms of legibility and readability.
69

70
00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:49.910
So how easy are the words to read and how pleasant is it to read the letters.
70

71
00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:56.760
There was a really interesting study done by MIT a few years back where they took two groups of users,
71

72
00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:05.190
one they put them into a car which had a dashboard made of a Humanist typeface and the other car had
72

73
00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:13.920
a dashboard which had a Grotesque San-Serif typeface. And what they did is they tracked the pupils of
73

74
00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:21.120
the people who were driving the cars and they tested how long each driver needed to look down at the
74

75
00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:27.840
dashboard before they got enough information from the speedometer or the odometer and before they could
75

76
00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:35.160
come back and look at the road again. And really surprisingly they found that just by changing the font
76

77
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.330
from a Grotesque San-Serif to a Humanist San-Serif, they could save the drivers somewhere around
77

78
00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:48.370
30 to 40 percent of the time that's required to understand the information.
78

79
00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:54.690
So imagine that car is on a freeway that's driving at 60 miles, 100 miles an hour.
79

80
00:06:54.750 --> 00:07:00.750
That difference in the amount of time the user needs to look down at the dashboard could be the difference
80

81
00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.670
between life and death.
81

82
00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:07.580
And as designers, we rarely get to make that kind of difference in the world right?
82

83
00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:13.600
So knowing that the Humanist typeface, all of the fonts that belong in that category like Gill Sans,
83

84
00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:21.620
Tahoma, Verdana, these are highly readable and highly legible fonts which you can use in the body types
84

85
00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:23.220
for example of your sales pitch.
85

86
00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:27.740
Now, even though we're not saving lives with our sales pitches,
86

87
00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:32.610
if you manage to get the user to read through more of your sales copy then they're probably going to
87

88
00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:36.120
be more convinced and more likely to buy your product
88

89
00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:36.420
right?
89

90
00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:42.990
So readability and legibility when you're choosing fonts is incredibly important. And the things that
90

91
00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:49.260
you're looking for in the letters when you're looking for legibility are open shapes and a lot of space
91

92
00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:54.690
between each of the letters and also the forms look unambiguous so they look different
92

93
00:07:54.690 --> 00:08:00.940
for example here the 'g' and the 9 actually look different on the second line. And finally, varying proportions.
93

94
00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:06.540
So having an 'O' that's very wide and a '0' that's a bit more narrow so you can actually tell the difference
94

95
00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:08.340
between the two.
95

96
00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:15.990
Now while we've talked about using fonts it's often that you see people go a bit overboard where they
96

97
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:22.920
choose 10 fonts in the same design. And that makes your design look very cluttered and very unprofessional.
97

98
00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:26.910
I recommend actually sticking to just two fonts in one design.
98

99
00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:32.580
So if you're making a poster keeping that to two fonts. If you're making a section of your website keeping
99

100
00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:36.560
then again to two fonts. It just looks a lot cleaner and a lot tighter.
100

101
00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:44.190
And when you're combining these two different fonts you want to try to go for similar moods. So find
101

102
00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:48.990
fonts that have a similar mood to each other and also a similar time era.
102

103
00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:53.610
You don't want something that looks ultramodern with something that looks like it's from the days of
103

104
00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:56.780
yore combined together. It looks a little bit weird.
104

105
00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:59.730
Now the things you want to contrast are the serifness.
105

106
00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:05.190
So for example you on the heading to be a Serif and the body to be a San-Serif or the opposite way
106

107
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:08.030
round. It just creates more interest in your design.
107

108
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:14.010
And similarly, you can also create interest by just changing up the weights between the heading and the
108

109
00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:21.150
body. So making the heading really really bold or even using a black typeface and making the body text
109

110
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:27.660
using something like thin or regular or light. These different weights can create contrast in your design.
110

111
00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:34.850
Now if you don't remember anything from this talk on typefaces, I just want you to look at these six
111

112
00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:42.050
fonts and try to wipe them from your memory because it is very very difficult to make these designs
112

113
00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:46.830
look good unless I guess if you're running a lemonade stand.
113

114
00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:52.940
But if you want to look professional, if you want to look designs, try to use one of the other fonts that
114

115
00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:58.190
we've talked about and try to ignore these ones which are difficult to read and have moods that are
115

116
00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:00.830
difficult to fit in in a professional setting.
116

117
00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:05.780
The next time you're designing a website think about what typefaces you're going to choose.
117

118
00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:11.750
Think about what you're trying to convey with those typefaces and then pick a font from the San-Serif
118

119
00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:14.660
or the Serif family and maybe try to combine them
119

120
00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:20.000
so you have a heading that's a San-Serif and a body that's a Serif and try to create contrast in your
120

121
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.310
designs.
121

122
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:28.310
So keep this in mind and hopefully they'll make your designs a lot more interesting and a lot more professional.
