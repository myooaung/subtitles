All right now it's time for challenge 15.
1

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.600
The goal of this challenge is instead of console logging the titles or the bodies of each of the posts
2

3
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.460
that we compose I want you to be able to render it on the home page
3

4
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:21.730
once you've composed a new post. So the end goal is that once you've reloaded your website and you go
4

5
00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:28.450
over to the compose page and we add let's say just some sort of post
5

6
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.150
And if you wanted to generate a whole bunch of text without a lot of effort then you can head over to
6

7
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:40.670
loremIpsum.io and use their lorem ipsum generator to put in some post content in here.
7

8
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:48.870
Now when I hit publish I get redirected to the home page and my new post gets put in to this page as
8

9
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.300
HTML elements. So pause the video and I want you to complete this challenge
9

10
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.280
trying to figure out how you can achieve this.
10

11
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:07.880
So my first hint is just remind you that when you're creating just simple HTML elements it shouldn't
11

12
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.710
be inside the EJS  scriptlet tags.
12

13
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.790
So check your code if it's not working and see if this helps to solve your problem.
13

14
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.230
Now my second hint is
14

15
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:30.420
again to remind you to check the EJS documentation and to remember that there is a specific tag that
15

16
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.470
outputs the value of a variable into the template.
16

17
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.790
So this is the one that you'll need to be able to solve this challenge.
