All right. Are you ready for challenge 19?
1

2
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.420
All right so here's the goal of this challenge. Instead of console logging whether something matched
2

3
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.440
or not match,
3

4
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:18.150
we actually want to render the actual page so that if we have a post say called another post inside
4

5
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:25.170
our home page we should be able to head over to /posts/another-post.
5

6
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.830
And the goal of this challenge is that when I hit enter we should now get taken to a brand new page
6

7
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:40.080
that's been rendered using EJS and it's a standalone page that just contains the contents of that particular
7

8
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.290
blog post.
8

9
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.100
And if I had more than one post say if I had another post-coup Day 2 as the title, then I should be
9

10
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.100
able to navigate to it by simply going to /posts/day-2. And now when I hit
10

11
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.740
enter I get taken to another page, a brand new page for this blog post.
11

12
00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:05.130
And no matter how many new posts that you compose every single one of them should dynamically get its
12

13
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:13.070
own page just by using EJS and our Express routing parameters. Inside the views folder
13

14
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.460
you should notice that you already have a empty file called post.
14

15
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.350
ejs.
15

16
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.210
See how you can use this along with what we've got so far
16

17
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.150
in order to create this outcome. Pause the video and complete the challenge.
17

18
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.670
Now my first hint for you is that you don't need this else statement any more.
18

19
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.240
You're only checking to see if the requestedTitle is equal to the storedTitle. And in that case instead
19

20
00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:46.210
of console logging, you want to send people over to this posts.ejs page. And you need to render this
20

21
00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:54.480
page such that it gets access to the title and the content of the post that is being requested.
21

22
00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.480
You will need to decide on some variable names for what you want to pass over using EJS,
22

23
00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.910
you'll have to add the layouts the header and footer just as we have done for all the other pages and
23

24
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:14.080
then you have to use the EJS tags in order to render an h1 and a paragraph tag of the title and
24

25
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.090
the body.
25

26
00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.010
So see if this is enough of a hint for you to now be able to complete the challenge.
26

27
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:28.150
Now the second hnt if you need it is that remember how we rendered our home page right?
27

28
00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.250
We actually used a method called res.render.
28

29
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.580
Seems like a long time ago but we use res.render and then we specify the name of the page that
29

30
00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.940
we want to render and then we added a comma and then we specified a Javascript object where we have
30

31
00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:49.450
a key and a value and the value is the thing that we want to pass over and the key is the thing that
31

32
00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.350
we get to access inside that target page.
32

33
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.360
So with this final hint see if you can now complete the challenge.
