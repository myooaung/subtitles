00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.480
All right.
1

2
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:07.710
So time for challenge 16. Make sure that you've watched a class lesson on Express routing parameters because
2

3
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.460
this challenge is all about putting it into practice. To start off this challenge
3

4
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:20.010
I want you to head over to your console and you're going to type the letters 'rs' while your nodemon
4

5
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.310
server is running.
5

6
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.040
What this does is that it will force nodemon to restart your server.
6

7
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:31.950
And in terms of our website that means it will get rid of any previous blog post that we had because
7

8
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:37.960
it will rerun this entire page and it will set our posts array back to empty.
8

9
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:46.800
So the challenge is can you change the code inside Atom such that we head over to localhost:3000
9

10
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:54.220
/posts/ anything you type in here, let's say testing right.?
10

11
00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:02.130
Then when I hit enter it should do nothing on our page but when you head over to our terminal it should
11

12
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.250
print whatever it is that comes after
12

13
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.070
/post/ right?
13

14
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.950
So this last part, whatever it is I write in here, when I hit enter it should get logged in our console.
14

15
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.860
And this requires you to apply what you learned in the last lesson about route parameters and using
15

16
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.030
Express JS to achieve this.
16

17
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.130
So pause the video and complete the challenge
17

18
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:34.770
now. All right so there's only one hint for this challenge and that is remember that using Express if
18

19
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.100
you have a read of the documentation, you can see that whatever parameter you have in here you can access
19

20
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.390
it using request.params and then dot the name that you've put over here
20

21
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.040
right? So whatever it is, it has to be spelt exactly the same. And hopefully this is enough of a hint for
21

22
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.290
you to be able to reach the answer yourself.
