Hey it's Angela here again.
1

2
00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:10.640
And of course I'm here to congratulate you on completing yet another module. If you keep showing up like
2

3
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:16.070
this and if you keep just doing the work then I'm pretty sure you're going to get there and you're going
3

4
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.520
to be able to achieve those goals that you set out at the beginning of the course.
4

5
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:29.660
Now today I want to talk about a way of using sort of public judgment in your favor.
5

6
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:36.680
So the idea is that you know when you set out a goal for yourself and the only person that knows about
6

7
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.050
it is you,
7

8
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.750
it's very easy to say like ah, actually you know it doesn't really matter.
8

9
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.210
Like if I achieve it or not. Like I don't want to stress myself out too much it doesn't matter.
9

10
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.720
But if you actually declare it publicly
10

11
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:59.570
if you say to your friends like I am going to be able to build this thing that I want to build, I am
11

12
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.940
going to learn how to code, I am going to I don't know go to the gym every day,
12

13
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.600
then you have some accountability right? To other people not just yourself.
13

14
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:20.450
And I think as humans we find it much harder to deal with like public embarrassment or public scorn
14

15
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.770
when you declare that you're going to do something, like I'm going to quit smoking.
15

16
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.350
And then the next time they see you, you're like you know smoking away
16

17
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.940
it's-- it's much harder to do basically.
17

18
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:39.950
So one of the ways that you can use other people's help in motivating yourself is to just declare it
18

19
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:40.300
public.
19

20
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.080
Go on Facebook go on Twitter,
20

21
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:49.730
tell your friends like I am going to work one hour a day on learning how to code for 100 days and I'm
21

22
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.020
going to check in every day and post my progress.
22

23
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.050
In fact a lot of people already do this.
23

24
00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:01.430
And so if you hang on to Twitter and you look at the hashtags #codingnewbie and #100DaysOfCode, you'll
24

25
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:08.240
see a lot of people document their journey like everything that they've done during the hour and they
25

26
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:16.400
post every day so that a) they have a track record of what they've done every day to learn to code.
26

27
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.240
But also you have loads of people cheering you on, you know like, it's hard.
27

28
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:26.210
Everybody knows that it's hard and everybody who's going-- going through it together will try to help
28

29
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.020
you out.
29

30
00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:36.770
So try to declare publicly your intention, your goal and then go onto Twitter and use those hashtags
30

31
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:46.070
#codingnewbie, #100DaysOfCode to try and reach out basically to a community of really encouraging people
31

32
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.350
who will be there alongside me telling you that you can do it.
32

33
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.270
And I think it's really really powerful when you can tap into that resource.
33

34
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.490
So have a go at that.
