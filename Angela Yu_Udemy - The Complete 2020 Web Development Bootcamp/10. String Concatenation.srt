
1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:00,800
All right.
1

2
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:06,090
So in this module we're going to cover strings in more detail and we're going to fully get to grips
2

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,550
with this particular primitive data type.
3

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:13,380
So previously we saw that we can combine strings using the plus sign.
4

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,780
And this creates a single string using a special feature of programming called concatenation.
5

6
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:24,810
Now you have to imagine that you're joining together everything that's inside a quotation mark and ignoring
6

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,820
everything else.
7

8
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:33,060
So "a" + " " + "b" becomes "a b" concatenated into a single string.
8

9
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:39,570
Now let's try it out in practice. If we head over to Chrome and we open up our Developer Tools and we
9

10
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,650
head over to our Sources and our Snippets,
10

11
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:52,550
then we can start writing some code inside our index.js. So we can create an alert that says "hello"
11

12
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,130
+ "world".
12

13
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:02,880
And this, when we run it, will show helloworld with no spaces in between. So we can add the space by either
13

14
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,700
including it inside a string, so a string with a single space,
14

15
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,140
and this would be "hello" " " "world",
15

16
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:18,510
or we can have it where we have a "hello" + " world", and remember that it's only the parts that are
16

17
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,820
inside the quotation marks that are combined.
17

18
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,070
All right. So this is pretty easy.
18

19
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:31,120
So I want to set you the challenge of creating a greeting message using variables and alerts.
19

20
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,140
So I want you to start off with two variables.
20

21
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:41,190
One is a message which is equal to Hello, and the other variable is called name,
21

22
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:48,720
and you can set it to either your name, or you can set it to whatever the user enters in a prompt.
22

23
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:56,580
Then I want you to write a single line of code where you can create a pop up or an alert that says something
23

24
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:05,190
like, that combines or concatenates these two variables into a single string using these two variables
24

25
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,010
rather than simply just typing the string out.
25

26
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,490
So pause the video and complete this quick challenge.
26

27
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:13,590
All right.
27

28
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,200
So that's pretty easy.
28

29
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,790
All we need to do is to create an alert.
29

30
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,310
We add the message.
30

31
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,760
Then we add some characters in between, so namely it'll be
31

32
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,910
Hello there,
32

33
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:32,090
and then we add the name that we are going to greet.
33

34
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,650
And finally we close off our alert.
34

35
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:40,380
Now the important thing here is that you remember to add the spaces between the message and the name
35

36
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,370
variables.
36

37
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:46,210
You could have done it this way or you could add another string that's simply a space as well.
37

38
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,950
So did you get that right?
38

39
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:53,750
If not, have a review of this lesson and have a play around with concatenation inside the Chrome Developer
39

40
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,950
Tools. And in the next lesson we're going to cover another cool feature of strings which is how we can
40

41
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:03,650
quickly find out the number of characters that are contained inside a single string.
41

42
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,570
So for all of that, I'll see you on the next lesson.
