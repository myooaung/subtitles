00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:07.170
So in the last lesson we looked at how we're able to change the background color of the body of our
1

2
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:16.080
web page by simply injecting CSS code in the same line as our body HTML element.
2

3
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:23.310
Now in this lesson we're going to look at how we can implement CSS code across the entire web page
3

4
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:32.280
so we won't have to copy and paste the style attribute each time we want to change a particular element.
4

5
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:39.570
So in order to do this we're going to go into the head section of our HTML page and just below the
5

6
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.650
title,
6

7
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:46.500
I'm going to add a style tag and I'm going to close it off as well.
7

8
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:55.040
Now in between the style tag I'm going to select the HTML element that I want to affect.
8

9
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.250
So let's first try this with our body element.
9

10
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.910
So in order to select an HTML tag all you have to do is specify the name of the element you want
10

11
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.050
to change which in this case is the body.
11

12
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:16.590
And then you're going to create a set of curly braces inside which you're going to write your CSS code
12

13
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.020
that will affect the style of the body element.
13

14
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.450
So let's hit enter and give ourselves a bit more space.
14

15
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.060
And let's also indent this so that it's nested inside our style tag.
15

16
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:39.220
So here I can copy this line of code straight in like so.
16

17
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.870
So the essential elements of any CSS code that you're going to write is going to be something that
17

18
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.810
you want to affect.
18

19
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:55.110
So in this case it’s the body of the page that we want to change and then it's what you want to change
19

20
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.820
about it.
20

21
00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.740
So in this case it's the background color property that we want to affect.
21

22
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.570
And finally what is the value that you're going to change it to which in this case is that nice color
22

23
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.180
from our color palette.
23

24
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.870
So I want to go ahead and just change this to a more obvious color.
24

25
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.400
So back to that pretty ugly blue looking color that we had before.
25

26
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:27.270
And I'm going to delete our inline CSS here and make it go back to just a simple body tag just so
26

27
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.380
that we can confirm that our code is in fact working.
27

28
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:39.240
So now if we hit save and we go back to our Web site and we hit refresh you can see that that change
28

29
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.380
has worked.
29

30
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.910
So we know that our CSS code is functional and it is working.
30

31
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:51.390
Now sometimes when you're linking up CSS with your html file you might have forgotten a closing tag
31

32
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.920
or you might have put it into the wrong place.
32

33
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.490
For example you accidently had it inside the body instead of the head section and there's all sorts
33

34
00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.340
of reasons why your CSS and your HTML might not be linked together.
34

35
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:10.740
So it's always a good idea just to change something really really dramatic so that you can just confirm
35

36
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:20.310
that the entire style tag is working and it's affecting the appearance of your webpage.
36

37
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.390
So now let's change this back to that prettier color that we had.
37

38
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.230
And let's check to make sure that it's working.
38

39
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.400
And the next thing that we're going to change is what we mentioned before, we want to change the style
39

40
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:41.520
of something that occurs repeatedly in our code which is the horizontal rule.
40

41
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:49.680
Now instead of having to write the style attribute inside each and every single one of these tags what
41

42
00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:57.600
I can do is I can simply select it here by saying let's change the style of all the horizontal rules
42

43
00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:05.090
and the property of the horizontal rule that I want to change is also it's background color.
43

44
00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:12.100
I don't like this gray ish thing that we've got here and I want it to just be pure white.
44

45
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:21.870
So I want it's background color to be simply just white a CSS color that we can have access to just by
45

46
00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.500
writing the keyword white.
46

47
00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:33.280
So if we hit save and we head over to our website you'll notice that nothing changes when you refresh
47

48
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.760
it.
48

49
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.270
It hasn't changed in its appearance at all.
49

50
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:49.860
So why is that? Well, it's really really important to realize that no website is completely unstyled.
50

51
00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.130
So what does that mean?
51

52
00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:59.570
Even before we've added any CSS code to our index.html, there is already some default CSS
52

53
00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.300
being applied by your browser.
53

54
00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.240
Now you can find out what the default CSS looks like
54

55
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.430
by again searching for it.
55

56
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:16.710
So let's search for browser default CSS and hit enter.
56

57
00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.090
And you can see that the first thing that we get is actually from W3 Schools.
57

58
00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:27.260
So I'm pretty agnostic towards which sources we use as long as they're useful.
58

59
00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:35.420
And Google's always pretty good at picking out which is the most used or rather most useful links and
59

60
00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.450
put them at the top of your searches.
60

61
00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:45.920
So if we look inside W3 Schools you can see that all these elements have default CSS values being
61

62
00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.280
applied by your browser.
62

63
00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:58.800
Now if we hit command F to find the horizontal rule then you can see all the default CSS that it has.
63

64
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.420
Now let me just talk you through what all of this does.
64

65
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:10.520
Now the first thing is that it sets a margin for a horizontal rule and then it sets the type or the
65

66
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.750
style of our border to something called inset.
66

67
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:19.000
And then it gives the border a width of one pixel.
67

68
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.230
So what is this border style inset.
68

69
00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:32.750
Well let's take a look at border style CSS using MDN and you can see that there's a whole bunch
69

70
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:38.450
of different keywords that you can use that changes the border style.
70

71
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:46.640
Now you'll also find the default one which has the inset border style and this displays a border that
71

72
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:56.300
makes the element look embedded and if you look really closely at our border it's kind of got
72

73
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.400
that effect right.
73

74
00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:05.780
Even though it's not that nice looking that happens to be the default style that's specified by our
74

75
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:06.980
browser.
75

76
00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:10.440
So let's change it to something that we want.
76

77
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:14.110
Well we actually don't really want a border.
77

78
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:20.330
All we want is just to have a single line without a border that is white in color.
78

79
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:20.950
Right.
79

80
00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:29.300
So we can change the border style to none and we can override the default browser value by specifying
80

81
00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.780
a new value for it using CSS.
81

82
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:39.220
So we're going to set border style to none.
82

83
00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:46.480
And if we hit save something surprising is going to happen when you refresh your website.
83

84
00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:50.100
Your horizontal rules have disappeared.
84

85
00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:51.740
Now why is that?
85

86
00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:59.580
Well one of the most important concepts in learning CSS is realizing that pretty much everything that
86

87
00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:08.280
exists on the web page are essentially just boxes and I can make those boxes appear by using the Chrome
87

88
00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:16.610
plugin I've got which is called pesticide and it highlights all of the boxes that we have on screen.
88

89
00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.830
Now the horizontal rule is no exception.
89

90
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:30.090
It's also just a rectangle and that rectangle used to have a border specified by this border style and
90

91
00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:32.410
that border had a width.
91

92
00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:39.540
So it was one pixel on the top one pixel on the bottom one pixel on the left and one pixel on the right.
92

93
00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:47.480
Now by getting rid of that border by setting border style to none our rectangle now has no size.
93

94
00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:50.510
It's literally 0 pixels high.
94

95
00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:59.400
So in order to change this situation we need to change some of the CSS for the box to give it a height.
95

96
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:05.040
So if you head over to devdocs.io and you search for height,
96

97
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:10.750
the first one, the blue icon here, shows you that this is CSS related documentation.
97

98
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:15.210
And if you click on it it takes you to this height CSS property.
98

99
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:22.740
And this specifies the height of an element and you can read that as this thing changes the height of
99

100
00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:23.550
your box.
100

101
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:32.190
So if we now give a horizontal rule a height let's say 2 pixels and we hit save.
101

102
00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:40.950
Once we hit refresh our box now has an actual dimension and you can see that here as well you can see
102

103
00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:48.600
that that tiny box now has a little bit of height associated with it whereas previously had zero pixels
103

104
00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:52.920
in height because only the border had a dimension to it.
104

105
00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:58.260
Now that height property isn't unique to just the horizontal rule.
105

106
00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.600
And this is the really interesting thing about CSS.
106

107
00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:09.060
Now once you realize that essentially everything in your web page is just a whole bunch of boxes and
107

108
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:15.120
the properties of these boxes can be affected by changing the CSS code,
108

109
00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:22.650
then you can pretty much apply the same rules or the same changes to any of these boxes you choose.
109

110
00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:32.070
So for example if I wanted to select my image HTML element, then I could write img and I can change
110

111
00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:39.540
its height to something less extreme maybe something like 20 pixels and if I hit save and refresh
111

112
00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:50.070
then you'll see that the box for my image has now become super tiny and it is now only 20 pixels high.
112

113
00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:56.400
Now some of you might have tried to change the height of the body and you might have gotten stuck and
113

114
00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.660
wondered why did it not work for the body.
114

115
00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:09.030
Well it's down to the fact that the body has some default values that prevents our changing the height
115

116
00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:15.750
and we're going to look at some of those things like display block in later lessons in this module to
116

117
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:17.740
understand why that is.
117

118
00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:25.650
But for now let's get rid of this style that we apply to the image and let's hit save and let's see
118

119
00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:27.560
our web site as it is.
119

120
00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:35.190
Now if you go into Dev Docs and you go to the CSS section, then you can look at all of these subsections
120

121
00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:41.160
of how you can change the appearance of any element. One of the things that you can change
121

122
00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:46.080
in addition to the height is actually the width of your element.
122

123
00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:56.070
So we can go and say the width of our horizontal rule should only ever be 100 pixels and we hit save
123

124
00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:57.640
and we refresh.
124

125
00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:00.800
And you see that this is 100 pixels wide.
125

126
00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:08.250
Now sometimes you might want the width to change depending on whether you're viewing your web site on
126

127
00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:14.570
a smartphone or whether you're viewing on a browser or if somebody is viewing it maybe on an iPad.
127

128
00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:24.200
So you might not want to specify a straight up hard coded value such as hundred pixels.
128

129
00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:27.820
You can also specify a percentage.
129

130
00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:35.710
So you can say the width should be 30 percent of the entire width of the web page.
130

131
00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:43.260
Now when you hit refresh you can see that that line is much wider when our entire page is wider.
131

132
00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:49.330
And when our page gets narrower it always remains 30 percent of the entire width.
132

133
00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:52.570
So that's another way that you can specify a size.
133

134
00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:59.530
Now as a challenge I want you to use this page on MDN, the border style property,
134

135
00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:07.840
and looking at all the different types of border styles I want you to be able to make this line similar
135

136
00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:16.750
to what Sean has here, which is just a few gray dots, maybe three or four or maybe just 10 percent of
136

137
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:18.030
the page.
137

138
00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:26.460
So pause the video and see if you can change the CSS in order to make that line look like this.
138

139
00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:32.030
All right.
139

140
00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:33.970
So how did that go?
140

141
00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:42.750
Now in order to make our horizontal rule look similar to this we know that we can change the border style.
141

142
00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:49.490
And one of those styles is the dotted style and MDN very helpfully
142

143
00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:55.990
has this interactive box where we can change the properties of these borders.
143

144
00:13:56.210 --> 00:14:00.130
So we already know that we can have a border to be set to none.
144

145
00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:02.270
We're going to need it to be dotted.
145

146
00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:14.740
But if we simply change this border style to dotted and hit save then you can see if I zoom in
146

147
00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:25.360
that yes I have a border that's dotted around my horizontal rule but this looks nothing like what he's
147

148
00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:26.890
got over here.
148

149
00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:28.890
So how can we change this?
149

150
00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:36.550
Well if we only want to have a single border then we have to turn our height down to zero again.
150

151
00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:42.430
So we have a box that's 0 pixels high that only has a border.
151

152
00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:50.020
So you can either change the height to zero pixels or delete it outright and that will also make it
152

153
00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:51.550
zero pixels high.
153

154
00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:58.420
Now if I refresh you can see that we've now got a horizontal rule that's 0 pixels high.
154

155
00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:01.380
And we've got a border around it.
155

156
00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:09.040
So if we have a look here the syntax section it says that when one value for border style is specified
156

157
00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:15.700
then it applies the same style to all four sides and that's pretty much what we're getting here.
157

158
00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:19.990
We’re getting that dotted style across all four sides.
158

159
00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:27.210
Now when we specified two values then the first styles applied to the top and bottom borders and the
159

160
00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:34.620
second to the left and right when three values are specified then the first one applies to the top the
160

161
00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:38.320
second to the left and the right and the third the bottom.
161

162
00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:42.820
Or you can also specify all four values of all four sides.
162

163
00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:49.530
So knowing this we can actually change our border style to dotted.
163

164
00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:53.390
So that gets applied to the top border.
164

165
00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:58.740
And then we can specify none for the rest of the borders.
165

166
00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:02.760
And if we hit save, we go back over here, we refresh,
166

167
00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:07.360
you see that we now only have the top border showing.
167

168
00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:14.340
Now an alternative way that you might have worked out is by simply changing the border top style so
168

169
00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:23.400
we could say that the entire border style is none but the border top style is going to be dotted and
169

170
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:29.840
if you hit save and you refresh you can see that it's exactly the same effect.
170

171
00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:38.910
Because we're specifying something that is more specific than this property we're affecting only this
171

172
00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:40.110
particular thing.
172

173
00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:47.830
And now our background color is redundant because our main box has no background because it has no height.
173

174
00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:49.330
So we can get rid of that.
174

175
00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:57.300
Now in order to make this line look more like this line we have to change the size of the dots and also
175

176
00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:03.600
the color of the dots and you can see that we can change the color by simply changing the border color
176

177
00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:08.880
property so we can change it to grey and we can also change the border width.
177

178
00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:18.530
So if we say 20 pixels then the dots get a lot bigger whereas five pixels you only get very tiny dots.
178

179
00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:25.780
So let's go over here and add some more properties that we want to change so we're going to change the
179

180
00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:35.080
border color to grey and we're going to change the border height the border and then we're going to
180

181
00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.890
change the border width to 
181

182
00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:43.610
let’s try 20 pixels and let's see what that now looks like.
182

183
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:46.070
Oh that's absolutely massive.
183

184
00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:48.610
And our border is still black.
184

185
00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:53.850
So what's going on here is because we have a typo in the word grey.
185

186
00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:59.200
And you can see that using our packages that we've installed in Atom, when it’s actually a valid color
186

187
00:17:59.200 --> 00:17:59.980
code,
187

188
00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:04.910
it gets highlighted in a different color compared to something that doesn't exist.
188

189
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:14.530
So let's change that down to maybe let's try 10 pixels and that is now looking pretty similar to that
189

190
00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:19.360
size maybe smaller still maybe 5 pixels.
190

191
00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:25.070
That looks pretty similar.
191

192
00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:30.460
And we can change it down to be a lot smaller in width as well.
192

193
00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:39.290
So let's say maybe put the width as maybe 10 percent or even smaller maybe 5 percent yeah that looks
193

194
00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:40.080
pretty decent.
194

195
00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:48.780
So we've now more or less implemented what we see over here simply by changing the CSS style of our
195

196
00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:50.070
horizontal rule.
196

197
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:57.980
Now there's still a bit of a problem though because we've changed our horizontal rule to look exactly
197

198
00:18:57.980 --> 00:18:59.560
the way that we wanted to.
198

199
00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:03.170
And we of course want this to be consistent across our web site.
199

200
00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:10.070
And we also want our background color to carry over to all our other web pages on our web site.
200

201
00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:19.850
But if we look inside My Hobbies or Contact Me it still looks exactly the same way as it did before.
201

202
00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:27.170
And we're going to have to copy this entire style section over to the Contact Me header as well as the
202

203
00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:28.280
Hobbies header.
203

204
00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:36.700
So that's kind of a lot of work especially if you end up with a web site with you know 200 pages then
204

205
00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:43.530
it's not a good idea to have to copy this over and change it in every single place.
205

206
00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:53.210
This might be easier than using inline CSS as we did in the last lesson but it's still quite repetitive.
206

207
00:19:53.240 --> 00:20:02.300
What we really want is to have a single location where when we change the CSS styles in that one location
207

208
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:08.890
then everything gets reflected across our web site in all of the pages.
208

209
00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:15.710
So that is what we're going to learn about in the next lesson where we look into how we can create external
209

210
00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:17.630
CSS for our web site.
210

211
00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:21.240
So stay tuned and I will see you in the next lesson.
