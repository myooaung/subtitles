00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:07,050
All right here comes the answer. Are you ready? Now because we know the code used to work when our header
1

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:07,180
.
2

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:14,880
ejs file was inside our views folder, we know that all we have to do is just change the path in order
3

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,320
for EJS to be able to reach it and include it in our home page.
4

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:25,440
Now the only change that has happened is instead of being immediately available inside the views folder
5

6
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:30,060
our header file is now in a subfolder called partials.
6

7
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:39,510
So if you remember how directories work, our styles.css is inside /public/css/
7

8
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,130
styles.css
8

9
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:41,660
right?
9

10
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:50,790
So in order to reach our new header location all we have to do is just to update the path inside the string.
10

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,900
So we know that EJS already knows to look inside the views folder
11

12
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:02,190
so that's where we're going to start specifying our file path. And when it's here we're going to tell
12

13
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:08,460
it to go to this folder called partials and then navigate inside it to find this file called header.
13

14
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,600
And we'll go ahead and do the same for our footer.
14

15
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:20,280
So now let's hit save. And let's go ahead and refresh our website and you can see that we've recovered
15

16
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,540
our header partial and our footer partial
16

17
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:30,210
and now our code is laid out the way that it's meant to be with a partials folder and also a views
17

18
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:35,830
folder inside our views folder and also the rest of our EJS pages.
18

19
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,800
Did you get that right? Now
19

20
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:41,450
if you had any trouble with any of the previous challenges
20

21
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:47,400
be sure to take a look at some of the tutorial videos where we spoke about a lot of these things in
21

22
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:52,200
detail. But otherwise when you're ready, let's head over to challenge 5.
