00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,850
All right. So this is the very last challenge of the module.
1

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,580
Well done for getting it this far
2

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:14,160
if you're still with me. The goal of this challenge is when you load up the home page it should have
3

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:20,350
a link at the end of each truncated blog post with something that says Read more.
4

5
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:27,660
And when we click on it then it should take us to the actual page of the blog post including all of
5

6
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,160
the content.
6

7
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:35,970
So that means we can read each and every blog post on its own individual page just by clicking on the
7

8
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:39,820
Read more after the bit of truncated preview text.
8

9
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,010
So think about what you've learned in this module and try to complete this challenge all by yourself.
9

10
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:45,550
Good luck.
10

11
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,290
I'll see you on the other side.
11

12
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,610
So here's my first hint.
12

13
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:57,410
In order for this to work the first thing that we need is an anchor tag
13

14
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:04,660
right? Something that it will act as a link to link to that particular page. Inside our paragraph
14

15
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:11,100
let's open it up fully so that we have one line which is going to be dedicated to our post content that's
15

16
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:18,700
truncated and then we also add an anchor tag. And inside this anchor tag the text is just going to be Read
16

17
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:28,950
More. The href has to point to a URL that will take us to the specific page.
17

18
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:34,960
See if that was enough of a hint for you to now be able to complete this challenge.
18

19
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,810
Now here's my second hint.
19

20
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,420
We know that inside this home.
20

21
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,250
ejs
21

22
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:49,680
we already have access to the post.title for each and every post that's being listed over here
22

23
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,070
right?
23

24
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,820
We already have access to that.
24

25
00:01:52,080 --> 00:02:00,690
And we also know that if we navigate to posts/ simply just the title spelt out Day 
25

26
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:05,790
1 and we hit enter. Because of all the code that we've got in our routing,
26

27
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:11,130
that alone can take us to the individual page of each blog post.
27

28
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:15,470
That's my last and final hint. See if you can now complete the challenge.
