Hi guys! It's Angela from the App Brewery.
1

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:08,610
And in this lesson, we're going to deep dive into how exactly does the Internet actually work.
2

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,600
Because here's the thing that we use every single day and we completely take it for granted.
3

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:19,020
So before we start developing awesome websites and web apps for people to access through the Internet,
4

5
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:25,440
it's really important that we understand the fundamentals of how the Internet actually works.
5

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,840
So what exactly is the Internet?
6

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,610
Well, a lot of people think of it as a cloud.
7

8
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:36,510
Something that's hanging around in the sky. It's super complex; super difficult to understand, but actually
8

9
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:37,890
that's not it at all.
9

10
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,520
The Internet is really simple.
10

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,860
All it is is just a long piece of wire.
11

12
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,610
And the wire connects different computers to each other.
12

13
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:52,230
So you might have one computer that's in Seattle and another computer that's in London. And they can
13

14
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,230
talk to each other and transfer data through this giant wire.
14

15
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,250
Now some of these computers attached to the internet have a very special job.
15

16
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:08,900
They have to be online 24/7, ready to serve you all of the data and the files that you are requesting
16

17
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:14,700
when you try to access websites. And the computers that are doing that job, we would call a server. And
17

18
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,440
the computers that any user would use to access the internet is called a client.
18

19
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:25,830
Now you can imagine a web server as a giant library that's open 24/7. And you can go in there at any
19

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:31,680
hour of the day and request "I want to see Google's home page" or "I want to see the latest post on Tech
20

21
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,050
Crunch". And it would be up to serve you with all of the files and data that you would need to be able
21

22
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:40,200
to view whatever website it is that you requested.
22

23
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,570
Now you can imagine if there's a library that's big enough to house all of these websites. then it's
23

24
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:50,910
going to be pretty difficult to quickly locate the thing that you want out of this giant library,
24

25
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:51,310
right?
25

26
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,840
So how is this problem solved on the Internet?
26

27
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,130
Well, let's say that you're sitting at home on your computer and you type in google.com because you
27

28
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,270
want to head over to the main Google home page.
28

29
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:08,980
What happens behind the scenes is that your browser will send a message to your Internet service provider.
29

30
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,010
So these are the people who you pay to be able to access the Internet.
30

31
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:18,810
And if you're in the US, that's a company like AT&amp;T or Comcast. And if you're in the U.K. then that would
31

32
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,760
be something like BT or TalkTalk.
32

33
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:28,050
Now the message that you're sending the ISP is "I want to see google.com". And the ISP will then relay
33

34
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:36,030
that message to something called a DNS server - a domain name system server. And a DNS server is essentially
34

35
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,190
just a souped up phone book.
35

36
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:45,390
And what happens when you make that request through your browser is the DNS server will look up in its
36

37
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:52,770
database as to what is the exact IP address of that website that you're trying to access. And every
37

38
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:57,330
single computer that's connected to the internet has an IP address.
38

39
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:03,330
This is like a postal address for your computer. So that when people need to send and receive files on
39

40
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:08,100
the Internet, each computer can be located by a unique IP address.
40

41
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:14,040
And once that DNS server finds the IP address, it sends that back to your browser.
41

42
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:19,230
So now you know the exact address where you can find the Google home page.
42

43
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:25,920
So, the next thing that happens, is you will send a direct request to that address through your Internet
43

44
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,950
service provider.
44

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And this message will be delivered via what's called the Internet backbone.
45

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,750
Now, the Internet backbone isn't some sort of analogy for some clever programming.
46

47
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,630
It's literally the backbone of the Internet.
47

48
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:47,910
And if you had a submarinecablemap.com, you can view all of the underwater cables that power the
48

49
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:55,380
Internet. And the Internet is made up of these huge sprawling masses of wires, connecting all of the world's
49

50
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,810
Internet users. As you can imagine
50

51
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,000
it's a pretty complex world out there.
51

52
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:07,350
Now, if I'm sitting in London and I want to see a website that's hosted in the United States, then my
52

53
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:12,780
browser would have to make a request that goes through one of these cables under the Atlantic Ocean
53

54
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,200
in order to reach the United States.
54

55
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:21,390
And once that computers receive my request, they'll send back all of the relevant data. Again, through
55

56
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:27,630
these giant cables. And to navigate all of this crazy underwater and above water wires,
56

57
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:30,180
all I have is an IP address.
57

58
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:36,180
It's like as if I'm sending a letter halfway across the world and my only hope for my letter to reach
58

59
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,710
my friend is that postal address on the front of the envelope.
59

60
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:46,200
So, once I've gotten the IP address of the website that I want to access, then my browser sends another
60

61
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:53,190
message through the Internet service provider via the Internet backbone to the server that is located
61

62
00:04:53,280 --> 00:05:01,950
at that address 216.58.210.46. And the computer that's located at that address is of course the
62

63
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:08,640
Google server. And on this server, there's all of the files I would need in order to be able to view the
63

64
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,030
Google home page.
64

65
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:15,930
So, the server then sends all of those files back to me through the Internet backbone and I get to see
65

66
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:21,930
the Google home page in my browser. And all of that happens in a matter of milliseconds.
66

67
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:27,720
And just to imagine the journey that my data has gone on, travelling through the world thousands of times
67

68
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,380
per day.
68

69
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,060
So, why don't you give it a go?
69

70
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:39,630
Open up your browser and type in 216.58.210.46 and hit enter to see the Google home page being
70

71
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:43,190
served up to you being served up to you through the Internet.
