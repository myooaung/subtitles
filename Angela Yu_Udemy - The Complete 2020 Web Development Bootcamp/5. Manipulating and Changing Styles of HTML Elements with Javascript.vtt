00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:00.840
All right.
1

2
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:07.200
So now that we know how to select elements using the DOM, it's time to learn how to use Javascript to
2

3
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.060
manipulate the elements that we've selected.
3

4
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:18.030
Now, as you saw earlier on, we were able to change the CSS style dynamically using Javascript by tapping
4

5
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.060
into the style property of an element object.
5

6
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:31.320
So, for example, we could say document.querySelector(“h1”).style.color = “red”.
6

7
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.750
And that selects on the h1 element in our document, changes the style color to a red color.
7

8
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.510
Now every single CSS property can be changed in this way using Javascript, but the property names might
8

9
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.610
look a little bit different.
9

10
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.830
As we said earlier on, Javascript naming conventions tend to be camel cased.
10

11
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.760
So, for example querySelector, where the first word is lowercase
11

12
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.940
and the second word begins with an uppercase letter.
12

13
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.390
This is camel casing and this is standard for naming methods and properties in Javascript.
13

14
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.720
So that means that when you're trying to change the CSS styles, you will find that the property names
14

15
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.830
don't look quite the same as what you see in CSS.
15

16
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:24.660
So, for example, we might have things like font size, which is font-size as the property name in CSS,
16

17
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.810
but if you're trying to change it using Javascript, then the property is going to be camel cased like
17

18
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:31.530
so.
18

19
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:39.780
So let's change the font size to, I don’t know, something massive, 10rem. And you can find all of those names inside
19

20
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.750
the DOM style object documentation and you'll see all of these properties and what they look like when
20

21
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.910
you're trying to change it using Javascript instead of CSS.
21

22
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.200
And I'll leave a link to this in the resources of this current lesson so you can check it out.
22

23
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.740
But, as a rule of thumb, in most cases they're exactly the same,
23

24
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.440
other than the fact that there are no dashes and every word after the first one will have its first
24

25
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.000
letter capitalized.
25

26
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.420
The other thing to notice is that the values that you're going to set it to have to be represented as
26

27
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:20.370
strings. Whereas in CSS we simply just specified the value as is, for example padding 7 percent, if we're
27

28
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:26.760
trying to do this with Javascript, then we actually have to specify everything as a string, even if it's
28

29
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.770
a number, like line height or padding.
29

30
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.460
So, just so you can see more clearly, I'm inside the Elements tab of the Chrome Developer Tools,
30

31
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:42.600
and as you might remember, you can quite easily select an item over here and change its CSS by just typing
31

32
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.530
it inside here,
32

33
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.930
so say visibility is hidden, and that hides our h1.
33

34
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:56.250
But if we wanted to do the same thing using Javascript, then we would have to specify that value “hidden”
34

35
00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.480
as a string.
35

36
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.720
So remember those two differences.
36

37
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.180
Now it's your turn to try it out.
37

38
00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:11.240
I want you to use Javascript only to change the background color of our button here to a yellow color.
38

39
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.230
And you might have to take a look at the object style properties or you can just give it a go and see
39

40
00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.630
if you can predict what it might be.
40

41
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.840
So pause the video now and give that challenge a go.
41

42
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.110
All right.
42

43
00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.600
So you might already realize that in order to change the background color of our button, then in CSS you
43

44
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:33.310
would simply just tap into the background color property and you would set it to yellow.
44

45
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.810
And that would achieve what we wanted.
45

46
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.460
But because we have to do it using Javascript, then we need to know the Javascript version of that background
46

47
00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:42.570
color property.
47

48
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:50.070
So if we head over to our Style Object Properties documentation and we hit command f and we search for background
48

49
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.150
color, then you can see that it brings up the property
49

50
00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.520
that’s called backgroundColor.
50

51
00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:02.220
And as some of you might have predicted it's simply the same property without the dash and camel case.
51

52
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.430
So let's now use it inside our console.
52

53
00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.680
So we're going to tap into the document and query for the selector
53

54
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:22.200
that is a button, and change its style property, namely the background color property, to, remember the value
54

55
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.990
has to be specified as a string,
55

56
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.130
so it's the word yellow
56

57
00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.390
inside some quotation marks.
57

58
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.830
Now if we hit enter, our Javascript code has turned the background color of the button yellow.
58

59
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.580
So if you found that difficult at all,
59

60
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.350
then I recommend going through some of the other properties that we've been using in CSS and trying
60

61
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.870
to do it using Javascript instead,
61

62
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.420
and have a play around with the Chrome Developer Tools until you really get it.
62

63
00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.630
Now in the next lesson we're going to learn all about the separation of concerns and how we can keep
63

64
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:57.230
our style inside the CSS but toggle it on and off using Javascript.
64

65
00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.240
So for all of that and more, I'll see you on the next lesson.
