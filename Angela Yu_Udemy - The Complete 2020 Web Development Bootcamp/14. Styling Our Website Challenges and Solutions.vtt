1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:01.260
All right.
1

2
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:07.260
So in order to get to where we are right now we've learned about a number of Bootstrap components,
2

3
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:16.800
for example the navigation bar, the Bootstrap buttons, Bootstrap containers, grids, and the responsiveness
3

4
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.810
that we get using Bootstrap for layout purposes.
4

5
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:28.530
Now, before we carry on, I want to add some more CSS code, so normal bog old standard CSS, so that
5

6
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:36.780
we can customize all of our Bootstrap components and make our title page look a little bit more like
6

7
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.760
our design on Balsamiq.
7

8
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.980
So let's get started.
8

9
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.180
Now, the first thing that you may or may not have noticed, there are some different fonts going on here.
9

10
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:55.800
The nav bar uses the Bootstrap default font, as does the nav bar brand, as does the text in our buttons,
10

11
00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.140
and also of course the rest of our unstyled web page.
11

12
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:08.400
Now, instead of going into the button, and going into the nav bar, and adding CSS to each of them, changing
12

13
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.630
the font, I want you to think if you can figure out a way of changing all of the text to the Montserrat
13

14
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.010
font that we got from Google fonts.
14

15
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.280
So pause the video and see if you can complete this mini challenge.
15

16
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.870
All righ. So, this shouldn't be too hard because we've done it before.
16

17
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.610
Now, what is the one thing that encompasses all of our content for our web site?
17

18
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:40.650
Well, it's the body element, because all the content is embedded inside it. And we can simply define a
18

19
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.860
global font for the body in order to apply it to all the text on screen.
19

20
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:55.620
So, I'm going to target the body element, and I'm going to change the font-family to Montserrat, and
20

21
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.280
I'm going to close it off with a semi-colon.
21

22
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.910
So let's hit save and let's go back and refresh.
22

23
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.700
You can see that all the text now has changed to our chosen font, which makes it look a little bit more
23

24
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.810
unified, and gets us closer to our final design.
24

25
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:22.890
So, the next thing I want to change is, I want this title text to have a white color, so that it matches
25

26
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.980
with the color palette that we've got going on here, which is this kind of red and white kind of scheme
26

27
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.910
for our imaginary TinDog product.
27

28
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:39.480
So, one way of doing this is going into the h1 that we've already selected here, and adding a color property
28

29
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.240
and setting it to white.
29

30
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:49.890
Now, the other way of doing this is adding it to the title section, which, if you remember, the h1 is residing
30

31
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.060
inside.
31

32
00:02:51.060 --> 00:03:00.450
So, this line is inside our title section, and, by changing the color of all text in the title section,
32

33
00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:08.340
if later on I decide to add a subtitle or, you know, a little bit of explainer text, or whatever it may
33

34
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.870
be,
34

35
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.930
it will still keep to our current color scheme.
35

36
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.800
So it's a little bit more encompassing, and that's what I'm going to do here.
36

37
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.630
I'm going to add our color property and I'm going to set it to white.
37

38
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:29.550
So, as a shorthand remember that the color hex codes for #fff is always going to be white,
38

39
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:37.710
and #000 is always going to be black, and you can see our Pigments add on showing you that.
39

40
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.020
So I want white.
40

41
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.470
Let's hit save and let's refresh.
41

42
00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.840
You can see we've now got our white big title, which looks brilliant.
42

43
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:54.870
Now, don't worry, if you added your color to the h1, it's perfectly valid, and we can always refactor code
43

44
00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:01.410
later on if we see we’are duplicating any part or, you know, if we want to make our code more succinct.
44

45
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.820
So that's completely acceptable and it's not wrong at all.
45

46
00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:13.500
So, now that we've styled the text on our page, the next thing I want to look at is this nav bar, because
46

47
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:19.350
you can see that the text is a little bit too small and this brand should really be a little bit more
47

48
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:20.250
prominent.
48

49
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:26.700
And also I want to make it look a little bit more like the Tinder logo, because we are making a copycat
49

50
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.850
product here after all.
50

51
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:38.190
And the closest logo that I found on Google Fonts was the Ubuntu font, which we already incorporated when
51

52
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.690
we embedded our Google Fonts into our web site.
52

53
00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.450
So let's go ahead and do that. Now, before I do that, 
53

54
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:52.770
I want to add a new section, and I'm going to say Navigation Bar, and I'm going to use that good old trick
54

55
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.480
of highlighting it and command forward slash to style it.
55

56
00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.460
I find this much easier than typing a bunch of asterisks and forward slashes.
56

57
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.240
Now here we're going to first target our nav brand,
57

58
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:18.670
so navbar-brand, and and I want to change the font-family to Ubuntu, so font-family, and that's
58

59
00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.330
going to be Ubuntu.
59

60
00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:30.230
Now let's hit save and refresh and you can see that that t looks a lot like the t for Tinder now, but
60

61
00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:36.380
it's still too small, so let's increase the font size as well to 2.5rem,
61

62
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.870
and maybe while we're here we can make the font-weight to
62

63
00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.210
bold as well.
63

64
00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:53.880
Let’s save and refresh, and you can see that now we've got this big navbar-brand, which looks a lot better and it
64

65
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.890
makes us seem like we're more proud of what we're called, rather than as if we're trying to hide it with
65

66
00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:00.410
our tiny text.
66

67
00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:05.780
Now, with the bigger font size for the navbar-brand, you start to notice that it’s a little bit awkward
67

68
00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:09.290
having it so close to our title text and image,
68

69
00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:17.130
so ideally I would like to push down any content, and have a bit of padding at the bottom of our nav bar,
69

70
00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.760
because it would make it look a lot nicer.
70

71
00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:24.450
So, I don't really want to add any padding to the top or the left and right.
71

72
00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:35.430
So, can you think of a way in which we can set the bottom padding to 4.5rem, without touching the padding
72

73
00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.840
on any other side of the nav bar?
73

74
00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:42.050
So, again, mini challenge, pause the video if you want to complete it.
74

75
00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:44.060
All right.
75

76
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:53.230
So, I'm going to put this just above our navbar-brand, because it's more broad, and it targets the nav
76

77
00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.380
bar instead of any component inside the nav bar,
77

78
00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:05.170
so it's a higher level div, so I tend to add my selectors in that kind of order, going from less specific
78

79
00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:08.190
to more specific as you scroll down,
79

80
00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:12.150
and also I try to keep the CSS styling
80

81
00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:14.970
roughly in the order that you see on the page.
81

82
00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:19.570
So, the title section will go first, then the next section, then the next section.
82

83
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:24.260
It just makes it a little bit easier to change and to fix later on.
83

84
00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:31.750
Now, in the nav bar we want to change the padding, and we only want to touch the padding bottom, and we want
84

85
00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:40.060
to set it to 2.5, and we want to set it to 4.5rem, hit save and refresh.
85

86
00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:46.960
And now we've got a little bit more space in between that nav bar and the title text and images, and
86

87
00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:52.660
it makes the whole web site look a lot less bunched up and a lot more designed, if you will.
87

88
00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:56.980
Now the next thing we should address in the nav bar are these nav items.
88

89
00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:00.190
They need a bit more space between each other.
89

90
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:03.200
So I'm again going to add some padding.
90

91
00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:08.270
I'll keep this as a fixed size just because we've got that responsiveness,
91

92
00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:12.220
so I don't really need it as a percentage or as a rem.
92

93
00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:20.350
So, I'm going to put in probably 18 pixels of padding left and right of each of these nav items.
93

94
00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:27.640
So, we're going to go below the navbar-brand. We’re going to target nav-item, and we're going to say
94

95
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:38.260
padding 0 top and bottom, and then about 18 pixels left and right, hit save, refresh, bit more spaced
95

96
00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.310
out, looks a lot nicer,
96

97
00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:45.640
we won't accidentally press on the wrong button, but they still need to be a little bit larger.
97

98
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:49.690
So I'm going to dig even deeper inside the nav-item.
98

99
00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:53.380
I'm going to target the actual nav-link to style it.
99

100
00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.200
So we're going to target the nav-link.
100

101
00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:02.470
So, in this case I'm going to change the font size, the font-family, as well as the colors, so that we get
101

102
00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.480
a little bit more like this.
102

103
00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.090
So a little bit larger,
103

104
00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:12.900
and I'm also going to change the font-weight to the Montserrat-Light font
104

105
00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:16.370
so it's not so prominent on the page.
105

106
00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.830
So let's go ahead and do that.
106

107
00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:24.420
Let's change the nav link’s font size, we can change it to maybe about 1.2rem.
107

108
00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:29.560
You can’t see it's just a little bit bigger, but it's a little bit too heavy in terms of weight at the moment.
108

109
00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:41.200
So let's change the font-family to Montserrat-Light, and this will thin those letters down and make
109

110
00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.800
it less prominent and blend in a bit better.
110

111
00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:50.250
Now let's take a look at how our nav bar looks by activating Pesticide.
111

112
00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:54.400
And you can see that this is the entire section,
112

113
00:09:54.460 --> 00:10:00.220
this blue section. And you can see that we've still got a bit of padding,
113

114
00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:05.590
it seems, leftover from the top, the left and the right of our nav bar,
114

115
00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:12.780
which is why that text is not aligning on the left with our title text here.
115

116
00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:15.970
So that is just a little bit off.
116

117
00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:24.670
And I suspect the reason is, if we inspect on this, is that the nav bar actually has some padding, in addition
117

118
00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:26.830
to the padding bottom that we added.
118

119
00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:34.060
So let's try and get rid of this padding which came from, probably, the Bootstrap element, and we can do
119

120
00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:42.070
that by, instead of using padding bottom to add padding and then add zero to the top, zero to the left
120

121
00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:45.690
and right and 4.5 rpm to the bottom only.
121

122
00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:48.270
So now if we refresh.
122

123
00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:55.320
You can see that our navbar-brand now aligns perfectly with our title text and our buttons.
123

124
00:10:55.450 --> 00:11:02.530
And when you're designing web sites or apps or whatever it may be, try to minimize the number of lines
124

125
00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:07.750
that you can align things to, because it will usually make your designs look more together.
125

126
00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:10.620
So now I'm pretty happy with my nav bar.
126

127
00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:16.210
So the next thing I'm going to deal with are these buttons. They’re far too close to this title text
127

128
00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:20.680
and they need a little bit of a margin to push it away from that text.
128

129
00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:32.140
So let's go into our CSS and add another section. Let’s call it Buttons, maybe more specifically the
129

130
00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:39.730
Download Buttons. Let’s comment that out so that we have our new section. Now, in order to target the button,
130

131
00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:48.550
I have a choice of either using the Bootstrap btn class, and customize the Bootstrap style, or I can
131

132
00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:50.560
add in my custom class.
132

133
00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:58.690
Now, in this situation, if you start getting lazy and using the existing classes from Bootstrap, you often
133

134
00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:04.810
find yourself in a situation later on when you want to use this button, but you don't want it to have
134

135
00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:08.590
the same amount of margin as you do in the title section.
135

136
00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:15.590
So, usually, it's much better to just add in a custom class, which is what I'm going to do right now.
136

137
00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:24.820
So I'm going to call this our download-button, and I'm going to apply that class to our Google Play button
137

138
00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:25.300
as well.
138

139
00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:35.940
So let's hit save, and now we can target it over here, and our download button needs a margin that is,
139

140
00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:38.800
I've sort of been tweaking around with it,
140

141
00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:50.120
and the one that I find to work the best is about 5 percent on the top, 3 percent on the right, 5 percent
141

142
00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:53.700
on the left, and 0 on the bottom.
142

143
00:12:53.900 --> 00:13:01.220
So let's hit save and refresh, and you can see that that provides a large enough distance between the
143

144
00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:05.870
two buttons to make it take up roughly the amount of space that we've got
144

145
00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:07.160
for our title,
145

146
00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:14.710
and it makes our button aligned perfectly with the navbar-brand as well as the title text.
146

147
00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:19.520
So that's what I quite liked when I was messing around with these numbers,
147

148
00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:23.370
but of course feel free to play around with it yourself.
148

149
00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:29.360
So it's usually easiest if you just inspect on it, and then just go into the box model and try changing
149

150
00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:34.460
some of these numbers and see what it ends up being for the design that you want.
150

151
00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:39.800
All right. So the very last thing I want to change is this image. That’s all that we have left in our
151

152
00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.120
title section.
152

153
00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:47.840
And, firstly, I want to make its width a little bit smaller, because at the moment it's kind of taking up
153

154
00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:49.660
as much width as it can.
154

155
00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:56.260
It's like full size right now, and I want to be maybe 60 percent of its parent.
155

156
00:13:56.270 --> 00:14:04.460
So this is its parent, which is the containing div, which is our col-lg-6 on desktop and 
156

157
00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:09.790
12 and a full width on iPad or mobile.
157

158
00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:14.080
But I want it to take up only maybe 60 percent of this width, to make it a little bit narrower.
158

159
00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:16.620
So let's go and do that.
159

160
00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:21.550
So again I'm going to add a new section. This is called Title Image.
160

161
00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:29.070
Let's add a comment there and let's find out what class we need to use to target that image.
161

162
00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:33.120
And you can see at the moment our image is devoid of all classes.
162

163
00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:42.730
So let's go ahead and add that, and I'm going to call the class maybe title-image, and we can hit save.
163

164
00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:53.180
Now here I can use that class called title-image, and we can make its width only 60 percent of what it
164

165
00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:56.250
used to be, hit save, refresh.
165

166
00:14:56.350 --> 00:15:02.240
You can see it's now a little bit smaller and less sort of assuming and less in your face, which makes
166

167
00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:04.390
a much better design, I think.
167

168
00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:04.760
Right.
168

169
00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:11.000
So the last and final thing that you might have been struggling to figure out is, how do we get it to
169

170
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.790
be rotated to the right.
170

171
00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:20.430
And this is the part where I said to you might need to search for it on Google.
171

172
00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:26.990
So, as I've been saying, a lot of times getting good at development or programming is very often getting
172

173
00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:31.040
good at Google and knowing the right things to search for in order to get your answer.
173

174
00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:40.670
So in our case we want to rotate an image using CSS. And let's see what we get with this search query.
174

175
00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:45.380
So we are getting some results from W3 Schools as well as MDN,
175

176
00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:49.970
and they seem to point towards something about transform, something about rotation.
176

177
00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:55.130
So I tend to prefer the MDN docs, so let's just take a look at what they talk about.
177

178
00:15:55.640 --> 00:16:01.070
And you can see that there is a CSS function called rotation.
178

179
00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:07.120
Now we haven't really spoken much about functions, but we will do in the next section when we cover Javascript.
179

180
00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:13.130
But for now let's just see what we can do using this rotate function.
180

181
00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:22.010
So they've got a very simple bit of CSS code here, where they’re changing a transform property by using
181

182
00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:23.160
the rotate function,
182

183
00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:30.200
and then you specify the degree, the amount, that you want to rotate your element by, and you can see, in this
183

184
00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:37.010
case, the pink one, which is what this targets, is rotated 45 degrees to the right.
184

185
00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:43.200
So let's just open this in Code Pen and have a mess around with it to fully understand what is happening.
185

186
00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:45.700
So let's take a look at the CSS section.
186

187
00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:50.920
So we've got this div which is normal, which nothing really changed about it.
187

188
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:58.170
And then we've got this div called rotated, with the class of rotated, which is what we are editing here.
188

189
00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:04.970
And what we've changed is the transform property using the rotate function and we're specifying 45 degrees.
189

190
00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:08.570
So when it's positive it rotates by 45 degrees to the right.
190

191
00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:14.170
If it's negative it rotates by 45 degrees to the left or rather anti-clockwise.
191

192
00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:22.980
And, as you expect, 90 degrees is 90 degrees right rotation, 180 degrees is 180 degrees clockwise rotation.
192

193
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:29.390
So this seems pretty simple and we can probably figure out how we can use this to achieve what we want
193

194
00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:32.190
which is something like this.
194

195
00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:38.160
So let's go into our CSS, and we're again targeting the title image in this case.
195

196
00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:44.780
We're going to use what we just learned which is changing the transform property to use the rotate function
196

197
00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:51.250
and we're going to specify how much we are going to rotate by. Now, with repeat sort of experimentation,
197

198
00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:53.690
changing this number a few times,
198

199
00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:57.240
I found that 25 degrees tends to work quite well.
199

200
00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:05.710
So, if you add 25 degrees in the positive and you refresh, you can see that we've now got that
200

201
00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:08.710
lovely right sided rotation.
201

202
00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:12.100
So we are almost done here.
202

203
00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:17.560
The last thing that I want to do is just do a final sort of sense check,
203

204
00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:23.800
looking at this layout and seeing if we're happy with how it looks, and the one last thing that's a little
204

205
00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:31.900
bit niggling for me is that this title is kind of competing with this navbar-brand.
205

206
00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:38.020
And whenever you're designing web sites you want to think about what is the first thing that you want
206

207
00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:39.270
the user to look at.
207

208
00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:45.040
You want to establish some sort of visual hierarchy and you can do that using size or you can do that
208

209
00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:46.680
using weight,
209

210
00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:53.260
so font weight, or you can do that using highlighting or outlining, a whole bunch of things, basically.
210

211
00:18:53.680 --> 00:19:01.300
And, in this case, even though this one has a much higher font weight than the navbar-brand, it’s kind of competing
211

212
00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:04.260
with it because it's about the same size.
212

213
00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:11.440
So let's just increase the title text size just by a smidge, and I'll show you the difference.
213

214
00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:21.180
So let's go ahead and change that font size from 3rem to maybe, say, 3.5rem, and let me show you what
214

215
00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:23.100
happens when I refresh.
215

216
00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:29.370
You can see now, on this web site, it's pretty obvious that the biggest boldest thing is this heading
216

217
00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:36.270
here, and it's pretty much guaranteed that if you get a user to load up this web site, the first thing
217

218
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:41.670
that their eyes will be drawn to is this biggest boldest title and that's exactly what we want.
218

219
00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:45.100
We want them to immediately know what our product is about.
219

220
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:52.170
And then the second most important thing should be maybe the download button which are highlighted and
220

221
00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:57.930
outlined for them to start taking action. And then maybe the third most important thing is for them to
221

222
00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:03.060
know what our company is and what other things they can explore over here.
222

223
00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:10.330
So now that we have more or less finished styling our title section of our page, in the next lesson we’re 
223

224
00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:15.200
going to move further down and continue with the other sections.
224

225
00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:19.160
So, for all of that and more, I’ll see you on the next lesson.
