Hi guys.
1

2
00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:02.370
Welcome back.
2

3
00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:10.230
This is Angela from The App Brewery, and it's a new day, which means that it's time for a new project.
3

4
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.940
So in the coming lessons, we're going to be building something really exciting, at least
4

5
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.150
I'm really excited to build it with you.
5

6
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:24.360
So far none of our web apps that we have built have been deployed, and none of them have really been
6

7
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.940
all that exciting to deploy,
7

8
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.970
to be honest. But everything is going to change for the next project.
8

9
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.120
So the web app that we're going to be building is a newsletter app. So I'm probably signed up to far
9

10
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.740
too many newsletters, but some of them are real gems, and I really enjoy reading them.
10

11
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:47.190
So if you are somebody who wants to set up your own newsletter, where you want to email people who are
11

12
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.990
interested in hearing from you, well, then you need a sign up page, right?
12

13
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.840
So this is what we're going to be building.
13

14
00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.690
It's a single page web site that looks pretty nice, and on the front end it looks incredibly simple, but
14

15
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:07.470
on the backend it's got some powerful functionality that will allow you to sign people up to your mailing
15

16
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.040
list.
16

17
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.340
So let's give it a go.
17

18
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.340
Let's try,
18

19
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.820
say, let's say that Jack Bauer wanted to sign up to my mailing list.
19

20
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:23.910
Now once I click sign up, if it was successful then I get taken to the success page, and if it wasn't
20

21
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.460
then I will get a failure page.
21

22
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:33.120
So now, finally, we were successful, and the data that we entered into that collection box doesn't just
22

23
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.870
disappear.
23

24
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:43.170
No. It gets sent to our list on MailChimp, and all of that data gets added into our list, and our new subscriber
24

25
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.570
gets added.
25

26
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:50.910
So that means now you can go ahead and send your newsletters, or your email campaigns, to your subscribers,
26

27
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.350
and this list will build up as more and more people subscribe to your newsletter.
27

28
00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:02.000
So the special part of this web site is that, if you look at up here, that is not a localhost anymore.
28

29
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.490
This is an actual HTTPS web site, and you can include this URL in your socials, on Facebook,
29

30
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.140
Instagram.
30

31
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.920
And anybody can access this, because it's now on the World Wide Web.
31

32
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.940
So this is going to be a really cool and really useful web site
32

33
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:25.020
by the time that you've finished making it, and it's all down to this integration with MailChimp. And
33

34
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:31.350
we're going to explore how to work with their APIs, and how to post data and communicate with their server
34

35
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.780
in order to send them pieces of data that we want them to hold on to.
35

36
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.760
So I hope you're excited. Once you're ready,
36

37
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.260
letâ€™s head over to the next lesson.
