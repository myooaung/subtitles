1
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:00.890
All right.
1

2
00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:02.690
So how did that go?
2

3
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:09.090
Now I want you to really give this a good go before you come and check the solutions because this really
3

4
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.480
is how you're going to prove to yourself that you've actually internalized and learned all of this information
4

5
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.650
that we've been teaching you.
5

6
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.260
But once you have done and if you want to check the solution or you just want to fix a particular bug
6

7
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.480
or see how I did it then go ahead and continue watching.
7

8
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.820
So we first start off, this is the web site that we've got, and notice that it's already been styled and
8

9
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.290
it's already set up so that we can start writing Javascript.
9

10
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:44.010
Now there's just one problem. We currently don't have a Javascript file, so we're going to go into a project
10

11
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.180
and we're going to create a new file that's called index.js.
11

12
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:55.530
So now that we have our Javascript file, it's still not linked to our index.html. Just as we linked
12

13
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.200
up our style sheet in the CSS sections,
13

14
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:05.460
we have to link up our index.js. And the best place to do that is just before the end of the body.
14

15
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.820
So we're going to create a script tag that has an external source, and the source is going to be index.js.
15

16
00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:19.290
So now we can test this by simply writing an alert that says "Working!".
16

17
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.770
And now, if we reload our web site and we get our alert, then we know that our Javascript has been linked
17

18
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.690
up without any issues.
18

19
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.920
All right.
19

20
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.090
So that's step one.
20

21
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.730
Now the next thing we want to do is to place some images into our image elements by default,
21

22
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:43.450
so when our web site starts up it should have two images of the die six face already showing.
22

23
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.890
So we know that our images are located in a folder called images, and they're numbered dice1 through to
23

24
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.010
dice6.
24

25
00:01:51.150 --> 00:02:00.600
So we can simply change the src here to images/dice6.png, and we can do the same thing
25

26
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.530
over here.
26

27
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.070
And now if we hit save and refresh we've got some dice on the page.
27

28
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.280
Looking pretty good. All right.
28

29
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.610
So that's step two.
29

30
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:20.090
Now step three involves going into our index.js and generating some random numbers that we're going
30

31
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.410
to be using to select a random dice face.
31

32
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.040
So we first have to create a variable called randomNumber1,
32

33
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:37.760
and remember that to create a random number, we simply use the method Math.random, and this will generate
33

34
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.780
a number between 0 and 0.9999999 recurring.
34

35
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.670
So in our case we need a random number between 1 and 6.
35

36
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.380
So we need to multiply this random number that we get by 6.
36

37
00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:01.790
So if the random number was between 0 and 0.9, then we now have a number between 0 and 5. And
37

38
00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.060
we can't have that random number be a decimal number,
38

39
00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:12.000
so we need it to be a whole number. And we can do that by rounding it down using Math.floor.
39

40
00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.660
So remember that if at any point you're not quite sure what your code is doing, you can always just
40

41
00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.250
copy it and paste it into your console and just run it to see what the values are.
41

42
00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.950
So we're currently getting random numbers between 0 and 5.
42

43
00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:36.170
So to change that range from 0 to 5 to 1 to 6 all we need today is just to add one.
43

44
00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:44.610
So let's recap on this method. We're generating a random number between 0 and 0.99999.
44

45
00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.600
Then we're multiplying that number,
45

46
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:55.250
whatever it may be, by 6, in order to change it to between 0 and 5.99999.
46

47
00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.420
Then we're rounding that number down to the nearest whole number,
47

48
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.030
so it becomes between zero and five.
48

49
00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:11.390
And finally we're changing that range from between 0 and 5 to between 1 and 6 by simply adding 1 to
49

50
00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:12.040
the number.
50

51
00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:18.860
And you can verify each step of this code by simply testing it out inside the console.
51

52
00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:25.430
Now if any of this seem confusing then make sure that you go back to our lesson on randomization where
52

53
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.010
we talked about this in more detail.
53

54
00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:34.940
All right. So now we have a randomNumber1 which is going to give us a random number between 1 and
54

55
00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:43.160
6 and then we're going to use this random number to select a random dice image.
55

56
00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:50.120
So you might notice that our dice images are very handily named from dice1 through to dice6.
56

57
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:57.800
So we can simply use concatenation to add this number to the end of the string 'dice', and get our random
57

58
00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.910
dice image.
58

59
00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:06.780
So let's create a variable called randomDiceImage, and we can create this using concatenation.
59

60
00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:13.600
So we can say "dice" + randomNumber1 + ".png".
60

61
00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:20.400
So this will be a string that is from dice1.png through to dice6.png.
61

62
00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:29.080
So we can now use that string to change the source of our image to that random image name.
62

63
00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:34.760
So the next part is changing that attribute value for the source.
63

64
00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.210
So at the moment it's just a static image,
64

65
00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:43.700
it's always going to show dice6. But we're going to change this string based on the random number that
65

66
00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:44.680
we got back.
66

67
00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.740
So, in order to change it, we have to tap into the src attribute of our image element.
67

68
00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:58.580
So notice that the source is actually not just the name of the image but it also has the folder that
68

69
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.670
the images are contained in,
69

70
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:06.500
and that's because all of our dice images are nested inside this folder called images, which is how we
70

71
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.560
would normally organize our assets.
71

72
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:18.860
So in order to include that name we also have to add it by concatenation. So we can say var 
72

73
00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:24.860
randomImageSource = "images", which is the name of the folder,
73

74
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:32.160
notice that it's a plural, with an s, and then / + 
74

75
00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:34.190
randomDiceImage.
75

76
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.870
Now this step is optional, because you can also add it in here,
76

77
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:40.310
but I think it's just easier for you to see what's going on,
77

78
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.460
so I'm leaving it as a separate line here.
78

79
00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:49.390
So now what we'll get back inside this variable will be something like images/dice1.png
79

80
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:55.800
through to images/dice6.png.
80

81
00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:01.190
So now we're ready to change the src attribute of our image element.
81

82
00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:05.100
So do you remember how you can change the attributes of the elements?
82

83
00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:09.250
Well before we do anything we have to first select the element.
83

84
00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:17.780
So we'll say document.querySelectorAll, because we actually have two images that we need to change
84

85
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.430
rather than just selecting the first one.
85

86
00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:25.600
So we're going to use querySelectorAll, and we're going to select based on our img tag.
86

87
00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:32.480
So we're going to get two of these back and to tap into the first one we just have to specify the index
87

88
00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:34.610
0 inside a square bracket.
88

89
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:41.840
So now we can either assign this to a variable, say var image1 equals this document.querySelector
89

90
00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:47.200
image at index 0, or you can simply just continue along that same line.
90

91
00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.800
But let's make it easier to see
91

92
00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.260
by separating it all out.
92

93
00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:59.120
So now we've got image1, and we can now set its attribute by using the method setAttribute.
93

94
00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:06.200
Now, in this case, the first input in here has to be the attribute's name that you want to change.
94

95
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:11.010
And in our case the one that we want to change is the attribute called src.
95

96
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:13.290
So let's put that in there.
96

97
00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:18.310
And the second parameter, or the second input, is what we want to change it to.
97

98
00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:22.400
So we want to change it to our randomImageSource.
98

99
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:28.570
So we'll just put that variable in there, randomImageSource.
99

100
00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:35.540
So now if we hit save and we go back to our web site and we refresh it, then you can see that every time
100

101
00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:45.290
that we refresh the web site we get a new random dice showing up on the left, and it's going between dice1.png
101

102
00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:48.820
through to dice6.png.
102

103
00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:54.920
All right. So now we have to do exactly the same thing for the second image element.
103

104
00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:59.850
Now very often you will be tempted to copy and paste code.
104

105
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:06.620
And I just want you to hear my voice in your head whenever you do that to remember that it's probably
105

106
00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:14.180
better to just write out the code for extra coding practice, because when you copy and paste code, especially
106

107
00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:19.230
in a case like this, I will bet that you will probably get at least one or two bugs.
107

108
00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:21.860
So let's just write out our code instead.
108

109
00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:26.060
Now the first thing we need to create is a randomNumber2.
109

110
00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:28.710
And this is going to equal exactly the same thing
110

111
00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:29.650
Math.floor
111

112
00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:40.990
Math.random, multiply that by 6, and then add 1 to the value.
112

113
00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:46.700
So now we can use randomNumber2 to create the second random dice image.
113

114
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:50.850
So in this case I'm going to make it a little bit simpler and we can cut down on these two lines of
114

115
00:09:50.850 --> 00:10:07.890
code. So we can simply say var randomImageSource2 = "images/dice" + randomNumber2
115

116
00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:10.190
+ ".png".
116

117
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:16.980
So now we have our randomImageSource2. Then we can go ahead and perform the next two steps, which
117

118
00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:19.300
I'll combine into one line as well,
118

119
00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:20.690
so you can see how you can do it.
119

120
00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:28.380
So we're going to use document.querySelectorAll, and we're going to select our img element, and
120

121
00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:34.740
we're going to grab the second one in the array, so we're going to tap into the one at index 1.
121

122
00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:43.050
Now that we've gotten this element using these lines of code, we're going to set its attribute, and the
122

123
00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:49.710
attribute we're going to set is src, and the value we're going to set it to is randomImageSource2.
123

124
00:10:50.060 --> 00:11:00.770
So now if we hit save and we refresh, then you can see that both our dices are generating new random
124

125
00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:01.890
dice images.
125

126
00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:02.550
It's pretty neat,
126

127
00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:08.690
right? Now the next step we have to address is the title, and we're going to change the innerHTML
127

128
00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:13.770
of the title depending on what was the result of the dice roll.
128

129
00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:16.540
So we can use an if statement to do this.
129

130
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:25.010
We can say that if randomNumber1 was greater than randomNumber2, then in that case that means
130

131
00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:26.450
player 1 won.
131

132
00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:33.380
So we're going to tap into the h1 by saying document.querySelector, because in this case we only
132

133
00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:40.560
have one h1, and we're going to say .innerHTML equals,
133

134
00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.180
you can put whatever you want here,
134

135
00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:49.220
but I'm just going to say "Player 1 Wins!", and I'm going to add a emoji tag in here.
135

136
00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:55.370
So, on a Mac, if you wanted to add emojis then you can simply go into Edit, Emoji & Symbols, and on 
136

137
00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:58.520
Windows you can simply search for the flag emoji
137

138
00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:00.400
inside Google Chrome.
138

139
00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:05.120
So this is the case where if player 1 wins.
139

140
00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:13.610
So the next one is going to be an else if, and in this case this is, what if randomNumber2 was greater
140

141
00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:15.630
than randomNumber1?
141

142
00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:19.380
Then clearly that means that player 2 won.
142

143
00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:31.480
So we'll say document.querySelector("h1").innerHTML = "Player 2 Wins!".
143

144
00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:39.410
Now finally, the third scenario is, what if randomNumber1 actually equaled randomNumber2?
144

145
00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:40.560
Well, in that case
145

146
00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:51.830
we'll address it with an else statement, and we'll say document.querySelector("h1").innerHTML =
146

147
00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:56.080
"Draw!". Cool.
147

148
00:12:56.090 --> 00:13:02.560
So now if we hit save and we refresh our page then you can see that depending on the dice roll then
148

149
00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:08.000
we'll tell the user which player won, or whether there was a draw.
149

150
00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:13.700
So I hope you had fun with this challenge and it helped you to get to grips with a lot of the things
150

151
00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:17.100
that we've been learning in these past few lessons.
151

152
00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:22.760
Now of course, depending on how you wrote your code, it could have been a lot shorter or a lot longer, or you
152

153
00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:29.390
might have used different ways, like say getElementById, or getElementByTagName, instead of 
153

154
00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:31.490
querySelector or querySelectorAll.
154

155
00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:37.860
And of course if you wanted to refactor your code and make it a lot shorter then you can always do that.
155

156
00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:44.570
But always remember that there is a healthy balance between really short code and expressive code that
156

157
00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:47.290
anybody could understand when they came around.
157

158
00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:52.850
So I would say something like this is probably a little bit too long but I think it helps to see what's
158

159
00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:53.320
going on
159

160
00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:55.220
exactly every step of the way.
160

161
00:13:55.490 --> 00:14:04.070
Now if you were to go even more extreme and to say, you know, instead move this into here and then move
161

162
00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:06.980
this into here.
162

163
00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:13.280
Now this code will still work but having such a long line of code where everything is happening all
163

164
00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.460
in one place is a little bit much,
164

165
00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:20.700
and it makes it harder for anybody else who comes along to understand what's going on in your code.
165

166
00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:26.220
So I recommend aiming for that healthy balance and aiming to keep your code really really readable.
166

167
00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:31.310
Now in the next module we're going to be digging into some more intermediate parts of the Document Object
167

168
00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:38.260
Model, and we're going to see how we can respond to events such as button clicks and also keyboard strokes.
168

169
00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:41.320
So for all of that and more, I'll see you on the next lesson.
