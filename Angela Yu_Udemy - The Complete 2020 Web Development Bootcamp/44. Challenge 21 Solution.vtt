00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.540
So here's the final answer to the final challenge.
1

2
00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:11.680
We know that in order to be able to render that read more page, we need an anchor tag right?
2

3
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:17.660
If we were to add our anchor tag inside our home.ejs let's try and do it here.
3

4
00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.730
Let's add an anchor tag that simply says Read more.
4

5
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.180
And if I hit save and refresh then, you'll notice that I've got to read more
5

6
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.400
that shows up below my paragraph.
6

7
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.080
Now this might be what you want.
7

8
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.240
If so, then continue this way.
8

9
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:39.350
But if you wanted the read more to be on the same line as the paragraph tag, then you have to include
9

10
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.650
this anchor tag just before the end of the paragraph,
10

11
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.570
so somewhere here right?
11

12
00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.050
And so let's separate out our paragraph tag into its two components.
12

13
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.780
One is that truncated bit of post content and the second one is going to be our anchor tag that will
13

14
00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.520
take us to that post's individual page.
14

15
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:07.550
Now in order to do that, our anchor tag will need a link right? So will need an href. And the ref is going to
15

16
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.190
equal to the URL that will take us to the individual page.
16

17
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:19.370
Now we know that inside home.ejs we already have access to the post's title for each and every
17

18
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.260
post on the home page.
18

19
00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:28.430
We already have access to this and we also know that we've set up our routes so that if we say posts
19

20
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:36.300
/ and we simply put in the name all the titles, so say Day 1 with a space in between
20

21
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:43.790
so this looks exactly the same as the title and we hit enter, we'll get taken to the page of that blog
21

22
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.340
post.
22

23
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.580
That means that our href can simply be /posts/
23

24
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:59.970
the title of the post that we want to see. And to insert that we of course need our EJS tags, so angle
24

25
00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:08.380
percentage equals and then percentage angle. And in-between we're just going to put a post.title. And
25

26
00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.450
now we should be able to tap into that
26

27
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:16.770
URL /posts/the title of each and every post.
27

28
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:25.420
So now if I hit save and I refresh and I go back to my home page, then you can see I've now got this
28

29
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:33.750
Read more link next to each truncated post and when I click on it it shows me the individual pages of
29

30
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.880
the blog posts.
30

31
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.820
I hope you had fun in this challenge module.
31

32
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:44.160
I know it's pretty long but it goes through and re-affirms all of the things that we've learned up till
32

33
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.950
now.
33

34
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:52.800
And if you have completed this module without needing to look at a single hint or the answer, then you've
34

35
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.800
done really really well and you should be getting a gold star for your efforts and you can be pretty
35

36
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:05.180
confident that you've grasped all of the concepts up till now and you're ready to move on.
36

37
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:12.510
Now if you needed to look at a couple of the hints or if you needed to look at all the hints and even
37

38
00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.760
the chances, I would recommend to give you a mind
38

39
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.050
a few days break and then to go through the challenge once more with fresh eyes and try to complete
39

40
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.640
it without using any of the hints.
40

41
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:30.420
This really is where you are going to improve and where you're going to level up. And I recommend to
41

42
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:36.540
give it some time and be patient and try to make sure that you've really made all of this knowledge
42

43
00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.770
your own before you proceed.
43

44
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.000
So that's all from me and I look forward to seeing you in the next module.
