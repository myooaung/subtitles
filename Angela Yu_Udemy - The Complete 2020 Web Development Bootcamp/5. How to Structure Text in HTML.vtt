00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:06.390
So now that we understand how the HTML boilerplate works and what each line does in it it's time
1

2
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.280
to move into the body section and start giving our web site some content because at the moment our web
2

3
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.660
site is looking a little bit plain.
3

4
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.100
So if we have a look at Jon Kleinberg’s web site the first thing that we want right at the top here is
4

5
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.790
a level one heading that says our name.
5

6
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.360
So let's head back into Atom.
6

7
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:32.010
And as a challenge to you add a level one heading inside the body section of your web site that contains
7

8
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:37.910
your name.
8

9
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:45.260
So this one's easy and it's made even easier using the autocomplete features inside Atom.
9

10
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.390
All I have to write in order to create an h1 tag which is what's needed to create a level one heading
10

11
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:56.630
is I just have to write h1 and it makes a suggestion asking me, ‘Are you looking for a heading level
11

12
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:57.120
one?’
12

13
00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:05.570
And now if I hit enter or if I hit tab I get the h1 tag inserted automatically opened and closed for
13

14
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.620
me and my cursor gets moved right in between.
14

15
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.960
Exactly the place where I would need to start typing.
15

16
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:19.730
So now if I hit save and I head back over to my personal site and remember if you close down this tab
16

17
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.460
you can always go into your finder or your explorer to open it back up again or you can select the full file
17

18
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.600
path from Atom as well and paste it into here.
18

19
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:36.020
Now if I hit enter you can see my h1, my level one heading, gets shown up here just like Jon Kleinberg’s
19

20
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.940
and we're ready to move on to the next thing.
20

21
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.180
Now we want to have a line that shows our title so who it is that we are.
21

22
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.030
So let's head back to Atom and first I'm going to get rid of this little heart because it doesn't look
22

23
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:56.470
very professional and I'm going to add another HTML element under the h1.
23

24
00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:02.060
And this is a good point to talk about how to keep your HTML file neat and tidy.
24

25
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:09.470
Now most programmers are very serious about how to indent and structure their HTML files.
25

26
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:16.190
And the reason for it is because having these indents makes it easy for us to see at a glance which
26

27
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.830
tags are inside other ones.
27

28
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.660
So for example if we look at the top level here we've got the html tag.
28

29
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:30.410
And because both the head and the body tags are indented inside these html tags,
29

30
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:39.590
it shows us at a glance that the head is inside the html element as is the body but the body and
30

31
00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.760
the head, they’re at the same hierarchical level.
31

32
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.400
They're not inside of each other at all.
32

33
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:51.370
And this is a good structure for us to be able to see at a glance what's happening in our code.
33

34
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.540
And also when other programmers look at our code, because we're used to working with the same structure,
34

35
00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.620
it's easy to be able to understand what's going on at a glance.
35

36
00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:08.560
So you can see that there's one part of our code that breaks this rule and that's this line here.
36

37
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:17.090
Our h1 is contained inside our body element and so it should be indented like so.
37

38
00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:23.020
And you can clearly see that this is now a child or contained inside the body tag.
38

39
00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.140
Now if you didn't want to do that manually every single time.
39

40
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:33.370
Well we actually installed a package right at the beginning that helps us with this organization.
40

41
00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.320
It's our little housekeeper if you will.
41

42
00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:42.830
So if you go to packages and go to Atom Beautify and click on Beautify it will automatically beautify
42

43
00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:49.580
your entire code file to make all of the indents for you and to make everything look neat and tidy.
43

44
00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.340
So every so often once your code starts getting messy either learn the shortcut or go through it in
44

45
00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.500
the menu and reorganize your code file.
45

46
00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.350
It'll make it much easier on the eyes and much easier to read.
46

47
00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:06.360
So now I want to add my title under my h1 tag.
47

48
00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:15.830
And for this I'm going to use the p tag which is a paragraph tag and the p tag formats text into a paragraph.
48

49
00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.580
So they get a new line and the text inside gets grouped together into the same paragraph.
49

50
00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:23.890
So let's add my title here.
50

51
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.290
And now let's see what our changes look like.
51

52
00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:39.270
So remember again command S or control S to save and head back over to our site and command R or control
52

53
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.680
R to refresh or click this button to refresh and there we go.
53

54
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.400
There’s our brand new paragraph showing up.
54

55
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:53.810
Now if we look at Jon Kleinberg you can see that his title is italicized and ours is not.
55

56
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.750
So how can we make ours italicised as well?
56

57
00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.860
Well this is where our lessons, our documentation, is going to come in handy.
57

58
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:08.460
Let's go ahead and go to Google and see if you can find out how to italicize your text using HTML.
58

59
00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:22.150
So let's write italicize HTML MDN and let's hit enter and you'll see that there's actually two tags
59

60
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:27.690
that come up here and the first one that comes up is this one so let's have a look at it first.
60

61
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:35.720
Now this is the em or the emphasis element and it marks text that has a stress emphasis.
61

62
00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.150
Now it looks like this in practice.
62

63
00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.410
And the result is that it makes it look italicised.
63

64
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:49.240
Now you might have noticed back here we also had the i element or the i tag and it does the same
64

65
00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.310
thing visually.
65

66
00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:55.380
It also makes the text that's in between the i tags italicised.
66

67
00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.780
But there's a little bit of a difference here.
67

68
00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:59.800
And the difference is quite subtle.
68

69
00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:06.370
The emphasis tag tells the browser the words that are enclosed between it should be stressed or should
69

70
00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:11.670
be emphasized but the i tag only italicises the text.
70

71
00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:18.390
So it only styles the text to make it slanted and it doesn't confer any of that emphasis.
71

72
00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:25.120
And for this reason it's good practice to always use emphasis instead of italic because it conveys
72

73
00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.770
more information and it isn't just about the style.
73

74
00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:36.010
Remember when writing HTML code we're more concerned about structuring our text rather than caring
74

75
00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:38.840
about how it looks or how it appears.
75

76
00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:43.940
Now a similar pair is the b tag or the bold tag.
76

77
00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:48.640
And this is equivalent to the i tag, it makes any text that's in between
77

78
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:50.630
bolded, like so.
78

79
00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:55.010
But instead what you should be using is the strong tag.
79

80
00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:59.080
And that's because the strong tag again confers meaning.
80

81
00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:05.860
It says that this text has strong importance and therefore it's displayed in bold rather than merely
81

82
00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:11.700
saying that this should be styled so that it's darker than the rest of the text.
82

83
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:18.370
And if you're interested you can have a read between bold and strong as well as emphasis and strong as
83

84
00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:23.440
well as emphasis and italic. It makes for some interesting reading and gives you a bit more background
84

85
00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.320
information on the different between these two tags.
85

86
00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:30.790
But whenever you're looking to make something bold in your website you should probably be using the
86

87
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:31.620
strong tag.
87

88
00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:36.630
And whenever you want to make something italicized you should be using the emphasis tag.
88

89
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:45.630
So let's go ahead and make our paragraph, this title, italicized, or emphasized, like so.
89

90
00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:53.220
So, if you remember, all we have to do is just to enclose it inside the em tag.
90

91
00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:59.250
Now you can do that for the entire length of the text or you can simply apply it to just a section of
91

92
00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:00.090
the text.
92

93
00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:05.730
So for example if I wanted to make the part where it says The App Brewery bolded then I can simply add
93

94
00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:12.330
a strong tag and have The App Brewery, not including the full stop, inside the strong tag.
94

95
00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:20.010
Now if I hit save and go ahead and refresh then you can see that the entire paragraph is emphasized
95

96
00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:24.030
and The App Brewery is bolded.
96

97
00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:26.640
So we've done a little bit of formatting for our web site.
97

98
00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.340
Now let's move on to the next part.
98

99
00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:34.080
We're going to add a little bio here and that again is going to be inside a paragraph element and it
99

100
00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:39.390
just tells anybody who's visiting our personal site who we are and what we're all about.
100

101
00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:44.560
So once you are ready go ahead and figure out where you should add this and complete the challenge.
101

102
00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.500
OK so that wasn't so hard.
102

103
00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:50.570
All we have to do is just to indent.
103

104
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.230
So we're in the right position.
104

105
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:56.160
Inside the body tag we're going to create a new paragraph element.
105

106
00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:00.310
So this is going to be on a new line from this paragraph.
106

107
00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.360
They're going to be separate paragraphs.
107

108
00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:08.670
And here I'm going to write I am an iOS and WebDeveloper.
108

109
00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:17.280
I love coffee and brew my own beers.
109

110
00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.930
Let's save and check it out here.
110

111
00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:20.320
All right.
111

112
00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.150
Looks pretty good.
112

113
00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.760
And we're getting pretty far already.
113

114
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:28.460
So obviously you can put as much or as little as you want here and design your website however you want
114

115
00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:29.250
it to look.
115

116
00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:34.370
Now the next thing I want to add is this horizontal line and we've done that previously.
116

117
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:39.490
So you can go ahead and add that into your code file as a challenge.
117

118
00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:42.700
All right.
118

119
00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:44.210
So do you remember how to do that?
119

120
00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:49.120
Well all we need to do is we're still staying inside the body because we're creating the content for
120

121
00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:53.940
our web site and all we need to do is just to create a horizontal rule.
121

122
00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:59.860
So I'm going to use my good friend autosuggest, I'm going to write hr and hit enter to insert a new
122

123
00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:01.100
horizontal rule.
123

124
00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:03.920
And now it's looking pretty similar to what we've got here.
124

125
00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:10.300
Now the last thing I want to add is a subtitle where I'm going to list all the books and courses that
125

126
00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:11.680
I'm teaching.
126

127
00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:17.020
So go ahead and add a level three heading to your web site
127

128
00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:22.990
underneath the horizontal rule and call it Books and Teaching or if you don't have any Books and Teaching
128

129
00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:27.560
you can simply call it Education and list all the schools that you've attended.
129

130
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.500
So underneath the horizontal rule
130

131
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:42.490
I'm going to add an h3, so level 3 heading, and this is going to be the Books and Teaching.
131

132
00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:42.890
All right.
132

133
00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:47.050
So we've already got most of our personal site coded up. In the next lesson
133

134
00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:53.310
we’re going to be diving into HTML lists and how we can create these bullet points as well as numbered
134

135
00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:55.900
points and add it to our website.
135

136
00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:58.120
So all of that and more.
136

137
00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.890
I will see you on the next lesson.
