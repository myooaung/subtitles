00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.970
Now let's first take a look at all the things that you'll be making in this module.
1

2
00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:12.410
So one of the projects is a registration screen like this one, as well as a real time clock app,
2

3
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.930
in addition to a dictionary for emojis and a beautiful To-Do list.
3

4
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:24.350
But of course the big project that we're working towards is a app called Keeper which is a clone of
4

5
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:31.010
Google Keep so that whenever you have any new ideas then you can simply take a note and add it to your
5

6
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.650
own Keeper app. In order to be able to do this
6

7
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.660
you're going to be learning a lot of new technologies and tools and especially how to work with the
7

8
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:45.470
React framework including things such as JSX, Props, Components, Containers, how to work with the Virtual
8

9
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:51.500
DOM. But you're also going to be learning about state management and declarative programming including
9

10
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:58.220
the use of React hooks such as useState. And the other big thing about this module is that it's going
10

11
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.300
to teach you a lot of ES6 or ES2015 concepts.
11

12
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.140
So we're going to get deeper into JavaScript and we're going to learn about things such as destructuring,
12

13
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.280
the spread operator, map and filter, import export.
13

14
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.580
So as you can see, it's yet another jam packed module that's ready for you to learn.
14

15
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.300
And by the end of the module, you're going to be well versed in React and ready to build some beautiful
15

16
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.630
frontends using this wonderful framework.
16

17
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.810
I hope you're as excited as I am to get started.
17

18
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.650
Head over to the next lesson and let's start writing some React code right away.
