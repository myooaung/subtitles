00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:01.150
All right.
1

2
00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:07.040
So now that we've seen all of the places where we can include CSS in order to change the style of
2

3
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:14.740
our website then now is a good time to review the CSS syntax. And you hear this word syntax a lot
3

4
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:20.390
when you're dealing with programmers or programming and all that it refers to is just the grammar of
4

5
00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:21.860
the CSS language.
5

6
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.930
Just as in English we have grammatical rules which state where you should put commas, where you should
6

7
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.960
have full stops, which words need to be capitalized etc. etc.,
7

8
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.140
all programming languages also have their own particular syntax.
8

9
00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.290
So let's take a look at what CSS looks like.
9

10
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.990
Now the first thing that you'll see is the selector.
10

11
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:50.210
And this comes at the beginning of the CSS rule and then comes a pair of curly braces inside which
11

12
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:56.720
is where your CSS rules are going to reside and the rule will change the appearance of some property
12

13
00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:05.050
and give it a new value and each rule has to end with a semi-colon at the end and that is kind of equivalent 
13

14
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.490
to the full stops that we see in English sentences.
14

15
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.960
Essentially the selector is basically just the who.
15

16
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.180
So who is it that you want to modify in your web page.
16

17
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.510
Is it the h1?
17

18
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.590
Is it the paragraph tags?
18

19
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.100
Is it the image tags?
19

20
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:28.190
Whose style do you want to change and the next part is the property.
20

21
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.890
And this is the what. What about that h1
21

22
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.050
do you want to change?
22

23
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.520
Is it the background color?
23

24
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.770
Is it the text color? is it its position?
24

25
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:44.220
And finally we've got the value and that is the how.
25

26
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.750
So how do you want to change the background color of the h1.
26

27
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.390
Do you want it to be blue?
27

28
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.530
Do you want it to be red? And that's the value that you're going to give in order to change it.
28

29
00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.720
So whenever you get stuck thinking about CSS this is a good time point in the video to come back to
29

30
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.470
just to remind yourself.
30

31
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:10.150
what are each of the parts inside the CSS code that you are changing in order to affect the style.
31

32
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:17.270
So let's look at a real life example. Here I have a website that is dedicated to the true love of my
32

33
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:23.890
life which is bacon. And all that I've got in this website is an h1 for the
33

34
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:31.970
I Love Bacon heading and I've got three separate paragraphs that just say bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon which
34

35
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.560
is what I hear in my head
35

36
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.420
most of the time, especially around lunchtime which is right now, so ...
36

37
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:48.380
And finally I've got an image of a piece of bacon so if I decide to apply some CSS to my web site say
37

38
00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.110
let's change the h1’s  color to the color red.
38

39
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.460
Now in this case the who is of course the h1,
39

40
00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.400
that’s what I'm trying to select, and that's why it's called the selector, and the color of course is the
40

41
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.950
what and finally the how
41

42
00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.420
I'm going to change that color is the value which in this case is red.
42

43
00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:14.870
And by applying the CSS rule I end up changing the h1’s color property to red.
43

44
00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.840
Now let's take a look at that in real life.
44

45
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:25.730
If you look inside the resources of this lesson you will find a zip file called Bacon Fansite that
45

46
00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:32.810
you will be able to download and once you unzip it and extract the files inside you should find a folder
46

47
00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.770
called CSS - Bacon Fansite.
47

48
00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.630
Now inside this folder there is a html file called index.html and here
48

49
00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:49.530
I've already written a little bit of code in order to create the bare html bones of our bacon fansite.
49

50
00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:57.840
Now I knew that some of you guys might be vegan or vegetarian or pescatarian or whatever it may be.
50

51
00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:05.750
If my love of bacon offends you in any way then I am deeply apologetic and you can feel free to change
51

52
00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:13.310
or update this website to whatever it is that you worship like broccoli or spinach.
52

53
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.430
But my thing is bacon.
53

54
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.760
So here we go.
54

55
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.490
So here's the base web site.
55

56
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:28.540
And as the first challenge I want you to pause this video and create a new folder called CSS inside
56

57
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:35.590
which you will create a new file called styles.css and then you're going to link that file to
57

58
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.720
this current HTML file using an external link.
58

59
00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:45.040
So we're using external CSS. So pause the video and give it a go.
59

60
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.050
All right. That shouldn't have been too hard. If it was make sure you look at some of the previous videos
60

61
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.000
where we spoke about inline internal and external CSS.
61

62
00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:06.090
So the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to create a new folder inside our CSS - Bacon Fansite
62

63
00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.760
and I'm going to call it CSS. Inside the CSS folder
63

64
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.040
I'm going create a new file called styles.css
64

65
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:20.150
and now styles.css is inside a folder called
65

66
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:20.740
css
66

67
00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:24.540
and the same hierarchical level as index.html.
67

68
00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:33.310
So I can go inside the head of this Web site and I can insert a link that has a relationship of stylesheet
68

69
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.920
and the href is 
69

70
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.500
css/styles.css.
70

71
00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:46.000
So now if I hit save and I can just check to make sure that it's actually been linked up by tapping
71

72
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.710
into the body changing the background color which we've done before.
72

73
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.720
Let's just change it to red.
73

74
00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:54.690
Let's go ahead and save everything.
74

75
00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:55.730
Hit refresh.
75

76
00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.100
And we can verify that it's all linked up.
76

77
00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.250
It's all working.
77

78
00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:06.150
Now I don't really actually want to have a red background for my Bacon web site, seems a little bit
78

79
00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:07.470
too fanatical.
79

80
00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:13.020
But instead we're going to add that CSS rule that we saw earlier on where we changed the text color
80

81
00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.570
of the h1 to a red color.
81

82
00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:16.950
So first things first.
82

83
00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:18.710
Who am I trying to change.
83

84
00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.650
So of course it’s going to be the h1 in this case. We’re going to open a set of curly brackets.
84

85
00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.580
And then I'm going to add the property or the what.
85

86
00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.580
And in this case it's of course the color property.
86

87
00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.490
And I'm going to change its value to red.
87

88
00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:43.290
And of course remember that the CSS syntax requires that you close off the line with a semi-colon.
88

89
00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:50.650
Now all the parts that we've mentioned in the CSS syntax lines are really really important and sometimes
89

90
00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:56.030
you might forget or you might accidentally remove something and it will break the code.
90

91
00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.890
So let me show you what I mean.
91

92
00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:06.690
For example if we forgot to put in that then we can’t differentiate between the what and the how.
92

93
00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:11.750
And it’ll think that all of this is the what or the properties we want to change.
93

94
00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.380
So that doesn't work.
94

95
00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:23.220
And if you hit save then the Linter inside atom will actually give you this error saying it expected
95

96
00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.190
a colon on line 1 column 12.
96

97
00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:32.910
So you can see your lines and columns down here and you can see that currently we're on line 1 column
97

98
00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:36.840
11 so this is line 1 column 12.
98

99
00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:40.230
And this is where it expected a colon.
99

100
00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:48.660
Now with the colon if we refresh our web site you can see that it changed our h1 to have a red text
100

101
00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:49.230
color.
101

102
00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:56.410
But without that colon then you can see that it doesn't affect the style at all.
102

103
00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:59.460
It's not a valid CSS rule.
103

104
00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:08.110
So let's put that colon back in and let's go ahead and add another rule to modify our h1. Let's change
104

105
00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:14.380
the font size to something really really huge let's say 200 pixels.
105

106
00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:22.350
So let's hit save let's refresh and see we've got this massive title saying I love bacon.
106

107
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:27.850
So you can have more than one rule that's applied to the same selector.
107

108
00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:34.990
And very often you'll actually apply many many rules to the same selector and you can either have them
108

109
00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:39.910
in line but as you can imagine as you get more and more rules you're going to run out of space pretty
109

110
00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:40.780
quickly.
110

111
00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:47.370
So by convention most people write CSS with the selector, the open curly bracket,
111

112
00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:51.900
then each CSS rule will go onto a new line.
112

113
00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:57.400
And this way you can clearly see and make sure that each line ends with a semi-colon and each of the
113

114
00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:02.140
properties are separated from the values by a colon.
114

115
00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:08.590
Now there's another sort of best practice is that once you start getting a lot of these rules say you
115

116
00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:14.560
know 20 all in one paragraph then it starts getting hard finding them.
116

117
00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:22.440
So usually the best practice is to keep all of these rules in alphabetical order.
117

118
00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:30.460
And in fact if you put font size before color and you hit save Atom will actually give you a warning
118

119
00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:38.770
telling you that the Linter advises that the best practice is have all of your properties in alphabetical
119

120
00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:39.390
order.
120

121
00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:45.070
That way when you come to debugging or trying to figure out what's going wrong then it'll be much much
121

122
00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:49.070
easier to find each and every property that you're looking for.
122

123
00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:58.090
Now as you might have seen it's quite easy to find the who because we're just looking at the HTML element
123

124
00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:05.020
for example the h1 tag and we're simply ignoring the angle brackets of the tag and we're just picking
124

125
00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:10.110
up on the name of the HTML element to use as our selector.
125

126
00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:19.030
Now as a challenge I want you to change the background of this bacon image to red as well.
126

127
00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:25.770
So take a look at the index.html and implement your CSS code inside styles.css. So
127

128
00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:28.010
pause the video and give that a go.
128

129
00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:32.490
All right so how did that go.
129

130
00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:39.620
Now of course the easy part is the who in this case which is the image tag.
130

131
00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:46.280
And we're not including any of the other attributes like source or alt text etc., we're just interested
131

132
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:50.810
in that red part which is the name of the HTML element.
132

133
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:57.890
So we're going to go into our styles.css and we're going to and we're going to target our selector 
133

134
00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:05.190
which is of course the image tag. Now we're going to open a set of curly braces.
134

135
00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:10.850
And inside we're going to define our rule and the property that I wanted you to change for the image
135

136
00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:16.520
was its background color and we want to change it to red as well.
136

137
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:25.350
So let's hit save and hit refresh and you can see we've now got a bacon image that has a red background.
137

138
00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:35.930
Now at this point it seems easy to see how to find the who, right, the image or the p tag or the h1, whatever
138

139
00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:38.120
it is that you want to change,
139

140
00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:41.240
you simply use it as the selector inside
140

141
00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:43.070
your CSS code.
141

142
00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:47.440
Now what about the what or the properties.
142

143
00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:53.160
How do we know what keywords we can and can't use and what they will affect.
143

144
00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:55.290
Well you guessed it.

145
00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:59.020
This is where we go back to the Web Docs.
145

146
00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:05.960
So if you have a look on the MDN home page and you go to technologies and you go to CSS and then
146

147
00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:14.630
you go to their CSS reference you can see that it talks about the syntax but more importantly it has
147

148
00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:20.710
this entire directory of keywords which are effectively our properties.
148

149
00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:27.360
So these are the whats that we can change and you'll find everything that we've used so far.
149

150
00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:33.130
For example background color or font size or whatever it is that you're looking for.
150

151
00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:40.370
And these are all of the generic properties that you can change using CSS rules and if you click on
151

152
00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:46.910
each of them then it'll take you to a more detailed page where it shows you how you can implement the
152

153
00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:52.470
code and what different types of code will do for your styling.
153

154
00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:59.660
So have a play around with all of these different properties and see what other things you can do to
154

155
00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:02.710
make this Bacon Fansite look more
155

156
00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:07.580
the way that you want to do and once you're done I'll see you on the next lesson.
