All right here comes the answer to challenge
1

2
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.910
6.
2

3
00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:12.160
We know that on nav bar up here is where we need to change these links in order for it to work and take
3

4
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.140
us to the right routes.
4

5
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:21.400
Now the nav bar of course comes from our header file and that is what's being added at the top of our
5

6
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.470
home page.
6

7
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.370
So if we head over to our header.
7

8
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.120
ejs
8

9
00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.250
this is the place where we need to change something in order for all our links to work.
9

10
00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.890
And the something is of course these link elements.
10

11
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.680
So the first one should go to the root route in order to get to the home page.
11

12
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.670
The second one needs to be /about to get to the about route.
12

13
00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.870
And the third one needs to be changed to contact.
13

14
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:56.560
So now once we hit refresh, our links in our nav bar now take us to the correct routes. And when we click on
14

15
00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.540
contact us,
15

16
00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:04.660
we're actually making a get requests to /contact which gets call in our server and we render
16

17
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.070
the About page.
17

18
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.900
So I hope that was an easy challenge and you managed to complete it and you're ready to go on to challenge
18

19
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:13.670
7.
