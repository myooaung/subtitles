Hey guys. In this lesson I want to tackle this idea of state and introduce you to React
1

2
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:15,430
hooks as a way of being able to make our website interactive and actually have changeable state.
2

3
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,040
Go ahead and fork
3

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:22,210
the starting project for this lesson. And once you're done
4

5
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,010
have a look at what we've got here now.
5

6
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:32,120
Unlike our previous React apps, I've actually got all of my React code currently living inside my index
6

7
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:36,320
.js and there's a reason for this that you're going to discover very soon.
7

8
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,670
But inside our index.js
8

9
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,020
the code is very simple.
9

10
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:46,650
All that we're doing is rendering a single div that has an <h1> and a button contained inside it.
10

11
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:55,110
The idea is simple. How can we get this button to trigger an update in this number so that every time
11

12
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:00,480
the user presses on this plus button, this number actually goes up in value?
12

13
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,650
So let's think about how we might approach this.
13

14
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,430
Well firstly, this <h1> has a hardcoded value in it.
14

15
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:09,970
So that's not going to work.
15

16
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:16,920
So let's go ahead and create a new variable called count and let's set it equal to zero and then we'll
16

17
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,480
replace this hardcoded value with this variable count.
17

18
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,200
Nothing has changed so far in the user interface.
18

19
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:30,540
Now the next thing we need to do is to be able to trigger some piece of code to happen whenever this button
19

20
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,340
is clicked.
20

21
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:39,930
So we know from our HTML that all of our button elements have a attribute called onClick. And we
21

22
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:46,920
can set that to equal some sort of function to be triggered when this button receives a click action.
22

23
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:53,610
Now we know that when we're creating React components that all of these HTML elements and their attributes
23

24
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:56,390
gets converted into camel case,
24

25
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:04,270
so something like this. So we can in fact set this onClick attribute to a function in our code.
25

26
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:10,980
So let me create a function called increase and all that I'm going to put inside is just a simple log
26

27
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:20,120
statement saying, 'I got clicked.' And now in our onClick I'm going to add a set of curly braces and assign
27

28
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,060
it that function.
28

29
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:28,820
Now what should happen is when I click this plus button, then it should call this function increase and
29

30
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:32,420
it should log this message and indeed it does.
30

31
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:38,290
If you look inside the console I get a new message being logged every time I press this button.
31

32
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:44,060
So our code is working. But how can we increase the count that's being shown here?
32

33
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:50,450
Well one way you might think of doing this is to simply just write count++
33

34
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:56,270
and this should increase the value of count every time the function increase is called.
34

35
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:58,100
And indeed it does.
35

36
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:02,760
Let's go ahead and log the value of count inside the increase function
36

37
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:07,610
and then I'm going to click on the plus button. And you can see that in the console which is logging
37

38
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:10,630
the value of count, it is indeed increasing by 1
38

39
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,790
each time I press the button. But our user interface is not changing at all.
39

40
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:17,780
Nothing is happening.
40

41
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,580
It looks dead to me.
41

42
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,900
So what's going on here?
42

43
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:27,710
Well remember that even though we're writing HTML elements, they're not actually real elements right?
43

44
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:35,150
We're relying on the ReactDOM to actually render each of these elements onto the screen.
44

45
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:41,840
So if we wanted to update what's on screen we actually have to re-render all of this.
45

46
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:49,070
So if we wanted this to update, one way of doing this instead of console logging would be to call React
46

47
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:54,870
DOM.render all over again inside our function.
47

48
00:03:54,890 --> 00:04:02,270
Now if I hit save and I click the plus button, you can see that it does indeed work.
48

49
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:09,260
And every time I press this button effectively what it's doing is re-rendering everything that's on
49

50
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:13,670
screen which is our div and our <h1> and our button.
50

51
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,080
And this is kind of inefficient
51

52
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:16,630
right?
52

53
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,280
And besides the code also looks terrible.
53

54
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,120
We have all of this repetition
54

55
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,650
that's not really doing anything for us.
55

56
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:27,700
So how do people actually solve this problem using React?
56

57
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:36,890
Well this is where hooks come in. And there's a hook code useState that is perfect for this situation.
57

58
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:45,400
But one of the rules for using hooks is that you must use a hook inside a functional component.
58

59
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:51,980
So we have to create a function that renders a component and then inside that function we can use hooks.
59

60
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:56,030
So let's go ahead and import our App.jsx
60

61
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:07,360
and move all of our code into our App.js. And then back in our index.js
61

62
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,080
all we need is our ReactDOM.render.
62

63
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:15,580
And then we're just rendering a simple app component.
63

64
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,050
So now we can focus on our app component.
64

65
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:25,870
And I'm going to just start off by wrapping everything inside a function which is called App so that
65

66
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:33,360
this gets rendered and instead of using ReactDOM.render and all of this document get element etc..
66

67
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:40,060
All I'm gonna do is just use the return statement so that this becomes the output of our app component
67

68
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:43,830
and it gets created on screen which you can see right here.
68

69
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:50,290
Now I'm gonna delete all of this repeated ReactDOM code and you should be left with something that
69

70
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:51,480
looks like this.
70

71
00:05:53,400 --> 00:06:01,590
Now inside our app component instead of using this count, I'm going to create a new constant that I'm
71

72
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:06,830
going to call state and I'm going to set the state to React.
72

73
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:10,770
useState which is a function.
73

74
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:18,240
Now this useState function comes from the React module so I can either call it like this or as you've
74

75
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,840
seen from the import and export lesson
75

76
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:29,760
we can also just add a comma and then a set of curly braces and import that use state function as a
76

77
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,760
non default export.
77

78
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:37,730
So now instead of saying React.useState I can simply just write useState whenever I need it.
78

79
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,360
Now what is this use
79

80
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:39,910
State
80

81
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:40,590
exactly
81

82
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:48,890
anyways? So I'm going to go ahead and comment out my count and also I'm going to delete the count that
82

83
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:57,140
currently lives inside my <h1> so that I get rid of my errors. And instead I'm just going to log what this
83

84
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:00,490
state is actually equal to.
84

85
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:06,200
Notice how state holds the return value of this function useState.
85

86
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:13,910
And if I log it you can see it's comprised of an array with two items. The first item seems to be undefined
86

87
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,660
and the second item is some sort of function.
87

88
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,040
If I go ahead and add a value in here let's say 0
88

89
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,840
and again my console log gets triggered,
89

90
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:30,000
you can see the first value of my array gets replaced with whatever it is that I put in here.
90

91
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:38,600
What's inside these parentheses is basically our starting state and if we wanted to get hold of this
91

92
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:46,570
value through this state we can simply say state and [0].
92

93
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:51,530
So that gets hold of the initial value that we put into this function.
93

94
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,450
And of course now we can then use this state inside our React component.
94

95
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:02,960
So I'm going to replace that hardcoded 0 once more but this time I'm going to tap into this new array
95

96
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:09,330
called state and get hold of the first value. And you can see it's now being displayed on screen.
96

97
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:16,550
And whenever I change my state, you'll see it update automatically in our <h1>.
97

98
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:23,120
So effectively we're telling this h<1> to track the value of our state.
98

99
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:31,270
And whenever the state updates then it should also re-render this <h1>. This way
99

100
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:38,030
it's way more efficient than us calling ReactDOM.render and it only updates the parts that need to
100

101
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:41,320
be changed, such as this <h1>.
101

102
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:49,520
Now because the output of useState is an array we're forced to write code like this. If we want to get
102

103
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:56,630
hold of the first item out of that array, we're using this square bracket notation which is very ugly
103

104
00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:02,740
because it has no meaning. At some point down the line we're going to forget what state zero is and it's
104

105
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:06,230
gonna be hard to debug other issues when they come up.
105

106
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,910
Now in JavaScript
106

107
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:08,420
ES6
107

108
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:17,570
there's this concept called destructuring and what it allows you to do is to destructure a complex structure.
108

109
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:23,090
So the complex things in JavaScript are objects and arrays.
109

110
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:28,040
Let's say that I had a constant which was a rgb color
110

111
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,610
right?
111

112
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:32,160
And it was an array comprised of three values.
112

113
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:38,420
If we head over to flatuicolors.com which is a really nice color palette where you can simply
113

114
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:44,300
just copy these color values, let's change the color to the rgb format,
114

115
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:50,260
so red green blue. And let's just copy this electron blue color.
115

116
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:58,070
Now if I go ahead and paste this here, you can see that this color is comprised of three elements, the
116

117
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,650
amount of red, the amount of green and the amount of blue.
117

118
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:10,640
Let me go ahead and add this inside my array. If I wanted to access the amount of red or green or blue,
118

119
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:20,420
I would have to log something like rgb at index 0 for the amount of red or one for the amounts of
119

120
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,090
green etc..
120

121
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:27,020
And this is really bad code because it doesn't mean anything at all.
121

122
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:34,100
And if this code was separated from where the rgb array was declared and you just saw this out of the
122

123
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,110
blue, I mean what does that even mean
123

124
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:36,860
right?
124

125
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,540
What can we do instead?
125

126
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:47,780
Well we can destructure this array so that instead of having this name rgb, we can use a set of square
126

127
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,450
brackets.
127

128
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:54,280
Remember that we're working with an array and arrays are declared using square brackets
128

129
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:01,250
so we also deconstruct them using a square bracket. And then we can provide some names for each of the
129

130
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:05,570
elements inside the array ordered by their positions.
130

131
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:09,980
So I could call the item at index 1 red, the next one
131

132
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,670
green and the last one blue.
132

133
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,070
And what's going to happen behind the scenes
133

134
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:21,130
is this variable name red is going to be mapped to this first value,
134

135
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,750
green is going to remap to the second value
135

136
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,630
and blue is going to be mapped to the third value.
136

137
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:34,510
So now if I simply just log the value of blue, you can see that third value gets outputed.
137

138
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:43,420
So given that we know that this useState function outputs an array with a value and a function,
138

139
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:48,670
then we can give each of these a name instead of just calling it state.
139

140
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:52,240
So let's open up a set of square brackets
140

141
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,640
and given that we're going to be using this state to hold the value of our counter, I'm going to give
141

142
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:02,440
the first item of the array a name which is called count.
142

143
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:10,570
So now whenever I want to access the value that's stored inside the state, all I have to do instead of
143

144
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:17,360
saying state at position 0 I can simply just happen to count and it does the same thing.
144

145
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:24,490
It gets hold of the output of this function, which is an array with two items and because we've only
145

146
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:31,420
got one name specified in our destructuring, it assigns this name to the first value which is the initial
146

147
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,010
value.
147

148
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:37,750
So how do we use this useState hook to update its value?
148

149
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:44,200
Because yeah it's great that we can change the initial value but how can we change it later on?
149

150
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:50,650
For example when we want to call increase. What's the equivalent of the count++?
150

151
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:57,900
Well remember that we mentioned that this array that gets returned from this function has two items.
151

152
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,510
The first one is a value
152

153
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:06,760
and the second one is a function. Well we can give that function a name. Let's call it setCount because
153

154
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,860
that's basically what it's going to do.
154

155
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:16,420
This is gonna be the function that's going to be used to update this value inside our state. Inside the
155

156
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,960
increase function
156

157
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:22,300
I'm going to call setCount and I'm gonna pass it a new value.
157

158
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,700
So let's say maybe 12.
158

159
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:32,050
So now let's track what's going to happen. First when my app loads up I call you state and I give it
159

160
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,630
an initial value.
160

161
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:40,900
This value gets stored inside this variable count and it gets rendered inside our <h1>.
161

162
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:48,280
Now when the user presses on this button and the onClick gets triggered, the increase function is activated.
162

163
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:55,870
And this increase function is going to call set count which is going to update the state of my count
163

164
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,050
variable and I'm setting it to equal 12.
164

165
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:04,530
Let's go ahead and take a look in our website. When we refresh
165

166
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:08,890
it starts out with this initial value for the count.
166

167
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:15,850
And then when I press the plus button, it gets set to whatever it is that I set it to inside the increase
167

168
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:16,870
function.
168

169
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:22,240
But notice how if I keep pressing this nothing happens. It's just going to keep resetting it to 12 which
169

170
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,970
is not very useful for a counter app.
170

171
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,170
What can we do instead?
171

172
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,920
Well let's set this count to 0 to begin with,
172

173
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:39,070
make it more like a counter. And then I'm going to set my count to the current value of count + 1.
173

174
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,710
So count + 1.
174

175
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:50,490
And now when I press this button we'll see that it just increases by 1 each time. As a challenge
175

176
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:58,840
go ahead and create another button down here and instead of increasing the value, you want it to decrease
176

177
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,950
the value.
177

178
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,960
So it should have a minus sign inside
178

179
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:06,870
and when you click on it, it should go the opposite way.
179

180
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,330
Pause the video now and see if you can complete this challenge
180

181
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:20,220
All right. So we've got an increase function that's tied to the plus button.
181

182
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:28,090
But we should probably also have a decrease function that's tied to the minus button.
182

183
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:34,830
Now when this button gets clicked we trigger the decrease function and inside here we are again going
183

184
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:40,880
to call setCount which is the function that's going to allow us to update the value of count.
184

185
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:44,760
And we're going to say count - 1.
185

186
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:50,300
So now if we update our website and we press the plus it goes up, we press the minus
186

187
00:15:50,310 --> 00:16:00,360
it goes down. And this is all achieved using the useState hook. To recap, in this lesson we're introducing
187

188
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:05,010
this concept of state in order to have interactivity in our app.
188

189
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:11,280
And what we're trying to achieve is for our website to be able to update dynamically reflecting the
189

190
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,930
updated state.
190

191
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:19,910
Now the state comes from this useState hook and this function comes from the React module.
191

192
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:27,630
Now when we first call this function, we get to define an initial value. And then we get to use this value
192

193
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:31,980
inside our destructed array which we called count.
193

194
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:39,750
So we're putting that value of count inside our <h1> and then we get to trigger the set count which
194

195
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:43,570
is the function that's going to update the value of count.
195

196
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:50,220
And we do that when the user clicks on our plus button. And we set it to the current value of count +
196

197
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,090
1,
197

198
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:55,500
so it increases it by 1 each time.
198

199
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:01,620
Now the idea of hooks might be quite unfamiliar to you but once you wrap your head around its mechanism
199

200
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:08,800
it's incredibly powerful and really useful when you want to create any sort of interactive app.
200

201
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:13,320
Now don't worry if you're still trying to get to grips with this concept because it's something that
201

202
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:20,190
is quite foreign and I recommend as a first step to simply delete all of the code that you have in your
202

203
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:27,600
code sandbox right now and then to recreate this app from scratch yourself. So delete everything that's
203

204
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:35,190
inside App.js and refresh yourself just simply on the syntax to begin with because it looks pretty
204

205
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:42,060
weird. And in the next lesson I've got a another challenge for you to implement this use
205

206
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:42,940
State hook.
206

207
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:45,420
So you're going to be getting plenty of practice
207

208
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,320
and we're also going to be talking about destructuring a little bit later on as well.
208

209
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:55,950
For now what I want you to do is just to get familiar with the syntax. Be able to write this code from
209

210
00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:01,710
scratch yourself without looking at the video and be able to understand how we actually got here in
210

211
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:02,940
the first place.
211

212
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:08,570
So pause the video now, have a play around with the sandbox and I'll see you on the next lesson for a challenge.
