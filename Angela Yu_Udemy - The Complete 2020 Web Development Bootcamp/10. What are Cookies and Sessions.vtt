00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:01.870
All right.
1

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.390
Onwards and upwards.
2

3
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.550
We're now on level 5 authentication
3

4
00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.660
and in this lesson we're going to talk all about cookies and sessions.
4

5
00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.830
Now just a word of warning here, during the lesson
5

6
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:20.080
if you continue watching you may start to feel that you get a little bit hungry.
6

7
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:26.170
So don't blame me if I've just completely derailed your diet plan because in this lesson we're going
7

8
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.910
to talk all about cookies and their yummy goodness.
8

9
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:36.730
Not really. The type of cookies that we're talking about that relate the Web Development are more similar
9

10
00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:44.770
to fortune cookies because they have a message that's packaged inside and you can pass these around
10

11
00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.450
and they can be broken to reveal the message.
11

12
00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.250
So you've probably come across cookies before. But if you haven't,
12

13
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.100
I just want to show you how it works in practice.
13

14
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.030
So let's say we go onto Amazon and we search for the switch
14

15
00:00:59.050 --> 00:00:59.370
right?
15

16
00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:06.140
The Nintendo switch. And we decide to go ahead and add it to basket.
16

17
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.770
So now when we look inside our basket you can see we have one item, the switch right?
17

18
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.410
And then we're going to do something that all e-commerce sites hate.
18

19
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.760
We're going to go and navigate away and abandon our shopping cart.
19

20
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:30.170
Now this to any e-commerce website is a real crime because the user obviously wanted to buy something
20

21
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.800
but then at some point they got distracted by something else abandoning their cart without checking
21

22
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:36.340
out.
22

23
00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.560
So what does Amazon do?
23

24
00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:47.260
Well as soon as you added that item to the cart, Amazon has created a cookie and it stored that cookie
24

25
00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.410
on your browser.
25

26
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.970
So how do we go and view that cookie?
26

27
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:58.680
Well inside chrome if you go to settings and you search for "cookie", if you scroll right to the bottom
27

28
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.650
it shows you that there's something relating to cookies inside content settings.
28

29
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.900
So if we go over there and we click on cookies, you can see there's this option to see all cookies and
29

30
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:18.000
site data. And now you can see that Amazon has not added just one cookie just by doing that very small
30

31
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.110
act of adding a Nintendo switch to an Amazon basket
31

32
00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:29.370
Amazon has told our browser to save all sorts of information about ourselves. And if we click on amazon.
32

33
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:36.240
co.uk, you can see there's the session-token the session-id, and these cookies don't necessarily
33

34
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.460
contain any actual information
34

35
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:46.170
say this user wanted to buy a Nintendo switch but what they do contain is an ID number. And this ID
35

36
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:53.460
will be used to fetch all of those things that you added to your cart during this browsing session on
36

37
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.720
Amazon.
37

38
00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:03.330
And this is why if you decide to go and close down your browser and you open it back up and let's head
38

39
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:09.930
back to amazon.co.uk you can see that my switch is still inside the basket.
39

40
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.070
So they haven't forgotten this.
40

41
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.940
So that means the next time I go on to Amazon that Nintendo switch is still going to be in my shopping
41

42
00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:18.470
basket.
42

43
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:28.050
However if we go into those cookies for Amazon and we go ahead and delete it.
43

44
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.840
So let's go back to see all
44

45
00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.530
cookies and site data
45

46
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:37.770
we find the one that is directly related to Amazon and we remove all of these.
46

47
00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:45.080
Now if we go and refresh this website you can see we forced it to forget our last browsing session
47

48
00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.640
and it doesn't know about that Nintendo switch anymore.
48

49
00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:53.240
Now on the internet cookies are used widely to save these browsing sessions
49

50
00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.100
and it goes beyond just saving your last actions on the website.
50

51
00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:06.050
When Amazon adds those cookies to my browser it also means that when I go and visit another website say
51

52
00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:14.810
if I go onto Facebook then it knows who I am and what items I wanted to buy on Amazon. And it'll try to
52

53
00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.050
remind me of that thing that I wanted to buy on Amazon.
53

54
00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.660
And it's kind of creepy but this is essentially how retargeting ads work.
54

55
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:31.910
Once a user comes your website initiates some sort of buying behavior and then they decide to abandon
55

56
00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:38.570
cart, you save what it is that they wanted and then on other websites or when they come back onto your
56

57
00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.410
website you remind them about that thing that they wanted to buy.
57

58
00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.710
And this is all done through cookies and sessions.
58

59
00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:52.760
So if we review this from a web development point of view it means that say on day 1 when I go into
59

60
00:04:52.760 --> 00:05:01.310
Chrome and I type in amazon.com, my browser will make a get request to Amazon server requesting for
60

61
00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:09.440
their home page. Amazon server will then respond to that request and send over the HTML, CSS and JavaScript
61

62
00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.820
files that are needed for my browser to be able to render the Amazon website.
62

63
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.570
And then let's say that we decided to add a computer to our cart,
63

64
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:24.950
well that is equivalent to making a post request to Amazon server saying that I would like to buy a
64

65
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:25.810
computer
65

66
00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:26.550
right?
66

67
00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:33.240
And it's at this moment in time when Amazon servers will create a cookie that contains that data,
67

68
00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:41.390
"This user wanted to buy a computer." And when it responds to the post request that cookie gets sent along
68

69
00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.140
and the browser gets told to save that cookie.
69

70
00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:51.330
So that means that if I now get distracted and I decide to go onto Facebook or whatever it may be.
70

71
00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.530
But if I come back tomorrow
71

72
00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.290
that cookie is still saved on my browser.
72

73
00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:04.730
So the next time that I make a get request to Amazon server, that cookie gets sent along with my get
73

74
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:12.920
request to allow the server to be able to identify who I am and see if I had any previous sessions on
74

75
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.820
Amazon.
75

76
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:18.190
And it's the equivalent of cracking open that fortune cookie revealing
76

77
00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.920
what were the previous things that I wanted to buy,
77

78
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:26.540
so in this case it was a computer. And then they could respond with the HTML, CSS, Javascript
78

79
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:33.250
and also render my cart so that the computer is already added in the cart.
79

80
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:38.090
So there are lots of different types of cookies but the types of cookies that we're going to be looking
80

81
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:42.840
at are the ones that are used to establish and maintain a session.
81

82
00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:48.500
Now a session is a period of time when a browser interacts with a server.
82

83
00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:54.650
So usually when you log into a website that's when your session starts and that's when your fortune
83

84
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:55.880
cookie gets created.
84

85
00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:01.550
And inside that fortune cookie you'll have your user credentials that says this user is logged in and
85

86
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:03.870
has been successfully authenticated.
86

87
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:09.630
So that means as you continue to browse the website you won't be asked to login again when you try
87

88
00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:15.410
to access a page that requires authentication because they can always check against that active cookie
88

89
00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:22.160
that you have on your browser and it maintains your authentication for this browsing session until
89

90
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:29.360
the point when you log out which is when this session ends and the cookie that's related to the session
90

91
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:30.810
gets destroyed.
91

92
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:37.970
So we're going to be implementing cookies and sessions into our website and we're going to be doing
92

93
00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:40.880
it using something called Passport.
93

94
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:47.520
Now if you're good on Node.js and authentication it's almost impossible to not mention Passport.
94

95
00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:54.560
And it's something that's very very flexible and allows you to authenticate your users using either
95

96
00:07:54.560 --> 00:08:00.770
a local strategy like what we're doing right now which is username and password or use a whole bunch
96

97
00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:04.530
of other services such as Google, Facebook, LinkedIn Twitter.
97

98
00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:10.640
And it makes it a lot easier for you to be able to plug these different ways of authentication into
98

99
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:11.330
your website.
99

100
00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:18.080
So let's get started learning about Passport and learning about how we can implement cookies and sessions.
