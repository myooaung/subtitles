Hey guys. In this module I've got something a little bit different for you. Now, 
1

2
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:13,220
up till now we've been working on how to build websites that have great functionality and how to use
2

3
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:17,590
CSS, HTML, to build up the structure of the website.
3

4
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:24,680
Now today I want to talk about something a little bit different namely how to design websites so that
4

5
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:30,710
not only does your website have great functionality but it also looks beautiful.
5

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:37,910
The most important thing to making a website loved by users is pretty much the design.
6

7
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:39,010
After all, think about it.
7

8
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:43,600
When was the last time you heard somebody tell you, "Hey I came across this great website.
8

9
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,220
It worked really really well.
9

10
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,180
So smooth and no bugs."
10

11
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,000
Nobody ever says that right?
11

12
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:55,050
They say things like: "It looked so beautiful. It just worked like I wanted it to."
12

13
00:00:55,910 --> 00:01:02,570
So today we're going to talk about design and I want to show you some of the different aspects of design
13

14
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,450
when it comes to websites.
14

15
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,340
Now more often than not, you've heard the saying right?
15

16
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:10,260
"Don't judge a book by its cover."
16

17
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:16,250
Now at the same time, you might have also heard of this saying: "You only have three seconds to make a
17

18
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,770
good impression."
18

19
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,400
Now when it comes to web design, the latter is probably more accurate.
19

20
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:30,290
It's just like a job interview or a first date, your website has a crucial few seconds before the user
20

21
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,720
is going to judge your company, your brand, your product.
21

22
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,820
So take a look at this example.
22

23
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:43,930
This is a website called Penny juice and it's a company that sells children's juice cartons.
23

24
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:52,880
Now look at the design of it. There's clashing colors, there's different typefaces, there's different colors
24

25
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,980
for the text and they have different fonts and it's all, to be honest, a bit of a mess.
25

26
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:02,300
So this is a question I often ask students at this point.
26

27
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:08,250
Take a look at this website and ask yourself if you were to buy a product from this company,
27

28
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:12,200
if you were to buy a carton of juice, how much would you pay for it?
28

29
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,920
Now take a look at this website.
29

30
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,990
This is the same website reimagined by a professional web designer.
30

31
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:28,100
Look at how the color scheme is now consistent, how the fonts and the typefaces now look a lot better.
31

32
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:34,860
And ask yourself again, how much would you pay for a single carton of juice from this website.
32

33
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,740
Now I've asked this question to a number of people and this is the result I got.
33

34
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:46,570
People are willing to pay anywhere up to only a dollar for a carton of juice from the first wesite
34

35
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:51,150
but anywhere up to $3 for the second website.
35

36
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:57,480
Now I run a startup and a lot of friends and colleagues of mine also work on their own businesses.
36

37
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:02,630
And we usually spend a lot of time brainstorming, how can we make our product better,
37

38
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,930
how do we make our brand stronger.
38

39
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,600
And there's very very few things that we can think of that can actually produce a three times improvement
39

40
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,120
in the value of your product or in the value of your company.
40

41
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,660
So design is really really powerful.
41

42
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:24,980
It's one of the cheapest ways to make your company or your product look expensive because it's elevating.
42

43
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:30,820
And it doesn't take a lot to get good at design as you'll see in the coming lessons.
43

44
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:36,140
So we're going to be exploring some of the principles of web design in this module.
44

45
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:44,210
And I want to take you through everything from color theory to typography to user interface design and
45

46
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:46,330
user experience design.
46

47
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:51,020
These are the four pillars of good web design.
47

48
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:55,220
So once you are ready, head over to the next lesson and let's get started.
