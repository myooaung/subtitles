Hey.
1

2
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:04,710
Well done for completing yet another module.
2

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,180
This is really exciting.
3

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,940
You're getting really into the course now.
4

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,820
Now I want to share with you one of my ways for building a good habit.
5

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:20,860
Because if we think about it learning to code, it requires daily, almost constant effort, right?
6

7
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:28,320
Ideally if you could spend 100 days and you spent one hour a day learning to code or coding something
7

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:35,340
of your own, then you're going to become so much better than if you just, you know, did it one weekend and then forgot
8

9
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:35,740
about it,
9

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,500
right?
10

11
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:43,830
So the difference between these two scenarios is if you're able to build a habit, and once we have a
11

12
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,730
habit, you almost don't have to think about it anymore,
12

13
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,160
right?
13

14
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:52,180
You don't think about in the morning like do I want to brush my teeth or not.
14

15
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:53,510
I don't know.
15

16
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,860
Is it one of those days where I brush or not? You don't think about that because it's a habit.
16

17
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,810
You just wake up, and you just do it.
17

18
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:06,690
So how can you make coding, or learning to code, a habit?
18

19
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:15,270
One of the things that really helps me is to mark a line in my calendar, and I think this
19

20
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:20,510
is actually something that came from Jerry Seinfeld, like the comedian dude, where he said that every
20

21
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:30,270
day he writes a new joke, he puts a line through, you know, his calendar, and, by continuing that line, at some point
21

22
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:36,720
you're not going to want to break the chain, because it's like, “Man, I've done like a 10 day streak.
22

23
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,220
How hard is it just to do one more day?”
23

24
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:46,740
And I don't know if it's because I'm kind of OCD like I just like seeing things like completed.
24

25
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:53,220
I sometimes just write to do's in my to do list that I've already done which I haven't written in my
25

26
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,190
list but just to be able to tick it off.
26

27
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,420
Yeah yeah let me know if you can relate.
27

28
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,120
But if you even if you can't.
28

29
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:12,660
Most people actually benefit from continuing a streak and by about 30 days or 40 days that thing that
29

30
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:18,680
you have to constantly think about, like, “Do I have time today to code?
30

31
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:26,150
Do I want to do it?” That kind of just becomes a habit and you just know, “Oh, this is the time where I get
31

32
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:32,900
sat down and I start coding.” And it doesn't actually take that much motivation anymore. So try and give
32

33
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,750
this a go and see if that helps you.
33

34
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:39,050
But the most important thing is to just keep going.
34

35
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:44,720
I keep saying it but at the end of the day if you show up if you do the work then you're gonna get the
35

36
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,290
results.
36

37
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,950
So I'm here cheering for you.
37

38
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,480
I'm sure other people are.
38

39
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:52,090
I think you're doing great and you're going to do even better.
