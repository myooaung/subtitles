All right great job on reaching challenge 6.
1

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:11.020
We're almost halfway. Now currently even though our website works when we navigate to the URL say
2

3
00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.670
/about or /contact.
3

4
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:19.880
But when you click on to any of the links in the nav bar, all they do is take us back to the home page.
4

5
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.240
They're not yet linked up to the correct pages. In order to complete this challenge
5

6
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:31.360
update the code so that when we click on these links in the nav bar they actually take us to the correct
6

7
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.680
pages.
7

8
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:38.170
So when I click on about, it should go to the About page and contact goes to a contact page. And a large
8

9
00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.550
part of the challenge is figuring out where to change this code.
9

10
00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.550
So pause the video now and try and complete this challenge.
10

11
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.880
All right.
11

12
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.950
So the hint for this challenge is if we think about on nav bar
12

13
00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:00.060
we've got some links up here and we want those links to go to the correct paths,
13

14
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.880
/about or/contact.
14

15
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:11.040
Now this nav bar comes from our header file. So that means the file that we need to edit in order to
15

16
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.780
change this is our header.
16

17
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.530
ejs.
17

18
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.080
That's more than enough of a hint for you to be able to complete this challenge and get our nav bar
18

19
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.780
working.
19

20
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.720
So pause the video now and try and give that challenge another go.
