00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:08,040
Now, so far we've talked about the three pillars of web design: Color Theory, Typography, User Interface
1

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:13,600
design and now I want to talk about the last pillar, User Experience design.
2

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:19,520
Now a lot of people often get confused about what exactly is UX or User Experience?
3

4
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:27,720
And one of the best ways I've heard it explained is through the story of the renovation of a college.
4

5
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:35,640
So this is a picture of Reed College in the US and let's just use it as our imaginary backdrop.
5

6
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,550
So this college decided that it needed to undergo serious renovation. Tearing down the buildings, building
6

7
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,500
new ones and completely reform the campus.
7

8
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:51,660
So they invited this well-known architect who is very respected in his field.
8

9
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,540
He came and he did a great job with all the buildings and the provost was really really happy.
9

10
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,240
He was like "This looks great."
10

11
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,710
But he had one question.
11

12
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:10,470
"Hey Mr. Architect. It seemed like you've just left lawn across the entire campus. Where are all the path that
12

13
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,090
people are going to walk on to get between the buildings?" At this point
13

14
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:20,810
the architect says "Don't worry. I'll come back in a year and all will be revealed."
14

15
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:28,320
So in a year the paths where people need to naturally walk becomes trotted down and the grass gets worn
15

16
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,540
down revealing these paths that people need.
16

17
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:37,790
And it's at this point when the architect actually lays down all the tiles and paves these paths.
17

18
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:43,230
So this is kind of the difference between user experience and design. Design
18

19
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:49,820
we often think of having an aesthetic, what we think looks good and enforcing that on the user.
19

20
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,000
Now user experience is meant to be invisible.
20

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,790
If you have a good experience with a website it's meant to be unobtrusive and it just lets you do your
21

22
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:05,490
thing and it feels like as if everything is easy and everything is effortless.
22

23
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,690
So this is what we're aiming for.
23

24
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:12,120
And in order to do that we have to think about again five things.
24

25
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:21,000
The first is simplicity. Keeping things simple is always better than making it more complex or more cluttered.
25

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,570
So this is a website called Sina and it's one of the biggest News websites in China.
26

27
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:33,320
Now every time I look at it though I get a headache because it is just so dense.
27

28
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:39,030
There are so many links and my brain gets overwhelmed and I say "Nope, can't do it."
28

29
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,270
So take a look at this alternative.
29

30
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,630
This is Monocle, which is also a News website.
30

31
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:51,510
But look at how they've managed to chop up the content, provides some interest for the eyes.
31

32
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:55,290
There's a little bit of dialogue, some images, some videos, a little bit of text.
32

33
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,330
It's never overwhelming.
33

34
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,960
And with that consistent color scheme and typography, it's really delightful to actually read rather
34

35
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:09,300
than this experience of sort of hurting your eyes with design.
35

36
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,720
This is a much nicer user experience because it's simple.
36

37
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:18,700
So whenever you're having to choose, should I make it more complex or should I make it more simple,
37

38
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:21,720
always try to pare it down.
38

39
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,710
The second point is consistency.
39

40
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:31,320
Keep your designs consistent but also keep the functionality of your product consistent.
40

41
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,140
So here's an example.
41

42
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:42,520
This is the webpage for Xfinity. Xfinity is a really big communications company in the US and they
42

43
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:48,130
are responsible for various things like providing TV and providing internet.
43

44
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:52,090
Here are three screenshots from various parts of their website.
44

45
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,440
One is their home page,
45

46
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,320
the second is their TV offerings and the last one is their News site.
46

47
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:04,420
And if you take a look at the top navigation bar not only do you see that they've changed up the design
47

48
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:08,360
of the navigation bar between the different parts of their website,
48

49
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:11,160
they also made it work a little bit differently.
49

50
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:15,460
The buttons are not all in the same place, the search bar moves around.
50

51
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:21,880
And that inconsistency means that a user is going to be confused when they go from one part of the website
51

52
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,850
to another, having to re-learn how to use your website.
52

53
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:31,210
If you think about the target audience of this company Xfinity, a lot of them are going to be a little
53

54
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,680
bit older right?
54

55
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,530
And having this inconsistent functionality and inconsistent design will really make those users have
55

56
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,440
a bad experience with this website.
56

57
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,270
Now the next thing to think about when you're designing your website is to take into account people's
57

58
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,770
reading patterns.
58

59
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:54,020
Now they've looked at how human eyes track a webpage and which parts they look at when they're browsing.
59

60
00:04:54,190 --> 00:05:00,580
And one of the most common reading patterns is what's called the F-pattern where the eye starts at the
60

61
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:05,370
top left of the corner and then it tracks the right and then it flips back again
61

62
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,360
browsing down the left gutter.
62

63
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:14,020
So you have often things like bullet points or pictures or icons, buttons, they're all on the left.
63

64
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:17,280
So you can design for this by using the F-layout.
64

65
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:24,490
So have the most important parts of your content on the left gutter, have the logo at the top and have
65

66
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,800
everything follow this pattern.
66

67
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,340
For example like this website for Bigcommerce.
67

68
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:35,560
See how the eye is being naturally accommodated going from left to right.
68

69
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:42,610
Now another really common pattern for reading is the Z-pattern where our eyes go from left to right and then
69

70
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:45,370
zigzagging down all the way the website.
70

71
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,670
Now this of course depends on the type of website.
71

72
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,540
So you have something that's more sparse with more video content or if somebody is trying to browse
72

73
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,440
a website a little bit faster,
73

74
00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:01,050
you see them using this layout. And this layout is used pretty famously in the Facebook website
74

75
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:05,520
using that Z-pattern to accommodate for people's natural reading pattern.
75

76
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,810
So have a think about this. Have a think about how people naturally looks at the page and place your
76

77
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:16,680
content in that pattern to make it easier for people who are using your website.
77

78
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:21,760
Now in today's day and age, it's really important to think about All Platform Design.
78

79
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:27,330
It's not enough anymore to just design a website that's meant to go into a desktop computer.
79

80
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,700
Instead you have to think about mobile as well.
80

81
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:37,990
So having a website that scales up nicely onto mobile, what we call mobile responsive, is really important.
81

82
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:45,070
You don't want a big website that's designed to take up a landscape kind of screen to be crammed into
82

83
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:45,860
a phone
83

84
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,700
that's actually more like a portrait shape.
84

85
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,110
This looks really bad.
85

86
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:55,500
It's very hard to read the individual links and, more often than not, my fingers are actually too big to tap
86

87
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,680
onto the length that I want.
87

88
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,700
So this is a really bad user experience.
88

89
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,220
Now this can happen the opposite way as well.
89

90
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:10,030
So a design that looks much better on mobile but then when it's rendered on a desktop with a wide kind
90

91
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:14,550
of screen, it doesn't use up enough of the screen real estate. For example,
91

92
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,270
this is the Facebook latest redesign of their website.
92

93
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:23,980
And you've got all of this empty space that's not being used at all and everything is crammed into the
93

94
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:24,750
middle.
94

95
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:31,260
This is not very efficient. So have a think about how you're using the available space and make sure
95

96
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:39,210
that your website rearranges itself when it's being rendered on a portrait smaller screen vs. a larger
96

97
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:46,980
desktop screen. And try to avoid one of my pet peeves in terms of design which is having so many banners
97

98
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:53,010
on your website that show up on the mobile version that your content becomes impossibly small.
98

99
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:57,480
And even when you're scrolling it's like you're scrolling it on an Apple Watch or something.
99

100
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:03,360
Whereas all of this extra content is taken up by warnings and banners and cookies and it's just not
100

101
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,590
a very good user experience.
101

102
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,830
But on the other hand, don't go crazy either.
102

103
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:15,870
Don't make your entire website just one part like a picture or a piece of text scaling it up massively
103

104
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:21,960
like this is also very very awkward because then I have to just keep scrolling until forever before
104

105
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,080
I can actually read and take in all of the content.
105

106
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,630
So strike a happy medium.
106

107
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,430
And most importantly test, test, test.
107

108
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,820
Give it to other users.
108

109
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,960
You can employ professional testers to try out your website and give you feedback.
109

110
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:40,800
Now if you can't afford that, just use your family and friends. And bake some cookies for them,
110

111
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:46,800
get them to test out your website and start getting some feedback on how you can improve the design.
111

112
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,840
Now finally we've talked a lot about user experience and how to get people to have a good time.
112

113
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:57,900
Now some designers though use the knowledge they have about human psychology and User Interface and
113

114
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:04,670
User Experience design to do bad things.
114

115
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:13,410
And in the design world, we call these dark patterns. So patterns which get a user to perform an action
115

116
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:17,790
or behavior that is beneficial to the company or the designer
116

117
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,960
but it's not necessarily what the user wants.
117

118
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:25,450
And this I would say is another form of bad user experience.
118

119
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,510
So let me give you some examples.
119

120
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:32,790
This is a real life example. Let's say that you walked into Waitrose which is a big supermarket in the
120

121
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:35,880
UK and you bought yourself a sandwich.
121

122
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:40,560
Now when you look at it at the point when you're buying it, it looks like this sandwich is going to be
122

123
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,510
full length from edge to edge
123

124
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,410
right?
124

125
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:49,320
But then when you rip open the packaging you're disappointed when you find that actually all that's
125

126
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:55,540
in the middle is just air and your sandwich turns out to be a lot smaller than you initially thought.
126

127
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,910
It is the worst feeling in the world.
127

128
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,840
This is a feeling that I can't stand when my food suddenly gets reduced in size.
128

129
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:07,770
It's like as if somebody came along and took food out of your plate. In the digital world,
129

130
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:13,770
people do the same thing. The same kind of trickery that's meant to get you to perform an action that
130

131
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:20,430
you don't necessarily want and you end up feeling really disappointed and really upset. With Amazon every
131

132
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:21,110
single time
132

133
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,550
I have to re-click the free delivery button which I've earned by buying so much product from them.
133

134
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:32,310
But they still try to trick you using the things that we've learned about hierarchy
134

135
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:39,060
for example. Here the button that makes the more money "Express delivery" is highlighted in orange.
135

136
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,860
It pops out a lot more.
136

137
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,000
It's a lot more likely that you'll want to click on it.
137

138
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:50,880
But in all likelihood, you're probably happy with just normal delivery and you're now tricked into paying
138

139
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,040
more for this delivery.
139

140
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,260
Now here's another example
140

141
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,230
that's actually true the evil.
141

142
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,410
This is a Snapchat ad for some shoes.
142

143
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:08,340
But what the designer has cleverly done on the advertising is they've placed a one pixel curved line
143

144
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:15,090
on this ad which makes it kind of look a bit like a hair is on your screen. But when you go into that
144

145
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:19,140
screen and you try to get rid of that piece of hair, well you've tapped on an avenue.
145

146
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:26,550
So the ad takes you to the website and the advertisers make money off each click.
146

147
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:32,020
And this is truly a dog pattern because it's just tricking you to do something you didn't want to.
147

148
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:37,770
Whereas good design is about helping people do what they want to do and giving them a good experience
148

149
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,400
while they're at it.
149

150
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:47,250
Now the king of dog patterns is RyanAir and it's a low cost airline in Europe which is really known for
150

151
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:50,720
sort of charging you for every single little thing.
151

152
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:55,880
I wouldn't be surprised if tomorrow they suddenly charged you for using the toilet on the plane.
152

153
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:03,150
But here's what the website looks like when you tried to buy an airplane ticket. In order to buy your
153

154
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:08,370
airplane ticket you have to go through all of these extra add ons including saying "No I don't want to
154

155
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:13,920
buy travel insurance." But look at how they've hidden it inside this big dropdown list and it's not even
155

156
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,170
at the beginning of the list.
156

157
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,920
It's actually sorted alphabetically below Denmark for some reason.
157

158
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:23,650
And this just makes it so much harder for you to find that option
158

159
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:27,910
and for you to actually accidentally end up buying travel insurance.
159

160
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:34,930
Now the final example and probably one of the dog patterns I dislike the most is these checkboxes. You
160

161
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,660
know right below you filled in a form,
161

162
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:42,130
you get these checkboxes and sometimes the wording is so confusing that I really don't know what I'm
162

163
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:43,120
signing up for.
163

164
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:49,720
Like this one: If you would like us to no longer continue to stop not sending you special deals and offers
164

165
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:53,150
every week, please indicate you are inclined to yes
165

166
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:57,440
by not checking the box. I have no idea what clicking that box does.
166

167
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,160
I really just... I don't know.
167

168
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:00,490
I might click it, I might not.
168

169
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:06,490
I don't know what it does. But it's horribly confusing and it's not a good user experience at all.
169

170
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:10,440
I will bet you that after I sign up I'm never going to come back to this website again
170

171
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,390
right?
171

172
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:13,210
Are you with me? Now
172

173
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,850
we've seen what good websites look like.
173

174
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:18,130
We've seen what bad websites look like.
174

175
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,650
We've even seen what evil websites look like.
175

176
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:27,520
But it's time to put our knowledge to the test by designing our own website from scratch and applying
176

177
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,460
these four pillars of web design to this project.
177

178
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:36,190
So have a think about what you've learned so far and head over to the next lesson where we're going
178

179
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,860
to design a hotel website from scratch.
