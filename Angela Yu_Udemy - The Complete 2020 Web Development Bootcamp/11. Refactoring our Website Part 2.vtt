00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:07.140
All right. So in the last lesson we looked at what this syntax means and we learned all about how to combine
1

2
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.550
selectors in CSS code.
2

3
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.820
Now if you haven't taken a look at that then I strongly recommend you do because it's really really
3

4
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.280
useful so that you can understand what exactly is going on over here.
4

5
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.320
But now we're going to continue to refactor our code.
5

6
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.290
So the next thing I want to do relates to the fact that we've got certain sections on our web site that
6

7
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:34.350
have a colored background where the text is white and then we have other sections where the background
7

8
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.640
is white and the text is black.
8

9
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.000
So this is a repeated pattern across our web site.
9

10
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.500
So I want to capture that and refactor our code to make it a little bit more modular and reusable.
10

11
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.170
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to look through my code and give each of these sections a class
11

12
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.870
based on whether it's a colored section or if it is a white section.
12

13
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.830
So the first title section is a colored section,
13

14
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:12.220
the second section, features section, is a white section, and then testimonials was colored, I think,
14

15
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:21.900
and then press was also a colored section, and then pricing was a white section,
15

16
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:33.800
and finally the cta was a colored section, and the footer was a white section.
16

17
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:34.150
All right.
17

18
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.600
So now all of our sections have a class depending on whether they should be white or if they should
18

19
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.610
be colored.
19

20
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:48.830
And if I hit save I can now go and create some of these sections up top so just below containers.
20

21
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:56.730
I'm going to add another comment that's called sections, and I'm going to add our classes here,
21

22
00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:04.390
the colored-section and the white-section.
22

23
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:05.150
All right.
23

24
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:13.230
So now if we take a look at our code you can see that for the colored sections we tend to add a background
24

25
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.900
color of that bright red pinkish color and then we give the text a white color.
25

26
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.170
Now for the white sections we tend to just give it a background color of white and maybe a little later on
26

27
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.990
we decide that we want to add other changes to our different sections,
27

28
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.140
but at the moment that's basically all that each section has.
28

29
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.830
So let's put that in here.
29

30
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.630
So I'm going to remove these two bits of code and I'm going to put it inside the colored section and
30

31
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.990
then the white section is simply going to have a background color of white.
31

32
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.840
And now I can go through my code and remove some of the repeated declarations. So, in the case of the
32

33
00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.270
testimonial section, even though it's a colored section because it has white tags and has a background
33

34
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.690
color and we've already given it a class of colored-section,
34

35
00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.880
it is slightly different from the other colored sections because it has this kind of peachy color rather
35

36
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.300
than this bright pinkish red.
36

37
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:18.180
So what we can do here is we can delete the part that's repeated, which is the
37

38
00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:24.720
white text, because it's already inside a section that has a class of colored-section, which has that
38

39
00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:32.570
text color that's applied, but we can override the background color by applying a style to our id.
39

40
00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.560
And it's important to remember that there is a hierarchy between different types of selectors,
40

41
00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:45.510
as we mentioned before. So ids are the most specific and their styles get applied preferentially over
41

42
00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:46.740
everything else,
42

43
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.560
then next comes classes, and finally comes these HTML elements.
43

44
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:59.090
So if I right click and inspect to go into the Chrome Developer Tools and I select our section here
44

45
00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.530
which has an HTML element of section,
45

46
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.290
class of colored-section, and an id of testimonials,
46

47
00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.590
you can see that even though colored-section is applying the background color of that bright pinkish
47

48
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.570
color and id testimonials is applying this more peachy color,
48

49
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.190
you can see that this one gets overridden and it's shown as being crossed out in the Chrome Developer
49

50
00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.690
Tools.
50

51
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:30.030
So if we didn't have this style that's applied in the id, which as we said is more specific, has higher
51

52
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:36.660
ranking, then it would default to the colored-section background color, but because we do, then this one
52

53
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.160
is going to override the other color. And it's pretty much the same thing
53

54
00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.170
inside the press section as well.
54

55
00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:47.010
All right. So the last one that we have is the cta section which we can now basically delete because
55

56
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:52.190
the section already has a class of colored-section so we don't need to write out that code again.
56

57
00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:59.010
So let's hit save and refresh our web site and hopefully absolutely nothing has changed.
57

58
00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.680
So we're doing a good job with our refactoring.
58

59
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:07.310
Now another thing that you might have noticed up here is that, because we're targeting the container that's
59

60
00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.630
inside the title section, we don't actually need this extra title id.
60

61
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:20.040
We can actually just combine these two into the same selector and we can delete that specific title
61

62
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.970
id selector.
