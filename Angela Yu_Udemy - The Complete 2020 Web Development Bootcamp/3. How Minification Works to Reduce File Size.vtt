00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:08.040
Now for the inquisitive ones amongst you you might have copied this URL where our jQuery library
1

2
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:16.200
resides and tried to take a look at it. And if you did this is what you would see, it looks like a huge
2

3
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.010
mess.
3

4
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:23.330
But this is essentially the minified version of the jQuery library.
4

5
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:30.040
And you might notice that it looks very similar from the Bootstrap CDN that we used previously.
5

6
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.330
When you copy the URL there and paste it and load it in your browser, then you can see again you
6

7
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.980
have this huge mess of code.
7

8
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.810
Now what exactly is all of this?
8

9
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.500
Let's take a section of this and copy it, and inside Atom I'm going to open a new page.
9

10
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.760
I'm going to show you what this minification does.
10

11
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.470
So essentially we've still got the same Bootstrap code.
11

12
00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.340
So in the case of Bootstrap then it is CSS,
12

13
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.920
and in the case of jQuery then it's Javascript code.
13

14
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:14.700
But essentially all of the spaces, the new lines, the comments, have been removed from the file to try
14

15
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.400
and reduce its size.
15

16
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.490
But you can see that as I've been combing through this and separating out these lines into the familiar
16

17
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.000
formatting that we're used to, then you can see that it's just CSS code.
17

18
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.000
And this is simply just Javascript code.
18

19
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.850
And in fact if you head over to minifier.org, which is a way of converting your Javascript or CSS
19

20
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.470
code to a minified version.
20

21
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:47.880
Now to test it out I've got our index.js from our drumkit code and at the top I'm going to add
21

22
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.170
a comment.
22

23
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:56.250
This is a comment. And you can see that it's got a lot of spaces, new lines, new paragraphs.
23

24
00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.190
But we're going to copy its entirety by just hitting command or control A and then command or control
24

25
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.300
C, and then we're going to take it over to our minifier and we're going to paste that in.
25

26
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:14.220
And now we're going to select Javascript and hit Minify, and you can see that it's just crunched everything
26

27
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.500
together and got rid of comments.
27

28
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:25.120
So now you can see that our original script was 1539 bytes, our 
28

29
00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.720
minified script is only 1113 bytes.
29

30
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:37.260
So we have gained 426 bytes, making our files smaller and therefore quicker for our users to load.
30

31
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:43.650
And this is exactly the reason why we minify our Javascript or our CSS, because all of this code has
31

32
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.830
to be loaded up by your users' browser.
32

33
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:54.060
Now depending on their Internet speed, that may take a short time or a long time. Now because the browser
33

34
00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:00.090
doesn't care about tabs, indents, spaces and comments, it completely ignores all of it,
34

35
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:07.270
there's no point asking the user to load up all of this unnecessary information, and by minifying
35

36
00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.210
we get rid of those things and make our web site load much faster.
36

37
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.920
So if you download the jQuery library straight up then you'll see something that looks a bit like
37

38
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:17.770
this.
38

39
00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:25.830
Now as with all libraries they'll come up with a standard version that is human readable and they'll
39

40
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.620
also have a minified version that's just intended for the browser.
40

41
00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:38.310
And this is so that you can customize the code if you wish and then minify it yourself, or if you don't
41

42
00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:44.330
want to do any customization then simply to just drop the jQuery file into your project.
42

43
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.720
All right.
43

44
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.920
So in the next lesson we're actually going to be getting down and dirty and actually exploring all the
44

45
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.930
things that you can do with jQuery, starting by selecting elements.
45

46
00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.470
So for all of that and more, I'll see you on the next lesson.
