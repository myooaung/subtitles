00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:00,540
All right.

2
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:07,590
So here comes Challenge 20. Currently on our home page it's quite cluttered because every single blog post
2

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,310
no matter how long it is one paragraph or five paragraphs,
3

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,210
it all gets listed here.
4

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,960
But now that we've managed to create a separate page for each and every single one of our blog posts
5

6
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:23,100
we don't want to list it in full on our home page anymore.
6

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:29,940
The goal of this challenge is to use Google and use Stack Overflow and use all the resources you have
7

8
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:38,910
on the Internet to figure out how you can change the code so that our home page now truncates the content
8

9
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:45,790
of each blog posts to only 100 characters. And then at the end there's just these three ...
9

10
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,690
and now we only have a preview of each blog post.
10

11
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:57,750
Pause the video and I want you to practice this really truly important programming skill of figuring
11

12
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,060
things out by yourself and try to complete this challenge.
12

13
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,390
So here's my first hint for you.
13

14
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,920
A journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.
14

15
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:16,200
The programmer version of that is that the journey of solving any programming problem starts with a single
15

16
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:16,880
search.
16

17
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:22,380
So let's go ahead and try to succinctly explain to Google what it is that we want to know.
17

18
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:30,360
Now the goal that we want to achieve is to be able to truncate our string down to 100 characters using
18

19
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,360
Javascript.
19

20
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:37,110
So if we exclude all of the specific parts of our problem say the 100 characters right? Because somebody
20

21
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:40,800
else might have posted that they wanted to limit it to 10 characters.
21

22
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,490
So to widen our search let's try something like
22

23
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:50,030
truncate string Javascript. And the first answer we get on Stack Overflow
23

24
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,890
let's check it out.
24

25
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,290
Let's see what that query is to see if it matches our own.
25

26
00:01:54,300 --> 00:02:01,110
So they want to truncate a dynamically loaded string using straight Javascript and all they care about
26

27
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,790
is just the number of characters.
27

28
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,640
That sounds exactly like what we want to do as well.
28

29
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,550
And the answer they explain is to use the substring method and they actually very kindly link to the
29

30
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:15,140
documentation as well as providing a code example.
30

31
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:23,040
So let's say that you have a string ABCDEFG and you want to truncate it down to say only 3 characters
31

32
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,290
long. Then you would say the string
32

33
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:33,720
call a method .substring on it and then inside the parentheses you specify a start position and an
33

34
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,090
end position where you want to cut up that string.
34

35
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:45,190
So now the outcome of my truncated string is now just ABC because it goes from 0 to length which is 3.
35

36
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:51,390
So from 0 to 3 then then that includes 0, 1, 2, 3 only has ABC right?
36

37
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,270
So now using this
37

38
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:56,930
can you apply it to the challenge and solve it for yourself?
