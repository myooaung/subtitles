Now very often I hear students ask me about, "How can I become a freelancer?
1

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:15,060
I want to work in Bali or I want to travel and I want to be able to at the same time work as a freelancer."

3
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:21,720
One of the best ways to get started is to build a portfolio and to build up a list of clients who can
3

4
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:28,230
vouch for you because if you want to get that top gig right at the beginning then it's going to be very
4

5
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:33,120
very hard without some references without something to show for it.

6
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:40,140
So the first thing I recommend students do is to go onto a website like Fiverr where people are not
6

7
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:47,130
paying very much for any sort of service. But you know to practise working with a client to figure out
7

8
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:54,240
what it is that people want, to establish how you can better communicate with your clients and make them
8

9
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,400
happy and build the things that they want.
9

10
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:03,210
So even though you're not getting paid a lot in the beginning, at least you're working with real projects
10

11
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,380
and real people.
11

12
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:11,100
And as you build up your skills, as you build more projects, then you'll be able to go to websites like
12

13
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:17,290
Upwork or Guru or Freelancer and be able to offer your services for slightly more.
13

14
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:20,810
Basically, don't shoot for the moon right at the beginning.
14

15
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:26,640
Instead build up your reputation and build up your skills while you're getting your clients excellent
15

16
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,440
service
16

17
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:33,240
for not very much money. And this way, within a year or so, you'll have enough projects to show off and
17

18
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,950
enough clients will vouch for you, then you can shoot for the moon.
