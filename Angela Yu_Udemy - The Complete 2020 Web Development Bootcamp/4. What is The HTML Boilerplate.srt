1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,000
Now once you're ready go ahead and open up the Atom editor.
1

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,990
Now if you haven't yet installed Atom,
2

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:13,140
this is a good point to go back and have a look at those videos on how to install Atom for Mac or for
3

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:13,980
Windows,
4

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,350
because from here on out we're going to be working with the Atom editor to create every single one of
5

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:20,350
our web sites.
6

7
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:25,590
So it's really really important that you have it setup with all the packages that we've specified in
7

8
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,520
those installation videos.
8

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,670
But once you've got it installed and open you should be looking at a screen like this.
9

10
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:37,770
Now the first thing we're going to do is we're going to go to File and we're going to open a new project
10

11
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,240
folder to work out of.
11

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:45,360
So I want you to create a new folder either in your desktop or somewhere else that you prefer.
12

13
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:49,330
And it's going to be called Web Development.
13

14
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:55,470
Go ahead and hit Create and then select that Web Development folder and go ahead and click Open and
14

15
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:01,890
now you'll see your project folder show up in the sidebar over here and you can toggle it closed by
15

16
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,770
clicking on that arrow button over there.
16

17
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:09,710
So now that we've got our Web Development folder, this is where we're going to store all of our projects.
17

18
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,750
So the first project that we're going to be creating is our personal web site.
18

19
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,120
So go ahead and right click on the Web Development folder.
19

20
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:25,020
And we're going to create a new folder inside the Web Development folder, and we're going to call our project
20

21
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:28,370
HTML - Personal Site.
21

22
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:33,180
And now we're ready to create our very first HTML file inside this folder.
22

23
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:38,400
So again right click on this tab and we're going to create a new file.
23

24
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,960
Now as you get used to Atom you're going to start to want to use some of their shortcuts.
24

25
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,780
So for example instead of right clicking and selecting new file you can also just simply select the
25

26
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,210
HTML - Personal Site and hit A in order to do the same thing.
26

27
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:58,140
But in the beginning as you’re getting used to Atom I'm going to be using a lot of the mouse controls
27

28
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:03,060
so that you can see what's happening on the screen but feel free to start incorporating the shortcuts
28

29
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,620
into your workflow.
29

30
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:09,770
And as time goes on you'll find that they make life so much quicker and so much easier.
30

31
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:15,570
So now we're going to create our very first file and you can see the way that the files are structured
31

32
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:22,830
is that we're creating it inside this folder called HTML - Personal Site and inside that folder is
32

33
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,070
where our web page is going to be located.
33

34
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:32,100
Let's go ahead and create this homepage and by convention we're going to name it index.html
34

35
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,730
and that is usually the name that developers will give their home page.
35

36
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,270
So go ahead and hit enter in order to create that file.
36

37
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:44,970
And if you open up this folder you can see that's exactly where it's located.
37

38
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:49,530
And it should open up on the right hand or the main pane over here as well.
38

39
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:55,700
Now in order to create any HTML web site there's a little bit of boilerplate code that's associated.
39

40
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:00,750
Now you can either write it all out or because we installed the Emmet plugin, 

41
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:09,340
We can simply write html and then hit enter and it will insert all of that boilerplate code for us.

42
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,450
Now if that didn't work for you you could also hit the tab key after writing each e-mail or typing an

43
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:19,380
exclamation mark and then hitting the tab or the enter key.

44
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,900
Try some of these combinations that you see on screen.

45
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,150
If it's not working for you.

46
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:29,110
So now we mentioned that this is a standard html boilerplate code.

47
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:34,650
Now in programming we'll talk about boilerplates quite frequently and it's similar to having a code template

48
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:37,740
something that you'll reuse for different projects.

49
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:43,320
And it comes from the days when the printing press would make these heavy iron plates that would function

50
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,150
as their printing template.

51
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:50,190
And because they looked very similar to the small metal plate that identified the builder of a steam

52
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,230
boiler they called it the boiler plate.

53
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,090
So that's just where this word comes from.

54
00:03:55,110 --> 00:04:00,340
But when we're talking about it in programming we usually mean a code template that you can reuse.

55
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,460
Now even though we didn't have to do very much work in order to get all of this into our file it would

56
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,000
still be a shame to lose it,

57
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,260
right?

58
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:15,920
So, in Atom, whenever you see a blue dot on the tab bar of your file that means that there's unsaved progress.

59
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:22,200
And in order to make it disappear and to keep your progress you can simply go to File and then click

60
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,680
on save or use whatever shortcut that shows up for you over here.

61
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:30,880
It should be Command S on Mac and it should be Ctrl S on Windows.

62
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:36,540
For those of you who are interested I've included a link to some of the most commonly used atom keyboard

63
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:41,400
Shortcuts, and it includes the commands for both Mac, Windows and Linux for users of 

64
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:42,540
all three platforms.

65
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:47,020
So go and have a look over there and start learning and using some of these shortcuts.

66
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:51,020
And once you've saved your phone at ATM you'll see that little blue dot disappear.

67
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,320
And now you can be rest assured that all your progress has now been safely saved.

68
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,880
Now there's quite a lot of stuff on screen.

69
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:03,930
So let's talk about this boilerplate line by line to understand what it all does.

70
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:11,670
So the first line here is where we declare the document type and this tells the browser when it opens

71
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:12,800
up this file.

72
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:17,420
What is the version of HTML that we're using now in this course.

73
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:22,560
We're working with the latest version of each HTML which is HTML5.

74
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:30,510
Now in previous versions of HTML, this doc type was incredibly convoluted and in fact I can show

75
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,070
you what some of them looked like.

76
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:39,960
So we can write HTML for example and then because we've installed Emmet if I hit enter you

77
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:46,080
can see this is what the boilerplate code for a particular HTML for version would look like.

78
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:49,640
And you can see that DOCTYPE is a lot longer.

79
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:55,400
And very often programmers won't be able to remember that so they actually have to look it up somewhere.

80
00:05:55,430 --> 00:06:02,540
But since HTML5 the DOCTYPE declaration became a lot simpler.

81
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,460
And now it's just !DOCTYPE html.

82
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:10,170
And this tells the browser to render this file as an HTML5 document.

83
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:16,160
And there's a few differences between how things will appear or how things will be structured depending

84
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,690
on whether if the doc type was HTML5 or a previous version.

85
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,370
So that's the doc type.

86
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:29,720
Now we inserted all of this code using autocomplete from Emmet and if you want to look at all the other

87
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:35,930
things that you can do with Emmet then you can go ahead and have a look at docs.emmet.io/cheatsheet

88
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:42,020
and here you can see what all of those abbreviations look like and what is the result of

89
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:45,560
it as you're developing into a professional web developer.

90
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:51,230
It's a great resource to have in order to save yourself a lot of time when you get used to using these

91
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,370
common shortcuts.

92
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:59,120
Now the next line in our code is an html tag and this tells the browser that everything in between

93
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,870
the opening and closing tags is going to be HTML code.

94
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,090
And what does that code consist of.

95
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:09,160
Well it consists of a head and a body.

96
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:16,670
Now the head is the part of the HD file that holds information about the web page and it tells the browser

97
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:19,330
how it should handle the page.

98
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:26,930
So for example we might have a title tag in here that tells the browser what is the title of this particular

99
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:29,120
document or this particular page.

100
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,880
So let's go ahead and give our website a title. Let’s call it whatever your name is.

101
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,240
So mine is Angela,

102
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:47,230
Angela's Personal Site, and now if we go ahead and hit Save we can have a look at it inside our browser.

103
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:52,460
Now there's a couple of ways how you can open up the website that you're coding up inside your browser.

104
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:59,090
Now one of these ways is simply going into your finder or your explorer and finding that index.html

105
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:01,440
file and then double clicking on it.

106
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:04,640
And it should bring it up inside chrome.

107
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:13,520
Now the other way of opening up your web site is if you right click on your file inside atom and you

108
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,990
go to copy full path.

109
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:21,350
Then it copies the entire directory path to the location of your Web site.

110
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:26,780
So if you just go ahead and paste it into the bar here and here with this file path were telling the

111
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:32,180
browser how to find this file index for each HTML on our computer.

112
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:38,660
So first we're telling it to go into a folder called users then we're telling it to go into a folder

113
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:46,210
called angelayu, then we're saying go to Desktop, and then inside Desktop we're going to Web Development.

114
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:51,590
And finally we're going to HTML - Personal Site, and that is where we're going to find 

115
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,090
that index.html site.

116
00:08:53,540 --> 00:09:00,530
So let's go ahead and hit enter on that file path in order to do exactly the same as double clicking

117
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:05,620
on this file which is opening up our web site inside Chrome.

118
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:12,050
Now if Chrome is not your default browser then when you see the icon it's not going to have the chrome

119
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,090
symbol here.

120
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:21,330
So you can change that by going into your settings then scrolling down to Default Browser in order to

121
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,270
change it.

122
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:31,290
Now at the moment our Web site doesn't contain any content yet but it does have a title which you can

123
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:32,050
see here.

124
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:37,020
And it says Angela's Personal Site, which is what we created over here.

125
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:42,750
Now inside the head section there's also this meta element.

126
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:49,320
Now there's quite a few different meta elements, but this particular one is called character set and

127
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,940
the one that we're setting it to is UTF 8.

128
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,440
Now what does this line do?

129
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:03,840
The meta elements give extra metadata or associated data to your HTML document.

130
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:10,350
And in this case were telling the browser when it opens up this file that all the text inside our web

131
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:15,140
page is encoded using the UTF 8 encoding system.

132
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:21,360
So this is basically a list of all the available characters that we can use inside our website for it

133
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,250
to be rendered correctly.

134
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:29,730
Now sometimes when you open up a web page especially in an outdated browser like Internet Explorer or

135
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:36,420
an email that you got from a Bulgarian friend you might see some of the characters being jumbled up

136
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:37,190
like this.

137
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:45,990
And this is called mojibake and it's a Japanese word that stands for characters that are transformed.

138
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:53,190
And it occurs because your browser is trying to render the characters using the wrong character set.

139
00:10:53,400 --> 00:11:00,420
So for example if we have a look at this wikipedia page for mojibake in Japanese you can see that currently

140
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:08,760
my browser is set to render all the web pages as unicode which is very similar to UTF 8 and you can

141
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,520
see that everything looks pretty legit.

142
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,780
It all looks more or less like Japanese.

143
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:20,100
But if I decide to change the encoding of my browser and for it to interpret all of the Web sites as

144
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:25,900
something else say Arabic then you can see that all of this web page is now messed up.

145
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,980
This is not a valid word.

146
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:33,690
And none of this has any meaning because it's encoded the Web site incorrectly.

147
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:40,740
So there's quite a few different types of encoding and they're specialized for different languages because

148
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,190
different languages use different symbols.

149
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:50,310
So for example if you have a look at the windows Greek symbol chart then you can see that the symbol

150
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,600
at position two to four looks like this.

151
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:59,610
But if you have a look at the chart for Windows Arabic then 224 actually encodes a completely

152
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:06,600
different character and that's why we get these messed up Web sites or strange looking e-mails when

153
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,610
it's interpreted using the wrong encoding.

154
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:16,160
Now UTF 8 is the standard encoding that you should be using when working with HTML5.

155
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:23,280
And the reason for that is because it includes all of those international symbols and in fact every

156
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:27,510
single symbol that is included in the unicode character set.

157
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:35,680
So if you go to unicode-table.com, then you can see a table of all of the unicode characters.

158
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:41,250
And if you scroll down it's got this nice little animation that shows you as we change locations going

159
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,300
from Latin.

160
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:50,700
so most of the English speaking countries, to Greek and Coptic, then going to Armenian, Hebrew, Arabic and

161
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,800
all of the different languages.

162
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,530
The other thing about Unicode is that it also includes emojis.

163
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:04,480
So for example if you have a look at the emerging chart let's look for heart symbols for example.

164
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:11,040
Then we've got all of these different emoji characters that we can also use on our Web site that's encoded

165
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,950
with UTF.

166
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,770
So let's go ahead and give that a try.

167
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:16,700
Let's find a nice looking heart symbol.

168
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:23,370
We can right click to copy it or hit command C or control C and we can paste it to the front of our

169
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:26,850
website title using control V or command V.

170
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:36,060
And now if I hit save and go back to my website and hit command R or control R to refresh or click

171
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:41,250
this refresh button here and you can see our title is updated with that emerging.

172
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:47,070
So everything that is Unicode can be encoded correctly using UTF 8 and it's something that you should

173
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:51,570
just have as your boilerplate code for any new website you create.

174
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:58,260
This gives your Web site the maximum chance of being rendered correctly on browsers that are from international

175
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,010
visitors.

176
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:04,500
Now if you're interested in doing a bit of background reading and learning more about Unicode and character

177
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:09,450
sets then this is a really good piece that I highly recommend by Joel Spolsky.

178
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:16,200
It's a roughly 10 minute read and it talks a lot about these character sets and how they encode different

179
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:22,240
symbols and why you should be using something like Unicode or UTF 8 in your websites in order to ensure

180
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,850
maximum compatibility.

181
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:28,600
So it's a good read and I'll include a link to it in the resources for this lesson.

182
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:35,530
Now aside from the character set attribute for the meta element there's also other attributes that you

183
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:37,360
might see on different websites.

184
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:44,050
So some of the Common ones include description or things like keywords about your website who the author

185
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:52,180
is as well as viewport and these meta tags tell the browser how it should render or display the web

186
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:58,630
page and also they give information to search engines about the content of the website.

187
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:06,340
So for example if we go to the Mozilla MDN Web Docs web site, the main page, so developer.mozilla.org

188
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:12,050
and we right click and we view page source.

189
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:18,630
Then we get to see the entire HTML file that's used to render this particular page.

190
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:24,310
So this is what our browser sees and does all the hard work of making it look nice and pretty like this

191
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:25,030
for us.

192
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:33,550
So here you go ahead and hit command f or control F on windows you can search for the description attribute.

193
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:38,260
Now it's not this first one but it is this third one.

194
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,170
And it's this exact thing.

195
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:46,150
And the description says the Mozilla Developer Network MDN provides information about Open Web technologies

196
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,760
including HTML, CSS and APIs.

197
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:57,730
Now if we go into Google and we searched for MDN you can see that the snippet of text that it shows

198
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:07,870
about the main M.D. and Web site is exactly the same as what we saw just here in the description a tag

199
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:15,550
and this is what search engines do they crawl the HDMI CML of your website and look for certain meta

200
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:23,580
tags in order to know what your website is about and also how to display it in their search index.

201
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:28,990
And there's a whole bunch of different attributes for the meta element and you can have a read about

202
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:33,950
either on W3 Schools or what I recommend usually is the MDN Web Docs so if you have a look at meta

203
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:40,390
 over here then you can learn all about the different attributes how to

204
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:42,570
use them and what they're good for.

205
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:47,800
So in the next lesson we're going to be tapping into our body section and we're going to be creating

206
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,070
the content for this personal site of ours.

207
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:53,830
So for all of that and more I'll see you on the next lesson.
