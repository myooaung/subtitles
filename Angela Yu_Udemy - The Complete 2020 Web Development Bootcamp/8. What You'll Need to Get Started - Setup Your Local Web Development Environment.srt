1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:01,150
All right.
1

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:03,900
So, first things first. Before we do anything else,
2

3
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:07,890
we first have to get set up and ready for web development.
3

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:14,010
So I'm gonna walk you through a couple of applications that we'll be using pretty much full time during
4

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:21,300
this course. There are two major tools that we’ll rely on, and that is going to be the Chrome browser and
5

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,190
the Atom text editor.
6

7
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,140
And between these two tools we're going to achieve a lot.
7

8
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:31,890
And later on in the course when we're introducing more advanced concepts such as using the command line
8

9
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,350
or using a database then we'll install other things as we go along.
9

10
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,120
But to get started the most important applications we need to install are just these two.
10

11
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:48,150
Now you might already have Chrome installed, but if you don't then be sure to check out the Web Development
11

12
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:54,930
Course Resources List which I’ll link to in this current lesson. And it's really really important that
12

13
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:59,460
you check over here because every single time I mention a link, or every single time I try to point
13

14
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,740
you towards something, the links will show up over here, and you'll be able to click on it to save you
14

15
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:07,940
all the trouble of having to type it all out.
15

16
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:08,720
First things first.
16

17
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:14,580
If you don't have Chrome installed, then open up this page in your browser and just click on this link
17

18
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:21,330
to go ahead and download and install Chrome. And that should be pretty simple. And it will guide you through
18

19
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,540
the process.
19

20
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,050
So now that you've downloaded the browser you need, the next step is to install a code editor.
20

21
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:36,240
And out there there are so many different code editors, for example, Atom, VSCode, Sublime, Brackets ...
21

22
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,810
And if you think about it all that you need to actually write code is just some form of text editor.
22

23
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,510
So you could, if you really wanted to, even use something like Notepad.
23

24
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:53,640
But the downside of Notepad is that it doesn't have all of the great features that some of these other specialized
24

25
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,230
code editors have.
25

26
00:01:55,230 --> 00:02:00,660
So two of my favorite are Atom and VSCode and I use both of them pretty regularly.
26

27
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:06,540
Now, in the course videos you'll see me use Atom, but if you have a strong preference towards one of these
27

28
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:12,390
others or any other code editor that you're already used to that you want to use instead then feel free
28

29
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:18,390
to do that. But if you have no strong preferences then I recommend we go ahead and install the Atom text
29

30
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,290
editor.
30

31
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,580
And it's completely free to download and install.
31

32
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:29,160
So if you just head over to atom.io or go through the Web Development Course Resources List, then
32

33
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:35,040
you should land on this page and it very cleverly figures out what system you have that you're running.
33

34
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,410
So for example at the moment I'm running MacOS and I'm on MacOS 10.9 or later.
34

35
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:47,370
So all you have to do is just go ahead and click Download, and, once download has completed, then you can
35

36
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:55,170
simply head over to your Downloads folder and double click to unzip that package. And now you will see
36

37
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,390
Atom show up.
37

38
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:03,420
The last thing you have to do is just to move this application into your Applications folder. On the Mac
38

39
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:08,130
it’s just a matter of heading over to your Macintosh harddrive and then your Applications folder, and
39

40
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:16,260
then dragging in that Atom application that you just downloaded in your Downloads over into here. And
40

41
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:20,040
then you're all done and you're set up with Atom.
41

42
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,650
Now, if you're a Windows user and you head over to atom.io, you'll see that will automatically detect
42

43
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,570
that you are viewing this on a Windows computer.
43

44
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:34,380
And then you can just go ahead and again click that big yellow Download button. And you should end up
44

45
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:40,620
with something that's called something like atomsetup.exe, and you'll be able to see this in your
45

46
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,550
Downloads folder.
46

47
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:48,120
So now if you just double click on that and it will automatically do everything it needs to install
47

48
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,310
Atom on your system.
48

49
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:56,880
So once you're done it should open up a new Atom window like so, and you would have successfully installed
49

50
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:01,900
Atom. And the power of Atom really comes from their packages.
50

51
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:08,110
So you can see that they have over 8000 packages, which are bunches of code that other programmers have
51

52
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:12,220
written to make your experience of using Atom better.
52

53
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:19,930
So you can put in custom things such as display a clock in the Atom status bar, or other things such
53

54
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:25,990
as having the file icons next to each of your files, or something that's way more practical which is
54

55
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:31,240
things like atom-beautify which just beautifies and indents your code for you.
55

56
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,220
So these are really really powerful.
56

57
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,750
And we're going to customize it for the course.
57

58
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:41,260
So, again, if you head back over to the Web Development Course Resources List, you'll see that there is
58

59
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:45,380
a list of Atom packages that we want you to install.
59

60
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:50,980
And these are the ones which are recommended and these are the ones which are optional.
60

61
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:56,830
All you have to do is open up Atom and go to Preferences and then go to Install.
61

62
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:02,580
And I want you to search for each of these and then just go ahead and install it.
62

63
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:08,290
So you can simply just copy and paste it into here and you'll see the one that should match up exactly
63

64
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,310
with the name that you see over here.
64

65
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:17,110
And then just go ahead and click Install. And on Windows it is absolutely exactly the same.
65

66
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:22,570
And once you have installed all of your packages then you should be able to view them over here.
66

67
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:28,390
Now if you end up having any issues installing packages in Atom, then I recommend to go back to that
67

68
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:34,660
Google doc and scroll down to the place where I've got the troubleshooting instructions and follow each
68

69
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,690
of these steps to see if you can try and resolve it.
69

70
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:45,290
Now if you really can't fix it and your specific version of Windows or Mac or Linux just won't install
70

71
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:50,710
Atom or won't install the packages then I recommend to go ahead and get VSCode instead.
71

72
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:56,590
So, head over to the link. So, you'll be able to find a link to VSCode again in the Course Resources 
72

73
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,150
List.
73

74
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:02,230
And once you click on it it will take you to a web site which will automatically look at which system
74

75
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:05,050
you're running and give you a big Download button.
75

76
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:09,700
And then from there on it's exactly the same as downloading and installing Atom.
76

77
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:15,040
Now you can also click on the dropdown list to select the stable version of whichever system you're
77

78
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,730
running.
78

79
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,690
I recommend you don't go for the insiders version because it usually has more bugs.
79

80
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:22,390
I recommend going for the stable version instead.
80

81
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:28,920
Now similar to the packages and Atom I've also compiled a list of the equivalent extensions in 
81

82
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,160
VSCode that you can install.
82

83
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:36,440
So head over to the Course Resources List and you'll be have to find this list of VSCode extensions
83

84
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,270
I recommend.
84

85
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:44,230
But the goal is to have the Chrome browser installed and some form of text editor be it VSCode or
85

86
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,840
Atom installed.
86

87
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,190
Once you've got an editor and the Chrome browser, then you're ready to head over to the next lesson where
87

88
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:56,320
we're going to get started actually learning how to code and start building our web site.
88

89
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:59,260
So for all of that and more I'll see you on the next lesson.
