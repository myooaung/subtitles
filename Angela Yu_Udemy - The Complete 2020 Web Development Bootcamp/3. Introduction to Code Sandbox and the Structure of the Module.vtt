00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:07.590
In order to get up and running straight away, I want to introduce you to a tool called CodeSandbox. And
1

2
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:14.190
this is a browser based development environment that was initially created with React element in
2

3
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.140
mind.
3

4
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.150
It takes care of a lot of the grunt work and setup and it makes it easy to install dependencies with
4

5
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.650
NPM support,
5

6
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:29.250
so every package that we've used previously using NPM install we can use it inside CodeSandbox.
6

7
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.630
It can be embedded into Medium blog posts and web pages,
7

8
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:41.040
it allows you to build and deploy within the same application and a whole bunch of other things including
8

9
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.830
really good syntax highlighting and linting as well.
9

10
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.990
Throughout this module, we're going to be using CodeSandbox to introduce you to new skills in React.
10

11
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.180
And after you've learnt the skill
11

12
00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.720
then we'll practice those skills in a separate sandbox and it's through this skill practice skill practice
12

13
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.480
that you're going to build up and level up your skills in React.
13

14
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:10.740
And then at some point once you've acquired enough skills, I'm going to introduce you to a part of the
14

15
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.810
final project,
15

16
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.520
the Keeper app that we're going to be building. And we're going to break down the large Keeper app project
16

17
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.160
into several parts so that you'll be able to apply all of the skills that you learned previously
17

18
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:29.670
to complete each of these parts. And hopefully you're going to find that this process of using CodeSandbox
18

19
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:36.480
to learn and practice your skills help you learn React that much quicker and establish a solid foundation
19

20
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.770
of knowledge.
20

21
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.290
Now later on when I introduce you to the first part of the Keeper project, I'm also gonna show you how
21

22
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:50.070
to set up your local environment using Atom or using the VS code to create React apps. But to begin
22

23
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.500
with, I want to start out just using CodeSandbox so that you'll be at to use the same starting project
23

24
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.240
as me in a really really easy way.
24

25
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.420
So throughout this course, I'll be sharing with you these sandboxes, so that ensures that we're working
25

26
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:11.160
from the same file and it should minimize any headaches around the setup and configuration. In each lesson
26

27
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.110
where I'm explaining a concept through a use of a sandbox,
27

28
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.570
I will be sharing with you a link to that particular sandbox and this is what you'll see when you open
28

29
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.850
up the link in your browser.
29

30
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:30.420
You'll be able to see the files that are included and a preview of the website as it is, as well as be
30

31
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.260
able to view any of the existing files that I've created.
31

32
00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.510
Now if you want to just get started straight away you can just start editing the project.
32

33
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:45.630
It's already live and working in your browser. But if you want to be a save your work, you can sign in using
33

34
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:53.610
GitHub and you'll be able to fork or create your own copy of the sandbox so that you can save it under
34

35
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:54.450
your own account
35

36
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.580
for you to review later on.
36

37
00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.580
Now there's four main sections I want to talk about and the first section is this left hand pane here
37

38
00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.420
which you can collapse by clicking on these elements over on the left.
38

39
00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.360
If any of you have used VS code, this layout will look quite similar because it's heavily inspired by
39

40
00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.620
VS code and a lot of the structure looks a bit like that particular application as well.
40

41
00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:24.360
So all of our files are under the explorer tab and you can collapse or uncollapse by clicking on each
41

42
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.180
of these folders to view the files that are inside.
42

43
00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.780
Now we've got our dependencies listed here.
43

44
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.920
So for example if you wanted to add MongoDB or Mongoose or any of those dependencies which you've
44

45
00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.250
worked with before,
45

46
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:46.060
it's as simple as adding a dependency and searching for it from NPM. Now in the middle pane is our code
46

47
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.660
editor.
47

48
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.590
And this is where we're gonna be doing most of our work,
48

49
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:55.720
so for the majority of time, I'll ask you to collapse or reduce the size of all of the other panes so
49

50
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.720
that you can focus on the coding part.
50

51
00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:05.440
And if you want to, you can change your preferences for your sandbox here to change the font size for
51

52
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.270
example.
52

53
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.650
So I tend to prefer a little bit larger.
53

54
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.220
Or you can even change other things such as the theme or the colors.
54

55
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:19.390
But this is the middle pane and then on the right here we've got a live preview.
55

56
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:27.820
So that means if you had a say an h1 tag in here that says 'Hello', it's going to automatically refresh this
56

57
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:34.690
page to show you the most up to date version of your web app without you needing to start or stop your
57

58
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:35.140
server.
58

59
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:40.600
It's going to do that for you automatically in the background. And right at the bottom here you've got
59

60
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.280
the console.
60

61
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:48.520
So this is the same as the Chrome development tool console that we've been using previously and it's
61

62
00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.300
just a small version for the website that you are creating.
62

63
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.760
Now if this is too small, you can always pop it out in a new window so that you can see it in its full
63

64
00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:04.110
glory and you can use the Chrome developer tools if you prefer to stick with these tools as well.
64

65
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.420
Now over here there's also a problems tab which is really useful.
65

66
00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:14.460
So it means that if you make some typos or you have some errors, all of your linting errors is going to
66

67
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.880
go into the problems tab
67

68
00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.910
so you can review each of them and try to debug your code.
68

69
00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:27.000
Now if you wanted to share your code say in the Q/A or with your friends, it's
69

70
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:35.010
as simple as clicking on share and just copying the editor URL. As you can see it's pretty simple
70

71
00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.660
and it just works. In the next lesson
71

72
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:47.130
I'm going to introduce you to JSX, which is a core component of React. So head over there and let's
72

73
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.170
get started writing some React code.
