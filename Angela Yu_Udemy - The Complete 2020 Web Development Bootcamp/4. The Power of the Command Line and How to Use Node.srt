
1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:00,980
All right.
1

2
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:05,990
So now that you've got Node and Hyper installed, it's time to check it out and see what we can do
2

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:07,480
using Node.js.
3

4
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:12,890
So the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to create a new folder on my desktop.
4

5
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:15,710
But this time I'm going to do it slightly differently.
5

6
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:21,500
I'm going to be using our brand new Hyper Terminal, and we can issue it commands in order to get it to
6

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,880
do what we want.
7

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,380
So the first thing I'm going to type is pwd,
8

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,370
and this stands for print working directory,
9

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:37,170
so print where we are currently. Now working with the command line involves a little bit of imagination.
10

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,280
You have to be able to imagine where you are in this giant filing cabinet.
11

12
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,780
So, for example, you might have a cabinet and it has three drawers. Inside the first drawer
12

13
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,820
there might be three folders. Inside the first folder
13

14
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:53,720
there might be another three folders.
14

15
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:57,340
So this is how directories work on your computer.
15

16
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:03,650
And we're going to go into this in a lot more detail in the next module, where we explore everything
16

17
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:05,510
that we can do using the command line.
17

18
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:11,840
But here's a little bit of a taster, or a sneak peek, of the fun things that are yet to come.
18

19
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,520
So by using the pwd command and hitting enter,
19

20
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:22,430
we get printed out a number of lines that shows us where we are in this giant filing cabinet.
20

21
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,280
So the starting point is called the root,
21

22
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,730
and then we're inside a folder called Users,
22

23
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:31,190
and inside that folder there's another folder called angelayu.
23

24
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:37,220
So if you're used to a graphical interface, this is basically where we are. We’re inside this current folder,
24

25
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,740
and you can see that the folder above it is called Users,
25

26
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:49,040
and then if I double click on this folder called angelayu, then I get into my home folder, and from here
26

27
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,100
you can see that we have our Desktop folder.
27

28
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:59,240
So in order to move over there, then all I have to do is write cd, which is the command, and it stands for
28

29
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:05,400
change directory, or change folders, and we're going to change over to Desktop.
29

30
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:12,000
Now you can either type it out entirely, so Desktop. I don’t know why I just turned
30

31
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:19,370
Japanese just now. Or you can simply start writing, say De, and then you can hit the tab in order for
31

32
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:20,880
it to auto complete.
32

33
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:26,840
Now, for example, if you only wrote the word D and you have multiple items like Documents, Downloads, Desktop,
33

34
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,540
then it won't know what to suggest, so it won't come up with anything.
34

35
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:36,890
But if you give it enough characters for it to be able to identify a unique name, then hitting that tab key
35

36
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,400
will auto fill the rest of it.
36

37
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:46,590
So now, if I hit enter, I am now inside the Desktop folder. As you can see, that's what's showing up. At
37

38
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:53,750
the colon is our current location. And we can confirm that with the full directory path by using pwd. You can see
38

39
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:57,890
that we're inside Desktop, which is inside angelayu, which is inside Users.
39

40
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:04,330
Now once we're on to the Desktop, so I'm going to do it side by side with Finder over here as well,
40

41
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:12,650
now once we're inside Desktop, we can use a command called ls which simply just lists everything that
41

42
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,440
currently exists inside our location.
42

43
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:18,080
So now we can see what exists here.
43

44
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:23,390
And we've got something called Web Development, something called App Development, two folders.
44

45
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:30,770
Now, if I wanted to make a new folder at this current location, Desktop, all I have to do is write the
45

46
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:39,940
command make dir, or mkdir, and this makes a new directory, or rather new folder.
46

47
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:44,110
It's the equivalent of hitting right click and clicking on New Folder.
47

48
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:50,770
And then we have to specify the name of the folder, and I'm going to call mine intro-to-node.
48

49
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:54,800
So you can have it capitalized if you want, but I'm just going to keep it lower caps
49

50
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,380
and also with hyphens in between.
50

51
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,910
And now, if I hit enter, I have a new folder called intro-to-node.
51

52
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,760
Cool, right? Now, if you haven’t used command line before,
52

53
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:14,300
it really is built for power users, because we can do so much stuff that Apple or Windows has kept
53

54
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,280
away from us.
54

55
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:19,850
And I think using the graphical interface is kind of like riding a bicycle with training wheels.
55

56
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:25,760
This is more like a full blown Hayabusa motorcycle. With great power comes great responsibility, and
56

57
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,840
we're going to talk a lot more about that in the command line module that's yet to come.
57

58
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:37,190
But now that we've created our folder called intro-to-node, I'm going to then cd, or change directory, into
58

59
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,560
that folder.
59

60
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,260
And now I am inside this location,
60

61
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,320
so the equivalent of being here.
61

62
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:47,430
And if I hit ls here you can see that there's nothing.
62

63
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,300
It's completely empty so far.
63

64
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:55,570
So we're going to create a new file here, and the command for creating new files is touch.
64

65
00:04:55,580 --> 00:05:00,430
So we're going to say touch and then we're going to specify the name of the file.
65

66
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:04,240
So we're going to say touch index.js.
66

67
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,950
And now, if I hit enter, you can see, wow, brand new file that's just been created out of mid air.
67

68
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:14,990
So if we double click on this, it should open up in Atom. If it doesn't,
68

69
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:19,270
then make sure you right click and tell it where to open to, which is Atom.
69

70
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:26,690
And inside this file, we’re going to simply create a console.log that just says, “Hello, world!”
70

71
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:34,310
Up till now, we've only been able to run this code if we incorporated it into an HTML file and opened
71

72
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,330
it inside our browser.
72

73
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,390
But now we're going to do something slightly crazy.
73

74
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:46,220
We're going to run this code using our computer, and we can do that by simply being inside the folder
74

75
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:48,110
where that file exists,
75

76
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:53,270
so when I hit ls I should be able to see the file that I want to run, and then I'm going to use the
76

77
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:57,050
command node index.js. 
77

78
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:01,970
So this says use Node to run this file.
78

79
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:09,050
And now, if I hit enter, you can see that the result of that file, which was simply to console.log “Hello,
79

80
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:15,560
world!”, gets executed, and it gets logged inside my Hyper Terminal.
80

81
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,770
So that was our first Node.js file that we executed.
81

82
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:24,080
Now, in the next lesson, I want to talk to you about the REPL, the Read Evaluation Print Loop.
82

83
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,960
So for all of that and more, I’ll see you on the next lesson.
