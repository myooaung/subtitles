00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:06.780
Alright guys, it's time to put into practice what you learned in the last lesson, namely how to use
1

2
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:12.960
these import and export keywords and how to work with different files and different modules.
2

3
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:21.270
In this challenge, I want you to import the functions that live in this calculator.js file and
3

4
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:28.160
once you've imported it, it's going to be used in each of these lis to calculate a number to go on
4

5
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.500
to the website.
5

6
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:36.660
Now the results that you're aiming for is the same as this Final.png file. Four bullet points each
6

7
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.310
with a number which is calculated from each of these methods.
7

8
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:47.420
And all you need to do is figure out how to import those methods so that they can be used inside our
8

9
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.860
EJS here.
9

10
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.250
Now when you start out, you're going to get a lot of errors and a lot of warnings. Things like add is
10

11
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.400
not defined, multiply's not defined. It basically doesn't know any of these methods until you actually
11

12
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.440
figure out the code and import the correct functions.
12

13
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.230
So go ahead and fork this sandbox and try to solve this challenge.
13

14
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.520
And once you're done we can walk through it together.
14

15
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.310
All right.
15

16
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:18.870
So the first thing we're going to do is go into our calculator.js because we need to export all
16

17
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.470
of the functions that we want to be accessible from other files.
17

18
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.980
So in this case I have no default thing that I want to export. I actually want to export all of these
18

19
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.180
functions separately.
19

20
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:38.020
So I'm going to add the add function, the multiply, subtract and divide.
20

21
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.700
Now remember that at this stage you don't want to add any parentheses to these functions.
21

22
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:49.890
We're just exporting the function as it is without activating or calling it. Once I've exported all of
22

23
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:50.670
these functions
23

24
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.540
I can now go back to my index.js and I can import all of the ones that I want from that file.
24

25
00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.930
So at this stage I've got two options really. I could either use a wildcard form where I input everything
25

26
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:13.140
packaged under one name, or I can import each of them separately. So I can go ahead and say add, subtract,
26

27
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.450
multiply and divide.
27

28
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:22.500
Now notice the order in which you import these methods don't have to be the same as the order that you
28

29
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.550
export it
29

30
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:33.450
as long as the names match precisely, so like what I've got here. Now next I have to specify where or which
30

31
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.820
file I'm importing from.
31

32
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.580
And in my case I'm gonna use a relative path to my calculator.js file.
32

33
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:48.510
So now that we've imported all of these functions our errors have gone away and our website is now working
33

34
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.780
and looking exactly the same as what we've got in the sample, the final.png.
34

35
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.930
This is one way of solving it.
35

36
00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.750
Another way that you could have done this is to use the wildcard
36

37
00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:01.320
right?
37

38
00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:07.500
So you could've added an asterix and you could've given that particular module a name, so we could call it
38

39
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.480
calculator.
39

40
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:15.480
And then down here instead of just writing add or multiply, what we have to do instead is we have to
40

41
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:23.670
add calculator.add, because this calculator is the object and it contains a whole bunch of functions
41

42
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.110
that corresponds to the ones that we exported.
42

43
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.200
So now I could add calculator.add or .multiplied, .subtract and .divide.
43

44
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.960
And this now works perfectly as well.
44

45
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.910
So you have lots and lots of options and it's important that you understand that both of these methods
45

46
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.530
work so that when you come across them in the wild you won't be confused and you'll understand what
46

47
00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:47.820
it does.
47

48
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:53.340
So have a play around with this file if there's anything that you're still unsure about. And once
48

49
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.770
you're already come and join us back on the next lesson where we're going to learn about how to set up
49

50
00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.180
our local environment for React development.
50

51
00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.650
So for all of that and more, I'll see there.
