00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.650
To set up your project for this challenge the first thing I want you to do is to head over to your console
1

2
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.370
and while nodemon is running you can see that we don't have our prompt, our dollar sign right?
2

3
00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.320
So that means the server is running using nodemon.
3

4
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.170
I want you to type rs and hit enter.
4

5
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.370
And what this does is it forces nodemon to restart,
5

6
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:26.880
that's what rs stands for, and what that means is that it will rerun apps.js which if you remember
6

7
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.920
will make our posts array become an empty array again.
7

8
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.430
So it deletes any of the posts that we currently have in our home page.
8

9
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.070
And from this blank slate I want you to head over to compose and to create a single blog post that has
9

10
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.240
the title of Test. And it's really important that you have the same title as I have here.
10

11
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.620
And then inside the post you can write any sort of mumbojumbo or simply head over to Lorem Ipsum and
11

12
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.010
put in some Lorem Ipsum text in there.
12

13
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.260
So now we have a single blog post.
13

14
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.640
Now here comes the goal of the challenge.
14

15
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:09.140
Now we know that we already have this post with a title of text stored inside our post array.
15

16
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.290
And you can refresh the page a couple of times just to make sure that it's definitely there
16

17
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.560
and we haven't emptied out our post array when we updated our app.js.
17

18
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:27.540
The aim of this challenge is if we can type /posts/test spelt out exactly the
18

19
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.960
same as the title of our blog post,
19

20
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:38.010
then when I hit enter and I go over to our console I should be able to see match found.
20

21
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:46.650
So I want you to write the code inside app.js that checks whether if this parameter value is equal
21

22
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.870
to a title of a post that we've got inside our posts array.
22

23
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.160
And if that's true then you're going to log match found.
23

24
00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.420
Simple as that. And your code has to work even if the word is different
24

25
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.010
right? So it'll be /posts/testing.
25

26
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.450
And when I hit enter it should say match found.
26

27
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:15.180
Now at this point we're not too worried yet about the casing so I'm typing it exactly as I see as the
27

28
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.310
post title.
28

29
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.300
I'm not changing its casing and I'm also not adding two words right?
29

30
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.830
We're going to deal with that a little bit later on.
30

31
00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.430
Pause the video and see if you can complete this challenge.
31

32
00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:37.220
Now the first hint is instead of console logging the value of the post name which were getting through
32

33
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.600
the URL as a parameter value,
33

34
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.950
I want you to save it into a variable.
34

35
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:53.600
So say something like const requestedTitle is equal to req.params.postName.
35

36
00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:02.640
So now we can check this requestedTitle against all of the titles inside our posts array.
36

37
00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.940
Now try out the challenge again and see if this hint helps you to complete it.
37

38
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.020
All right so here comes
38

39
00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.320
hint number 2.
39

40
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.500
Now remember that our posts is an array
40

41
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:22.360
right? It's an array of post objects and post objects look like this.
41

42
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.670
They have two key value pairs, one that's called title and one that's called content.
42

43
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.970
What we need to do here in order to complete the challenge is we need to check if our requestedTitle
43

44
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.570
matches against any of the titles inside our posts array.
44

45
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:45.730
But because it's an array, we have to loop through the array in order to reach each and every post object
45

46
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.370
to check its title.
46

47
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:54.640
Remember how we used arrays in the past and see if this hint now helps you to complete the challenge.
