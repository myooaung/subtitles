Hey.
1

2
00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:03.880
Well done for getting through another module.
2

3
00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:11.520
Now today I want to talk to you about what to do when the goal just seems really really far away.
3

4
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:18.610
You might be sitting there thinking, "Oh man. I've still got so much stuff to learn and there's so
4

5
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:19.750
many things I don't know.
5

6
00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.960
And it seems like the more I learn the more it seems like there's more stuff to learn."
6

7
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.690
So what should you do if you feel like this?
7

8
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:41.980
Now a few years back I was in Africa and I was climbing Mount Kilimanjaro and one of the things that
8

9
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:52.390
really bothers me is that even though I'm trudging along like day by day it felt like as if the peak
9

10
00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.760
was just like really far away.
10

11
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.870
And it was getting further and further away.
11

12
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.320
It didn't feel like I was making progress even though I felt like I was working really hard.
12

13
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:14.940
And at this point the guide for the National Park just said just look down at your feet just look at
13

14
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:26.880
your feet taking steps one by one and I tried a try just looking at every step as I went along.
14

15
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:35.610
And surprisingly just by focusing on completing the one small task like putting one foot in front of
15

16
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:43.730
the other and not thinking about anything else like grand goals of something, I actually got that far
16

17
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.460
pretty quickly.
17

18
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:51.120
And when I looked up it was like whoa! I've actually gone a really long distance.
18

19
00:01:51.120 --> 00:02:00.130
So I guess what I'm trying to say is that you know a lot of things that are worth doing are quite large
19

20
00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:07.810
goals and if you focus on that large goal it can feel like you're like an ant that's moving along and
20

21
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.240
you're not making much progress.
21

22
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.620
So don't focus on the end.
22

23
00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.990
Just focus on doing one step at a time.
23

24
00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:23.590
Just cram in one hour a day of coding or just solving one coding challenge.
24

25
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.360
And the more that you do this
25

26
00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.950
I mean it's the laws of physics right?
26

27
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.520
You're eventually going to get there
27

28
00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:36.250
but it just won't feel like it's as far away or it takes quite as long.
28

29
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.450
So try doing that the next time you feel like your goals are really out of reach.
29

30
00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:49.000
And as long as you're making daily progress then the laws of physics state that you eventually have
30

31
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.930
to get there right?
31

32
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.350
So keep going is what I'm trying to say.
32

33
00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.130
You're doing great.
