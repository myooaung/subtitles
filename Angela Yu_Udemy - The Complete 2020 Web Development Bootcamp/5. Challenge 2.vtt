00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.050
All right guys.
1

2
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.570
Here comes the challenge
2

3
00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.190
number 2. Are you ready?
3

4
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:05.520
All right.
4

5
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:13.230
So in the app.js when you first downloaded it we had three of these constants at the top and
5

6
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.330
they just contain a whole bunch of Lorem Ipsum and randomly generated text.
6

7
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:25.200
But let's say that this is some content that's in our server and we want to be able to deliver it over
7

8
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.900
to our home page using EJS.
8

9
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.040
Now this challenge is about doing exactly that.
9

10
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:38.070
How much can you make this home starting content be displayed inside our home page inside a paragraph
10

11
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:45.540
tag so that when you head over to our home page on localhost:3000 you not only get the h1 that says
11

12
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:52.420
home, but also the same text that's held inside that constant which is home starting content?
12

13
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.890
So that's the challenge. Pause the video now and give it a go.
13

14
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.620
All right.
14

15
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.830
So currently inside home.ejs
15

16
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.680
all that we have is an h1 tag.
16

17
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:14.160
Now in order to complete this challenge we need to also have a paragraph element in here. And the text
17

18
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:21.420
that's going to go into that paragraph element is going to be the text that's inside home starting content.
18

19
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.720
So you'll need to render that variable using the correct EJS tag in order to see the content in this
19

20
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.830
page.
20

21
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.860
So with that hint and maybe a little bit of googling around what we just talked about, see if you
21

22
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.820
can complete the challenge now.
22

23
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.570
All right.
23

24
00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.530
Here's my second hint.
24

25
00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:46.810
So we know that we need to have a paragraph element in here. And in between the paragraph element is the
25

26
00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.500
text that we want to show up on our Web page.
26

27
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:57.710
So the text that we want is going to be rendered dynamically using EJS. And to do that we need the
27

28
00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.960
EJS tag that does that.
28

29
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:07.510
So if we head over to the EJS docs, you can see the tag that we've been using so far which is the one
29

30
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:14.320
that outputs the value of a variable into the template. And it's in fact even the one that they show
30

31
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:22.120
in the header. And in between that tag is going to be the name of the variable that you passed over to
31

32
00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.750
the EJS template.
32

33
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.360
So with that hint see if you can now complete the challenge.
33

34
00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.430
OK.
34

35
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.650
This is hint number 3. Inside this paragraph tag
35

36
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:42.210
let's add that EJS tag that we showed you earlier on the one with a angle, a percentage sign and
36

37
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:48.750
an equal sign in the closing part of the tag is just a percentage sign and an angle bracket.
37

38
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:55.650
Now in between these two parts is going to be in the name of the variable that we're going to pass into
38

39
00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.180
here.
39

40
00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.220
So let's give it a name. Let's call it just starting content.
40

41
00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.980
And now we need to pass over a variable with that name to our home.
41

42
00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.370
ejs from our server, our app.js.
42

43
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:17.000
So see if with that hint you can now complete the challenge.
43

44
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:18.200
All right.
44

45
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.460
This is my fourth and final hint.
45

46
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:28.270
Currently our res.render method is only rendering the home.ejs page.
46

47
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:35.610
If we wanted to pass in a variable, we would add a comma and then we would pass over a Javascript object.
47

48
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:42.850
So we know that Javascript objects are a key value pairs that are inside a set of curly braces.
48

49
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.450
So you need to provide a key and a value.
49

50
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.140
The key is going to be the variable that you'll be able to tap into
50

51
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.270
inside your home.
51

52
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:59.710
ejs and the value is whatever it is that you want to pass over that comes from this current page which
52

53
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:01.300
is the app.js.
53

54
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:07.660
Now with my final hint see if you can now finally complete the challenge.
