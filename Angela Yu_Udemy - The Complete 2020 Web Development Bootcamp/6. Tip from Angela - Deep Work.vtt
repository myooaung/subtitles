Hey. Well-done on achieving yet another module. Today I kind of wanted to talk about the concept of deep
1

2
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.260
work.
2

3
00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:21.100
There's a really good book called "Deep work" that I recommend everybody read actually.
3

4
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:31.010
And it goes into like what consists of deep work and how do you get into a deep state of flow where
4

5
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.570
you're able to produce your best work.
5

6
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.740
Now I think this concept of deep work is also really applicable to learning.
6

7
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:50.510
Like when you're in flow, when you're really using your brain, that state is so precious.
7

8
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:58.160
And what I often see is that sometimes people think that you know just because you're sitting at your
8

9
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.320
desk just because you're putting in the hours and you're staring at the screen then you're learning.
9

10
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:12.420
You're probably not right? Like unless you are actively engaged, unless you are you know the brain is
10

11
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:19.410
fresh and you're making those connections and things are like just making sense for you and you're able
11

12
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.180
to understand what's going on
12

13
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.280
you're able to apply it.
13

14
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:31.790
If you're sitting there like hangover, sleep deprived, like just had pizza for lunch,
14

15
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:39.990
even if you just sit there and like for many hours, it's not going to achieve the results that you want.
15

16
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:49.100
So one of the things that I'm really disciplined about is work is work and play is play.
16

17
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:57.600
So what I try to do is that when I'm sitting down to work, I am at 95% if not 100% focused
17

18
00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:58.990
on what it is I'm doing.
18

19
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:06.980
I'm not really thinking about like like what am I going to eat later on or what shall I do for fun.
19

20
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.530
And I'm just trying to put all my attention on this one thing.
20

21
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:21.630
Now when I'm actually relaxing like when I have time off work, I try to not think about work at all. Like
21

22
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:29.370
I won't think about, "I have this thing tomorrow which I have to do." Or like, "Oh like maybe I should just
22

23
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.610
try doing a little bit of this work or that work."
23

24
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:40.200
No. Like try to make sure that when you are sitting down to work, that's all you think about and when
24

25
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.260
you're having a relaxation time just that's all you do.
25

26
00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:51.110
This way if you become more disciplined around this, you'll find that your brain actually gets into the
26

27
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:57.530
rhythm when it sits down to actually doing work rather than just sort of pretending to work right?
27

28
00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.390
So have a go at that and see if that helps you.
