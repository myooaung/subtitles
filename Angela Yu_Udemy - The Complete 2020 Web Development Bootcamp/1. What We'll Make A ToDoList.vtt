Welcome back guys and girls. In this module we're going to be learning about Partials and what we can

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.290
do with them.

3
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.050
And the project that we're going to build while we're learning this is a To Do list app.
3

4
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.420
So this is what you will end up with by the end of the module and it's a beautiful To Do list.
4

5
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:27.040
It will show you the current date and month at the top and you get to check off your to do list items.
5

6
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.950
And you also get to add new items which will get added to your To Do list.

7
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.970
And in the process of building this we'ill be learning about templating, Partials and a whole bunch more.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.810
So I hope you're excited to build this project with me.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.370
And once you are ready let's get started.
