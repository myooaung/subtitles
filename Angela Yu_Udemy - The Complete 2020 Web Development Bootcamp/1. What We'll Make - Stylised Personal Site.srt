00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:00,880
All right.
1

2
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:08,490
So we've already come pretty far in our journey of creating and beautifying this CV web site that we
2

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:09,240
have here.
3

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,770
But we're no longer really aspiring to be computer science professors.
4

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:21,280
So we're going to have to take a slightly different path and instead we want to be hired as web developers.
5

6
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:25,170
Unfortunately we're never going to get hired with a web site that looks like this.
6

7
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,780
So we have to aspire to greater heights.
7

8
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:35,160
And we want to create a web site that looks and resembles more like a professional personal site with
8

9
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:41,700
a beautiful interface and a few brief notes about what you can do and how people can contact you.
9

10
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:48,390
So we're going to pay homage to one of the best personal sites on the Internet which is this web site
10

11
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,510
by Sean Halpin.
11

12
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:56,010
And for the rest of this module we're going to make a web site that looks more similar to this and less
12

13
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:00,020
similar to our computer science professors’ CV web sites.
13

14
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,520
So once you’re ready,
14

15
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:07,440
I have a challenge for you and that is to create a brand new project.
15

16
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:14,220
So that means you have to create a new folder called CSS - My Site, and you have to create an index.html
16

17
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:20,490
page inside that folder, and then you're going to add all of that HTML boilerplate code that you
17

18
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:25,590
will need for any web site and you're going to give your website a title of your name and mine would
18

19
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,950
be Angela Yu for example.
19

20
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:34,920
And then you’re going to create a css folder and a styles.css file, and then you're going to
20

21
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:41,330
link up your styles.css file with your html file, and you're going to check to make sure that
21

22
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:47,610
it works by giving your web site an ugly blue background color or which ever other ugly colors you can
22

23
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:48,280
think of.
23

24
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,920
It's completely up to you.
24

25
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:58,550
So pause the video now and complete this challenge. So inside Atom we're going to close off what we were
25

26
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:59,890
previously working on,
26

27
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:03,960
be that the CSS bacon fansite or the HTML personal site,
27

28
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:11,030
if you’ve got any of these open, then just right click and remove it from the left hand pane. Now you're
28

29
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:17,300
going to go into whichever folder you've decided to store all of your web development projects and you're
29

30
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:22,530
going to right click and create a new folder that is going to be called 
30

31
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:31,690
CSS - My Site, and you're going to go back to Atom and you're going to add this to the left hand pane by clicking
31

32
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,200
on Add Project Folder.
32

33
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,620
And the one that we're going to pick is that brand new folder that has nothing contained inside.
33

34
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:38,920
All right.
34

35
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:44,820
So here's our brand new project folder and I'm going to go into it and create a new file.
35

36
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,600
And this is going to be our home page or our index.html.
36

37
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:56,080
And inside this brand new html file I'm going to add in the HTML boilerplate code just by using auto
37

38
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:02,090
suggest and I'm going to give my Web site a title of my name which is Angela Yu.
38

39
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,190
That's me.
39

40
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:11,530
And now I'm going to create a new folder inside this project folder and it's going to be called css
40

41
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:18,700
and inside that css folder I'm going to create a new styles.css file.
41

42
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:25,350
So now I have a style sheet and I'm going to link it up with my html using it as an external stylesheet.
42

43
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,120
So I'm going to insert a link that has a relationship of stylesheet.
43

44
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:39,100
Now you can also add a type of text/css but this is optional if you want and it doesn't really
44

45
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,310
matter if you have it there or not.
45

46
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:47,280
Now what does matter though is that you correctly point to where your styles.css exists.
46

47
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:54,630
So in our case it exists inside a folder called css at the same hierarchical level as our index.html
47

48
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,860
which is the current file we’re inside.
48

49
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,880
And then it's called styles.css.
49

50
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,910
And finally just to check that everything worked out correctly.
50

51
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:12,850
Let's go inside the body and let's add a background color of say blue which is going to be that pretty
51

52
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,210
awful looking color.
52

53
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:20,350
But now we can check to make sure that everything worked by right clicking on the index.html and
53

54
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:27,710
clicking on Copy Full Path then going into Chrome and just pasting that into the browser bar.
54

55
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:28,680
And there we go.
55

56
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:35,290
This is our brand new beautiful site that is just a blue background but that means that everything we've
56

57
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,870
done so far has worked out.
57

58
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:40,280
And you can see our title is showing up up here as well.
58

59
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:46,210
And I'm going to get rid of this and I'm going to close down this previous site we had back over here
59

60
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:51,880
and we're now going to focus on working on this new site that we're creating and we're going to try
60

61
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,140
and make it look similar to a professional web designer’s personal site.
