All right guys. I need this lesson we're going to be using what we learned so far about setting up a new
1

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:14,520
web site with a server using Node and Express to create a really simple web site that acts as a calculator,
2

3
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:21,570
so I can simply enter maybe two numbers, 5 and 6, and I hit calculate, and I get the result back.
3

4
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:28,110
Now, in the process of building this, we're going to get to create our very first web application,
4

5
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,260
and it's not just a web site anymore.
5

6
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:37,710
Up till now we've only been making essentially static web sites, right, where our browser will make a
6

7
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:44,340
request to the server and the server sends back the CSS, the HTML, the Javascript files.
7

8
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,960
And if there's any Javascript code that needs to be run, it gets run on the client side,
8

9
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:56,640
basically our userâ€™s browser. And that Javascript gets sent to the browser and run when the user loads
9

10
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,130
up the web site.
10

11
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,830
Now in this lesson we're going to be making our code run server side.
11

12
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:09,780
So when our web site makes a request to our server, it's going to execute the code and only deliver the
12

13
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:16,370
outcome back to the user, so the user doesn't get to see any of the code and logic of our calculator.
13

14
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,610
It's all done on our server.
14

15
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:25,290
And once we grasp this concept, then we'll be able to make much faster, more complex web sites that can
15

16
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,840
do computation before it even renders the web site to be delivered to the user,
16

17
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:37,920
and we'll be able to interact with databases, and query, and search, and manipulate our databases, and create
17

18
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:41,310
much more interesting web applications.
18

19
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:46,610
So this is the core concept that we're going to tackle in the coming lessons of this module.
19

20
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,780
But first there's a challenge.
20

21
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,260
So head over to the next lesson and get started.
