1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,510
All right.
1

2
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,200
So it's time to practice what you've learned so far.
2

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:10,260
Go ahead and head over to the course resources, get the link for this practice session and then open
3

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:11,760
up in your browser.
4

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:18,030
And then of course fork it so that you have your own copy of it in your sandbox and then go ahead and
5

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,740
look through these comments and try to complete this challenge.
6

7
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,200
We're going to be creating a React app from scratch again.
7

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,260
It should display two paragraph HTML elements.
8

9
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:36,180
The first paragraph should say, "Created by..." and then we're going to add in a constant with your name, and then
9

10
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,580
the second one is a little bit harder.
10

11
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:43,520
It should say the copyright of your website and the current year.
11

12
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:49,230
I have a bit of a pet peeve of websites which have the copyright which is hard coded.
12

13
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:56,340
So I really want you guys to dig through your knowledge of JavaScript and if you've dug and you can't
13

14
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:03,510
find anything then head over to Google and try to see if you can figure out how to get this copyright
14

15
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,690
to be a dynamic date.
15

16
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:15,840
So instead of having it hard coded as 2019 when we enter 2020 or 2021 whichever year it may be right now,
16

17
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:22,860
the copyright should actually be updated using your Javascript code.
17

18
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,690
So there's a bit of React challenge in here, there's a bit of JSX Challenge and there's also a bit
18

19
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,440
of plain vanilla Javascript challenge for you.
19

20
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:37,430
I hope you'll give it a go. Pause the video and then come back here and we'll go through the solution together.
20

21
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,140
All right.
21

22
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:50,230
So we're getting quite a lot of practice creating React apps from scratch and there's good reason behind
22

23
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:55,340
this because it means that when you create it yourself, it's going to be a lot easier and it's going
23

24
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,560
to be like second nature.
24

25
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:03,730
So I've just imported React and ReactDOM from our two modules over here and then I'm gonna go ahead
25

26
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:09,330
and use our ReactDOM to render some HTML.
26

27
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,490
So we're gonna display two paragraph elements.
27

28
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:17,580
So we've got the first one and we've got the second one.
28

29
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:25,480
So the first one should say something like, "Created by..." and then we're going to put your name or my name
29

30
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:34,450
in my case. And then we got a copyright and we're going to somehow add in the current year.
30

31
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:35,800
That's what we're after.
31

32
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:40,000
And of course we can't render more than one HTML element
32

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,880
so I'm going to wrap it inside a div.
33

34
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,430
All right.
34

35
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,150
So now that we've gone what to render
35

36
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:57,600
let's go ahead and get our document, getElementById and fetch that root div in order to render this
36

37
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,600
inside this.
37

38
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:07,050
So now we can see our Created by YOURNAME, Copyright CURRENTYEAR which is not very exciting but let's
38

39
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:11,070
go ahead and insert some javascript into our HTML.
39

40
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:15,810
So the first constant I'm going to create is going to be a name constant.
40

41
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,350
And it's going to be my name.
41

42
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:23,970
And then the second constant is going to be a year constant.
42

43
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:29,730
And for now I'm just going to hardcoded as 2019 so that we can see it inserted in here.
43

44
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:36,210
So our paragraph is going to get a set of curly braces. In the set of curly braces
44

45
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:39,300
I'm going to specify the name of my constant right here.
45

46
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,100
So that goes in there.
46

47
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,210
Created by Angela.
47

48
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,050
And then the copyright is going to have the current year.
48

49
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,330
So let's insert that year constant into here.
49

50
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,390
So this is what it should look like.
50

51
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,690
But here comes the slightly more challenging part right?
51

52
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,110
We said we don't want this to be hard coded.
52

53
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:05,310
So we want to be able to use Javascript to fetch the current year rather than hard coding it in like
53

54
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,330
this.
54

55
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,980
So how can we do that?
55

56
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:14,040
So if you don't know how to do this or you've forgotten which is perfectly likely when I switch around
56

57
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,010
between different languages I get confused too sometimes.
57

58
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:22,120
And it's good to know that Google and Stack Overflow are always there for you.
58

59
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,840
So here's a question, get the current year in JavaScript.
59

60
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,970
Sounds pretty much like what we want to do.
60

61
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:33,090
So we're gonna have to create a new date object and then we call the method getFullYear and they've
61

62
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:40,590
even very helpfully linked to the Mozilla developer docs here so we can learn a bit more about it before
62

63
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:42,200
we use it.
63

64
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:48,840
So this method is supposed to return the year of the specified date and of course you can either create
64

65
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:57,060
the date yourself or in our case we're going to be using new date and this gives us the current date
65

66
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,350
right now.
66

67
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:05,610
So if we go back over here and we create a new constant, which is the current date, and we set it equal
67

68
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,130
new Date.
68

69
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:13,100
So this object should now equal the current date when I am recording right now.
69

70
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:21,900
So if I go ahead and just log the value of current date and then go ahead and hit save and check in
70

71
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:30,150
our console you can see that it's Friday November the 8th 2019 and that's this time and I'm on Greenwich
71

72
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:37,070
Mean Time right now because I'm recording in London. Now that we've got hold of the current date we can
72

73
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:46,820
get the current year by using that date and calling that method getFullYear. And now because it is a method
73

74
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:53,300
we of course have to add the parentheses at the end so that we can confirm and check that the year that
74

75
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:58,260
we've got hold of is indeed 20 19 which is indeed the current year.
75

76
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:06,950
So now let's go ahead and delete that and instead of console logging it, it's going to be inserted into
76

77
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,020
our paragraph element.
77

78
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:22,550
And when the date changes say it's now 2022, June the 1st, then we're going to get 2022 inserted into
78

79
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:29,300
our year because it's going to be dynamically calculated based on the current date.
79

80
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,530
So there you go.
80

81
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,630
Did you manage to get that right?
81

82
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:40,070
If not, have a play around with the code as you have it here and a link to it as a completed sandbox
82

83
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,040
in the course resources for this lesson.
83

84
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:49,580
Now one common mistake that students make is they forget these parentheses and what happens in this
84

85
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:57,230
case is it's not going to work because this is a method. But even worse if we actually tried to put that
85

86
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:04,130
in here instead of creating that year constant then we actually get a warning from the console saying
86

87
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,790
functions are not valid as a React child.
87

88
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:12,560
So what this is saying is getFullYear is a function.
88

89
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:20,270
And if we don't add the parentheses at the end, it's as if we're trying to pass in a function as the
89

90
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:27,980
value which of course doesn't work because unless we execute the function and call it which is denoted
90

91
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:34,460
by these parentheses, then it's not going to give us the value that we want. You can of course insert
91

92
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:44,060
the code inside here as a Javascript expression because it evaluates to a value the 2019 in this case
92

93
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:51,380
or you can create a constant as we did before where you work it out, assign it to a constant and then
93

94
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:59,720
put the constant into our HTML element. Either of these ways work and if you want to take a look
94

95
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:07,700
at this completed code, I've included this sandbox inside the course resources for this lesson in this
95

96
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,290
current completed state.
96

97
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:15,140
So if there's anything that you're not sure about, have a  play around with it and try changing things
97

98
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:20,420
around until you're comfortable with the code and the JSX and the Javascript that we've covered
98

99
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:27,680
in this lesson. And then we can head over to the next lesson and we can start learning more about styling
99

100
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:34,010
our HTML elements using React. So for all of that and more, I'll see you on the next lesson.
