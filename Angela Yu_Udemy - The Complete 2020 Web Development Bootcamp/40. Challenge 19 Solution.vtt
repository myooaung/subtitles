00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:00.690
All right.
1

2
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.940
So here comes the answer.
2

3
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.670
We know that in order to render the page we need to do it when the storedTitle matches the requested
3

4
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:09.540
Title.
4

5
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.690
So we need to do it somewhere in between the set of curly braces here.
5

6
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.790
And so I'm going to delete the console.log
6

7
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.700
and I'm also going to delete the else statement because we don't need it. Now
7

8
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.290
inside here is where I'm going to render my post.
8

9
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.070
ejs.
9

10
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.760
But before I render it, let's set it up first. Just as we have in our home.ejs
10

11
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:36.680
we've got our partials right? And that's the first thing we're going to add to any new web page.
11

12
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:45.480
Let's go ahead and include our header and our footer into our new page. And then in between is where our
12

13
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.630
code is going to go.
13

14
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.470
We need to have an h1 which is going to have the title
14

15
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:56.480
and then we're going to have a paragraph element which is going to have the body of the blog post.
15

16
00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:03.450
Now inside the h1 I'm going to add some EJS tags which is going to give me the value of a variable
16

17
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.940
that I pass over. And that variable
17

18
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:12.240
I'm going to simply name title. And I'm going to do the same inside the paragraph tag
18

19
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.170
but in this case I'm going to call that variable content.
19

20
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.900
So now I have to figure out a way of passing over these two variables over to our post.ejs.
20

21
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.370
Inside our app.js is where I'm going to do that.
21

22
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.830
And if we remind ourselves of how we did this in our previous route say how we rendered our home page,
22

23
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.710
then you can see we use the res.render method
23

24
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.620
then there's two parameters we provide.
24

25
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.960
The first one is the name of the page we want to render
25

26
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.960
then there's a comma and then there's a set of curly braces where we pass in a Javascript object with
26

27
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.380
key value pairs that contain the thing that we want,
27

28
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.840
the new page to be able to access and the thing that we want to pass over. Down here
28

29
00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.630
what we need to do is we need to again use res.render and the page that we want to render is this
29

30
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.050
post page right?
30

31
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.410
So we'll put that in there and then we have a comma and we open up a set of curly braces.
31

32
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:13.800
Now inside here is where we pass over everything that the post.ejs needs and it needs two things.
32

33
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.500
One called title, one called content.
33

34
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.650
So let's add those keys in first.
34

35
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.440
So one is called title one is called content.
35

36
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.550
Now we have to decide what to pass over as the values for those two keys.
36

37
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:35.400
Now because we're currently still inside the FOR loop then you can see that once this triggers and it's
37

38
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.800
true that we still have access to this post object
38

39
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:40.420
right?
39

40
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:48.150
For each and every post inside the post array we check to see if it has a title that matches the requested
40

41
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.920
Title.
41

42
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:55.380
And if that is true then we're going to render the post.ejs page and we're going to pass over that
42

43
00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:03.880
current post's title and then comma and we're going to pass over the current post's content.
43

44
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:11.430
So now let's close everything off with semicolons and save our app.js and let's go ahead and
44

45
00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.720
test our website.
45

46
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.410
Let's call it Day 1.
46

47
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:31.780
And now if I head over to /posts/day-1 hit enter, bam! We've got our new Web
47

48
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.910
page created for us on the fly through the use of EJS and express.
48

49
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.350
I've created another post
49

50
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:48.130
and I just want to show you that this is really where you start seeing the power of EJS. Previously
50

51
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.410
we've been creating new EJS files for home, for about us, for contact us.
51

52
00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:02.320
But now every time we create a new blog post then we get a brand new page that simply created using
52

53
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:03.930
an EJS template.
53

54
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.780
So now if we head over to /posts/day-1
54

55
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:16.210
then we get access to this brand new page with the content of the Day 1 blog post. And then -2
55

56
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:22.270
then we get a new page, -3 we get a new page and you can see that this is just a template and the
56

57
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.640
only thing that's changing in this post template is the actual content.
57

58
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.860
And because all of our blog posts are going to be formatted the same way, it's going to look the same
58

59
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:33.400
way,
59

60
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.170
the only changes are the text content. And
60

61
00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.230
this is how we can use EJS to create a massive website with lots of content
61

62
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:47.970
but creating these pages dynamically through the use of templating. Feel free to mess around with that.
62

63
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.780
Once you're done
63

64
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:54.460
head over to the next lesson where are we going to finish off this project with just two more challenges.
