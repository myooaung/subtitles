Now I know a lot of you are taking this course because you want to build your own project, your own app.
1

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:12,300
Now what are some of the things to think about when you want to pursue this path of becoming an entrepreneur
2

3
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,370
or starting a startup?
3

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,480
Now one of the first things to think about...
4

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:25,950
now one of the most important things is to know what are the most core features of this product. Really
5

6
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,000
get clarity.
6

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,170
Map it out, draw it out, write out all the bullets, all the functionality that you want and then simplify
7

8
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:41,400
it. Boil it down to the core fundamental thing that is different about your product and how it's going
8

9
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,330
to stand out in the market.
9

10
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:49,570
And once you've got that clarity then try to build that simplest version of your product.
10

11
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,280
Don't start right at the end.
11

12
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,670
I often hear students who say I want to build something that is a cross between Facebook and Twitter
12

13
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:02,450
with a sprinkle of Snapchat and that project is probably not going to happen.
13

14
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:06,750
If it does, it's not going to go well because it's too ambitious to start with.
14

15
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:12,960
What you want to do is you want to start off building something like a skateboard, and then you build
15

16
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,890
something more like a pushbike and then you go up to a bicycle and then you go up to a car. Instead of
16

17
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,670
just you know setting your ambitions on 'I'm going to build this fantastic Ferrari'
17

18
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:31,250
and then when your motivation kind of wanes you only built four wheels and nobody can use it.
18

19
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:35,250
It's not going to motivate you to keep building and you'll probably give up on the project.
19

20
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,050
So start small.
20

21
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:42,470
Start with the core functionality. Build it and then get feedback.
21

22
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:48,090
The quicker that you can get into this feedback loop where people are using your product and giving
22

23
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:53,790
you tips on what else they would like to see or what are the things that are not working so well in
23

24
00:01:53,790 --> 00:02:01,260
the app or what are the things that would really improve their user experience, then you can start improving
24

25
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:07,050
on it and then you're getting into a product development cycle. And that is really really crucial for
25

26
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,750
success as an entrepreneur.
26

27
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,950
So have a think about some of those things I said and see if you can apply them to your project.
