00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:00.580
All right.
1

2
00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.320
Are you ready for the answer for this challenge?
2

3
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.650
Now we know that we firstly need to include a header and a footer.
3

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.480
So let's head into this compose.ejs page which is currently empty
4

5
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.970
and add in those partials, the header and footer.
5

6
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.440
And again to save time I'm just going to copy and paste this over here.
6

7
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.550
But you should try and type it out if you have the time.
7

8
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.580
Now inside here instead of having an h1 that says home it's going to be an h1 that says compose.
8

9
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.370
And we don't have a paragraph tag
9

10
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.350
instead we want a input that's of type text.
10

11
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:42.720
I'm going to leave the name to be blank for now but I'm going to delete this value over here. And the other
11

12
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.790
element we need is a button element and it's type
12

13
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:54.620
is going to be of type submit so that when we click on it our form gets submitted. So later on when we create
13

14
00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:01.370
a form around this and we click on this button, it'll submit our form. And in between all tags we're going
14

15
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.720
to give up button a title of publish.
15

16
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.060
So now if we hit save
16

17
00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.020
this is still not enough to render a compose page.
17

18
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:17.130
Remember if we want to be able to reach it through our server then we need to add a get method.
18

19
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:28.280
So app.get, when people trying to get or reach /compose we're going to respond with res.
19

20
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.600
render the compose page and we're not going to pass over any data for this page.
20

21
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:44.440
So now if we hit save and we refresh our website we should be able to head over to home and if we change
21

22
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:51.250
the URL to compose then that should take us to our compose page with our h1, our text input and our
22

23
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.610
button.
