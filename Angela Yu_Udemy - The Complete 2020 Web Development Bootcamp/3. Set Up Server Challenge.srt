00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:06,460
So now that we've created the data in our database the next step is to create our server.
1

2
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:09,840
So we're going back from database to server to client.
2

3
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:14,760
So in order to do this there's a number of steps which are pretty much boilerplate.
3

4
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:19,750
It's what you're going to do every time when you set up a new server that uses MongoDB.
4

5
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,090
And we've really done it plenty of times before
5

6
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,410
so I'm going to set this to you as a challenge.
6

7
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:31,090
So the first thing you have to do is to create a new directory called Wiki-API and then we're going
7

8
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:39,430
to initialize NPM and install 4 packages: body-parser, mongoose, ejs and express. And then we're
8

9
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:46,600
going to create a new file called app.js and inside app.js we're going to add our server code.
9

10
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:52,810
So that includes requiring all those modules that we installed and initializing express and setting
10

11
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:53,710
body-parser up.
11

12
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,560
Now this is something that you need to do every single time.
12

13
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:02,590
And if you prefer instead of writing it all now you can also go to that repository at github.com
13

14
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:04,780
/londonappbrewery/
14

15
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:11,770
Build-Your-Own-RESTful-API and then if you scroll down you can see that there's some service starting
15

16
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:18,450
code that I have put there for you which you can copy and paste into your app.js.
16

17
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:23,260
Now alternatively some students prefer to get extra practice and they try and write it all out.
17

18
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:27,000
So it's completely up to you which method you want to go down.
18

19
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:34,000
And once you've set up your server then the next step is to setup MongoDB and our database name as
19

20
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:40,180
you remember is called wikiDB and the collection that it contains is called articles and all the
20

21
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:48,590
documents in the article collection has two fields: title and content. So using all of that information
21

22
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:56,090
you should be able to set up a connection with MongoDB and be able to create the models that you
22

23
00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:02,960
need with Mongoose and be able to set it up. So give that a go and if you get stuck or if you have any
23

24
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,880
problems head back over here and I'll walk you through the entire process.
