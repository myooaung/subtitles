All right.

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,710
So here comes the answer for challenge 13.
2

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:10,350
We don't need to change anything inside our app.js because we're already passing over this posts
3

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,130
array to be dealt with inside our home.
4

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,270
ejs.
5

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,460
So this is where we're going to create our FOR loop and log
6

7
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,940
each of the titles inside our posts array.

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,380
Whenever you're writing code inside an EJS file
8

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:31,020
I recommend to start writing the Javascript code without these little scriptlet tags because they make
9

10
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,870
everything look a lot more cluttered and
10

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,750
it's difficult to see what's going on when you're just trying to write your code.
11

12
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,280
The basic FOR loop looks something like this.
12

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,330
We start off with a var called i that starts at zero
13

14
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,140
and it increases by one until the upper bound that we define.
14

15
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,760
Then we can use that i to tap into each element inside our array.
15

16
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,370
So let's write our FOR loop here.
16

17
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:58,230
We'll write 
17

18
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,830
for var i = 0 
18

19
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:08,480
so this is our starting point, i is less than the upper bound and the upper bound
19

20
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,710
in our case is the length of this post array.
20

21
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,860
So the number of items are currently inside our posts array
21

22
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:25,460
so we'll say posts.length. And the final thing will be i++ so that we increase by 1 each
22

23
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:33,060
time. Inside our FOR loop, we're simply going to console log the titles of each of our posts.
23

24
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,970
So all we need to do is console.log
24

25
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:44,790
and the thing we're going to log is posts at index i.
25

26
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,390
So this is how we tap into each element inside posts.
26

27
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:52,220
We use the square brackets and we tell it which one we want to access.
27

28
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:59,430
So i will start off being 0 and we'll grab the first item in our posts array and then i will increase
28

29
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,600
until it gets to our upper bound which is the total number of posts inside the array.
29

30
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,210
Posts at index
30

31
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:16,200
i.title because remember the posts array contains post object and each object has a key of title
31

32
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:22,020
and content that contains each of the post titles and bodies. Inside here
32

33
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,850
this is the code that we need.
33

34
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:31,240
And so now we're ready to cap everything off and go ahead and add all EJS scriptlet tags.
34

35
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:39,650
And remember that each of these tags have to be added on every single line
35

36
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:47,690
so even on the closing curly braces and any semicolons you've got. So let's hit save and let's try it
36

37
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:48,370
out.
37

38
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:53,840
So let's head over to compose and let's add a title
38

39
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,220
Day 1. And now let's head back to compose again
39

40
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,380
and let's add
40

41
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,890
Day 2.
41

42
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:06,570
And now we're on the home page so this is where our console.log is.
42

43
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:13,790
And now you can see we're logging Day 1 then Day 2 both the titles without the rest of the array
43

44
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:22,450
because we're looping through it and tapping into that title each time. If you need a refresher on FOR loops,
44

45
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:26,440
then this might be a good time to have a look back in the course when
45

46
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:33,910
we first introduced it or just to check out the MDN docs on FOR loops and to read up on that document
46

47
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,000
to remind us of how they work.
