1
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:00.890
All right.
1

2
00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.030
So how did that go?
2

3
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.300
The first thing that we have to do is, of course, add our h3, and we're going to do that right above
3

4
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.420
the horizontal rule which is here and below our table.
4

5
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:24.030
So right here. And we're going to create something that's called skills and then we need to make a new table
5

6
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.570
and this table is not going to have any headings because we don't have any headings over here.
6

7
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.470
But it is going to have some rows and some columns.
7

8
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:44.720
So let's make our first row using tr. And let's list our first skill inside a td, and let's say 
8

9
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:54.370
iOS development, and then we can put our stars in a second td that's going to be right next to our first
9

10
00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:02.320
td in our second column, and we're going to pull up the emoji inspector and we’re just going to add in a
10

11
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:10.110
star which I'm going to copy which I'm going to copy and paste.
11

12
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.870
And now to save time I'm just going to copy the row.
12

13
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.250
Now whenever you are programming and you'll find yourself doing a lot of copy and pasting then you're
13

14
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.860
probably doing something wrong.
14

15
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.380
Now in order to save time you'll see me do it quite a lot and it's because it's not very fun for you
15

16
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:34.820
to watch me writing tr and TD all day long, but when you're coding yourself ideally try to avoid copying
16

17
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.460
and pasting and when you do always make sure that you understand what you're copy and pasting and also
17

18
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.180
make sure you check for any bugs and errors that you introduce.
18

19
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.040
So let's edit some of these things.
19

20
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:51.070
All right.
20

21
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.590
Let's hit save and let's check it out.
21

22
00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:55.460
Looks pretty neat.
22

23
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.420
Right?
23

24
00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.710
All right.
24

25
00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.460
So now let's tackle bonus points.
25

26
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.740
So if you’ve given it a go and you've managed do it then
26

27
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:04.850
really well done.
27

28
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:10.540
It takes a little bit of researching around and a little bit lateral thinking in order to get it working.
28

29
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:17.180
But if you haven't or if you want to find out how one might do it then take a look now.
29

30
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:22.850
So essentially what we're trying to achieve here is very similar to what we've done at the top.
30

31
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.510
We're trying to affect the layout by using tables.
31

32
00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:36.380
So essentially what we want is a table that has two columns or two table data cells and in each cell
32

33
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.160
we have a separate table which itself has two rows and two columns.
33

34
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.850
So the solution is essentially going to be a nested table.
34

35
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:53.600
So I'm going to make a little bit of space after the h3 and I'm going to create essentially the same
35

36
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.450
structure as we've got up here.
36

37
00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.920
A new table that has a single row and two table data cells.
37

38
00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.520
This one and this one.
38

39
00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:10.600
So down here I'm going to create a brand new table and then I'm going to create a tr or table row and
39

40
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.070
then I'm going to create two table cells.
40

41
00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:22.610
Now inside that first table data cell I'm going to place our existing table.
41

42
00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.520
So I'm going to cut it and then I'm going to paste it in here, and then I'm going to grab another copy
42

43
00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:37.100
of this table and then I'm going to paste it into the second table data cell of the first level table.
43

44
00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.590
So right over here.
44

45
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.880
Now this structure is a little bit confusing.
45

46
00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:51.080
And this is one of the reasons why using HTML to affect the layout is not a great idea, but by doing
46

47
00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.630
this exercise you do get to grips with using tables, table rows, table data.
47

48
00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:02.000
And if you've managed to complete this challenge then you should understand the ins and outs of how
48

49
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.870
to create tables using HTML.
49

50
00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:13.730
So now if we hit save and let's take a look at our work you can see that we've got a single table with
50

51
00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:20.550
two tables nested inside and we've managed to achieve this kind of structure.
51

52
00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.780
Now feel free to keep this layout or revert to the previous layout before the bonus challenge.
52

53
00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.200
It's completely up to you.
53

54
00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.930
Or even design it however you like with as many tables as you need.
54

55
00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.890
But I'm going to get rid of this nested table because it makes it really really complicated to see at
55

56
00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.460
a glance what's going on.
56

57
00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:45.680
So I'm going to remove this top level table and everything below this closing table tag I'm going to
57

58
00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.420
delete and I'm going to get rid of some of that space.
58

59
00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:55.660
And we're back at where we were before the challenge and I'll hit save to continue from here.
59

60
00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:02.000
Let's finish off by just giving our tables a little bit more spacing so that everything looks a little
60

61
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.250
bit more spread out.
61

62
00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:08.990
So go ahead and add the cell spacing attribute to both of your tables and give it a value of say 10
62

63
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.790
pixels.
63

64
00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:14.100
All right.
64

65
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.160
So that's easy enough.
65

66
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.580
We've done it before here.
66

67
00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:26.110
So we're going to add cell spacing equals 10 up here and also in this table as well.
67

68
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:27.130
Let’s save.
68

69
00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.730
Let's check it out.
69

70
00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:29.650
Nice.
70

71
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:30.650
Looks pretty good, right?
71

72
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.380
And finally let's add a few more horizontal rules.
72

73
00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.110
So let's add one between books and teaching and work experience.
73

74
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.170
And also one between work experience and skills.
74

75
00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:51.730
OK so let's find the end of books and teaching and that's at a horizontal rule here.
75

76
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:59.490
Find the end of work experience and let's add a horizontal rule here.
76

77
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.880
Save. Refresh.
77

78
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.920
There we go. A bit more spacing.
78

79
00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.230
Everything looks a little bit more padded up.
79

80
00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.550
All right.
80

81
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.340
So if any of that was confusing or difficult,
81

82
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:16.100
make sure that you watch the video again and also have a read of the MDN web docs on not just tables
82

83
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:25.760
but also thead or tbody or tfoot or td, ths  etc. So you can have a look at the example code and see
83

84
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:30.620
some other examples of how you can use tables and rows and cells.
84

85
00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:37.340
Now in the next lesson we're going to learn all about HTML forms and how you can add these to your
85

86
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.970
web page to collect data from your users.
86

87
00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:42.940
So all of that and more.
87

88
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:44.460
See you on the next lesson.
