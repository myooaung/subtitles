00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.050
aspect oriented programming is about separation off concerns.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.680
To understand the basic concept off they will be.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.700
Let's around this program again.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.170
But before that,

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.850
let's also add a print statement here saying,

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.950
Dear War is an instance off.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:17.350
What kind of class?

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.410
Let's type your system that order Wendelin on,

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.770
say,

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.650
Diego is an instance off,

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.740
and then they would not get close dot Get me.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.190
It should ideally say that it's an instance off hibernate template product deal.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.530
Let's run that same and check it out as you can see that it's giving me a result.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:44.380
Saying Deol is an instance off quarter we know dot gov or dot hibernate template product

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.850
deal.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.830
Let's first pictorially represent the same.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.610
So when we run the application,

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.770
we do have a spring container inside off.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.370
Jbm So this is,

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.430
Let's assume it's Jerry Um and we have your CTX,

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:05.650
which is a reference variable that refers toe Sprink and Dana Andi insane this finger

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:12.980
dinner we have here something called Deal So an instance off our hybrid template proud of

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:13.730
Deal,

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.550
which we named us Hitch de Deal.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:24.380
And we also have a reference off D'Amore type on a product Diego that currently refers toe

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.950
this particular object,

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.700
and that's the reason why it says that deal with an instance Off cola we know dot de order

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.870
having attempted part of you with aspect oriented programming.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:41.830
What we do is we want toe make This deal will refer toa an object which we call it the

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:42.850
proxy object.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.850
So this proxy object is automatically going to be created,

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:53.250
which will internally have reference toe this product deal that we have already pointed toe

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.250
,

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.890
which,

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.850
with the deal is no longer pointing toe hit studio directly.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.650
Deal will refer toa a proxy object.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:07.870
The proxy object also maintains references toe another object called as an aspect and

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.840
aspect maintenance functions,

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.850
which we call as a choices.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.950
So why the heck Studio object is called a target object here,

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.220
which has the actual business logic functions that we have that such as updated products,

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.900
are count etcetera whenever we call the deal,

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.410
we're not a business Reddick function are actual implementation function.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.550
Let's say I call dio dot count.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.100
Now the function is delegated toe the proxy.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.750
The props see checks this aspect.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.280
Is there any advice that it has to execute if the answer is yes.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.920
First,

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.130
the Edwards function will be.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.400
Quite then,

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.900
the actual control is given to the cone function.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.770
Once the corn function is finished,

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.590
it's gonna come back to the proxy proxy checks again.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.400
Do we have any other at ways?

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.000
If there is any advice,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.080
that is a function that gets called.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.620
Once that function is going,

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.650
comes back to the proxy proxy it.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.120
Then we'll give the return really off the original con function back to the deal.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.530
So what it has done is it has intercepted the deal with that common function,

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.500
Andi has done some jobs.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.750
This is where it is important for us to understand some off the keywords.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.430
Let's start with the terminology called aspect aspect to the modular ization off a concert

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.820
that cuts across multiple pluses.

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.550
Transaction management is a good example off a crosscutting concern.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:34.490
In spring,

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:41.350
you will be aspects are implemented as just regular classes annotated with that aspect.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.720
The terminology giant point is a point to during the execution of the programs,

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.930
such as the execution of a matter are handling of an exception.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:51.780
In spring,

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.510
it will be a giant point,

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.750
always represents a method execution.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.970
While aspect is represented at that class,

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.350
A class has a bunch of functions.

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.650
Address is an action taken by an aspect at a particular joint point.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:13.300
Different types of addresses include our own that boys before roadways after add ways as a

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.050
less after throwing advice.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:16.990
Many It will be free marks,

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:23.590
including spring model and add ways as an interceptor maintaining a chain of interceptors

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.250
around the giant point.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.310
You can think of Joint Point as a bunch of functions,

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.050
but in our implementation class,

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.550
you might have any number of functions were only going toe apply.

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.070
Our advisors toe certain functions.

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:44.310
The point cut is a predicate that matches the giant point advises associated with a point,

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.690
cut expression and runs at any joint point matched by the point cut.

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:49.510
For example,

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:55.050
the execution of a method with a certain name are certain parameters are certain.

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.280
Return values the concept off joint points as matched by point.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.130
That expressions is centered.

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.980
Toe A will be on spring users aspect J point,

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:05.840
good expression,

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.350
language by default.

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:12.730
So in spring it will be There are two objects coming into picture Number one is the actual

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:18.660
target object Target object is an object which is a twice by one or more aspects.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.140
Also referred as the DOJ's object.

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:26.220
Since the spring elope is implemented using runtime process,

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:31.050
this object will always via proxy object on what is a proxy.

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:37.260
It will be proxy is an object created by the API framework in order to implement the aspect

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.070
contracts such as advice,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.260
,

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.510
method,

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:45.210
executions and so on in the spring framework and they will be proxy will be GK dynamic

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:53.190
proxy all seasonally proxy depending on when exactly and advice is applied on a particular

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:54.250
target function.

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.050
The addresses are divided into four types.

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.950
Number one is the before twice.

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.060
This isn't a choice that executes before a joint point,

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:10.910
but it does not have the ability to prevent execution flow proceeding to the joint point

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:12.450
unless it throws an exception.

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:16.590
Number two After returning twice,

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:21.780
this is an adores to be executed after a giant point complete Normally,

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:22.540
for example,

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.230
if a matador returns without throwing an exception,

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:27.750
then this advice gets executed.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.950
Number three After throwing advice,

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:34.220
this is an advice to be executor.

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.620
If a matter exists by throwing an exception now,

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:43.010
if you remember in our hibernate template product deal on even the JBC template product

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:43.600
deal,

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:50.000
I mentioned that each of these functions must have a try catch block where I receive an

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.760
exception off data access exception thrown by a particular function here.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:07:00.500
And then I have to read through that as a doll exception that this can be handed by using

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.480
the after training twice.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.830
Another advice is the around roadways,

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:08.250
the adores that surrounds the giant point,

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.150
such as a method invocation.

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:14.030
This is the most powerful kind of advice are under duress.

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:18.350
Can perform custom behavior before and after the medical indication.

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:23.350
It is also responsible for choosing whether to proceed to the giant point,

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:26.740
are so sharp with the other boys do matter execution.

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:32.020
Let's come back toe clips and then configure aspect oriented programming such that when we

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:33.390
get the front of zero,

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:35.560
we get the proxy object.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.550
Once we get the proxy object,

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:40.160
we will also intercept the method call such as,

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.040
for example,

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:47.960
I may be interested in intercepting on the functions that started to get are probably I

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:53.780
want to intercept a function which takes two double perimeters and in case if mini is

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:54.610
greater than Max.

00:07:54.610 --> 00:08:00.570
I want to slap it and then pass it on to the actual target function and few other examples

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:00.570
.

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:02.740
The very first thing that you have to do is tow.

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:06.050
Add the aspect oriented programming libraries.

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:11.560
If you expand the Maimon dependence is you can see that spring elope is already day,

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:15.590
and that's because spring internally uses cable before all its functionalities.

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:16.300
However,

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.170
we also need a few more charge,

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:20.770
which are related toe aspect J libraries.

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:23.910
So lets go the bomb that examine Onda.

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:25.800
We want to add some dependencies.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.580
Let's go somewhere at the end.

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:30.030
Go to the envy and deposit to dot com.

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:34.990
Look for SPG and press enter.

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:40.410
Now you can see that there is an aspect JV were aspect rt those the two things that we

00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:40.890
request.

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:43.950
So let's open them in separate times.

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:49.900
Let's select the late destruction Wonder 9.5 I copied this one.

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:51.530
Go back over here.

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:58.050
Best it come back toe May 1 repository select the aspect here on time.

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:02.160
Let this Washington come back toe clips basted,

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.520
formatted and save it.

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:09.380
And in a minute you should be able to get all the just related toe aspect,

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:12.650
J Aspect JV were aspect of our people to them.

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:18.280
Welcome to know that the aspect J Jar files are there in the next video.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:23.850
Let us create a simple method called lager aspect on just aren't the same thing.
