X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.220
if I had on my project by right clicking on the project run as run on server,

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.010
you will see that it comes with therefore not for.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.430
That's because we don't have any index.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.480
Start JCB in our application.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.800
So first,

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.300
let's fix this problem and then proceed for 10.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.290
Let's go to our pages,

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.840
right click and say New JSP.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.190
Let's call it US Index Index is typically a standard name,

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.570
the one for a home pitch.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.960
But because we were kept under Rabbi enough slash pages so the actual name is no longer

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.000
index charges.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.150
Be its name is weapon of slash pages slash index jsp.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.380
Obviously,

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.770
this may not work,

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:45.960
but we'll give it a try.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.420
So let's call this as Spring Web,

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.950
NBC Demo.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.790
That's the title.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.760
Let's just put some title here for the time being,

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.430
each one.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.870
Maybe I copy and paste the same thing.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:06.100
And could that over here if I right click on the page and Tehran as on sir?

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.360
Well,

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.160
sometimes you get this dialog box.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.130
It says that the Sarwar restart is required and because this is a mandatory for us to

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.670
restart.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.780
So there is no point in saying continue without restarting.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.360
Let's click on this check box.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.600
Remember my decision.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:27.210
Say okay now when it restarts on and deploys that it will open a Ural,

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:35.660
which has slash Web and have slash pages slash index jsp now slash weber NF is something

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:36.160
hidden,

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.080
which means that anything you store inside the Vagina folder,

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.750
the client browsers cannot access them at all because of which we get this error message

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.680
even though we have an index or JSP.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.010
But it is not in its default location,

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.330
so I'm not able to see that.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.700
So to fix this problem,

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.480
let's go toe over that door XML file here,

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.780
which has a source tap over here.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:59.340
Click on that.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.870
You'll be able to see that source.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.690
You can see that there's a bunch of welcome finalist,

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.150
which means whenever you access the root off your application,

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.490
which file should be looked in on?

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:10.110
None off.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.860
This corresponds to our fight.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.460
We do have an indexed or JC,

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.120
but it's expecting under the weather.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:23.680
So let's get it off all of these and then type your slash Web I NF pages indexed or Chase B

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.680
.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.620
And this is the reason I told that the name of the file can be anything because you have

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.290
dimension that over here one very important point you need to remember is it must to start

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.070
with a splash on this case sensitive.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.710
So let's save this.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:43.670
And now I'm gonna write like my project and then say Run as on Sir one.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:50.840
And this time you should see a spring Web NBC demo as the output.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.910
Now let's everyone toe style this particular page using letter bootstrap.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.590
So for that,

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.290
let's create Under Rob a folder called Assets.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.560
That's where we're gonna keep all over,

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.880
CSS finds.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:13.020
Let's call it us at six and I'm gonna create a sub folder here called CSS,

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.730
and I want to download a bootstrap team filed over here.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:24.980
So let's go toe Newtown that Boots wants dot com and select a team off your choice.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.570
I'm going to select this yeti.

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.430
There is an option for download.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.250
I click on this download on.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.680
It's gonna ask me really want to download It is under desktop spring sandbox.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.410
That's my workspace location.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.490
There is a spring NBC basics,

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:40.530
SRC,

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.160
main verb Assets and CSS.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.750
That's the location where I want to download this file,

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.930
and it's boot shop dot mean dot CS.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.960
Let's save that one that is saved.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.270
If I come back to eclipse,

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:53.670
it doesn't show up here,

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.240
so I'm gonna rightly can say the refresh.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.910
And I would see that file.

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.560
Bootstrap Gartman dot CSS is over here.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:07.910
So what a little are here in my indexed or jsp a link Attaf or l equals toe style sheet.

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.670
You have to say type.

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.210
He goes toe texture slash CIA says Hey,

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:13.370
terrific ALS toe.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:19.350
You can say don't slash a sex slash CSS slash bootstrap.

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.470
I don't mean dark CSS to make use of this file.

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:29.860
What I do is I'm gonna just adhere a deal whose last name is called Alert Alert.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.050
Let's say primary,

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.710
in fact,

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:37.160
that I'm gonna have your another deal whose class is called container on inside that I'm

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.070
gonna base that each one So we have a banner on our page.

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.260
Let's say this on now.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.100
I'm gonna write,

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.410
get my project run as on server,

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.160
and this is going to take a couple of seconds.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.580
Restart the serval open start in a new browser time,

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.050
but it will still see that it's not applying the CSS.

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.130
So if I goto right,

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.780
click and say,

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:02.890
inspect on,

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:08.570
go to the network tab over here and then reload my page once again,

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:14.970
if you see that it's showing me bootstrap dot mindo CSS coming from this particular urine

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:15.650
spring Web,

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.410
NBC Basics slash assets Last year's bookshop window,

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:20.010
she says,

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:21.500
is not phone now.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.110
The reason for this is if you go back to your app.

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:31.820
Config where we have configurable slash every request is now being 100 by dispatcher

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.740
Separate and dispatches alert will check with handler mapping.

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:42.760
Do you have a handler for slash assets slash CSS slash bootstrap mean doxy is is handler.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.380
Mapping doesn't have a clue about this butcher.

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:46.660
It simply says no.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.640
And then it's going to give me a 40 for error.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.200
To solve this problem,

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.340
you have to add one more implementation off an interface.

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:55.680
Here.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.770
It's got that NBC configure.

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.010
When you do that,

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.570
you can optionally overrate many methods from here.

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:08.850
One of the method is called configure D four separate handling,

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:09.850
meaning.

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:13.150
If dispatcher seller doesn't know how to handle you,

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:14.330
pass it on to Tomcat.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:14.650
So then,

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:15.080
tomcat,

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.280
we look for the static content such as assets CSS bush up.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.470
Mendota es eso Now the function you have to over it is going to configure default,

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:24.310
separate handling.

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:29.400
So I'm gonna press control space and tight conficker default sovereign handling.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:29.880
As you can see,

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.110
you get the intelligence.

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:37.400
Now all I have to do is to get it off these two and then say you're configure the argument

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.560
apart don't enable.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:45.150
So what it does is if your dispatches alert is unable to handle certain requests,

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.980
then it will pass it on to the default handler,

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.040
which is Tomcat on dunk it.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.330
If it doesn't know how to 100 that dunk,

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.430
it will anyway give you 404 Now that it is done,

00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:00.700
let's save this right lickle project and then say rawness on,

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:01.650
sir one.

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:08.850
And you can see our pages nicely color with the bootstrap CSS.

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:14.760
Let's go back to our index dot jsp Nam and I had a few other stuff.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:15.800
For example,

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.490
I'm gonna add one more savior whose class is called Patina.

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:27.550
Let's add your something like hitched to welcome toe product manager at.

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:30.080
We'll also add some kind of a footer.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:36.590
So that's your deal class equals toe container text center to make sure that it is all

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:37.630
center aligned.

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:40.820
And then we're gonna add your and percent copyright,

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:42.590
so that's gonna give a copyright symbol.

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:50.300
19 2020 all rights reserved by Let's say,

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:51.030
for example,

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:52.140
came in on in,

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:54.550
and I want to surround this with hyperlink,

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:59.350
so I think hatred equals till it's too tps we know not call.

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:02.180
And this is my copyright information.

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:08.180
Let's also give a minimum height for this so that the cooperate always is at the bottom.

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:11.140
So I'm gonna are the style here in in line style.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:12.060
Not good practice,

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:16.890
but let's have that as a min height off.

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:20.090
Let's 400 pixel save this.

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:23.340
If I now come back to the browser and refresh,

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:28.130
I should see that there is a hitch to under the copyright Now,

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:33.250
in order for me to maintain this look and feel common for all other pages,

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:40.600
it's a good idea toe have the fragment like header footer Andi sideboard in case if you

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:44.000
have as well as the main content area.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.520
So to do that,

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.910
let's go to our pages location.

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:50.530
Let's create your a new file.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:58.590
That's call this s new jsp file are you can simply say new file The file name extension can

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:04.740
be anything but as a practice we can view something called J SPF to indicate it's a jsp

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:05.450
fragment.

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:09.790
I'm gonna give you a header dot Js the f press enter.

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:10.930
It's a new fight.

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:19.990
I'm also going to create something like food or dot jsp f from the indexed our jsp

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:27.750
everything about this section I'm gonna cut this and paste it in the header Dodgy SPF

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:29.300
Similarly,

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:37.930
everything after this particular section I'm gonna baste it in the foot or dot Jsp a save

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:44.420
it Save the header Let's come back toe index dot jsp If I now just go back to the browser

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:48.880
and refresh because the indexer jsp has only hitch to and nothing else.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:54.000
You should only see the hitch toe without any formatting because there's no CSS applied

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:54.700
over here.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:55.520
However,

00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:03.660
I can say your percentage at this is a directive called include file equals toe dark slash

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:05.430
header George A SPF.

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:06.470
Likewise,

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:10.490
I'm going taste the same thing here called this ass foot.

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:11.980
Save this.

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:16.730
Now you can see the header is common toe all our pages.

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:18.770
So every time I create a new JSP,

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:23.510
I just had to include the first line and last line in every page and the actual

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:25.510
presentation logic in between.

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:27.650
So if I come down here refreshed,

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:30.390
you can see that our styling has come back.
