00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.920
in this video.

00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.970
Let us understand the working off a hedge GDP claims there are communication for this.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.630
We have to go configure or eclipse to work with a Web server such as about you.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.280
Don't get to do this.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.160
Let's go for us.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.650
Download Apache Tom Kit.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.940
So you goto a new from tab and look for Apache Tomcat.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:20.970
$9.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.070
The very 1st 1 is usually the correct one.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.110
If you go there,

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.280
you will see that there are some downloads by another.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.150
Distributions.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.340
The one that we are interested in is the zip file.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.200
So I'm gonna download this.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.710
Andi,

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:36.950
keep it on my desta.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.540
Once it is downloaded,

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.530
it's around 10.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.490
Maybe you can unzip the same and then probably delete does it?

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.900
Fine.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.770
So it is on my desktop.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.060
I have the Apache Tomcat unzipped here as well as the zip file.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.030
I don't need the zip file.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.520
I'm gonna delete that now.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.350
This directory contents have been been has all the executable tear like shell scripts and

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.050
batch friends.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.880
We don't need to run this,

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.840
but if you're running it in a standalone more without eclipse,

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.330
there is a start up that bad for windows on Start up.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.350
That s it for UNIX based platforms.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.530
Let's close this comeback toe clips.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.840
Since we're using Jama e Washing of Eclipse,

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.450
there is a several stab over here.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.600
It says No,

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.530
sir was available.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.350
Click this link to create a new server.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.730
Andi,

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.590
As you can see that the plug in for Apache is already available,

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.220
we don't have to install anything,

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.280
and the current washing off a clip supports upto Tomcat.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.950
Nine.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.450
Select it next,

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.120
and this is very hard to specify.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.870
Where is your Tomcat?

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:42.350
Which is,

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.030
in my guess,

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.750
desktop.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.190
A good of Brown's and select the best top selectors Apache Tomcat name.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.350
Just make sure that it is the parent off bin directory.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.950
Click on open.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.680
In case if you're chosen a wrong military,

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.650
you will see an error.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:58.260
For example,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.600
if I removed at zero,

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.520
you'll see that the directory is invalid and it's not allowing me to go forward.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.300
One other thing.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.170
In case if you have multiple job our installations,

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.190
make sure that you're using the Java Sea.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.650
Eight.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.080
Since I have only one right now,

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.730
configure with my eclipse.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.080
I don't have to do this,

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.040
but let's keep it.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.550
Anyways,

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.250
click the next button.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.710
Here it is asking,

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.230
Do you have any projects that you can Acto Tomcat?

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.480
For this?

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.340
It only looked for Web projects,

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.850
and this is not a project.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.580
So now we need to create a new Web project,

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.640
which we can then act over Tomcat.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.740
So let's click finish.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.730
You can see that the Apache Tomcat entry has been made over here.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:39.440
If you double click,

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.350
you get more configuration information.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.640
One of the conflict information you can look into is the port numbers on By default,

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.720
Apache Tomcat uses the it's TDP 80 its report that is OK with me.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.750
But in case if you have,

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:58.650
multiples are worth running and one of them uses http 80 rate zero already better change it

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:59.350
over here.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.280
Apart from that,

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.740
there is also another option.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.750
I would like to tell really Use window.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:05.590
Rep.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.760
Rosa Instead of using an Internet web Rosa,

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.180
I used a default,

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.400
which happens to be Crume,

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.150
in my case,

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.920
so that every time I run may project,

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.260
the home page of the project will be open in chrome.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.050
Let's start this award by right click on this and click on the start.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.000
You can also do the same thing by clicking this button over here.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.210
When I do that,

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:27.890
if there is no other Apache.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:28.120
Tom,

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.250
get starts on port number 800 You can see the console logs over here.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.720
It is that Apache Tomcat is occupying hits DDP.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.750
It generates report.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:44.730
You can open the browser on Goto local host age origin on.

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.000
You should be able to see other page for Not for because we don't have any applications

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.980
running on Tomcat at this point in time.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:52.870
But importantly,

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.250
you can see that the other message comes from Apache Tomcat 9.0 point three.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.850
Now let's go back to our eclipse and clear the new May 1 Web project.

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:02.570
Meanwhile,

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:03.950
I'm gonna stop the server.

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.150
Let's create a new May 1 project.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.220
I would like to create a simple projects.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.950
Keep on the archetype selection.

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.300
Next,

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.560
the group I d happens to be poured out.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.010
We know,

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.660
as I have been giving the artifact ready,

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:24.140
I can say here as spring NBC basics Importantly,

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.170
the packaging has to be a war project.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.950
Then only this considered as a project.

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:35.240
Let's click finish to come out of this as soon as the project gets created.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.430
You mercy and editor And this is family,

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.980
because everywhere project must have a Web.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:47.000
Enough Web XML file Babayan If is the folder web dot xml is a file.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.100
So if I select the marker step over here,

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.310
you'll see that the May 1 job i e.

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:53.590
Configuration problem.

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.200
It says that web dot XML is missing to generate the same you right,

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.760
click on the project and then say here,

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:06.310
Java e tools generated deployment descriptor stub That should be okay.

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.280
We'll add the web dot xml in a few minutes.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.190
First,

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:15.950
let us open the pond or XML off the same so that it will use Java Wonder aid.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:20.330
If you remember in the previous project we had made the entry already.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:21.530
So let me open the bomb.

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.320
The XML of the previous project copy this section,

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.850
which says that Java source and target Russian must be one that eight and based over here.

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:33.320
In addition,

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.350
let us also are the Summer day Pierre dependency,

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.850
and this is where I need to add a dependencies section,

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:45.490
and one of the dependency happens to be the southern AP a So I'm gonna go back toe Maimon

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:46.450
repositories.

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.340
Look for Sollett.

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.910
And if you press enter,

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.750
you'll see that there is a job X salary,

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:53.280
FBI.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.350
If I select that,

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:59.050
let us select the latest Russian copy the dependency,

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:00.860
Come back for work here.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.690
We also may want to add the JSP dependency for this.

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:15.650
Let's look for jsp and you have your the sunlit gsb FBI select the latest again.

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.650
Come back at that over here.

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.220
As soon as you save your file,

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.550
you will see that the dependencies are downloaded from the Net.

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:29.030
Since we added this section as the last couple of jobs,

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:30.450
let's goto a project.

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:31.360
Do,

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:31.590
um,

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:32.950
even update once?

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:35.870
And when you do that,

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:38.850
the job person should be one that eight.

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:43.720
We still have this letter related to the war file will fix that in a minute.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.340
But if I goto Project Properties job bill,

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.950
but you can see that the job will put now corresponds to one that date.

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:56.180
Now let's have the web dot xml file for which it's giving another over here.

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.660
So let's right click the project job,

00:06:58.660 --> 00:06:59.590
IE tools,

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:00.830
gender deployment,

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:01.850
descriptor stuff.

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:04.920
And now I should see the others are gone.

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:05.470
Plus,

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:06.510
under SRC,

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:11.750
you would see that there is a mean verb verb in F vugdalic salmon.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:18.870
So this is a location where we have to create our HTML JavaScript CSS if you want.

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:19.110
J.

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:19.850
ESPYs,

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:24.550
although we would like to keep the JSP is inside this weapon of so that they gets hidden.

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:28.280
Now let's have that subject to see how this whole thing works.

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:28.950
That's right,

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:35.210
like the Project New Joel class and in the new job class,

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:37.740
we're going to write the package as Kordell be.

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:39.950
No doubt that dot subjects,

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:42.870
because this is where we're gonna keep all of a sudden.

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:44.460
It's in fact,

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:47.130
in the entire project is the only satellite and moderate,

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:49.250
because when you work with Spring Embassy,

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:50.730
we don't have to write celebrates.

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:51.180
Instead,

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:52.750
we write something called controllers.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.210
But for the time being,

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:58.150
let's say we want to give it us a hello separate as the leave.

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:01.090
The super class for the summit would be,

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:02.240
it's TDP.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:02.990
Sell it.

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:07.350
You can press control space over here to get the intelligence,

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:09.210
click the finish button.

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:16.150
You can also gender the sell it by right click on the project and say new subject over here

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:16.150
.

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:20.270
But this also would pray toe art and entering the better XML.

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:22.250
And that is the reason I did not choose this.

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:28.890
Now every subject is gonna have a Ural mapping so that when I client makes a request that

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:34.110
you are ill will be reserved by the separate object and will be passed on to a specific

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:35.350
function called salaries.

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:41.170
So let's add that at the rate Web sublet that is the annotation through which you can do a

00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:42.150
Ural mapping.

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:44.230
You can simply take your slash.

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:46.900
Hello are you can use an element called you.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:50.250
Ahrens equals two and then given a day off Urals,

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:55.890
it says here that the cell alert extent Http solarte So which inherit from generates our

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:56.340
village.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.600
All those classes implement.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:08:59.480
See realizable.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:00.240
For that reason,

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:04.270
it's asking you toe clear the serial washing your duty as a valuable.

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:06.050
So I'm adding that here,

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:13.840
let's also overweight a function called Do get All typically a service also is okay,

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:16.110
let's go toe source override,

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:21.170
implement medics and you'll see that the reader varieties off do ex wives and functions.

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:26.100
There is also a service function that we can overwrite the service function can handle all

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.250
kinds of requests,

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:30.770
but as do get is only going to receive a get request.

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:33.730
So let's right the do get say Okay,

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:38.410
now that I have the duke it all I have to do is tow Generate a response on,

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:43.000
then give it to the end user request maintains an input stream.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:43.650
For example,

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:46.550
If I want to read information from the client,

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:48.060
I can always use this.

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:51.540
Http is alert request and its functions this time.

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:53.860
I don't want to read anything from the user,

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:56.860
but I want the right information to the end user,

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:59.840
for which the response maintains an output stream.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.520
Let's use the response.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.870
Don't get writer as a function.

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:06.790
Assigned this to available Called out Oh,

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:07.740
it is not created.

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:12.860
I'm gonna press command one or controlled one on Windows on a clear that local variable.

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:13.990
Once I got it,

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:19.040
I can say your outdoor print talents and then start typing my HTML content.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:19.580
For example,

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:23.820
I can see your hello world slash it one.

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:26.340
I can take another older brindle in.

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:27.970
Let's type your HR.

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:30.770
Let's add one more print.

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:31.210
Dylan.

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:32.670
Let's add a paragraph.

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:33.130
Let's hear,

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:33.870
for example,

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:38.950
demo by We don't slash b and now I can say are not close.

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:43.460
All we have done is we have returned some html content to an output stream.

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:45.420
When this function is in,

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:49.850
walked by Tomcat and we returned the control back to the Tomcat.

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:55.350
Duncan will now collect this response on then give the same thing back to the end user.

00:10:55.350 --> 00:11:00.950
Let's add the missing semicolons over here on one other thing that you may also want to

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:01.950
mention is.

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:03.490
Before you do this,

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:05.560
you can say response.

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:10.620
Don't set content type as fixed slash h demon.

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:11.630
Otherwise,

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:18.090
it's DDP client made Treat this as a plain text and even probably displayed html tax on the

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:18.550
browser.

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:20.810
Let's say the file on then,

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:21.090
right,

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:22.150
Click the project.

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:24.660
Rana's around Answer.

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:25.110
Well,

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:28.810
this is going to bring me a dialog box asking which is the server.

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:30.740
I have only one server just in case.

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:31.540
If you have multiple,

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:31.700
sir,

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:33.040
where you can choose that.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:37.850
But since I'm gonna use only this particular server for the entire project,

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:38.980
so I'm gonna select this.

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:42.010
Always use this server Wendling the project.

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:42.950
Click the next.

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:45.100
It's asking Is there any project you want?

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:47.380
The actor don't get are removed from dunk it?

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:49.810
I don't have any such requirement.

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:51.020
I clicked the finish.

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:55.850
Now it's going to open a browser and loads the local host.

00:11:55.850 --> 00:12:01.250
Eijiro Egidio slash spring MBC basics on that is an application name,

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:05.690
but our subject here has a euro mapping off slash.

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:06.260
Hello.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.620
So we have toe Add that again here.

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:09.590
So hello.

00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:10.930
And when I pressed Enter,

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:14.340
you'll see regard the response from our sell it.

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:20.750
But as you can see that generating an HTML content your is really not a good idea.

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:24.820
This is where we follow a concept called NBC Architecture.

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:28.750
We will understand the embassy architecture in the next video.
