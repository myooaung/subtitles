00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.340
Now let's have a look at what?

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:02.440
The dependency,

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.330
injection and wiring.

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.680
It's got over Jerry Busy product table.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:14.050
And let's say we want to create a variable here called connection off type connection.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:19.500
This becomes a dependency off this particular class.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.520
And because of the at the rate setter,

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.750
we also have a set connection as a function.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:26.230
Over here,

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.000
you can see that there's a set connection because the center now I can alter my create

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.850
connection function such that create a new connection only if this connection is equals to

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.850
.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.660
Not so I can come down here and I can say,

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.980
if connection not equals to know.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.880
As the last connection dot is closed equals toe force,

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.850
then we will return connection.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.830
But in getting the connection is either none or has it been close to then we create a new

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.260
connection using these member very.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.480
But if you're on the court as is,

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.950
you will see that it is not going to give you any others.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.020
You still see that there are 77 products.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.820
That's because using up conflict one,

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.020
we are able toe supply this particular diablo,

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.650
where we have manually initialized all the values.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.920
Obviously the connection is no.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.400
So this condition is false.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.980
So this whole thing is skipped based on the driver,

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.620
plus the mural use that its manufacturing a new one.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.350
What we will do now is we'll make a new app conflict.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.620
So we're gonna copy this up,

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:39.340
conflict one and paste it as a country to let's use that conflict to We don't want this

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.190
constructors.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.100
We don't want this done media war here.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.180
We don't want lazy and all those stops.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.060
So let's just keep everything simple.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.040
Will also delete this system that out that Intel in will also remove these centers because

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.940
what we want to do is tow assign a connection object the what if connection itself with a

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:57.910
different being.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:58.790
For example,

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.970
if I have public connection,

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.540
let's say we call it US connection class.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.550
Start for name,

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:06.230
off,

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.050
dry work,

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.750
last name.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:14.930
And then they say you're done driver manager dot Get connection off your user name password

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.930
.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.700
Both of them throw exception.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.530
Festival connection needs to be imported,

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.250
so let's just import it from Charlie Skill.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.730
And then we will also throw away all the exceptions that we get over here so since spring

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.870
is gonna call this function so spring will handle the exceptions by breaking our

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:31.550
application.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:32.770
But for that to work,

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.840
we had to say at the Red Bean when you actually cleared us,

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.770
think and dinner using APP conflict to spring calls this function automatically and lost

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.720
the driver class name creates a new TV connection and then keeps it with the name called

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:47.400
Connection.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.260
That's one being on.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.610
The second being happens to be this we're we say that this being can make use off this

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:56.050
being,

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.280
In other words,

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.530
there is a dependency off connection type over here on this being object can be wired to

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:04.450
this being there,

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:10.300
a couple of is you can do number one is you can say the or dot set connection and then calm

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.050
dysfunction over here.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.450
Just like that,

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.130
where I am calling the function and that function is going to return a connection object.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.410
We're gonna set it up over here on the error here is because of these two checked

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.150
exceptions were not only go over here.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.420
The second method is,

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.650
since this particular function is called by spring,

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.050
you can ask string toe supply any other means that you want.

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.860
For example,

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:40.410
if a declare a variable called connection connection here like this since the spring is

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.650
going to call this function,

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.230
spring looks at this perimeter type and then checks.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:44.580
Hey,

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.560
you need a connection and I do have a connection.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.210
Or here now what if I have to functions that return connection object?

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:56.620
This is the dependency injection that spring results by making is off this name off the

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.170
bean name of the valuable that your God here is called connection and the name of the bean

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.970
is connection or here,

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.380
so there won't be a problem in resolving that.

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.050
So spring does a dependency injection here.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.970
Now that I got this connection,

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.940
I can supply that my center.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.040
And now you see,

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.950
we're doing abiding.

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.050
So at this place,

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:19.680
it's called the injection off Dependency on.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.660
This is basically the wiring,

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:28.150
which is actually manually because I'm doing the wiring not automatically done.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:29.340
Let's save this,

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.750
go back to a program.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.800
Our program is making itself up.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.430
Conflict one.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.780
Make sure that it's coming from up conflict to now,

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.620
so let's import that Andi run the court.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:44.240
We should still get the same result as that there are 77 products and let's go toe up

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.010
conflict to and have a look at this.

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.870
This is called manual Wedding.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.170
I was thinking.

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.320
Also do an automatic wiring,

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.340
for example.

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.870
Let's say we comment or these lines on,

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:03.660
but then say your return New Jamesy product deal at this time,

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.540
whenever we asked for the jelly BCD a war in our program like this,

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.750
we are actually getting an instance off.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:11.480
This,

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:18.250
which is an object off this class over here and all these five member variables or no.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:24.830
So when actually clear connection is called connection is now also this face and plastered

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.290
for name no will result into another point exception.

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:29.370
So if you're under court now,

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.980
you should see an Alpine exception,

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:31.530
right?

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:32.510
Ultimately,

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.960
we can ask spring to do an automatic wiring.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.030
So at this time,

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.160
the application jbm looks like this.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.040
You have a city except the reference Well,

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:47.290
even that points toe A spin container on a sprinkler dinner has been loaded with these two

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.580
beings,

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.340
so the being number one is the connection.

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.650
Being Number two is the GBC tierro,

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:56.110
but they're not wired with each other because we're not doing any manual wedding.

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:01.090
And when we go to the program over here when we said Diogo equals two city extort,

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:04.500
get being This is the actual object that we're getting.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:05.730
However,

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:09.480
the object is not initialized with any member variables.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.560
There are months and then were eventually getting the Nile Point exception.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.090
What we want to do is we want,

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:19.030
think toe automatically wire disconnection with this particular being objects.

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:21.180
So this is supposed to be done to do that.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:28.580
I can goto GBC product dio and then mark this particular variable with an annotation off at

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:29.880
the rate outerwear.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.280
So I'll say here at the rate auto wire,

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:40.140
save it now you could go back to the program and not that conflict to still has no

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.740
connection between these two being objects.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:43.570
No wiring.

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:48.370
But my program should still work because off the outer wiring and you can see that our

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:51.250
application is working on It says there are 77 products
