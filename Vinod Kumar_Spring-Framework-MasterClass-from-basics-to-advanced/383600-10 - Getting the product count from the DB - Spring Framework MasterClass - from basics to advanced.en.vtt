WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
know that our DB is up and running,

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.670
and we also have long book at a total eclipse.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.200
Let's go and implement this function where we actually want to get the product count from

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:11.980
the database.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.050
We have declared four variables here,

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.650
which represents the driver class name you are lose anim passport.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.550
So whoever is creating an object off this class have to supply these dependencies in all

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.240
cases spring instant ships this.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.770
So let's ask spring toe pass on.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.320
These dependence is over here,

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.290
and the dependencies are supplied using the center or constructor.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.970
I don't have a constructor that takes these parameters,

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:38.970
but if I have one,

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.720
I can actually make use of the same.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.920
That's all great a function here which is gonna be used by maybe many other function

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.310
because every function that this deal will will have eventually needs a TV connection.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:56.670
The threat of private a function that returns a job order s cured or connection.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.920
That's called it as cleared connection on this is supposed to north this driver class them

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:04.870
into the VM,

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:10.420
thereby it registers with the driver manager Andi using this,

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.670
your user password.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.380
It supposed to return a new connection eventually will also use DB Connection pool.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.300
But for the time being,

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.690
let's make it off this function.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.930
So the first court here I might want to write is class.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:22.950
Start for me,

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.440
Dr One Class them.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:31.020
This is toe lured the GBC driver into the William so that the driver object will be

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.550
registered automatically with the driver manager.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:34.400
The second lately,

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.730
store it on a new TV connection by using driver manager dot get connection that the

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.870
function that takes you are user and password will supply the same.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.050
Both of them throw exceptions.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.250
There checked exceptions.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.490
Let's throw them away from the function.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.490
So since there is an error,

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.740
I can click on the line with There is an error Press command one or controlled one on

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.040
windows and press enter.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.400
It will add the appropriate exception here again,

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.270
I'm doing the same thing are since this quick fix came over here,

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.870
I can click on the add throws declarations over here as well.

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:13.080
Now this function being private and not being used there,

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.660
the warning.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.500
But that will go off as soon as we implement dysfunction.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.050
So to implement the function,

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.900
what we will do is we will create a tribal resources block.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:29.350
Let's go here and I try and catch any exception we have.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:35.070
Let's for the time being through new runtime exceptions so that we don't have to really

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.210
worry about what actually is the exception.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.770
Now,

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.010
this section here is where we can create some objects.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.360
They get automatically closed by the time you exit the strike catch block and this is a

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.080
good practice.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.330
This was introduced in Java 1.7.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.300
So the very first thing that I won't declare here is a connection variable.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.350
So I'll say your connection calm equals two.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.830
Create connection.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.920
The function that we just know road here.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.770
So this function is now being called.

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.100
We got a connection object and using the connection object.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.310
Let's create a prepared statement.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:17.030
Let's call it US S t m t equals toe conduct Prepared statement off some sq I don't have

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.930
this SQL It's a very simple SQL command.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.150
So select count off star from products.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:30.680
Then we say your results set artist equals toe s tempted our eggs.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.230
Good Quiet.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.700
Now,

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.070
since I declared all these three very butts in the try block over here they get

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.400
automatically closed.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.060
So we don't have to worry about the resource leak.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.820
Now that we have got the results,

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.670
it over here will say Always start next toe.

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:50.170
Make it moved to the first record available and the one lyrical because your seller's

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:57.060
account of star gives you one drove one column and what we want to written is a return.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.990
Orders don't get long.

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:05.580
11 corresponds to the first and only column that we have in our select statement.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.180
But either there is a return value or there is a exception being thrown.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.160
So this return is off.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.590
No use.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.160
Let's get it up by deleting them.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.800
Save it now.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:21.760
Our application is already let's go to our up conflict where we have created an instance

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.420
Off Jerry Busy product table here.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.850
Now Inslaw returning a new jail BBC product there will straight away like this,

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.110
we will assign this to a variable.

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.150
Let's call it US.

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.860
Deal equals two.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.300
Since Dio has not been declared,

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.210
it's giving me an error.

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.350
I'm gonna breast command one and get a quick fix Press enter on windows.

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.330
You press control one to do the same thing.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.970
Now that I got Deol.

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.180
I can say here returned,

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.870
be able.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.760
But before returning,

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.430
I would like to initialize some values for those centers.

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.560
So it's ideal dot set driver class thing.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:02.120
This happens to be our got its two dot de capital driver dear,

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.940
we're not set you're in now.

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:04.590
The Ural.

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.700
Either you can type it manually,

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.630
or you can copy it from our heads to console.

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:11.690
If you're using Mac,

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.660
you'll see that on the menu bar here,

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.280
there is an icon that hits to rid of his engine on Windows.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.180
It will be on the notification area at the right bottom.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.070
So if you right click on that on Windows or click on that,

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.050
you're on Mac,

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.420
you'll see that there's something on hedge to console.

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:29.490
When you click on that,

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.850
it opens the same in your deformed browser,

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.660
and now you can copy this from here.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.970
So this is my J BBC you're in.

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.760
I come back to Eclipse paints the same thing over here.

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.400
This is your GBC,

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.950
which is a client protocol hitched to Poland.

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:52.520
Recipe is the sorrow protocol slash slash several location till the year corresponds to the

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.090
home directory off your computer,

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:57.050
typically on UNIX platforms.

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.090
That's what it represents.

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:02.440
So since this particular file spring training is there in that particular location,

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:03.690
it's picking up from there.

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:05.190
So let's also type here,

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:05.960
be able darts.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.000
That user,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.250
which is este and dear,

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.140
would not set a password You.

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.120
And if it's an interesting,

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.660
you still have to give other physical assume now,

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:16.500
which is wrong.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:17.090
Now,

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.360
whenever we ask for GBC,

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.200
Diablo Spring will call this function and string cause dysfunction means that we are

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.780
creating an object under turning fully initialized,

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:27.650
being object.

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:32.620
So this is where the dependencies have been set and once the dependency have been set,

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.630
whenever we call the con function,

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:39.540
it's making us off this create connection function where the actual dependencies are used.

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:40.560
At that point in time,

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.630
eventually we get the product count.

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.640
So let's go to the program that we wrote earlier on,

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:46.950
Then run the same.

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:50.850
Make sure that you're getting the jelly BCD or not that the media will.

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:52.240
So when are under court,

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.960
you should now see that there are 77 products instead of 100 products,

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.450
which is actually coming from the database itself.
