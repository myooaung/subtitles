00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
If one row with multiple columns can be treated as a man,

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.900
then if you have a quietly the treatments multiple rows,

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:13.910
they can be treated as a bunch off maps on a bunch of maps can be represented as a list off

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:14.480
maps.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.670
So in orderto collect the values from Jerry Busy template Julie Busy Template gives me a

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.380
function that returns a list off maps.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.240
So let's make use of that to get the list of shippers.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.480
So let's go here.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.920
Come in this line and let's say we call it us.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.170
Print all shippers and the function Prindle Shippers doesn't exist.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:44.480
Let's go and create the same will make this as the package level function and the actual

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.490
quality is gonna be no strength.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.480
SQL equals toe sell it start from shippers.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.360
And when I called template dot quality for list,

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.550
I can supply justice string are string SQL with what kind of data date?

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:02.100
For example,

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.190
if I am given here select company name from shipper,

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.340
I would have got a list off strings.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.850
That's the reason why we have this day today,

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.400
and if the quality has questioned much of parameters,

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.090
you can supply them also and a few other variants along with this.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.860
So I'm gonna select this one.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.930
I'm supply the SQL alone.

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.510
Let's say we want to assign this to a variable called list on the list doesn't exist.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.990
So it's gonna be created by eclipse for me.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.060
When I click on this,

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:36.050
create local variable list and notice automatically becomes list off map but had given here

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.460
did it.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.610
I'd called string.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.070
Then I would have got list upstream.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.780
Now that I got the list,

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.830
I can look over the list.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:50.210
Let's say I give your for and I can simply say data in list without creating the valuable

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.850
data.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.860
It's giving me an editor and I can say create the loop Reliable data based on the unusual

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.070
elements data type.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.670
This variable gets created.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.090
So I'm gonna create this loop variable data and you can see it is a man and I can print the

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:11.790
name and phone off each of the shippers like this data don't get the get takes a key.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.860
I can type your company underscore name that the name off the shipper.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:24.820
Plus I can give the phone number like data got get for and let's give it a try now,

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:30.660
so we should get the list off all the name and phone numbers off the shipper and we got the

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.150
scene.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:37.800
Let's write one more example where I want only the name off the shippers so I can say your

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.950
print all shipper names.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.690
This time let's create another function on,

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:53.200
and the SQL Select Statement is gonna be string SQL equals toe select company name from

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.100
shippers,

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.950
and I can see your template dot quite a for a list.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.470
This time I'm gonna select the second variant where I say a skill.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:09.800
But the element of type is a string dark class and assigned this toe list just like the

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.630
previous one.

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.680
But this time the list is not going to be a list off map.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.780
But it's going to be a list off string because we explicitly mentioned that the element

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.040
here is a string,

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.670
and now we got that.

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.930
So let's loop over in print dollars times by just typing for string Name in list.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.170
Let's desperate the name like this.

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.610
Execute the court and we should get the list off all the company names off shippers
