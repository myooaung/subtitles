00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.920
by the time we deceived the errors object Spring has already added all possible data type

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.100
conversion enters.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:07.810
However,

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.460
we can add our own elements off.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.510
Others toe this errors collection to do so.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:20.850
Let's create a class called product validator and using that we will try toe validate our

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.020
product object since we don't have a product alligator This line make even after holding

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.670
for a second day of your product.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:37.130
Validator PV equals toe new product validated and recommend one or control one on Windows

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.770
toe.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.860
Create a class called product validator.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.090
Let's go and change the package toe quarter.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.180
We know dot validators a new one.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:53.000
We'll also say it implements that interface called validator from spring framework.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.160
Click on OK,

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.510
say finish.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:56.090
Let me see.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.350
You got two functions over here.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.180
Number one it is.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.210
What are the classes?

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.960
Does it support?

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.840
So spring is going to supply this class and say,

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:05.210
Hey,

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.100
do I support this product loss?

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.210
You say yes or no?

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.350
And then there is an actual function for validating and not the return take is still wide.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.850
That's because if there is any validation errors that you detected,

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.050
you have tow Add another object to this particular at ours collection,

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.370
and that's all we have to do.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:23.670
So let's do one thing.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.680
Let's first get it off the stool from here and then say Return the perimeter.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.110
I got class.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.140
Dot is assigned nable from product that plants.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.910
This is one way to say that Hey,

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.440
is this class that we're working on the product?

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.870
Plus,

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:44.550
then return true other resident and falls and let's go and write dysfunction.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:45.640
But before that,

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.280
let's go back to a product controller Onda.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:55.120
Call this function So we think your tv dot validate were to supply a target object,

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.590
which is nothing but PR.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.040
Remember that we are supplying this PR.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.620
The second is the others collection itself.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.090
So which means the validate function receives the product object over here.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.680
But it's received as a super type object.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.110
We have to know,

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.230
convert this back to product and then check for certain values and others.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:20.310
Is the collection off errors this may have zero are moderate zero because if there is no

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.380
data lead conversion error,

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.960
that may not be any other settle,

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.220
but if there is inundated address,

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.330
then this will contain some errors to check if there are any fields which are empty or just

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:37.140
user has pressed some white space is there is a utility class called Validation Util so I

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.700
can take your validation.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.410
You tills don't There are two functions that can reject editors.

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.820
One is called reject.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:45.740
If empty,

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.430
that means it only go check if it's an empty string.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.720
There is also another function called reject.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.420
If empty,

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.430
always space.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.760
There are many variants and I'm gonna take this one.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.910
This stays here.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.490
What are the others collection?

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.990
So we have received in this collection were giving that Ellis collection So this util

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.200
function will add another two days.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.130
What is the field that we're looking at?

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.160
The field here is product need that this is a request perimeter name?

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.950
Basically,

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.830
if the request perimeter park name is empty are a white spaces,

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.440
only then it is going look for an error court in our error messages.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.670
We don't have what we can give it in at once.

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.410
Let's see your product named dot empty.

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.650
That's the key it is trying to look for in kids.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.790
If that is missing than this actor,

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:40.960
the fallback or deformed message Let's give you something like product name is mandatory,

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.520
and that's the intimacy that I want to give.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.740
Say,

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:44.840
if you break it down,

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:51.260
you can see that the validation you deals don't reject if empty or white stays takes an

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.170
adverse collection,

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.350
which we received from the color the field it tricks is the product name.

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:58.850
If that is empty,

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:59.720
our weight space,

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:05.110
then it's gonna look for a key in the messages file core product named are empty If it is

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.940
not fun than this message will be used on,

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.090
it is going to be printed right here where there is a total for product,

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.450
which is right here.

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.390
So let's go back to the product validator.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:22.240
We can copy the same thing and paste it for all mandatory fields and make the necessary

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.800
changes.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.560
Let's say one other field that is mandatory is the unit price.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.550
I can type your unit price on probably copy and paste everywhere.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:32.940
That makes sense.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.640
It is gonna be unit price.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.660
That's tape it like this.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.770
And now let's add some custom validation rules.

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:40.580
For example,

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:46.690
the numerical fields like unit price units in stock units and order and reorder level they

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:47.830
cannot be negative.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.070
So let's do that.

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.790
First,

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.990
let's create a valuable called PR off product ID,

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.050
which is nothing but the target that received.

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.650
So let's first command one or controlled one toe at a cast.

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.220
Now we got PR on.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.720
Let's declare a variable call unit price,

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.210
which is equals to appear.

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.730
Lord get unit price unit price is supposed to be declared as double.

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:10.630
Let's do that.

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:11.550
Similarly,

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.720
I'm also going to do the same thing for others,

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:20.060
like units in Stop equals two appeared out gets units in stock command one,

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.110
Martin told one press.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:27.050
Enter units on order equals two pr dot get units on order.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.700
One lost is re ordered.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:34.070
Level equals toe pr dot get reorder level.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:39.940
We also want to use discontinued category 80 as a less supply ready also,

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.060
but we'll do that in a couple of minutes if you need to.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:50.090
Price is not equals TUNEL as the last unit price is less than zero,

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.710
then we want toe reject this field.

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.430
So to reject this field,

00:05:54.430 --> 00:06:00.040
we can say you're ever start reject value and select the field the field that we want to

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.360
reject.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.930
His unit price the other court,

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.120
which is going to be looked in other messages that properties.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.250
If it is there,

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:08.010
it's gonna use.

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:16.860
So with the unit price dot invalid and then probably I can say unit price must be greater

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:17.620
than zero.

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.860
So that's one nemesis.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.750
So I'm gonna copy and paste the same thing.

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.150
Make the necessary changes for the other one.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:32.890
Let's say units in stock All its that's done.

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:37.980
Now let's look at a couple of other validations such as Category I D and Supply I D.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:40.590
So let's declare a couple of variables for the same.

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:42.260
Let me make some room over here.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:43.910
Let's a category.

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:46.400
ID equals toe PR.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.320
Don't get category dark.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.400
Get category I.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:49.750
D.

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.320
This is an integer,

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.570
so let's create an integer variable supplier.

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:56.380
ID equals toe PR.

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.070
Don't get supplier.

00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:59.330
Don't get supply.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:06:59.840
I e.

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:06.410
It's also clear that variable we know that the default value in the drop down happens to B

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:09.320
minus one for this select option.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:14.090
So which means that the category I d existent supply really also exists.

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:16.300
But I don't want that to be minus one,

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:18.460
so I don't have to check in with equals to know,

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:23.040
because it will not be now so I can check if category I d.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.270
Is it equals toe.

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:27.850
Not then we want toe reject this category.

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:28.610
I d field.

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.140
But the property is not just category lately.

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.420
The property is category dot category 80.

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:36.170
Not just to show you that if I go back and right,

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:39.520
click on this drop down and then say inspect,

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:45.650
You will see the name and I d off this Drop downs are can't agree dot category 80

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:46.260
Importantly,

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.490
the name is category dot category 80.

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:51.600
This is the one that is considered as the field.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.430
So let's go back over here and they start rejected.

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:59.770
Value The field here is category dot category i d.

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:01.590
The other court is your choice.

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:02.630
You can give anything you want,

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:05.750
I can say category dot not selected.

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:11.450
And then the default value public and take Please select a category.

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:17.050
And I'm gonna copy the same thing from here and paste it over here.

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:19.770
This is gonna be a supply ready in debate.

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:26.870
So this is gonna be a supplier dot supply ready on day supplier not selected.

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:28.360
Please select a supply.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.560
So I've got those elements of this now,

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:34.280
And one last thing is that in case if you're not selected,

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:37.060
discontinued that radio button you're not selected.

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:42.490
I want to give that select an option so we'll create one last variable here.

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:46.440
Discontinued equals toe PR.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.290
Don't get discontinued.

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:51.610
That's an injury level on if this is no,

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:53.260
because if you're not selected anything,

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:54.480
this country be none.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.680
But the moment you click on one of the really Britain,

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.460
it will never be no again.

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:04.620
So I check your if discontinued is equals to know that means you haven't selected any off

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:04.960
them.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:05.970
So we're gonna say,

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:07.850
Don't start rejected by new.

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:16.550
On the field here is discontinued on the other court is that they discontinued dot not

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:22.580
selected and then defaulted a message saying that Please select an option.

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:25.190
And that should be my valuation.

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:26.260
So that's right.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.670
Nickel project run as run on Sarwar.

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:32.170
Save all the modified fights.

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:35.750
Let's go at a new product.

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:38.330
So without selecting any of these,

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:39.940
drop Don's without selecting the radio.

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:42.220
Britain's without tapping any of the text boxes.

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:43.950
If I click on submit changes,

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:46.980
we should now see product name is mandatory.

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:49.980
That's the custom rule that we are going in the product.

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:50.140
Well,

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:52.730
Editor unit price is mandatory.

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:54.180
That is also the correct one.

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:57.270
I was expecting an error message or here,

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:58.360
let's see what has happened.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.370
So in the product validator way,

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:02.320
we're doing the category check.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:05.160
So we're checking for Category 80 equals to know.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.170
But if you remember,

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:10.340
the drop down with the select option has minus one as its value.

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:12.790
That should be comparing that with a minus one.

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:14.410
Let's go check this out.

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:20.120
Restart dunk it Server is now restarted.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.050
So let's go back and then do the same thing.

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:22.560
Once again,

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:27.430
click on Submit changes and now we can see it is select a category.

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:31.410
I select one of the category and then click on Submit changes.

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:32.970
You'll see that the other is gone.

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:35.170
I select one of the supplier.

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:38.970
The other is supposed to have gone really a button.

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:40.200
Let's select it.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:40.940
Discontinued?

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:41.410
No,

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:42.720
that is also gone.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.200
Let's also try some product name here.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:45.560
Let's hear.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.230
For example,

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:49.230
it's called X Y Z Tomato ketchup.

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:52.060
Let's give it a unit price.

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:53.080
If you give negative,

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:56.650
you know that it's gonna give some other Let's give it us for example,

00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:59.320
say 12 in negative quantity.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:10:59.900
Pollen it.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:05.250
Let's just give it US 200 ml bottle and unit in stock.

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:08.150
Let's give some negative a Lutsen 20 units on order.

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:10.800
Let's give a negative value on reorder level.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:17.010
Let's give some negative value as well on these negative values should give me some errors

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:17.010
.

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:20.160
Right now you can see it's a unit price much bigger than zero on.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.400
All of them are same.

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.240
Let's remove the negative.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.470
Check that out and you see that others are gone.

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:30.710
Let's see more for all of them and see if our validations are going to pass.

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:34.840
Let's submit changes now and see if that record is added successfully,

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:35.640
which you can see.

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:36.970
It's added successfully.

00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:41.420
It's also go back to the DB year real on our select statement that click,

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:48.860
connect and say select star from products order by product underscored Ivy descending on.

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:49.630
Check it out.

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:55.080
It says product name is their supply ready for all the fields have taken their respective

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.590
