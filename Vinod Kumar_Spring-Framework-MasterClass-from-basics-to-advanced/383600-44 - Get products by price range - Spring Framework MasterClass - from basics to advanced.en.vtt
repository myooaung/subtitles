00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.860
suppose I want tohave a hyperlink.

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.410
Hear clicking on which,

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:05.130
instead of going to a controller,

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.380
I want toe render a jsp as off.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:08.750
Now,

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:09.960
if you click on this,

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.390
it goes to a controller,

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:13.140
worked with the modern on,

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.830
then goes to the JSP,

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:15.450
which is a view,

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.220
and that is how it is printing.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.280
But if I want just to J.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:19.490
C.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.830
To be printed because the jails before it's have been kept under Rabbi Nef,

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.450
which is not accessible to the client,

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.170
we can't give a hyperlink directly toe JST inside or Ravana.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.910
So there has to be an ultimate now.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.260
One of the method that you can do is you can create a new controller,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.110
function only toe return of you name,

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.810
but ultimately you can configure something called view controller on.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.160
That's what we want to see this time.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:51.250
So let's go and add a new link over here called products by price range.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.730
So let's go back to our head of Jsp F.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.450
I also would like to stop the dunk it at the raise.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:57.760
It keeps restarting,

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.160
so let's go to the head,

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:06.140
RJ SPF and add a pipe here and then a drift equals two.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.440
Don't slash praise for this is supposed to give me a jsp,

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.790
which displace a form to enter many Price and Max Brace.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:22.320
Let's give a classical Stobie Gideon Gideon Link and then we'll type your products by price

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.320
.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.270
Save this.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.150
Let's clear that J speak all price form under the pages folder,

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:34.320
Right Click the pages folder New jsp are just a file is also okay,

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.470
But if you give file,

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.920
then you get the extension Jace people get the extension is automatically taken.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.180
Someone type your price form press,

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.860
enter,

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:49.680
but delete everything from here and then type percentage at include filing court,

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.250
store dot slash header dodgy SPF and then copy business.

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.190
Same thing toe.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.380
Make it as footer.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:03.310
And let's just add your age to saying Enter the price range.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.950
We will add the form in a bit later,

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.450
but I just want to ensure that when I click on this hyperlink,

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.900
it should reach to this particular price form as off.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.060
No,

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.230
it's not gonna work like that,

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.650
so we don't even have to try that.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.350
But to make sure that it works,

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:24.260
let's go toe up conflict and see that our class has implemented that NBC configure.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.030
And with this we also have overdone a function called conficker before several handling

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.020
like this.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.550
There is another one which we can override.

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.550
So let's go toe source overrated.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:37.750
Implement methods.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.290
And if you see under Web,

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.470
NBC configure.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.970
We have a function here called Our View Controllers.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.790
So let's select that say okay,

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.870
and now we see we have access to something called View Controller Registry.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:51.730
Let's get it up.

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:58.920
The D forecourt that came and then say registry dot at a view controller way.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:05.950
Specify what is the part and the part happens to be our price for And this is a controller

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:12.550
object with a dot set view name to the logical name called Price Form.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.680
So let's save this on now.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.320
Restart,

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.950
dunk it and one stunk.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.130
It is restarted.

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.460
We should be able to click on the hyperlink.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.290
Goto the price form Dark Casey.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.130
Let's go back to the browser.

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.260
Refresh the page once,

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.290
and we should be able to see a new hyperlink over here.

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.740
And then I click on this.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.990
You should see that it's coming from the jsp.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.460
We thought we having to write a new controller.

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.870
So whenever you want oh,

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.310
invoke a jsp using a hyperlink,

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.790
all you have to do is tow.

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.400
Come over here and then add another entry for a Given Ural Pot.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.130
A view name.

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.740
Obviously,

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.630
the View name is nothing with the base.

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.250
Name off the filings off the JSP,

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.890
which is supposed to be under our Weber enough pages folder.

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.540
So now that we have got this,

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.330
let's go door price form I.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:11.310
A couple of text boxes with user can enter minimum price and maximum price and submit,

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.850
and we should get the filter or put so to do that,

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.450
let's add a form.

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:22.350
You can say action equals toe products by price range.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.650
Method equals toe get.

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:35.770
Let's create a deal whose classes role Pero consist off 12 groups,

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.740
and I can assign a bunch of grapes to a particular column.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.160
So in case if I want my form to consist of two columns,

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.010
one for labels and one for text boxes out off 12 grades,

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.050
I can as a maybe four to labels and eight tow.

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:56.720
The text boxes are I can make that as 50 50 so let's go and try something like that.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:02.640
Let's type your label class equals toe call on a medium device.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.270
There are four types of device.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.530
Extra small device.

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:06.680
Small devices,

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.220
medium and large,

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.080
so medium device corresponds to a laptop screens.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.840
So I'm gonna say MD and Hominy grits we want,

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:15.190
Let's say,

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.820
for example,

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.930
I want four out of 12 and then I say,

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:19.420
Here,

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:20.310
what is the Labour?

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:25.050
Let's say your milk price or minimum price on.

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:30.620
You can also specify that this particular label is a label for a text box.

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:31.880
So that's gonna be here.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.680
I said Deal class,

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.290
because toe call M.

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:36.160
V eight.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.400
So this particular Dave is gonna occupy the remaining eight.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.840
Great.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:40.740
Off the road.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.150
We have your input tight because stool next,

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:46.780
I lI equals toe.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:47.900
That's a min.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.340
And then I say name equals domain.

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:55.920
Name is important from server side point of view because this is the one that goes as a

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.200
query string perimeter.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.130
But idea is used by this label.

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.130
Are some JavaScript code we have,

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:05.640
Then I think classic calls to form control.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.580
This styles my input nicely.

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.820
Other than that nothing else is required here.

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:17.910
Let's also say that the label here is far this particular men so that if you click on this

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.640
particular text on the form this fixed,

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.760
what's gets highlighted are selected.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.430
So that's for the minimum one.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:27.260
Now that's copy and paste this for maximum.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.850
So let's change this to Max.

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:31.950
This is also Max.

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:35.150
You're and one more Max.

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.890
So now we have this min and Max.

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.120
That's one button over here,

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.330
but by the four acts like a submit button,

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.130
select a button class.

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.920
It goes toe Bt and BD in primary.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.630
So this is gonna be ah,

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:54.400
blue button and let's give a caption off submit or any other text.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.990
Save this now.

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:59.250
If I go back to the browser on the refresh,

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:01.050
we don't have a nice form.

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:01.930
Let's go back.

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:04.360
One more class here card form,

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:04.950
group,

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:06.190
copy,

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:06.620
business.

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:07.830
Anything for this.

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:08.370
Also,

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:09.150
save this.

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:10.140
Hopefully,

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:12.450
this should be a bit different.

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:16.230
You can see that there's a little bit gap added over here because of the form group.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:16.750
Also,

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:20.170
you can see that the minimum price and there's a huge gap here.

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:25.080
That's because the 12 groups are taken from here till the end off it.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:28.510
So if I want this to occupy a smaller space.

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:34.030
I can probably say that the whole form should occupy 50% off my screen.

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:39.000
So what I can do is I can take this and that form cut this from here.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.290
Created Deal,

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:41.160
whose classes?

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:49.020
The rope and at another bill whose classes just called So indicating that I want toe have a

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:53.160
column do classical is to call now,

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.360
but the bills will occupy 50%.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.760
That means this is going to take six.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.130
Creates on this is gonna take another sixth grade.

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:03.570
So if you are one more column that's going to be divided across like four plus four Plus,

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:04.620
for now,

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:06.460
this is gonna be a dummy column for me.

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:06.950
Now,

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:08.550
I don't want to have anything else,

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:09.200
Insect that.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.250
But inside this,

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:11.790
I'm gonna add my form.

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:12.730
Which uglier?

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:13.170
Good.

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:14.030
That's Indian.

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:14.990
This a bit.

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:17.060
And now we have a nice form.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:18.590
Let's go back or here,

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:20.350
do a refresh and we should know,

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:24.940
See that the form is occupying only 50% off the and that page.

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:26.410
So in any case,

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:32.550
when I type your main place that they're 50 and Max Price as 500 click on submit.

00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:36.170
You see that it's going to change from price form Here.

00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:44.180
Do products by price range with men equals to 50 and Max equals to find it sent as quite a

00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:44.980
stink parameter.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:46.190
Let's click on submit,

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:50.410
but I don't have your own mapping for this particular text.

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:53.230
So we are not getting any old Port 200.

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:56.400
This We're gonna read a controller handler function,

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.120
which is mapped to this products by price range.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.400
But I also want spring toe automatically.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.890
Give me this 50 and finder as to indigent,

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:07.230
valuable all probably double variables.

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:07.930
To do that,

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:14.000
let's go back to our product controller and we add a new function over here.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.740
Public stream get products by price range,

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:24.750
and I want spring to give me a double Men and double max.

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:30.750
And then I can simply return show products because ultimately that's where I want to go toe

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:34.050
and I'm gonna copy this request mapping and based here.

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:36.960
But the request mapping this time is not all products,

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.520
but it's basically the in the form.

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:42.440
We have this action products by Price Ridge.

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:43.490
This is what we want.

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:48.310
Let's go back on replace that this double men and double max.

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:50.230
When you're asking spring to give this,

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:54.440
we have toe tell spring were to look for these particular values.

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.450
And that is,

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:56.490
in our case,

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:59.250
found in the request perimeter.

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:02.160
These are called request perimeter of prior restraint Perimeter.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.060
The perimeter name is called Min and Max,

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:08.040
which coincidently match these two variables.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.240
But in case of the variable names are different.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:10.590
Daniel,

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:11.360
perimeter names.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.520
You may have to mention that.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:13.120
Also,

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.990
let's make some space over here,

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:18.440
and then we type your activated request,

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:19.150
madam,

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:24.550
and then automatically it looked for a perimeter with this name.

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:28.770
But if the name is different than you can added us mean over here like this.

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:30.030
But in my case,

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:30.890
since it is the same,

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:32.540
I'm not going toe do that.

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:36.330
I copy this and paste one more time for the max.

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:42.050
So there are two variables Min and Max now given by spring to me and I can make use off

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:42.520
that.

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:45.890
So I'm gonna copy these toe also over here.

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:50.830
But the actual function that I want in work is not get all products,

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:55.320
but it's gonna be get products by Price Ridge,

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.660
which takes Min and Max another title.

00:10:58.660 --> 00:10:58.940
Also,

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:08.700
I can change here I can say products priced between and then dollar plus 1,000,000 plus and

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:10.290
dollars plus max.

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:13.990
So I'm just giving a customized message for both the airport.

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:14.940
As you can see,

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:21.100
I don't have model here that also asked for modern so that we can store it in the modern

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:21.510
One.

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:22.980
Last thing is the function.

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:25.670
Get products by price range cruise daughter exception.

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:28.370
That's add that from our function also.

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:30.980
So if I check my function now,

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:32.530
you can see the function.

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:34.460
Signature says the name is get.

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:37.830
Products by price Range were asking for three dependencies.

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:40.060
Spring knows what to give any Oscar modern,

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:42.480
but we're also asking for men,

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.450
which is coming from request perimeter.

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:46.090
You're also asking for Max,

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:49.590
which is coming from request parameters on making use off.

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:55.550
Those were in walking a deal function and then storing it in a modern going to the same

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:55.970
view.

00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:59.900
So let's save this restart Tomcat in case if it's needed,

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:04.850
it says you're restart Once the sir,

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:05.410
what is ready?

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:06.960
Let's go back to the browser.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:11.510
Let's go access the home page first and see if everything is working.

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:13.350
Let's click on all products.

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:14.680
What's fine?

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.300
It's kicking products by price.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:18.040
We got this.

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:18.540
Let's type.

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:21.160
You're 50 and 500.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:22.570
Click on submit.

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:28.010
And now I should see all the products price between 50 and 500 just like that,

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:30.900
so I can go back to products by price.

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:31.400
That's there.

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.110
For example.

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:33.320
10 to 20.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.550
Click on submit,

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:38.060
and I see all the products between the price range off.

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:40.340
10 to 20 are being printed over here.
