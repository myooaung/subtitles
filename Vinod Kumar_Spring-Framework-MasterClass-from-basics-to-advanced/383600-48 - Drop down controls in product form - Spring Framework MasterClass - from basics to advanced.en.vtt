00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680
Now let's convert the category textbooks into a drop down.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:04.320
First,

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.670
I need a list off category objects.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.290
So this is what I'm gonna do.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:09.950
I will stop this arbor first.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.720
Let's go to the product.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.000
Deal into face.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.320
Let me close on these open fights.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.710
Andi Goto,

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.450
My dear package.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.540
There's a product deal interface.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.520
Let's either function here,

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.390
tow it through the list off categories.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.400
So I'm gonna go at the bottom at one new function or here.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:38.220
Let's say a public default list off category category is from our own into the package to

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.350
get all categories,

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.660
and this is supposed to throw an exception.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:45.700
Caldo exception.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.630
And that's also adity for body.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:48.350
For the same.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.920
We have this function now.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.970
We don't have an implementation for the same.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:57.030
Let's go to the hibernate template product deal and will provide an implementation for this

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.050
missing function.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.540
I'm gonna go press control space,

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.990
get all categories.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.950
That's the one that I want to overlay.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:09.150
We will create a detached criteria for the category object.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.460
So within the test criteria for class and the class is gonna be category start class,

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.350
which is our own indeedy class,

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:24.360
and then I think this a redone template dot find by criteria and then supplied d.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.760
C.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.790
This is gonna give me a list off objects,

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.500
whereas I have a list of category.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.500
That's the other message.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.970
It is.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.250
All I have to do is tow are cast,

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.990
so I'm gonna do that now.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.150
My function is ready now,

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.290
since this is to do with categories,

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:40.420
you may separately right,

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.600
a new category.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.090
Deol and work with that.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.430
But since there's the only function that I'm gonna use for categories,

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.770
I want to combine that in the product itself.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.820
So now let's go to our controller,

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.280
which is a product controller.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.140
Since this is where we're going and rendering a product form,

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.670
we have to supply another model activity,

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.660
which is a list of categories so that my product form can make use of the same.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.710
There is another way to do that,

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.280
but we'll follow that approach a bit later.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.510
For the time being,

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:12.790
Let's go and die peer model dot at attribute.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.350
The name of the attribute,

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:22.000
Al Qaeda's categories or category list on Europe Tape H T d or don't get all categories.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.490
That's what I want to say this throws an exception.

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:26.790
That's why it is giving another.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.450
Let's throw it away from the declaration.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.060
Save it now.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.220
If you go to the product form in the product form,

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.900
we have access to categories just like this PR.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.120
And to make use of these categories,

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.410
let's go to the product form,

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.490
which is right over here and let's go to the categories.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.510
This is the location where I've given the category.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.280
Let's full screen this.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:56.690
Let's get it off SF Colon input and are your Assef Colon Select particles toe category door

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.150
category i D.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.530
But the value should come from somewhere.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.350
Some will provide the options for the drop down.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:09.100
And I could take your SF colon options because I have a bunch of options that I want to get

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.540
from.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.030
And this is where you can specify some of the attribute.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.540
One of the attributes is items.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.140
The items corresponds to dollars categories.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.010
This is my list off categories that I store in the model execute in the product controller

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.750
restored here categories.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.730
That's what actually I'm trying to relate.

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.140
But from this particular categories,

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.350
what do you want as the label?

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.260
What do you want as the value.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.660
So you may have to are.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.800
They're also saying item Leven equals toe.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:46.210
I want the category name as the item label so I can see here critically.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.850
Name is supposed to come from here,

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.150
and the 2nd 1 is item value,

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.940
which is nothing but the value corresponding to the category you selected,

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.070
which is nothing but the category I d.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:02.700
So let's save this Restart our Tomcat and this survival started.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.330
Let's go back to the browser.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.180
Refresh this page once,

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.230
and it gives me the category as a bunch of options that I have here.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.290
And the only thing is that it has selected beverages by default because that happens to be

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.790
the 1st 1 But instead what I can do it.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:18.700
I can say here,

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.440
please select a category,

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.590
so I comport a dummy value over here.

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.650
Let's do that by going to our product form right before this.

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:32.870
SF Corn options that give SF colon options singular because we have a single value here,

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.060
the values going to remind us one indicating that the user has not done any selection and

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:43.660
then say Here label is dash dash something like select like this,

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.400
and I should see that this is the 1st 1 on one that is selected by default.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.250
And then there'll be a drop down values.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.190
I'm going to save this,

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.420
go back to the browser,

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:53.840
do a refresh,

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.460
and I should see now that it is select here.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.580
And if I am not,

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.000
any selection minus one will be the value for the category on.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.350
During my validation,

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.990
I can actually check if it's minus one,

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.850
displaying at a message over here.

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:13.270
One other thing that you can also see is that it is not style according Toa Bootstrap,

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.690
because we didn't add any CSS class for this and to see what is the styling.

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:18.900
For a drop down,

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.290
you can always go toe,

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:23.300
get food stamps dot com documentation,

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.630
and then you can type your select forms.

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.550
Custom forms select menu,

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.970
and you can see that the CSS class is called custom Select.

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.060
Let's go back to the product form on,

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.850
then say here,

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:39.570
select CSS class equals toe custom.

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:40.490
Select.

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:41.800
Save this.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.990
Go back to the browser refresh ones,

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:51.250
and now we can see we have a nice drop down that looks similar to the text boxes but it's a

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:51.890
drop down.

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.870
The drop down itself may look different in Windows and Mac,

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.480
so that's OK for us.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.450
But at least the form is not looking any different.

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:04.680
It also can work this supplier box in tow and drop down.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.660
So to do that,

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:06.440
let's go back.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.950
Stop this for a minute.

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:13.690
Goto my product deal with Java and I mean are one more function over here.

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:17.510
Public default list off supplier,

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:24.980
get all suppliers and then I'm gonna copy this part based over here,

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:30.420
supplier needs to be imported command shift all our control shift or will allow me to do

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:31.150
the same thing.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:32.600
Our select my quarter.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.950
Be no doubt into the supplier on.

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:36.140
Now that I have this,

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.630
I can go back to my implementation.

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.090
I had a very similar function over here,

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:42.850
so I'm gonna press control space,

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:44.620
get all suppliers,

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:45.490
is the court.

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:49.320
This is more or less the same except instead of category.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:55.070
I want supplier Someone copy this paste for here on based Over here.

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:59.770
So the other here says that it has not identified dysfunction in the product.

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:01.170
Do you want to save all of them?

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:04.550
That is gone now let's go toe product controller.

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.730
And that's at another model attribute.

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:09.390
So let's call it as modeled or at a tribute.

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:13.790
The name of the attribute is called Suppliers or anything you want,

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:14.820
like supply list.

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:16.720
There's gonna be HD video.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.550
Don't get all suppliers.

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:20.810
Andi,

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:22.840
Now that I have the suppliers here,

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.280
I can go to my product form on,

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.250
then pretty much copied this.

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:36.050
Replace that text about for the supplier and then changes toe supplier dot supplier idee.

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:41.330
And let's also say this is gonna be the Let's stop supplier storing the model.

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:41.890
Attribute.

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:46.140
This is gonna be company name on.

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:48.250
This is the supplier idee.

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:50.180
Save this.

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:51.650
Restart the server.

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:54.550
And this time that's at a new product.

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:56.530
So several restarted.

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:57.920
Let's go on at a new product.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.350
So I'm gonna kick on this ad product one city.

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:02.870
So I see a list of categories.

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:04.700
I see a list off suppliers.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.700
Let's go give a product name here.

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:14.560
Let's call it us Coca Cola Beverages and lets it is supplied by exotic liquids and let the

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:20.790
unit price Let's give it us around $80 for a back off stay,

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:23.050
15 units in stock.

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:23.470
Let their.

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:24.160
For example,

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:28.630
45 units on order is 03 other level is five.

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:30.130
Is it discontinued?

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:31.110
The answer is no.

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:34.020
I can also make this is the default in the product or Jolla.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:37.790
So that and new product always is gonna be like discontinued.

00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:38.220
No.

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.070
When I click on submit changes,

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:45.660
you should now see that it comes back with beverages and exotically quits as the category

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:48.950
and supplier details on all the values have been added.

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:50.280
We can also go back door.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:56.280
It's to console run this once more and you can see that it says 80 Coca Cola supplier.

00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:01.870
It is one category eighties one which is the value for the exotically quits and beverages

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:02.610
respectively.

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:05.160
And rest of the values have come anyways.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.550
In the next video,

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:12.630
let us toe some basic validations so that when I click on submit without supplying the

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:15.650
necessary values are by supplying wrong values,
