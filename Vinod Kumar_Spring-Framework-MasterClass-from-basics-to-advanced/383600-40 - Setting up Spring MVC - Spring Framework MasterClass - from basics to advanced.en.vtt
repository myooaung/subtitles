00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.990
in this demo,

00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.270
let us set up the Spring Web,

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.060
NBC to our application.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.540
So the very first thing that you have to do is tow.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.370
Add certain dependencies to your pond or XML.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:11.650
In fact,

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.110
we need all the dependencies that we used in our previous projects.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:21.250
So let's goto our previous Palm Durex Eman copy on The dependence is that we have over here

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:28.250
into our current bombed or XML In addition toe the one that we already have,

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.750
which is solid and GSP so that's opened up palm there except for the current project.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.930
After these Amero pasted over here,

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:37.860
save it.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.620
Apart from these dependencies,

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.030
we need one more dependency.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.180
That is the spring Web Embassy itself.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.020
Let me stop.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.060
Don't get for a while.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.320
Come back over here.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.220
Copy one of the spring dependency based it right next to it.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.860
Changes to spring dash red,

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:56.580
NBC.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:57.510
Save it.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.540
The files are getting downloaded fresh.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.180
Let's close this Andi create a couple off classes.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.850
As in any spring application,

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.450
we first need an app configuration file where all the spring beans are defined.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:23.350
So let's start by creating a new class called conflict and let's see the package toe C F G

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.350
.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.840
For good practices that's click finish.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.140
There are 200 nations you would like to add here.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.570
Number one is at the right configuration.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.120
Number two at the rate enable Web,

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.670
NBC.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.930
This will ensure that our NBC is configured.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.060
Basically,

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.790
what it does is it's going to set up our handler mapping view,

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.640
Result Wars and couple of others such means.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.050
So that is important.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.580
Apart from that,

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:52.850
will also add one more,

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.140
which is the components can with scans,

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.980
our base packages called out.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.480
We know dot Let's a Web dark controllers.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.120
We don't have this package,

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.190
but we're gonna keep our controllers in this particular package.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.360
So let's keep that order and any additional beats that you might want.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.610
Oh,

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.980
conficker over here,

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.760
one of the key configuration off a spring Web,

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.310
NBC.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.620
Ease toe Configure the friend controller,

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.550
which is the dispatches a threat.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.440
To do that,

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.480
you have to create a class that implements something.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.680
Our Web application,

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.650
initial lasers.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.960
I can make this class itself implement that.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:36.420
So let's do one thing that they are implements that application initialize er because of

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.950
which you're forced to overrate a function called on Start up.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.510
Basically,

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.260
this function gets executed on start up off your tongue,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.960
get are your application and the good access to your applications Separate context.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.760
Object using which you have to register a solid called dispatches.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.270
All right.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.330
And the dispatches.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.710
And let will take the reference off your spring container.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.520
I don't have a springtime dinner,

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.390
if you remember,

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.390
Previously be used to create annotation conflict application context.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:09.160
On this time,

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.650
we're gonna create something called annotation conflict that application context.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.620
So let's initialize CTX equals toe new,

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.170
an addition conflict application context.

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.310
And then we can register a configuration file.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:29.170
So it's a city extort register and then say here at conflict dot class in the annotation

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.580
conflict application context,

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.540
we could supply this directly,

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.650
but here we have so separately,

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.550
it just took this up conflict last.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.580
Once we got this somewhere,

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:39.730
we have to close it.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.680
We don't have to worry about that because now we're going to supply this to our dispatches

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.680
,

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.830
sir.

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:51.180
Let so how do we created dispatches and let you simply say here separate context This

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.600
variable what we have here some red context,

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.600
Don't I sublet and we supply some name.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.770
Let's say DS for dispatches separate.

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:07.070
And we say your new dispatcher separate on that takes an argument off Web application

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.750
context,

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.270
which is our city X.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.540
Let us assign this toe variable card sublet some name.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.670
Doesn't matter what it is.

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.300
We cleared that variable automatically using control one our command one.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.730
Now,

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.450
that summer it is ready.

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:28.360
You can see your salad dot are mapping toe slash And this is important because now we are

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:34.160
trying to say every client request toe this particular web application is handled by our

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.020
dispatches alert.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.450
Now,

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.980
typically,

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.320
we also like to lower the sunlight on don't get started.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:45.220
So they are subtler dot Set Lord on startup toe a sequence number.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.980
This is just a sequence number representing the older off separate loading.

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:56.240
So one means this is the first solar that gets loaded to check if our application is ready

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.850
or not.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.250
Let's create a controller in this particular package so I don't have this package.

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.430
Let's go create a new class under rebel packets.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.860
I'm gonna wreck like this new class.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.750
Let's remove the sunlit,

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.570
make arrests controllers,

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.160
make sure the felling is okay.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.160
Let's call this as Hello controller.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.180
Say finish.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:25.620
But if I want this to automatically be instance hated and had to say after it controller,

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.870
so that when the components can happens,

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:34.020
this class is now qualified for components can and an object off this is automatically

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.590
created.

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:40.050
Let's just put a constructor call here and see if this message comes up on our concern.

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.440
Let's go and die pure Hello,

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:43.190
controller.

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.050
Instance created.

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.000
Save it.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.810
Save the app conflict.

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:57.380
So now if I right click my project run as on server let's keep an eye on our log here on

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:02.090
the console and see if my message is printed.

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:07.330
So here is where we saw a message saying that initializing the separate DS.

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:12.280
So DS is the name that I gave for my dispatches have let dispatches a lit waas supplied

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.950
with our Web application context,

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:20.130
which scans for all the components in a specific package called Kordell.

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:23.140
We no doubt about that controllers it finds one,

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.270
and it loads that automatically,

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.100
which means I was spring.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:31.960
NBC set up is ready just to make sure that it is working.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.920
There does not test if I make a request,

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.080
will I be able to invoke a function over here.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:43.340
So let's get off this constructor at a function Public Street,

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.210
which is the return type off our function.

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:47.500
Let's call it us.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:53.090
Say hello and return the part to our GSP.

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:59.920
So let's assume that it's gonna be slash rabbi and F slash pages slash hello,

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:04.870
Dark GSP dysfunction is a handler for a specific You are.

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:11.100
So in order to tell spring that this function should be in world on a Ural part called us

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:14.180
Hello so I can see you're something like that.

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:18.830
Very request mapping and apart your hello dash,

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:19.550
NBC.

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:25.580
So when you make a request from the browser for a Ural Hits T T P Colon local host a gero

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:30.020
gero slash spring NBC Basics slash Hello,

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:36.950
NBC Spring NBC Basics corresponds Toe your application But between your application now we

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:38.580
have a mapping for slash.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:38.860
Hello,

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:39.550
NBC.

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:45.440
The dispatches salute will consult something called handler mapping which has collected all

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.880
the information in the beginning.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.350
And it knows that for slash Hello?

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:55.850
Embassy dysfunction is the handler function Handler mapping will simply give this functions

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:58.140
reference to our dispatches.

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:01.250
Elit dispatches alert will call this function.

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:08.260
We're supposed to make use of some Deol our service over here and then get the model data

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:09.720
are stored in some scope.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.570
We will see how to start the model later in the scope later,

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:18.040
but then eventually should say Who is the view that is supposed to be responsible for

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.320
presentation on?

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.750
We directly get the entire name here.

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:24.670
We will simplify this also to a logical name,

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:27.950
but right now it's going toe Look for hollowed out GSP.

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:37.780
So if I go back toe my pages folder over here under SRC Main that that rabbi in if on pages

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:39.750
you'll see that I don't have a hollowed out GSP,

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:41.940
let's create a whole Lord or chase Be over here.

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:48.830
New Jsp called Hello and let's change the title toe.

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:53.360
Hello and let's just print in a hard coded value off.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.200
Hello,

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.210
Spring,

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:55.770
NBC.

00:08:55.770 --> 00:09:01.030
We'll put a headshot say this also.

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:06.630
Let's put a console log over here so that we know that the control has reached this

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:07.250
location.

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:09.480
Let's call it as a low controller.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:14.890
Don't say hello called Save this.

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:17.970
Let's restart our Tomcat in Calif.

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:19.580
It's not starting automatically.

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:21.000
Sometimes you can see that the start.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:21.860
What status?

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:22.230
Say that.

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:23.150
Says Restart,

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:25.240
basically asking you to restart.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:27.890
Let's restart our server one.

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:29.200
Once it is restarted,

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:33.750
I can go back to my browser and access here.

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:34.940
Local host age.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:36.330
Rogelio Spring Embassy.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:37.340
Basic Slash.

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:38.270
Hello,

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:38.760
Dash,

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:39.580
NBC.

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:41.110
If a press internal,

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:44.110
I should get the response from the salad.

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:45.810
This is a J space are put here.

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:46.040
Hello,

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:47.020
string NBC.

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.710
But if I come back over here,

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:50.380
you can see on the server.

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:51.260
It has said that.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:51.560
