00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.310
Now that we have this product table with lots of functions,

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.190
let's create a new implementation using jelly.

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:06.990
Busy template.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.840
So for state skated off everything other than this,

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.010
let's create a new class under the package quarter.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:14.350
We know what deal.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.920
Let's call it us jelly.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.150
Bc template I got a deal,

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:26.550
so we given indication that it's implemented using this on it implements this.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.350
The interface is proud of deal so I can select the product deal from the history here,

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:37.900
even though there is inherited abstract methods because we have added default for each of

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:38.960
the functions in the product.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.190
You already don't get that.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:46.750
But what we can do is we can now go toe source and then say over implement methods and then

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.350
select probably all of them from the interface like this,

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.920
and then say Okay,

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.560
we got the functions.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.550
Now each of these functions must be implemented using the JBC template.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:06.830
So we want spring toe automatically inject a GBC template object and if you remember,

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.430
previously in APP config four.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.330
We do have a J BBC template over here,

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.600
And if I can add a components can annotation over here,

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.390
it can even scan the deal.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.000
Classes that are over here,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.050
Jerry BC product The war is a component because we market us at the red repository,

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.660
but its name is J D B C D A.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:27.080
Will.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.370
Let's also give a name here.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.920
Probably just Deol R J d d a wall.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:40.730
So let's give you at the rate repository and let's give it us JP Diello import the same.

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.500
And now I can do an auto wearing here for GBC template.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.470
Let's give it private Jerry Busy template.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.910
Let's call it S template That's important the same first,

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.640
and then add an illiterate auto wire annotation.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.600
You can say for the sake of demonstration record equals toe Falls.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.020
But in practice,

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.270
we don't want to give this at all.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.520
Let's keep that in mind and go back to up conflict fall and say that we want to scan the

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:18.660
deal package so with a great components can based packages equals two and a layoff packages

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.330
with only packets that I want to mention over here is called.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.820
Are we no doubt dio at this time Later,

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.670
we will add more packages as we go forward.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.850
Let's go back to O J BBC template for audio.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.020
And now that we have this template as a private variable,

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.150
I want to use them in each of these functions.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.170
The first function that I want to make you that that is this where I want toe add a new

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.720
product to do that.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.070
Let's get it off the to do and the default court that got generated over here.

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.200
Let's call the template or update function,

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.050
which takes and SQL Command and a bunch of perimeters.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.740
So first,

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.550
let's create the SQL Command,

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.600
which is nothing but insert in new products on values.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.890
I have 10 columns.

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.180
I have to give 10 caution,

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.250
much separated by comma.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.810
So I got five years.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.350
So I'm gonna copy this and based person.

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.530
So this is my actual insert command,

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.110
which can be used in the template dot update.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.580
Let's give a skill here.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:31.240
The values for each of the question marks come from this product that me rename this SP so

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.160
I can easily call that with p dot That Peter get product.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.010
I read that the 1st 1 2nd 1 is Peter.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:47.040
Get product name for the sequence off these values that I give must match the columns that

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.430
are dead in the products.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.870
If you're not sure of that,

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.150
then you can also give the list of columns over here like this.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.770
But let's go back to our DP and see that it's a product or any product name supply.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:59.030
Really?

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.060
Cadet created the next two to values.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.260
So I'm gonna give you Peter,

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.030
get Supply.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.750
And Heidi,

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.350
we don't get category I d.

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:16.330
Then we have Peter's get quantity per unit after the unit price unit in stock units on

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.810
order.

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:17.960
Peter,

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.450
get unit price.

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.450
You don't get units in Stop.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.170
We don't get units on order.

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:31.220
Then we have Peter get re all 11 on Peter Get discontinued.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.180
So these are the values for 10 cushion months that I've given over here,

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.510
and my ad product function is complete.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:45.390
One thing You also have to see that our function says it throws down exception.

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:51.550
But the only to link that I have here they don't throw any exception off that kind.

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:52.430
In fact,

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:53.770
if you look at the template,

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.230
our update function,

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:00.440
the update function signature say's that it throws an exception called data access

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.150
exception.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.260
So let's have a look at the same in type hierarchies on your oppressed command shift,

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.420
which and they data access exception.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.670
This is coming from our spring framework deal package,

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:18.750
and if you see that there is a bunch off sub classes for that.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:19.570
In fact,

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.260
this is the exception that is thrown by any off the spring.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.570
Data related classes such as Jerry Busy template,

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.350
hibernate template are in the older Russians,

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:30.260
something called J P.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.990
A template,

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.330
all of them.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:33.620
Any function you call,

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.670
they actually create an object off.

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:36.650
Get access exception.

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:37.490
And through that,

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:38.190
for example,

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.480
if you have a primary care violation,

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.490
there'll be a more specific exception in world.

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.860
But that exception is inheriting from their taxes exception,

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.590
which inherit somewhere from runtime exception,

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.540
making it as an unchecked exception.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:57.160
So what typically we have to do is to surround these two lines with a try,

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:57.500
catch,

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.000
block,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.860
catch the exception and then read through that exception as a new dove exception.

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.560
So that becomes very redundant court in all these functions.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.660
So the try catch block is something that becomes duplicate quarter evident in court,

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:16.720
which we can avoid by using a concept called aspect oriented programming No,

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:16.840
no,

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.460
it is that it is only the product.

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:20.960
There were implementation here,

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.580
but in our obligation we may have 10 to 24 different deal implementations,

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:30.650
each of them having 10 to 25 functions themselves in each one of them writing,

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:30.900
Try,

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.530
catch blood only to read.

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:37.580
Throw that as dumb exception is an unnecessary court with spring can handle that

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:42.300
automatically that we were looking toe when we cover aspect oriented programming.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:43.200
So far,

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:43.670
no,

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:49.370
even though the lines off court that I right here they do not throw Dior exception our

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:50.250
signature still,

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:51.500
says Dio exception,

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.030
which we need to fix,

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:55.540
which we will do during our position.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.960
So let's move on to the update product.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.060
The update product.

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:00.360
First,

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:06.090
let's come with a SQL statement for update products set.

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:10.590
I want to set each of the columns like product on the score name.

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:15.280
It goes to question month supplier underscored I d equals two question mark.

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:26.460
And for all the columns were the primary key value equals to question Mark now that I have

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:33.960
the complete SQL Update Command that they template dot update and supply the skill command

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:40.510
and the perimeters for this is almost the same as this for except that it started a product

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:42.860
name and then ends with the product ideas.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:46.170
So I'm gonna copy this one based for Were Here,

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:50.390
Put a comma and then the Peter get product already.

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:56.200
So I'm gonna pay Sit over here for the cynical and now my update command is also already

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:59.280
except that I have here the valuable card product.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.560
It's supposed to be P.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:05.900
Let's go and see if I can get the product to get a product.

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:07.600
I need the room mapper.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:11.760
So what I can do that can create a room Ever object as a member?

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:12.970
Variable over here.

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:17.950
So let's create a private row mapper off product type.

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:20.050
Let's imported from spring on.

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:22.250
This is the product type.

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:25.350
Let's call it us be autumn for product,

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:25.960
remember,

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:26.940
equals two.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:32.050
I can say artist for resents it on I for the current row number.

00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:36.970
Adul amicably Rocket toe represent something I need to return a value from here.

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:43.650
Let's first create a product B equals toe new product and then copy the value from honest.

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:47.380
So this peak at the end somewhere we say return B,

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:48.860
you can see that the Roma,

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:49.900
but is not giving another.

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:54.540
Except that I have to copy the violence from the results that to this speed which I do know

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:56.790
by typing Peter set product,

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:58.120
I'd be honest,

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.450
are get int off.

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:06.050
Brought it underscored i d and the same thing I have to do for the rest of the feels.

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:16.250
So now we have this p autumn,

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:17.950
which is a product room upper.

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:23.520
We can no supply this toe all our qualities and get function over here.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.440
Sprink and makers of that product,

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.210
remember,

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:30.700
convert the current road into a product object and give me the product object with check

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:31.990
and for director from here.

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:34.990
So let's go in at the select statement.

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:41.810
First string SQL equals Stoke Select star from products We're product underscored I d

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:42.940
equals two Forsmark.

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:50.050
And now I can simply say here returned template dot quality for object and then supplied

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:53.970
this SQL Rome apple and I d.

00:09:53.970 --> 00:10:00.550
That's this over here s cured p autumn and the product idea as the argument.

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:06.870
So this is automatically constructed product object based on this particular resented data

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:08.570
and the PR,

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:10.160
um dot macro function.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.660
Let's add the delete product,

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:17.370
and we want to make sure that the delete product only does a soft deal.

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:19.840
It not a hard deal it for this.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.520
It's not going to be a delete command.

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:23.180
Typically,

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:27.240
if you want to use the hard led would say delete from products we have product ready.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.110
Equal to so And so in our case,

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:31.600
we're gonna say discontinued equals to truth,

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.860
which is nothing but one.

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:42.000
So we'll just use here and stream s fuel equals toe update products set discontinued equals

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.060
toe one.

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:45.080
We're product underscored.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.690
I d equals two question mark.

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:53.920
And now I can see your template dot update and then the it's killed command and then the

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:54.510
parameter,

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:56.050
which is a product i d.

00:10:56.050 --> 00:11:00.450
So this will actually do the soft village meeting The product record exist,

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:02.240
but it's been discontinued.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.260
So typically,

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.810
when you get the list off all the product,

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:09.150
we should not get the list of products which are discontinued.

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:12.240
But in our next function over here,

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:16.850
where we're supposed to get the list of all the products we do send the list of all the

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:17.460
products,

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:19.280
including the ones that are discontinued.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.420
But in case if you want toe.

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:25.560
Use this function for displaying the data to an end user,

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.060
such as a customer who is planning to buy the products.

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:31.000
You should not be displaying the discontinued products.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.520
We're going to develop an application for the back office operations where an organization

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.810
employees going to work with these products,

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:40.310
not the actual customers.

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:41.670
So that's going right.

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:43.250
The SQL Select statement.

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:46.240
So string ask your equals toe selects,

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:53.470
start from products and then we say template dot quality and then simply supply this SQL

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:54.870
and then the PR,

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:57.090
which is the product from Apple.

00:11:57.090 --> 00:12:00.920
We do have toe return the value that this function returns,

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:03.050
which is nothing but the list of products itself.

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:05.870
The next one is an extension of the same.

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:08.250
So I'm gonna copy and paste this over here.

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:17.080
But I also have to say you were unit underscored price between two question marks like this

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:17.080
.

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.560
The SQL has parameters.

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:19.670
So after the product,

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:20.280
remember,

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:25.900
we can supply this min and Max and we get the list of products between those two price

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:26.500
rangers.

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:29.250
That is what we're for the returning from here.

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:30.640
What?

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.460
I would get products in Calgary.

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:37.190
It's pretty much the same as this song and copy and paste this over here.

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:44.190
And then this quality will change as where Category on the school I d equals to caution.

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:44.480
Mom,

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.170
on the category 80.

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:47.000
Whatever I receive,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.860
your will be the perimeter for this template.

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:53.260
That quality The function is for this one.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:58.540
Get products not in stock is another extension of the previous one.

00:12:58.540 --> 00:12:59.760
That's copy paste the same.

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:00.460
Over here.

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:08.060
Distended bodies Alexa from products were units in stock equals 20 So that is when it is

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:09.460
products are not in stock.

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:12.290
So we'll add that over here.

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:13.920
No,

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:14.210
madam,

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:18.520
it was required because they're quite it doesn't have any question much the same thing I

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:20.380
can copy and paste for the next one,

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:23.530
which is the get products in order.

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:24.920
It's copy paste.

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:29.010
The only change here is where units on art.

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:31.340
It is greater than zero.

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:34.560
That means there are some customers who are placed orders.

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:38.190
That's why this products have a unit on articulated and zero.

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:39.420
No question marks.

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:40.940
There is a small typo.

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:43.180
You're really supposed to be a units in stock,

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:44.610
not unit in stock.

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:51.350
That is done discontinued product again is pretty much the same as this copy best over here

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:51.350
.

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:56.710
So Select star from products where discontinued is true,

00:13:56.710 --> 00:14:02.680
so discontinued equals to one and no parameters over here.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:04.470
The last one is a bit different here,

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:06.420
so let's frustrate the SQL Command.

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:12.770
So string SQL equals toe select Count off star from products.

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:14.870
But when you return,

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:17.220
it is not the template or quality,

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:21.830
but it's the quality for object because we want a single value this time,

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:27.020
and the SQL is that the record is long dot class That way,

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:32.330
Jerry Busy template can words this numerical value into a long and returns the same thing

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:33.080
over here.

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:37.980
Let's see if this and in true that there is no syntax errors over here.

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:40.040
In orderto test to this,

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:42.860
let's go and clear a new program.

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:46.840
So let's go to the product Explorer Under programs,

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:56.760
let's create a new class that's called a desk 303 testing GBC template for a deal,

00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:02.940
and this is supposed to have a public static y remain where we're going to create a new

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:05.800
Sprinkle data by typing annotation.

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.580
Conflict application context.

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:13.120
City X equals two new annotation contact application context,

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:17.900
but the last thing that we're gonna supply here is gonna be at Conflict four.

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:18.820
Got class,

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:21.260
which is the modified Washington on safe.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:21.850
Go to the APP.

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:22.770
Conflict four.

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:24.720
We're doing a components can here,

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:28.900
so deal package has got to components right now.

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:32.880
So this is one component because we have got the repository.

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:37.470
This is another component because we have a repository there also,

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:40.620
but this one is actually the JD deal.

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:42.810
That's the new one that were created.

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:43.750
Demi product.

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:47.050
The war is not a repository order component,

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:49.160
so that doesn't qualify for components can.

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:52.550
So that conflict for does the competent scan,

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:57.640
and then it also creates to beans data source on the GBC template,

00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:58.940
Jerry Busy template.

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:02.050
We're doing a manual wearing off the data source.

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:03.060
However,

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:09.250
Jerry busy template itself is wild automatically toe our jerry busy template part of your

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:13.160
class using which we are doing all these operations.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.620
So we'll test one or two functions off this particular class.

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:20.310
So let's goto a new program and close the rest of them.

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:24.180
Let's say somewhere down the line to say city extra close.

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:27.020
Now here we will call a couple of functions.

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:32.070
First thing we want to do is to say we want a deer war from City X.

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:38.200
Selective City X Don't get being the name of the being is called Chitti Diablo and the

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.820
required tightest product,

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:41.460
the or dot class.

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:43.880
And we have to create a new,

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:45.590
reliable I press command.

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:46.440
One enter,

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.150
and that creates a product view.

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:54.540
So let's get one product from the deal by calling Get product supply and Islay.

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:55.770
Let's give one.

00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:57.170
Create the p,

00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:58.310
which is the product object.

00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:03.510
Now I have to either handle the exception by putting a try catch.

00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:07.590
Oregon threw away all the exceptions from the main function.

00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:08.540
So for the time being,

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:10.390
I'm gonna destroy with the exceptions,

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:12.450
not worrying about what happens all day.

00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:15.680
Let's print system that out of parental Andy,

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.390
but I don't have a two string.

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:20.680
So let's go to the product or Java and I like to string.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.690
So I'll say at two stream,

00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:27.680
all these will be included in the result and posting function.

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:30.650
So if I say this on run the court,

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:33.870
you should see the details off Product number one,

00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:38.890
which is child supply ready Kalogridis one product quantity opportunities,

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:42.200
10 boxes into 20 bags and so on on DSO four.

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.850
So we got the product.

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:46.360
Let's say I want toe update the product.

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:46.580
Pray.

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:48.350
So if you look at the product price,

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:53.810
the product place right now happens to be $18 I want to see if I can update that.

00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:55.180
Do $19.

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:59.350
I'm gonna see your p dot set unit price toe,

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:05.620
whatever its unit prices there plus $1.

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:07.060
So that's gonna be $19.

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:11.270
And then I have to say your beer or not update product off P.

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:17.850
Although the implementation here is updating on the fields were only interested in updating

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:18.950
the unit price.

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:22.560
The rest of them are already available in the product.

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.640
Be we did not change any off them there.

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.360
Everything else remains the same,

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:28.120
only the price that changed.

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:30.930
So this is supposed to update the product price alone.

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:33.030
Now what we'll do is I'll give us.

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:36.160
It's out here saying that price updated,

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:39.930
but we will go on check in the DB console,

00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:41.130
whether it is updated.

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:43.510
So I'm gonna just around this one's on.

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:46.720
It says here the current value is $18.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.240
You can see that it says $18 day on it,

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:50.480
says Price updated.

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.630
Let's go the browser and check the same.

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:54.800
So I'm gonna click on the products over here,

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:57.760
so that gives me a selects offering products.

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:02.820
Click on Run the very 1st 1 You can see that the unit price is $19.

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:06.920
One thing you may see here is that I did not do any commit,

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:08.810
but it got automatically committed.

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:11.620
This would be a scope off a problem,

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:14.680
because I won't be ableto customize the transactions.

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:15.400
For example,

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:20.270
what if I want Toe update three or four different products using three or four different

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:24.130
deer water Update functions and commit all of them together?

00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:25.500
Are you one of them fails.

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.240
I want to roll back all of them now.

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:29.780
This is where the transaction manager comes into picture.

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:31.370
But at this point in time,

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:36.810
that is an auto commit enable that will be able to see Let's go on a run this one more time

00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:40.550
and see if that is increased to $20.

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:42.770
So let's go back on a run this again,

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:45.850
and you can see that it's been updated to $20.

00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:50.420
Let's also get the list off products between price range.

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:58.120
Let's try here by typing list equals toe dear would not get products by price range.

00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:00.640
Let's give as $50 toe,

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:00.840
say,

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:02.140
$200.

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:04.010
The list is supposed to be created.

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:08.160
Let's press control one of command one and get that done.

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:09.560
We got the list.

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:17.470
I can say something like there are listed or size that give me the number of records

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:24.450
products between dollar 50 on Dollar 200.

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:26.920
That's execute that and check it out.

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:30.040
So it's supposed to tell me something like our own six products.

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:33.740
I guess So there six products between 50 and $200.

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:34.990
We can just check it out.

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:35.700
Or here,

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:44.820
where unit prize between 50 and 200 control enter will actually execute that quite here.

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:48.350
And these are the products that belonged to the price range.

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:55.760
One last thing we will check is list equals toe Delwar dot get discontinued products,

00:20:55.760 --> 00:21:04.550
since out there are listed outsize discontinued products.

00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:11.900
So say this execute the same and it is there are eight products that have been discontinued

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:16.050
and let's go back to the browser and very for the same were discontinued,

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:19.630
equals toe one.

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:27.240
Execute and you can see that are eight arose where the discontinued happens to be one as a

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:28.530
small exercise.

00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:32.250
I would like you to try testing the rest of the cord.

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:36.820
And I felt I have not made any mistakes in this particular implementation,

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:39.060
and you will be getting the output for each one of them.
