00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.990
let's begin by answering the question.

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:03.350
What is spring framework?

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:09.510
Spring is the most popular application development framework for enterprise shower Millions

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.450
of developers your spring to create high performing,

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.170
easily testable reusable court without any Wendell locking.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.530
Here is what Wikipedia says.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:24.080
The spring framework is an application framework on inversion off control container for the

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.990
Java platform.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.600
The frameworks core features can be used by any gel application,

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.390
but there are extensions for building Web applications on top of the Java E platform.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.890
Although the framework does not impose any specific programming modern,

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:46.530
it has become popular in the Jabal community as an addition to our even replacement for the

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.040
enterprise,

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.290
job weapons or aegypti Modern.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.670
The spring framework is open Source.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.860
The first wash In was written by Roger Johnson,

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.210
are popularly known as RaJohnson,

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.570
who released the framework with the publication of his book Expert one on one JT Design and

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.660
Development in October 2002.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:05.640
Since then,

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.180
many abortions are spring came each time bringing newest features to the framework.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.690
As of this recording,

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.460
the washing offspring is fighter two or three dot release.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.670
Currently,

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.080
spring is maintained by people tones after on the official website is Spring Daughter.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.390
You Spring is modular in nature,

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.240
providing the developer freedom to pick and choose the needed services.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.960
This was a great contrast to the then popular jet suitably applications where,

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.750
whether you need are not all the services were backed up in the jittery server,

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.250
making it very heavy.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.710
The core spring FBI provides a container off so called beads,

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:51.000
which are nothing but playing artery Joe optics in this container is where springs magic

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.680
happens.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.050
Spring not only manufactures and maintenance these beans,

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.920
but also identifies the dependence is among them and wires one with another.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.420
Although the initial goal was to make JSOW applications easier to use today,

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.370
spring has grown to an extent where there is no alternate to this framework.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:11.970
The framework itself has erupted.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.060
Almost all designed patterns and the number of lines.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.100
Of course we have to write is very less so that we can focus on the demined problems
