00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.650
whenever a controller returns a view.

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:07.800
This is supposed to be a logical name instead of physical fine name.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.050
So that tomorrow,

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:14.040
if you move this particular pages to a different location are if uranium this pages folder

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.030
to something else,

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.180
we don't have to come back and update all the controller functions in our application to do

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:20.600
that.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.800
What we want is we want to say that this is just show product.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.280
So I'm removing everything before show products on their dark jsp also,

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.120
which is after the show products.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.020
So basically,

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.170
I removed the prefix and the suffix part from the actually urine.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.090
But this doesn't work now.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.050
If you go and run your project,

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.160
it will actually give you a 404 era.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.300
So if you go to home and click on all products,

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.630
you can see that I'm getting a for not for error because it says that slashing NBC basic

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.770
slash show products is not a valid filing.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.400
So that's the reason why we're getting that other,

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.990
even though it is all products here.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.590
But even till it is looking for something called show dash products,

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.830
which is a logical name right now,

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.810
so How do we map this logical name to your physical?

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:11.530
Finally,

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:12.540
if you remember,

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.500
we have something called view results.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.700
So if you press command shift,

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.090
hedge on control,

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.310
shifted on windows and take view result,

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.420
would you get an interferes?

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.050
And the interface has got many implementations over here.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.640
Let's expand his abstract cashing view.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.880
Result were you can see that there is something called resource bundle View.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.760
Result were that means in a properties file.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.860
I can map this part show product to a physical filing.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.490
You also have something called You are based view.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.820
Result were that means whatever there you are,

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.450
we had given that same thing was used.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.220
We also have something called abstract template viewers over internal the source for your

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:54.570
results.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.700
Now this is the one that I want to use over here now on.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.830
This actually has functions called set prefix and set suffix inherited.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:03.610
From here,

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.580
you can see here set prefix and said suffix,

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:13.520
which means that the deleted perfect and Pacific's I can configure or using this you are

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.490
based view result,

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:15.960
which is called internal resource.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.320
The result were there's also a couple of others like excess LTV result were XML Beauties A

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.120
world etcetera.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.170
Now,

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.590
in order to configure this,

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.810
let's go toe at conflict created being off type view results.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.910
So let's make some room at the bottom.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:31.800
Andi,

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.680
adhere a public you can say I are We are in capital letters,

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.770
press control space that internal disorders view result.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:41.070
Well,

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.560
let's call it s I R.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.950
We are itself are maybe more sophisticated name like view result.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.360
It doesn't have any dependency.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.350
You simply have to create an object off this class.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:59.810
So let's say your i r we are equals toe new Internet resource the result over And then I

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:10.280
can say i r br dot set prefix to slash web slash pages and s slash because after that,

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.180
it's their show products and then a suffix should be like dot jsp.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:25.050
So I we are not set suffix off dot jsp So if I'm returning a view name called X from here,

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:32.230
then the inter notice of your results will argue slash webinars last pages slash and then x

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.360
dot jsp That becomes the result of name.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.910
Then we can say return.

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:43.360
I are we are the only thing I have to do now is to say that being saved this and then

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:49.710
restart don't get and then go back to the browser,

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:50.960
do a refresh.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.880
And this time I should not have any problems in getting the list of products.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.110
Similarly,

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.730
the hello controller that we had earlier in our controllers package here.

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:01.160
Also,

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.180
I can simply say here that it is supposed to be hello because right now,

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.800
if I go and access hollowed out NBC,

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:15.000
the enter name will also be perfect with slash weapon of slash pages slash and then this

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.210
and stuff and then a dodgy SB.

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:19.320
So in order for that to work properly,

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.380
we can say hello.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.490
Save this.

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:23.680
And now I should be able to access even.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.140
Hello,

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.380
NBC also.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.580
So let's go back to the browser and access.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:29.660
Hello,

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.910
Dash MBC press Enter Andi.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.350
I should get the hollow message like,

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.880
uglier
