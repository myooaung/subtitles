X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.620
to continue with our project.

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.820
Let's add annotations to our father Dark,

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:11.080
shallow as well as let's create another indeedy class for the supplier stable on Let's call

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.580
this supplier DiGel.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.600
So let's go back to our eclipse.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.780
Close this program.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.070
They click on Entity and create a new job.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.350
Lot last called Supply it.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.270
Press enter.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.770
This is gonna have fields corresponding.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.450
Toe column names in the supplier stable.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:29.630
That's going clear.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:30.250
The scene.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.250
Private individual supplier I need That's the primary key.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:46.330
Then we have a company We also have Contact me Contact title address,

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:47.140
City region,

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.790
postal court phone,

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.150
Fax homepage.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.230
Now that I have all the fields corresponding toe,

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.150
the column names.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.260
Let's also at the traditions such as,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.040
at the rate,

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.880
no arch constructor.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.670
And they said after it,

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:14.080
Getter Knowledge has had an addition that are required for hibernate so that entity and at

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.530
table name equals two suppliers.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.560
That's important thing from Java ex dot persistence package.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.660
Let's make supply ready as the fiery column as the less since the column name and the field

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:29.540
names are different.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.750
Let's add at column name equals toe supplier Underscore 80.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:41.290
That's import at column on copy paste the same thing for maybe rest of the fields.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.280
So here it's gonna be company.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.250
Underscore Name.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.230
This is the contact.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:47.150
Understood Me.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:55.550
Contact underscored Peyton Address City is same postal code.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.490
Happens to be postal.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:58.180
Underscore.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.370
Cool region,

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.390
country phone fax are OK.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.650
The home page happens to be home.

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:06.930
Underscore page.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.880
Now that we have got all of them,

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.290
let's go toe the product that job.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:18.240
So let's first are at entity and import the same at table import.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.190
The same table name equals two products.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.150
Let's also are at 80 for the product ready.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:34.470
Then we have your column because the name of the column here is product underscore.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.940
Really?

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.340
That's copy This based over here,

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.150
this is basically brought a name.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.470
We will also add to supply ready and calibrated,

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:46.670
because there anyway,

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:47.300
columns.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.340
So that's out here.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.740
Supplier underscore.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:50.250
Really?

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.450
As you less.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.260
Okay,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.440
big.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.780
Really.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:53.510
Underscore.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.950
80.

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:11.350
This is quantity for unit unique to underscore price units in stock on units on order.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:18.080
And one lost is really a living.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:25.000
And the column discontinued has the same name as the field discontinued over here.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.150
So we don't need toe have a great column Now this should be okay.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.340
However,

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:37.390
we wanted toe actually have category object as a less supplier object instead off supply

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:38.880
ready and Category 80.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.200
We can also have both of them mapped toe the same column,

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.050
but we may have to make one small change.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.430
First,

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:51.250
let's add a field correspondent toe the supplier that's clearly a private supplier.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.600
Supplying this is not a column mapping,

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.800
but it's a many to one column mapping.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.810
We say that many products have been supplied by one supplier,

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.630
so we can say that there are many to one.

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:11.590
We also have to say I did join column name of the giant column Happens to be supplying

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.100
understory now.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.960
This is where we will run into a problem.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:20.010
Because both at column and a joint column both of them correspond to the same column,

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.250
which is a problem.

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.170
In which case we can always say,

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.320
Hey,

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.010
one off them is read only it cannot be used for in certain update.

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.080
So it's your choice.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.720
Generally,

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.250
we will give it toe the column.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:37.640
Mapping here with the insert Doble equals two funds off datable equals two False without,

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.980
this will be an error while running the court the same way.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.510
I'm also going tohave here.

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.750
One more private category,

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.750
object off type category will also say that there many to one,

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.240
and we'll also say after it.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.480
Joined column Name off The Giant column.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.740
Happens to be category.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:58.670
Underscore 80.

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:59.870
Once again,

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.750
we have the conflict off column mapping over here,

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:08.970
so one of them have to be made read only so the same thing I'm gonna copy and base to add

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:15.490
Great column over here so that the conflict of column mapping is result.

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:21.160
Now that our annotated classes already let's create a hibernate template toe work with

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.250
hibernate in our spring applications.
