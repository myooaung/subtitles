00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.920
Let's go quickly.

00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.790
Create a bean off type transaction manager to do so.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.560
Let's come down somewhere here.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.460
Let's get a function public.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.790
Hibernate transaction manager.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.160
That's the written type.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.950
Let's call it us TX mgr.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.990
The fiber transaction manager has a dependency on session factory,

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.150
so let's just obtained the same thing.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.750
It's a spring will automatically inject a session factory here.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.620
Let's call the valuable last Session factory.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.560
Once we received this,

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:37.190
all I have to do is to return a new hibernate transaction manager with an argument off

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.530
Decision factory in order for spring toe automatically collect this being,

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:47.050
we have to say that there had bean and now our hibernate transaction manager is ready.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.900
Any transactional operations executed by Hibernate template,

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.020
which uses the same session factory,

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.050
will now be managed to buy this particular hibernate transaction Manager
