00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.960
in this demo,

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.410
let's understand the working off an M V C application,

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.360
which consists off a modern of you on a controller.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.820
The controller is simply a cell,

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:11.210
right?

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.210
So let's start by creating a separate.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.850
Let's call this as a greeting summit.

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.080
I can start with a separate here,

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.360
but I would like to go with the class and call it US greeting controller.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.540
This is supposed to be a solid,

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.550
so we're gonna inherit from http Sarette.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:35.940
That's press control space and select the 1st 1 that's also click on finish.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.740
As in the previous case,

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:44.250
let's add at Web Summit and give the Ural as slash greet.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.650
We'll also at the deformed serial Russian You I D.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:56.440
And we'll also already the do get this time so you can press control space and then type

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.720
Depot G.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:03.490
You'll see that they do get Let's get it off these different core and list of the

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.730
responsibilities off the controller as a controller.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:15.910
The first responsibility is toe really inputs from the request number two is it look a

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.770
model method toe get model later.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:28.380
The third is to store the model data in a school for a storage location,

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.960
which is accessible toe our view.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.310
And the fourth responsibility is Toe Follower.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.920
The request to the View,

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.850
which is Jsp anarchists.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.220
So first,

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:49.510
let's read the input from the user so I can say her string name because toe request start.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.750
Get perimeter off me so that the user may supply his or her name,

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.950
which we want to supply to a business logic function.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.070
In this case,

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.210
let's create a new class called as a greeting service,

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.650
which has a function probably called get message where we supply this perimeter and get a

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.050
customized to message.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.090
Then we store that message in the appropriate scope,

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.100
like a request,

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.790
our session,

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.310
our application scope.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.640
And then we go to a GSP.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.170
So first,

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.490
let's create a model class.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.950
So I'm gonna go on directly on my existing package.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.860
New class.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.160
Let's see the package toe caught up.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.480
You know dot service on Congress.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.740
Last asked greeting service,

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.370
the regular Jolla class.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:42.250
So no dependency on any baby PS and this will have a function public string Get message,

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.830
which takes a name from the user on written a customized message,

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:48.430
for example,

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.200
I can say hello class me plus an exclamation mark.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.710
But what if the name is empty?

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.080
So I can't say if name equals toe?

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.460
No.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.250
Then I can say name equals toe.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.040
Let's say red MBC save this.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.260
That's come back to our greeting controller.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.830
Now we have the modern.

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:13.540
We can improve that by typing Greeting service surveys equals toe new greeting service.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.160
And then I can say here MSG equals to service.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.580
Start,

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.970
get message off name.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:21.960
Now,

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.410
MSG is the return value from here,

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.290
which is a string willing to create one.

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.210
And once we got it,

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.950
the third responsibility of a controller is to store that in the school.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:33.580
Now,

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.890
scope is nothing but a storage location where you can store something on another.

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.910
Subtler jsp can make you that that request is one such storage location.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.870
All these scopes have a common function called set attribute.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.900
The activity has some key value.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:51.330
Pius,

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.160
I'm gonna get that key as message.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:59.310
But the variable MSG is what I want to store on the last responsibilities toe forward to a

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.190
jsp.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:06.930
Let's assume that we have a JCB somewhere we can say get request dispatcher to the GSP.

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.950
Let's assume that I'm gonna keep it in the Web.

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.850
I left pages for dinner that's called a desk greed dot jsp.

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.620
This is the request dispatcher,

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:16.440
So I can see.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:24.470
Here are the equals two and the request dispatcher has a function called Far were using

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.970
which I can forward the control toe that GSP No,

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.650
I can say rd dot forward request and restaurants.

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:38.140
No notice that when we go to this particular Jay's be using this already were supplying the

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.780
request on in this request were stored and attribute called Message,

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:43.990
which this James B.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.510
Has access to now.

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:55.520
So let's go back to our explorer Andi under SRC main bat under Weber and have noticed we

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.100
don't have a folder called Pages.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.750
Let's first create a folder called Pages.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:06.150
This is a convention You can give a different name if you feel like on the name of the Jsp

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.780
m supposed to create his greed.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:08.520
Dodgy SP.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:14.250
Let's do that right Click and say New jsp file here called greed.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:15.770
When I pressed Enter,

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.520
it gives me a basic template,

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.810
while I'll do is I'll display here,

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:28.240
NBC demo and in the Body and Hitch one and I want toe access this particular at tribute

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.150
that we have got a message.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:35.250
We can access them using dollar curly bracket message.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.680
If you want to be very specific to the request scope,

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.010
you can always say here request scope dot message.

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:44.380
But in our case,

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.720
it is there in the request scope.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.380
Anyways,

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.180
by default,

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.270
it looks in the request cope.

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.670
Let's leave that as it is and then let at a hit shot.

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:56.350
Probably a paragraph demo by not slash B.

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:57.830
Let's save this.

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.050
Save the controller Now.

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:01.070
This time,

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:02.950
instead of running my project,

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:06.070
I am going to run the summit itself directly.

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:11.690
So let me right click on the submit and then I have an option here called Ron s gonna

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:12.490
answer Well,

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:19.430
so now we can see it says great here directly it is giving me some more.

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:24.110
Put that NBC If you remember we did not supply any barometer.

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.340
So if I go back to my cellar here,

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:31.400
this is null because it is not were supplying another on in the get message function.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.710
If it is not,

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:37.220
we're giving this default value on the return value comes back toe.

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.750
My message message is stored in the scope.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.820
Now the JSP is the one which is printing it as a hitch.

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.350
One that the natural And then there is a paragraph.

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:46.910
If I want to supply name,

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:47.690
I can stay here.

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:49.690
Question Mark Name equals toe.

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:50.620
We not on.

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:52.200
You can see that it is Hello,

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:52.670
We not,

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:53.510
as you can see,

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:56.190
that the responsibilities have been distributed.

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:02.570
Now the greeting service is only looking at the Alamitos on its return value.

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:03.440
In this case,

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.650
it is a pure function.

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:10.030
But typically greeting service will have a dependency on a greeting Deol and it will

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:14.550
probably do some validations and then make use of the deer were to get the actual message.

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:18.240
That is what we typically do in our NBC James.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:18.440
Peace,

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:18.930
however,

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:21.450
are simple Java several pages.

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:24.350
There is no spring inward in this case,

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:25.660
at despite endemic list,

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:30.130
we simply display the data on the model later over here.

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:30.920
In other words,

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:37.670
we present the model later in the user understandable format on the controller is not doing

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:39.450
any such presentation logic,

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:40.750
our business logic,

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:42.190
our data access logic.

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:45.590
The focus here is on separation of conscience.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:48.410
So this is a simple example,

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:49.040
however,

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.520
in a large scale application,

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:51.770
it becomes very,

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:54.770
very complex to manage our own controllers.

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:59.780
So that is where spring comes into picture and simplifies the NBC freemark toe a very great

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:00.460
extent.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:01.610
So in the next video,

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:04.250
let us understand how spring NBC works.
