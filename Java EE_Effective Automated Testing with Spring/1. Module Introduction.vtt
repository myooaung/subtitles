00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.571
Hey, this is Billy with Pluralsight,

2
00:00:02.571 --> 00:00:07.425
and we're looking at how to write effective automated tests with Spring.

3
00:00:07.425 --> 00:00:09.280
So far in this course,

4
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.273
we have been leaning how to structure our code and make it

5
00:00:11.273 --> 00:00:14.866
easier to test and using tools provided by Spring to help

6
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:16.316
with testing our application.

7
00:00:16.316 --> 00:00:16.884
In this module,

8
00:00:16.884 --> 00:00:19.047
we're going to be looking at System Integration Testing to

9
00:00:19.047 --> 00:00:21.565
ensure our applications play well with others.

10
00:00:21.565 --> 00:00:26.335
In this module, we'll be covering what is system integration testing,

11
00:00:26.335 --> 00:00:30.446
what unique goals we are trying to accomplish when writing system

12
00:00:30.446 --> 00:00:33.300
integration tests versus other types of testing,

13
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.233
an introduction to TestContainers in Docker for system integration testing,

14
00:00:37.233 --> 00:00:47.000
which will also include a demo on these tools in action, and an overview and hands-on demo of Spring Cloud Contract.
