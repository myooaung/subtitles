Hi everyone.

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:10.081
My name is Billy Korando, and welcome to my course,

3
00:00:10.081 --> 00:00:11.898
Effective Automated Testing with Spring.

4
00:00:11.898 --> 00:00:14.525
I'm a software consultant with Keyhole Software.

5
00:00:14.525 --> 00:00:17.264
Frustrated with slow progress on your projects?

6
00:00:17.264 --> 00:00:20.420
Losing sleep because bugs keep popping up in prod?

7
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.990
Can't make heads or tails of the project you have just been assigned to?

8
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.663
In this course,

9
00:00:24.663 --> 00:00:28.105
we're going to learn how automated testing can speed up the development process,

10
00:00:28.105 --> 00:00:30.950
squash bugs before they make it to prod,

11
00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.000
and provide accurate documentation for you and future developers.

12
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.283
Some of the major topics that we will cover include

13
00:00:38.283 --> 00:00:39.925
the value of automated testing.

14
00:00:39.925 --> 00:00:42.557
We'll learn how automated testing is key to alleviating many

15
00:00:42.557 --> 00:00:44.307
of the struggles we face as developers,

16
00:00:44.307 --> 00:00:48.319
and how to get the most value out of the tests we write.

17
00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:51.035
Organizing code to make testing easy.

18
00:00:51.035 --> 00:00:53.542
There are several common mistakes developers make when

19
00:00:53.542 --> 00:00:55.484
writing code that make it difficult to test,

20
00:00:55.484 --> 00:00:58.471
and we'll learn what they are and how to avoid them.

21
00:00:58.471 --> 00:01:01.349
Practices that aid the software development process.

22
00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:04.867
Automated testing isn't just a post hoc process for catching bugs,

23
00:01:04.867 --> 00:01:08.476
but can be a powerful tool during the software writing process.

24
00:01:08.476 --> 00:01:10.460
And, tools that make testing easier.

25
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.574
Many tools have been developed over the years that

26
00:01:13.574 --> 00:01:18.295
make writing automated tests easier, and we'll learn how to use several of them.

27
00:01:18.295 --> 00:01:19.331
By the end of this course,

28
00:01:19.331 --> 00:01:22.516
you'll have the know-how and tools to quickly and easily cover

29
00:01:22.516 --> 00:01:25.062
projects you're working on in high-quality,

30
00:01:25.062 --> 00:01:25.911
automated tests.

31
00:01:25.911 --> 00:01:29.313
Before beginning this course, you should be familiar with Java,

32
00:01:29.313 --> 00:01:31.035
the basics of JUnit, and Spring.

33
00:01:31.035 --> 00:01:35.395
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn automated testing with

34
00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:43.000
the Effective Automated Testing with Spring course, at Pluralsight.
