00:00:02.461 --> 00:00:03.148
In this module,

2
00:00:03.148 --> 00:00:06.624
we learned how to further increase the value of the automated tests we write.

3
00:00:06.624 --> 00:00:09.677
Automated tests can do more than simply be a safety net

4
00:00:09.677 --> 00:00:11.480
catching bugs before they make it to prod,

5
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.733
or a tool to help during the development process,

6
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:16.613
like BDD or TDD.

7
00:00:16.613 --> 00:00:19.062
Automated tests can provide accurate and useful

8
00:00:19.062 --> 00:00:21.267
documentation on the application's they cover.

9
00:00:21.267 --> 00:00:25.233
We also learned about the next generation of unit testing

10
00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:28.189
with a brief introduction to JUnit 5.

11
00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.478
Finally,

12
00:00:28.478 --> 00:00:35.000
we also learned about behavior-driven development with a hands-on demo using Cucumber.
