00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:03.070
Throughout this course,

2
00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.515
I will periodically give definitions to terms I will be using to help with

3
00:00:06.515 --> 00:00:08.666
the task of comprehending the contents of this course.

4
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:09.395
In some cases,

5
00:00:09.395 --> 00:00:13.145
a term will have a different meaning depending upon the context it is used in,

6
00:00:13.145 --> 00:00:16.714
so it's important that I communicate the context in which I am using it.

7
00:00:16.714 --> 00:00:19.310
There's also the problem in which a term may be

8
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:20.773
frequently misused or ill defined,

9
00:00:20.773 --> 00:00:25.728
so I want to explain how I'm using the term so we are on the same page.

10
00:00:25.728 --> 00:00:29.140
Automated tests are tests designed to run as part of a continuous integration,

11
00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.361
or CI, process.

12
00:00:30.361 --> 00:00:35.490
Unit tests should be run every time a project is built by your CI server,

13
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.738
which should be happening with every commit to your central repository.

14
00:00:38.738 --> 00:00:41.038
Integration tests can be run less frequently,

15
00:00:41.038 --> 00:00:46.772
often nightly, as they typically take longer and may be more resource intensive.

16
00:00:46.772 --> 00:00:48.740
Dependency has different meanings in software development,

17
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.965
or at least several different ramifications.

18
00:00:50.965 --> 00:00:55.784
In Maven, for example, a dependency is a code library an application pulls in.

19
00:00:55.784 --> 00:00:57.552
In this course, or at least this module,

20
00:00:57.552 --> 00:01:05.000
I'll be talking about dependency as a resource a class utilizes. This can include another class, a web service, or a data store.
