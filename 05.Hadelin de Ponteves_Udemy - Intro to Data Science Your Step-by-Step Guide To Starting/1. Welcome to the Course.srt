1
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:08,400
My name is Carol or Maaco and along with the second instruction the scores.

2
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:09,580
I'd love that both of us.

3
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:15,970
We would like to extend a warm welcome to you into introduction to datasets.

4
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,060
We're so excited to have you on board.

5
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:21,180
This is going to be an amazing and fantastic journey.

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:26,570
We've been in data size and machine learning and artificial intelligence for quite some time now.

7
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:33,940
We've seen lots of students around the world become successful in this space and go from zero to hero.

8
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:39,460
And we really really all want the same success for you and that's why we've put this course together

9
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:43,030
to give you a roadmap of how to become successful.

10
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:49,510
And then this quick tutorial we just going to look at the structure of the course so you can understand

11
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:52,280
what it's all about and how to navigate it better.

12
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,400
So let's have a look.

13
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:59,620
And this course will have five sections in section one we're going to discuss the ultimate data science

14
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:00,830
guide here.

15
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:06,270
We will give you a roadmap of how to go about getting into this.

16
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:12,070
So if you're just starting out if this is your first time learning about their assets or you've only

17
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:20,350
seen little bits and piece of their science we will hope you have a structured way a structured path

18
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,080
through this.

19
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:26,140
And so you know exactly what you go through and how much time is spent on each topic so that you can

20
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:32,530
get to the end result in the most efficient way possible and learn everything you need to know to actually

21
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:35,980
start applying data science in your work.

22
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:42,240
In Section two we're going to give you a taste of data size with a specific tool called Tablo.

23
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:48,560
We'll give you a taste of a specific type of data science which is called visualization for data mining.

24
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,940
And this is specifically intended for you to get a feel for what it's like to be a data scientists were

25
00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:01,450
actually going to solve a real world case study real world challenge and you will see what goes into

26
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:07,660
being and scientists would kind of thinking mindset skill sets are required so you can understand for

27
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:13,060
yourself if this is indeed the right profession and if indeed you are interested in pursuing this further.

28
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,050
And then in section 3 will give you another test for data size.

29
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:21,310
But this time for different tool will give a taste for designs with Python and Adlon here will walk

30
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:28,840
us through applying to different machine learning algorithms to two different Dennison's problem.

31
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:34,360
And I love the section because both these sections actually because they're a testament to how quickly

32
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,820
you can get started into datasets if you follow up with the scores within a few hours you'll be solving

33
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:46,480
some very interesting real world challenges with some quite advanced techniques for this.

34
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:54,680
For example Section 3 will be applying some one machine learning algorithm to solve an energy problem

35
00:02:54,820 --> 00:03:00,790
and another machine learning algorithm to solve a health problem that can really impact people's lives

36
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,920
and impact different decisions that industries make.

37
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:13,270
Next in Section 4 we will talk about still signs of the cloud and we'll show you what this term is all

38
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:14,810
about why it's important.

39
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:23,290
And this is a quick quick overview because as a scientist you are likely to encounter the cloud and

40
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:29,420
some of your work will be in the closet and therefore want you to be prepared for what to expect from

41
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:33,140
this does come up in your career down the track.

42
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:39,760
And finally Section 5 will have a course conclusion where we'll run through everything that we've talked

43
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:46,290
about to make sure that we have a good recap and that you're ready to get on your way to becoming a

44
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,150
successful scientist.

45
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,620
So all in all a very exciting course.

46
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,520
We're super pumped to get started.

47
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:57,370
And for further ado let's dive straight into the next tutorial and I'll see you there.

48
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,770
And until next time enjoy Dallasites.
