00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:05.750
All right.

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.660
So welcome back to the resolution part of the intro today's science course.

3
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:17.010
And today we're going to continue with our visual data mining approach to the problem.

4
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:27.020
So what have we got so far we've gotten that to the stage where we've created a very useful tool inside

5
00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.890
our workbook which allows us to analyze the effect of certain variables.

6
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.540
In this case the way we can think that a person on the outcome.

7
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:45.080
So here we know that people who are contacted through mobile cellular had a 15 percent chance of taking

8
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.300
up the offer.

9
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:54.200
And and people who we last contacted by landline only had a 5 percent chance or only 5 percent conversion

10
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.510
rates or a chance conversion rate 5 percent of those people can vote.

11
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:04.290
And let's just reiterate the key here is that we put these into relative terms rather than absolutes

12
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.900
or an absolute of course there's more people in this box.

13
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.030
You know this 22 plus 3000 whereas there's only fourteen thousand plus or 100 here.

14
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.780
So a larger amount but not larger number of people.

15
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.200
But if we put them in percentage terms then we can compare side by side.

16
00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.960
OK.

17
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.890
So that's what we did for mobile or I mean.

18
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:26.210
Right.

19
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.220
So let's rename the sheet.

20
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.690
So if you double click on the this name here sheet one of each.

21
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.540
And you can change the name.

22
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.050
So we're going to change it to contact.

23
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.090
So we remember.

24
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:43.700
And so now let's look at another variable and what else do we have this look at the marital status and

25
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.700
instead of creating everything from scratch we're just going to click on this on a windows right click

26
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:58.570
or on a Mac press hold on control and left click and click duplicate and so now we're going to rename

27
00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:05.740
this right away to marital and all we're going to do is this is what I love about tabel is so quick

28
00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:14.360
to change things so quick to create resolutions all dragon Rob would be so much harder and other tools.

29
00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:22.210
So if you take marital and you drag it and you just put it over contact like replace it bam everything

30
00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.630
is done.

31
00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:23.500
That's it.

32
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.860
So as you can see because contact only came up once.

33
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:35.520
Now everything is about marital all of a sudden it's we're analyzing their marital status and who we

34
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:36.400
do people with.

35
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:44.140
What kind of marital status ended up having a higher probability of taking up our offer or what had

36
00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.910
a higher percentage of uptake or higher conversion rate for our offer.

37
00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:55.400
All right so here we've got marital as you can see we've got four columns now.

38
00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:02.480
So before it was more like an AB test cell versus a telephone here we've got four colos who got divorced

39
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.660
unmarried single and unknown.

40
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:11.050
And so what can you tell from this like try to be a data scientist maybe pause this video and try to

41
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:16.280
look at this and decide for yourself which ones have a high murder rate.

42
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:17.600
Which ones are more likely.

43
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.890
Well it's pretty straightforward pretty obvious from here.

44
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.780
From the way we are we've structured this is very easy to tell.

45
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:32.200
It's very easy to tell that people who are single were more likely to take up over 14 percent of the

46
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.160
people we contacted.

47
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.030
Again this is all in in relative terms.

48
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:42.900
Right 14 percent of the total number in this column we don't really care what the number was right now

49
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:43.180
right.

50
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.240
We don't care that this number is much greater.

51
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:52.510
Twenty five thousand here or almost 25000 whereas there's only like ten or eleven thousand here but

52
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.960
in relative terms is no difference.

53
00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.130
And again I'm just going to remind you that just double check that here you have.

54
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.520
You have what you have.

55
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.550
Quick table calculation percent of total checked off and compute using table down.

56
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.370
If you have compute using table across you'll have a different picture.

57
00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:12.600
Won't be the same.

58
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:18.110
It has to be table down meaning that the percentage is calculated in every single column separately.

59
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.840
And same here so in this in this one you just had some measure some.

60
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:30.440
But in this one you have a quick table calculation percent of total and compute using table down.

61
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:37.690
So here we can see that single people had a much higher not much higher but a higher chance of a high

62
00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:38.790
conversion rate.

63
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.330
Now why am I not pointing out the unknown.

64
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.840
The reason for that is first of all they're unknown so most likely like we can't really do much about

65
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:47.490
it right.

66
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.850
Maybe maybe we can't maybe there's like a feel in the feel we can like leverage that the field does

67
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.410
not.

68
00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.530
But the thing here is that maybe you picked up on this.

69
00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:03.260
The thing is that there's only 12 people in this category and 12 plus 60 80 or so in total.

70
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:10.330
There's 80 people in this whole called it looks like like a lot because we've put them in absolute terms

71
00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.140
in relative terms.

72
00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.010
They're all kind of like up to 100 percent.

73
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:21.640
But in reality there's like you know five thousand or four and a half thousand a year 23 11000 and then

74
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.290
there's like 80 people in this hall.

75
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:27.320
So what this means and this is something to look out for.

76
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.170
That this could actually be a sampling error or this could be just like a random effect.

77
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.690
It just randomly happened that we picked 80 people the 80 people that are in this column.

78
00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:45.400
It just they are just somehow for other reasons more likely to sign up to this off or rather than you

79
00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.180
know their marital status.

80
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:53.020
And that's an important thing to always remember they sense and that's why this is a good illustration

81
00:05:53.020 --> 00:06:00.850
of why in our guide for getting into data science statistics is at the start.

82
00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:01.120
Right.

83
00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:06.850
Like you don't need to know complex mistakes you don't need to know a lot of statistics but the basic

84
00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.490
things you need to understand a little bit.

85
00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:14.640
Like for instance you need to understand that this is not a statistically significant result and you

86
00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:19.540
know if you have 11000 here that's that's significant.

87
00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:24.580
Very unlikely that this happens at random that this effect is a random effect.

88
00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.940
But it is very likely that this is a random effect.

89
00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:36.230
We cannot say with certainty that this will be this is going to be replicable in the future.

90
00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.190
So that's why we're going to disregard this and we're only going to talk about these.

91
00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:44.650
So just something to keep in mind and it's a good illustration of why statistics matters and to what

92
00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:47.760
level knows all we need to understand is kind of like have a feel for it.

93
00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:53.560
And and of course before we present the results you would run if you were to go ahead like this you

94
00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:57.060
would run some statistical significance results and check them.

95
00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:59.920
But we're not going to do that now because we're focusing on results.

96
00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:05.860
So let's do quickly a couple more to duplicate this one.

97
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:07.600
And what do we want to look at.

98
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.390
We look at education.

99
00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:15.760
So just drag away here replace rename the good name.

100
00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:18.160
Always good to have things organized.

101
00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:24.460
And here again so you can see this one looks higher but this is probably our insignificant result.

102
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:31.690
It's got four so you can actually just right click and exclude If you are probably probably better to

103
00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:36.790
exclude the whole thing or just click here and right click and exclude.

104
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.190
So it doesn't get in the way.

105
00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:41.150
You know anything you feel is physically significant.

106
00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:46.040
As a rule of thumb try to go for at least 200 observations.

107
00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:52.060
Like everywhere like in each of these boxes at least that will kind of keep you safe but still in some

108
00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.610
cases it will still be a statistically insignificant.

109
00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:56.530
So what do we see here.

110
00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:58.510
You know unknown is unknown.

111
00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:04.300
Well we can see that people for university degree look like they're more likely to take up the offer

112
00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:13.480
than people who are most likely to take up law right or especially people who are of like 4 6 9 high

113
00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:16.790
school professionals so maybe that's something worth pointing out.

114
00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:22.510
There's either on duplicate that we're looking for like stronger effects.

115
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:24.350
Let's see if we can find anything stronger.

116
00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:32.260
So put this in and you noticed that probably that thing I showed you about excluding is probably don't

117
00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:38.050
do that because it adds a filter here and we don't want to get into filters right now so just right

118
00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:44.340
click here and remove this filter so that this this unknown comes back.

119
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:48.300
And so this issue this filters affecting our next slide.

120
00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:48.540
Right.

121
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:54.010
So either or or at least make sure you don't have filters when you proceed to next flood because otherwise

122
00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:55.720
it can get confusing.

123
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:56.310
OK.

124
00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.550
So what do we have here.

125
00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:03.840
If we add so now we put in loan right and loan means do they have.

126
00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:06.720
So we can go back here we can reference this.

127
00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:14.450
It says Have a look whereas loan loan Do they have a personal loan.

128
00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:21.880
So the people in the bottom we've got people who don't have a personal loan people have a personal and

129
00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:24.340
unknown as you can see there's no change.

130
00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:30.910
This has no effect and also these are quite statistically significant especially this one 100 these

131
00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:32.580
ones and maybe more or less OK.

132
00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:35.700
But nevertheless there is still nothing to observe anyway.

133
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:36.690
They're all 11 percent.

134
00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:46.790
So we can tell from here that most likely it doesn't really affect their decision to take up the product.

135
00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:51.460
You know whether or whether or not they have a loan a personal loan doesn't really affect their decision

136
00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:52.630
to make a product.

137
00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:53.030
All right.

138
00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.390
Let's duplicate this again.

139
00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:55.750
Let's do one more.

140
00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:58.370
And this one's going to be month.

141
00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:02.270
Let's see if it affects when what month we call them in.

142
00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:04.680
And here we see a much different picture.

143
00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.380
Very interesting as well right.

144
00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:09.560
And all of these look quite good except for the December 1.

145
00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:14.120
It has like 89 years observations there as have you know at least 200 400.

146
00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:22.750
But you can see the dispersion how this dispersion how the diversity of all of these you know some are

147
00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:24.250
higher some are lower.

148
00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:24.970
This is crazy.

149
00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:32.730
So what are going to do is I will leave you to explore this and try to understand why Esselmont highest

150
00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:39.760
in months low or just based on what you know about what happens in certain months and then we'll talk

151
00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.370
about it together next eternal.

152
00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:49.100
And also I wanted to suggest a quick for you looking at the Achree things to look at on your own.

153
00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:54.790
So we're not going to go through all the variables now but have a look at the next one on your on your

154
00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:55.000
own.

155
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.370
So look at housing.

156
00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:03.120
Day of the week and the outcome.

157
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:10.750
And remember the outcome is the outcome is outcome of the previous marketing campaign not the one we're

158
00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:16.150
doing now but previously did they take up their previous spanking campaign or not.

159
00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:18.430
So have a look at those on your own.

160
00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:22.480
Again it is housing it was day of the week and people come and see what you get.

161
00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:26.080
So there will be some some good practice.

162
00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:28.880
Remember data size is all about practice practice practice.

163
