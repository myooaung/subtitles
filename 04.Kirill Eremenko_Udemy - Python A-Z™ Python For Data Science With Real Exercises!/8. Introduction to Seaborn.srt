00:00:05,280  -->  00:00:08,190
Hello and welcome back to the python program of course.

2

00:00:08,190  -->  00:00:10,620
Today we're going to finally get to the fun stuff.

3

00:00:10,620  -->  00:00:17,640
So we are quite comfortable now with daughter sets where doorframes and how to filter them how to slice

4

00:00:17,640  -->  00:00:22,540
them how to access various parts of doorframes subset them.

5

00:00:22,800  -->  00:00:26,710
And finally we can proceed to some viz..

6

00:00:26,730  -->  00:00:32,850
So today we're talking about the seaborne package the Seaborn package is a very powerful position package

7

00:00:32,850  -->  00:00:33,930
for Python.

8

00:00:33,930  -->  00:00:36,700
It builds on top of matplotlib.

9

00:00:36,960  -->  00:00:39,310
So let's go ahead and import those.

10

00:00:39,370  -->  00:00:51,150
But marplot lib Pipelet plot as GLT and we're going to also add import seaborne as S and S S and S is

11

00:00:51,150  -->  00:00:58,170
a convention where Seaborn also are going to do that command that we know that plot Leib in line so

12

00:00:58,170  -->  00:01:04,590
the Graf's gets applauded in our chip in a notebook and well that's enough for now.

13

00:01:04,650  -->  00:01:05,770
Let's run that.

14

00:01:05,980  -->  00:01:10,530
Running is running's running matplotlib pipelined is quite large and we're also putting Seaborn on there

15

00:01:10,530  -->  00:01:10,890
.

16

00:01:10,950  -->  00:01:15,570
So seaborne we've already worked with pipelined before in this course.

17

00:01:15,780  -->  00:01:21,480
And what Seaborn does is it actually just makes obvious solutions better it gives us more awesome functions

18

00:01:21,510  -->  00:01:24,700
but at the end of the day it still uses matplotlib.

19

00:01:24,750  -->  00:01:30,690
It's kind of like a upgrade on top of my Podley and you'll see for yourself just now how cool it is

20

00:01:30,690  -->  00:01:31,780
how powerful it is.

21

00:01:31,950  -->  00:01:37,530
So let's create a distribution Right-O And of course we're going to use live daughter so the whole point

22

00:01:37,530  -->  00:01:40,590
of this course is to practice with live daughter.

23

00:01:40,680  -->  00:01:46,570
We've got this one we creating this one equals Asinus just Plaut is the command.

24

00:01:46,590  -->  00:01:51,830
So you can just go as soon as Doughton the press tab it'll give you all these different bar Plourde

25

00:01:51,840  -->  00:01:55,420
box Plaut you are facit grid pair grid.

26

00:01:55,440  -->  00:01:57,090
What else is interesting here.

27

00:01:57,180  -->  00:02:03,240
Cluster map but what we want is displayed so click displayed.

28

00:02:03,600  -->  00:02:09,090
And then here we just going to pause it in one variable so we're going to from our doorframes So let

29

00:02:09,090  -->  00:02:13,210
me just click here and I will click be on my keyboard while this is blue.

30

00:02:13,680  -->  00:02:14,910
And that gives us a new line.

31

00:02:14,910  -->  00:02:19,860
So here I am going to go stat's daughter head and we're going to post that one variable we are going

32

00:02:19,860  -->  00:02:25,410
to parse it the Internet uses columns are going to parse this column and we will see the distribution

33

00:02:25,410  -->  00:02:29,100
of Internet users in our daughter said sources stats.

34

00:02:29,460  -->  00:02:30,150
How do we do it.

35

00:02:30,150  -->  00:02:36,500
We say Square Records and then inter net users run that voila.

36

00:02:36,720  -->  00:02:37,590
There it is.

37

00:02:37,620  -->  00:02:44,940
Now we've got this error thing or it's an action Arutz warning come up and say so something visible

38

00:02:44,940  -->  00:02:51,060
depression deprecation warning using a non-integer number so basically it's not our fault it's something

39

00:02:51,120  -->  00:02:56,770
in the package that is going to be deprecated in some of the future versions.

40

00:02:56,820  -->  00:03:02,070
So it's not really in our control and moreover the creators of the package will make sure to update

41

00:03:02,070  -->  00:03:03,120
it most likely.

42

00:03:03,120  -->  00:03:06,750
So what we're going to do is we're just going to ignore this warning.

43

00:03:07,050  -->  00:03:11,020
So it will say import warnings.

44

00:03:11,400  -->  00:03:17,490
And here again to say warnings right away don't filter warnings.

45

00:03:18,080  -->  00:03:23,820
Ignore that so just copy these two lines add them to the top rear on that run that you're on that.

46

00:03:23,850  -->  00:03:25,200
And no more warnings.

47

00:03:25,200  -->  00:03:26,930
That's how we get rid of warnings.

48

00:03:26,970  -->  00:03:27,660
Beautiful.

49

00:03:27,660  -->  00:03:28,910
Very nice.

50

00:03:28,920  -->  00:03:29,460
What else can we do.

51

00:03:29,460  -->  00:03:33,060
Well you know right away we can expand this chart a bit to the right.

52

00:03:33,120  -->  00:03:38,750
Again I mentioned this before if I zoom out I'm just zoomed in so that we can see the code better.

53

00:03:38,820  -->  00:03:44,250
But if I zoom out you'll notice that these charts are actually very crisp and very clear.

54

00:03:44,250  -->  00:03:49,380
There's nothing like all the numbers everything is clear so if on your computer you're falling along

55

00:03:49,570  -->  00:03:54,240
hopefully you are just keep it zoomed out and you'll be able to see your own code and you'll be able

56

00:03:54,240  -->  00:03:59,580
to see the charts very nicely and clearly I'm going to zoom back in so that we can see the code.

57

00:03:59,580  -->  00:04:02,250
It's kind of like a trade off that we go to we've got to make.

58

00:04:02,490  -->  00:04:04,600
But nevertheless everything is good.

59

00:04:04,920  -->  00:04:10,280
So if we go down here what I wanted to do is increase the width of the chart because we got some whitespace

60

00:04:10,290  -->  00:04:10,720
on the right.

61

00:04:10,740  -->  00:04:12,310
Let's go ahead and do that.

62

00:04:12,480  -->  00:04:16,340
We're here in at the top which is going to do that for all the charges.

63

00:04:16,350  -->  00:04:26,050
We're going to peel T Dot R C arms figure fig size 8 come a full it colorful.

64

00:04:26,130  -->  00:04:30,990
Now I'm not going into too much detail about these things because we just need to increase it once and

65

00:04:30,990  -->  00:04:35,870
we don't need to know all of what's going on here and here basically we just into copy this line.

66

00:04:35,880  -->  00:04:41,490
And then if you ever need to know more details about how this exactly works you can always just look

67

00:04:41,490  -->  00:04:47,310
it up on line and this course would rather learn more data science related stuff and more awesome features

68

00:04:47,310  -->  00:04:48,680
of Python.

69

00:04:48,720  -->  00:04:54,500
So here you can see that with has increased and that is our distribution.

70

00:04:54,780  -->  00:04:55,080
OK.

71

00:04:55,080  -->  00:04:58,290
So now we're going to see if we can modify this situation.

72

00:04:58,290  -->  00:04:58,520
All right.

73

00:04:58,520  -->  00:05:04,160
So let's take that and now we'll just keep it as one because we're just changing it a little bit and

74

00:05:04,170  -->  00:05:09,330
here after this I'm going to press coma and ill press shift tab on my keyboard.

75

00:05:09,510  -->  00:05:14,970
What it shows me is is a pop up with some additional information which can do this problem is you can

76

00:05:14,970  -->  00:05:17,250
click the plus sign OK.

77

00:05:17,360  -->  00:05:20,620
So that's not the best I'm going to go to add some lines.

78

00:05:20,620  -->  00:05:24,720
I'm going to say click here could b b b b b b b for below.

79

00:05:25,000  -->  00:05:27,030
And then I'm going to press shift up here.

80

00:05:27,110  -->  00:05:33,470
Now if I look you'll see that it's got all this additional information so you can read up about how

81

00:05:33,470  -->  00:05:38,620
this function works flexibly Portie univariate distribution of observation.

82

00:05:38,660  -->  00:05:43,360
This function combines the Madlib lib his functions he can see it actually tells you how this function

83

00:05:43,370  -->  00:05:49,070
works parameters so you can find out the premise quickly here or he can read about them here.

84

00:05:49,400  -->  00:05:51,460
So the one we are interested in is beans.

85

00:05:51,650  -->  00:05:58,920
It's an argument for formidably behest or non optionals specification of beans of his beans or none

86

00:05:58,920  -->  00:05:59,490
.

87

00:05:59,560  -->  00:06:03,810
So you can actually read more about this specific problem if you go into the mad plot libber.

88

00:06:03,830  -->  00:06:09,380
His function helps you look for that online and read about bins then you'll get even more information

89

00:06:09,380  -->  00:06:10,190
on it.

90

00:06:10,190  -->  00:06:12,230
It's even got examples here and so on.

91

00:06:12,230  -->  00:06:19,150
So what we're going to do is we're just going to use bins and we're going to say beans equals 30 fire

92

00:06:19,220  -->  00:06:24,230
and that you'll see that now I have 30 bins and I don't mind that it goes to the left to the right.

93

00:06:24,230  -->  00:06:26,440
It's just because of this line otherwise.

94

00:06:26,480  -->  00:06:27,750
That is our distribution.

95

00:06:27,760  -->  00:06:30,960
You can see that that's what it looks like.

96

00:06:30,980  -->  00:06:37,800
Further you can again change a number of bins you can say 40 bins you can say 100 bins.

97

00:06:37,830  -->  00:06:42,280
Don't go too crazy because we know we don't have that many observations and now you're starting to see

98

00:06:42,290  -->  00:06:43,260
holes in your daughter.

99

00:06:43,400  -->  00:06:46,530
Or you can decrease the number of bins you can say five bins.

100

00:06:46,750  -->  00:06:49,010
And that changes it all again.

101

00:06:49,000  -->  00:06:50,780
So that's how we create bins.

102

00:06:50,810  -->  00:06:56,600
And once again this is just a quick introduction to seaborne to see what it's capable of let's say box

103

00:06:56,610  -->  00:07:06,260
plots these two equals as an asteroid walks plot and inherence daughter he calls stats and that by this

104

00:07:06,290  -->  00:07:12,300
are specifying that we want to work with this data frame and therefore in here we won't know long.

105

00:07:12,290  -->  00:07:17,320
We will no longer need to specify stat's every time when we call send call on so we're just going to

106

00:07:17,330  -->  00:07:19,630
say X equals income group.

107

00:07:19,940  -->  00:07:26,060
So that's our if we look at a frame that's our categorical variable and for why we're going to use perforating

108

00:07:26,060  -->  00:07:26,900
we're here.

109

00:07:26,990  -->  00:07:32,480
So we're going to see a box poised for income group and we're afraid it's going to be quite also quite

110

00:07:32,480  -->  00:07:37,100
insightful chart and then we'll see what incise we can derive from them.

111

00:07:37,100  -->  00:07:38,430
So there's our chart.

112

00:07:38,750  -->  00:07:40,530
Let's quickly start with this one.

113

00:07:40,850  -->  00:07:42,800
Let's change it back to 30.

114

00:07:43,250  -->  00:07:49,670
So you can see here is that we've got in terms of Burford Internet users we've got a hump over here

115

00:07:49,670  -->  00:07:49,750
.

116

00:07:49,750  -->  00:07:55,970
So quite a few people and a few countries have between 0 and 20 percent access to internet and then

117

00:07:55,970  -->  00:08:02,570
it drops off and then a lot of countries have between 20 or 30 and let's say 70.

118

00:08:02,780  -->  00:08:04,320
That's the internet user.

119

00:08:04,330  -->  00:08:09,830
So this chart basically tells you how many countries fall into which which group we're here and then

120

00:08:09,830  -->  00:08:10,420
it drops off.

121

00:08:10,430  -->  00:08:15,440
So the number of countries we have as you get closer to 100 percent Internet access it slowly drops

122

00:08:15,440  -->  00:08:15,980
off.

123

00:08:15,980  -->  00:08:21,650
So basically the majority of countries are sitting somewhere under 75 percent access to the Internet

124

00:08:21,640  -->  00:08:21,770
.

125

00:08:21,810  -->  00:08:27,010
We have some authors here but then there's quite a lot of countries sitting at 0 to 20.

126

00:08:27,000  -->  00:08:30,800
So it's not not like a bell curve a bell curve you'd expect it to go like that.

127

00:08:30,800  -->  00:08:33,220
Here it's a bit of a different type of distribution.

128

00:08:33,230  -->  00:08:39,970
Interesting observation and here we've got a box plot that talks to Burford by income group so in different

129

00:08:39,980  -->  00:08:40,680
income groups.

130

00:08:40,700  -->  00:08:47,310
Where do the Burford sits in the high income group you've got birthrates sitting somewhere around 12

131

00:08:47,340  -->  00:08:47,570
.

132

00:08:47,840  -->  00:08:53,350
And so you've got the first quarter second quarter third quarter I'll get some outliers so there are

133

00:08:53,360  -->  00:08:55,860
countries with high income of high birthrate.

134

00:08:56,060  -->  00:09:01,490
You've got low income most of the birthrate as high as expected and then upper middle income is closer

135

00:09:01,490  -->  00:09:06,230
to high income all are middle income is closer to lower income.

136

00:09:06,320  -->  00:09:08,830
Again very interesting chart as well.

137

00:09:09,050  -->  00:09:13,870
And one more thing I want to show you is the seaborne gallery.

138

00:09:14,000  -->  00:09:19,880
I'm going to Korea open up a new window I'm going to say seaborne Yeah Larry.

139

00:09:20,030  -->  00:09:21,590
So let's just look for that.

140

00:09:21,600  -->  00:09:27,890
And so this is our one example gallery if you just go to seaborne That's a Web site but it's just easier

141

00:09:27,880  -->  00:09:29,030
to look for in Google.

142

00:09:29,120  -->  00:09:30,400
And then you go to a gallery.

143

00:09:30,710  -->  00:09:38,060
They've got quite a lot of really interesting realisations here so you can click in them and understand

144

00:09:38,080  -->  00:09:40,720
like just have a look at them how they work.

145

00:09:40,730  -->  00:09:43,530
This is all created with Seaborn How beautiful is that right.

146

00:09:43,730  -->  00:09:45,620
And it's not much code at all see.

147

00:09:45,670  -->  00:09:49,690
Once you go through this course you'll be able to go in here find the one you like.

148

00:09:49,690  -->  00:09:54,310
Of course you will know everything but you'll know most of the things that you need to create and then

149

00:09:54,320  -->  00:09:58,940
some of the additional parameters or additional methods that they use.

150

00:09:58,970  -->  00:10:03,310
You could just look them up and understand how they work so that was a deep.

151

00:10:03,350  -->  00:10:05,630
That's a violin Plaut.

152

00:10:05,960  -->  00:10:11,660
I'll just share one more call one and then you can come back here and look these things up yourself

153

00:10:11,650  -->  00:10:12,030
.

154

00:10:12,190  -->  00:10:12,640
I don't know.

155

00:10:12,640  -->  00:10:14,760
Let's have a look at this one for example.

156

00:10:14,780  -->  00:10:16,770
So that's very cool I think.

157

00:10:16,820  -->  00:10:17,390
Very smooth.

158

00:10:17,380  -->  00:10:20,200
So times here is for a door frame.

159

00:10:20,210  -->  00:10:23,000
Not complex at all but it just looks very nice.

160

00:10:23,000  -->  00:10:30,440
So kind of reminds me of gg plot in our that's why I've grown to like this library or his package seaborne

161

00:10:30,460  -->  00:10:30,640
.

162

00:10:30,860  -->  00:10:32,320
So definitely have a look at that.

163

00:10:32,360  -->  00:10:38,420
This can be a useful tool in your analytics and data set when working.

164

00:10:38,890  -->  00:10:42,620
As I look forward to seeing you the next Tauriel until then happy coding
