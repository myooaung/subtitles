00:00:05,130  -->  00:00:10,050
Hello and welcome back to the course in Python programming is super excited to get the section started

2

00:00:10,330  -->  00:00:15,300
and we are going to kick off things with a list what is a list in Python.

3

00:00:15,330  -->  00:00:20,700
So we've already touched on lists before here and there is going to be a very quick tutorial very easy

4

00:00:20,850  -->  00:00:24,510
solidification of some of the things you've already seen about lists.

5

00:00:24,570  -->  00:00:26,610
So let's dive straight into it.

6

00:00:26,880  -->  00:00:32,310
So what is a lesson Python the best way to imagine a list and the way kind of I think about it is it's

7

00:00:32,360  -->  00:00:35,840
a horizontal bookshelf with elements inside it.

8

00:00:35,850  -->  00:00:43,950
So for instance let's say we have a list of some numbers in it so there's 50 30 400 11:7 24 681 and

9

00:00:43,950  -->  00:00:44,580
so on.

10

00:00:44,670  -->  00:00:49,140
So basically like a horizontal bookshelf and all of these elements inside of the list.

11

00:00:49,190  -->  00:00:54,570
Now the thing about lists is that they're kind of like arrows in other programming languages so if you

12

00:00:54,570  -->  00:01:01,140
studied C or C++ or other languages like that then you would be familiar with the concept of Aries and

13

00:01:01,410  -->  00:01:07,470
listen like areas but also in Python they are areas which are a separate thing and we'll talk more about

14

00:01:07,470  -->  00:01:07,820
them there.

15

00:01:07,830  -->  00:01:13,950
But for now you can imagine illest as an essential aere or if you studied our programming then a list

16

00:01:13,950  -->  00:01:15,330
is kind of like a vector.

17

00:01:15,600  -->  00:01:23,010
But once again there are certain specifics because a list is a ordered sequence of elements or ordered

18

00:01:23,070  -->  00:01:24,090
set of elements.

19

00:01:24,090  -->  00:01:31,010
They are all always enumerated so there is an element with number 0 element from a 1 2 3 4 5 and so

20

00:01:31,010  -->  00:01:31,140
on.

21

00:01:31,140  -->  00:01:34,410
So here we've got 10 elements in the list in total.

22

00:01:34,410  -->  00:01:39,480
But because the numeration starts at zero it goes all the way only up to 9 and not up to 10 so that's

23

00:01:39,480  -->  00:01:44,120
an important thing to remember especially if you're coming from are because there are vectors they are

24

00:01:44,120  -->  00:01:46,100
enumerated starting from one.

25

00:01:46,200  -->  00:01:51,360
In other program languages areas usually are numerate from 0 so if you're coming from there that's that's

26

00:01:51,390  -->  00:01:56,010
ok you'll you'll get she said or have Python is your first programming language then not a warrior at

27

00:01:56,010  -->  00:02:01,770
all just this is something to keep in mind that Numeration of lists starts with zero.

28

00:02:02,130  -->  00:02:04,510
So that's an example of a basic lesson python.

29

00:02:04,620  -->  00:02:08,800
A great thing about lists and Python is that you can have mixed data types.

30

00:02:08,940  -->  00:02:13,650
So for instance in our in a victory can only have elements of one specific type.

31

00:02:13,660  -->  00:02:19,760
So once you select the type it has to stay that in Python you can have a mix so here's two strings.

32

00:02:19,770  -->  00:02:23,010
A And hey then you've got a number so that's an integer.

33

00:02:23,010  -->  00:02:27,720
Then you've got logical value you've got a floating point value to another string and then you've got

34

00:02:27,720  -->  00:02:28,890
another integer.

35

00:02:29,130  -->  00:02:32,560
And once again everything is enumerated as 0 1 2 3 4 5 6.

36

00:02:32,790  -->  00:02:38,820
And that's pretty much it's about lists and the indexation is very useful because that's how we will

37

00:02:38,820  -->  00:02:41,700
access elements and you'll see that in the upcoming tutorials.

38

00:02:41,700  -->  00:02:48,270
That's what it's there for so that we know like the lists is the storage medium for information for

39

00:02:48,270  -->  00:02:50,420
data and then to access this data.

40

00:02:50,420  -->  00:02:55,530
We're going to be using the indexation So if we want out of this list to extract the value of true we'll

41

00:02:55,530  -->  00:03:00,010
go and ask for this or so for the value of the index of number three.

42

00:03:00,050  -->  00:03:03,990
Or if you want to extract twenty seven point five we'll ask for the value of the index of Number Four

43

00:03:04,320  -->  00:03:08,440
and you'll see all that an upcoming tutorial can't wait to see you there.

44

00:03:08,580  -->  00:03:10,200
Until next time happy coding

45

00:03:12,170  -->  00:03:15,380
.
