00:00:05.190  -->  00:00:07.860
Hello and welcome back to the python program of course.

2

00:00:07.860  -->  00:00:08.790
How did you go.

3

00:00:08.830  -->  00:00:10.030
We're experimenting.

4

00:00:10.050  -->  00:00:16.290
After a brief tutorial Did you have a chance to play around with the joint Plaut and specify different

5

00:00:16.290  -->  00:00:19.060
types of kinds or experiment with the variables.

6

00:00:19.070  -->  00:00:25.610
I hope you had a chance to do that and were able to kind of let that knowledge sink in.

7

00:00:25.630  -->  00:00:27.130
I bought the joint plot.

8

00:00:27.300  -->  00:00:31.700
Today we're going to continue and we're going to look at histograms.

9

00:00:31.710  -->  00:00:38.390
So first thing I'm going to zoom back into the chart or into Jupiter so we can see it better.

10

00:00:38.820  -->  00:00:44.310
And to make some space and actually going to remove the header and toolbar.

11

00:00:44.630  -->  00:00:45.130
OK.

12

00:00:45.270  -->  00:00:47.630
So let's proceed with today's story.

13

00:00:47.640  -->  00:00:54.540
So first thing I'm going to change this to marker or mark up by clicking M and then add a line here

14

00:00:54.560  -->  00:00:54.780
.

15

00:00:54.980  -->  00:00:58.690
And so today we're talking about Instagram.

16

00:00:59.100  -->  00:01:00.030
All right.

17

00:01:00.030  -->  00:01:06.750
So something that we already know about histograms So let's say I already know this method by the way

18

00:01:06.750  -->  00:01:11.100
today is going to be a very quick tutorial so we're just going to refresh on histograms before we proceed

19

00:01:11.130  -->  00:01:13.070
further in the section.

20

00:01:13.070  -->  00:01:20.170
So and one we already know this approach to Seagram's we know that you can say just Plaut movies Daut

21

00:01:20.310  -->  00:01:22.860
audience rating.

22

00:01:23.130  -->  00:01:24.320
Let's run that.

23

00:01:24.330  -->  00:01:29.820
There you go see you can see we've just created a histogram very quickly and even got to the probability

24

00:01:29.820  -->  00:01:30.980
density function.

25

00:01:30.990  -->  00:01:38.690
So if I specify Binz I can say I am less bin's I might say 15 or more bins.

26

00:01:38.910  -->  00:01:41.540
So you can specify less or more if you like.

27

00:01:41.760  -->  00:01:45.810
Therefore it will look a bit different but the essence stays the same.

28

00:01:46.080  -->  00:01:54.530
And another one that we can create is let's just take this and say to critic orating.

29

00:01:54.810  -->  00:01:57.840
So this the same thing but apply to cricket.

30

00:01:58.140  -->  00:02:04.110
So I want to show you another way of creating this distribution and this is a Throop Pipelet.

31

00:02:04.280  -->  00:02:08.790
Now seaborne is kind of like an upgrade on top of Pi Porto's and I don't.

32

00:02:08.790  -->  00:02:15.250
On top of Pi plot in terms of packaging because it does use the same functions in people are just packages

33

00:02:15.270  -->  00:02:21.090
in a lot of convenient things like for instance it adds this probability density function it adds the

34

00:02:21.090  -->  00:02:23.640
grid it makes the colors look good.

35

00:02:23.700  -->  00:02:27.270
So let's have a look at what the sin distribution would look like with fanciable.

36

00:02:27.320  -->  00:02:36.580
We've just Pipelet would say one equals P.L. T Dot HST or hit high SD Hills movies.

37

00:02:36.930  -->  00:02:43.450
Audience rating so if you press tab then it all out complete for you and Binns equals 15.

38

00:02:43.470  -->  00:02:48.310
So if I run that you can see that's what the distribution would have looked like before.

39

00:02:48.320  -->  00:02:52.150
SEABORNE So if I up that's a ridge that's the seaborne one.

40

00:02:52.470  -->  00:02:59.940
That's the pipeline one as you can see the seaborne even changed the x axis limits from minus 20 to

41

00:02:59.940  -->  00:03:05.660
120 and that's why it looks a bit smaller or further away in Pipelet that doesn't happen.

42

00:03:05.850  -->  00:03:12.930
And one more thing is you can actually still see the grid this grid is created by Seaborn and if not

43

00:03:12.930  -->  00:03:18.730
for Seaborn this child would have looked quite different it would have not had the grid.

44

00:03:18.960  -->  00:03:25.860
It's just kind of like a styling thing that Seaborn does so if if you want to see the original then

45

00:03:25.920  -->  00:03:32.640
we're going to just do this we're going to say as soon as dots at style and here is a white.

46

00:03:32.670  -->  00:03:36.150
So this is somewhat what the original would look like.

47

00:03:36.150  -->  00:03:42.480
It would still look a bit different but this is more what's the Pipelet version of that chart looks

48

00:03:42.480  -->  00:03:42.990
like.

49

00:03:43.350  -->  00:03:50.940
And now we're going to do the same thing for Kritik creating and notice that the grid didn't appear

50

00:03:50.940  -->  00:03:51.680
here as well.

51

00:03:51.690  -->  00:03:59.940
That's because the styling that you set is set for the package or for your instance of this bison that

52

00:03:59.940  -->  00:04:04.590
you're running so from now on even if you're on three or on this charts if you're on that you'll see

53

00:04:04.590  -->  00:04:06.890
that it doesn't have the grid anymore.

54

00:04:06.960  -->  00:04:13.860
So if you want to return the grid you'll have to add a different function here sells dark dark grids

55

00:04:14.160  -->  00:04:16.110
on that you'll see that the grid is back.

56

00:04:16.110  -->  00:04:17.580
So they write this down.

57

00:04:17.580  -->  00:04:23.460
These are quite useful if you want to change the styling they've got dark grid you've got white You've

58

00:04:23.460  -->  00:04:24.800
got quite a few options.

59

00:04:24.810  -->  00:04:26.850
We're actually running a bit ahead of ourselves.

60

00:04:26.850  -->  00:04:33.300
We'll talk about styling further down in the section of the course but it's a good intro anyway so why

61

00:04:33.300  -->  00:04:36.050
did we create these two charts what's so special about them.

62

00:04:36.180  -->  00:04:42.030
Well this is an interesting observation and not just interesting in terms of because these are indeed

63

00:04:42.030  -->  00:04:44.060
quite ordinary installations.

64

00:04:44.070  -->  00:04:48.330
They don't have anything complicated about them unlike the ones that were created previously.

65

00:04:48.540  -->  00:04:53.090
But what you will find is that they are quite interesting in terms of what they're saying.

66

00:04:53.370  -->  00:04:57.060
So here you've got the audience rating and you've got the credit rating.

67

00:04:57.300  -->  00:05:03.920
So the audience rating it's funny to see but it is normally it looks like it's normal distributor well

68

00:05:04.030  -->  00:05:09.870
and more or less so it's normally distributed so you can see that you've got the middle somewhere around

69

00:05:10.050  -->  00:05:16.980
maybe 50 or 60 percent ages and then it drops off both ways looks like a Belka rights if you look at

70

00:05:16.980  -->  00:05:23.730
this shape here you'll see that it does indeed look like an Bilker where as a critic creating it is

71

00:05:23.730  -->  00:05:30.900
actually not normally distributed see even though this has the tails and the left or right if you look

72

00:05:30.900  -->  00:05:37.530
at this version or here you can see that it's more kind of uniformly distributed so it's got this average

73

00:05:37.530  -->  00:05:39.560
line or the line going.

74

00:05:39.570  -->  00:05:41.260
The horizontal line going through here.

75

00:05:41.310  -->  00:05:43.200
So some with some of the ratings are above.

76

00:05:43.200  -->  00:05:49.480
So some of the ratings come more often frequently and those are lower ratings.

77

00:05:49.860  -->  00:05:57.990
And but at the same time more or less is uniform here is uniform here so critics unlike audience they

78

00:05:57.990  -->  00:06:02.940
behave in a different way so they have certain criteria how they market the movie and that's why this

79

00:06:02.940  -->  00:06:06.000
behavior isn't normally distributed.

80

00:06:06.000  -->  00:06:12.000
So it's got some rules behind it whereas when you've got just emotional type of behavior which is the

81

00:06:12.000  -->  00:06:17.670
audience which is normal human psychology that is all very often distributed normally.

82

00:06:17.670  -->  00:06:24.390
So it's interesting to observe how this dataset actually backs that concept that when something is natural

83

00:06:24.480  -->  00:06:30.810
when you just your impression about a movie and then you and you just post aerating and you have thousands

84

00:06:30.810  -->  00:06:35.840
and thousands and thousands of people posting the ratings just based on their natural intuition.

85

00:06:36.090  -->  00:06:38.160
You've got you've got a normal distribution.

86

00:06:38.340  -->  00:06:44.310
When critics come into play when they're using certain criteria to judge movies when they're looking

87

00:06:44.310  -->  00:06:50.230
at lighting when they're looking at sound effects when they're looking at the Plaut and they have some

88

00:06:50.250  -->  00:06:54.150
rules according to which a judge then the normal distribution is lost.

89

00:06:54.150  -->  00:06:56.370
Personally I find that very interesting.

90

00:06:56.520  -->  00:07:02.250
And this is something that I would definitely recommend conveying to the audience including in the report

91

00:07:02.250  -->  00:07:02.390
.

92

00:07:02.400  -->  00:07:08.190
So here I would say chart 2 and Hirose chart 3.

93

00:07:08.340  -->  00:07:13.260
So very very fascinating findings like that.

94

00:07:13.260  -->  00:07:21.150
Always interesting to see theories or hypotheses backed by actual data that we work with.

95

00:07:21.480  -->  00:07:22.110
So there we go.

96

00:07:22.110  -->  00:07:25.760
That's how we create histograms as just a quick refresher.

97

00:07:25.950  -->  00:07:30.800
And we got two more charts as you can see that was very quick we've already gotten three charts.

98

00:07:31.110  -->  00:07:39.180
And also we saw some very interesting phenomenon being a phenomenon confirming than normal distribution

99

00:07:39.390  -->  00:07:41.490
and the uniform distribution.

100

00:07:41.520  -->  00:07:42.790
So hopefully you enjoyed that.

101

00:07:42.810  -->  00:07:45.390
And I look forward to seeing you on the next material.

102

00:07:45.450  -->  00:07:48.070
Until then happy.
