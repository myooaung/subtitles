00:00:05.250  -->  00:00:08.100
Hello and welcome back to the Python programming course.

2

00:00:08.100  -->  00:00:11.900
Today we finally get to the fun stuff we're going to start off with.

3

00:00:11.970  -->  00:00:13.320
Brazil's Nations.

4

00:00:13.380  -->  00:00:13.770
All right.

5

00:00:13.800  -->  00:00:14.870
We're falling further is you.

6

00:00:14.940  -->  00:00:16.710
Let's jump straight into it.

7

00:00:16.740  -->  00:00:20.570
So we're going to import from a mad plot lib.

8

00:00:20.580  -->  00:00:28.530
We're going to import PI Plaut as usual as BLT actually and then we're going to import seaborne.

9

00:00:28.530  -->  00:00:35.880
So we were I had a bit of an intro to seaborne so Grange important as S and S then we're going to add

10

00:00:35.880  -->  00:00:42.990
a little quick code or a little quick command that will allow us to see resolutions right inside of

11

00:00:42.990  -->  00:00:45.930
Jupiter notebooks so moderately in line.

12

00:00:45.930  -->  00:00:48.840
So these all the standard imports that we do normally.

13

00:00:48.840  -->  00:00:51.800
And then of course we'll also do the warning.

14

00:00:52.290  -->  00:01:00.300
Because as we saw previously some warnings come up we don't want to see them filter warnings ignore

15

00:01:00.300  -->  00:01:01.000
.

16

00:01:01.050  -->  00:01:01.460
All right.

17

00:01:01.470  -->  00:01:04.760
Let's run that and our imports are done.

18

00:01:04.770  -->  00:01:06.710
So what are we going to start off with.

19

00:01:06.710  -->  00:01:12.190
What's the first type of chart that we're going to look at and that is a joint plot.

20

00:01:12.210  -->  00:01:17.600
So let's go ahead and create one joint plots a joint plot.

21

00:01:17.670  -->  00:01:24.120
It's quicker to create one and explain how it looks when we see it in front of us than to try to explain

22

00:01:24.120  -->  00:01:24.740
a farseeing.

23

00:01:24.750  -->  00:01:32.310
So let's go ahead and create one J equals s and s dot joint plot here we're going to pass the data that

24

00:01:32.310  -->  00:01:34.570
equals movies X..

25

00:01:34.710  -->  00:01:41.730
This is very very standard type of format so we were selecting a data set then we specify what colors

26

00:01:41.730  -->  00:01:50.420
we want to look at or what's a variable's critic rating and why it equals audience rating.

27

00:01:50.430  -->  00:01:51.860
Have a look.

28

00:01:51.860  -->  00:01:52.450
Voila.

29

00:01:52.540  -->  00:01:57.990
A German plot is ready and we'll zoom out a little bit so that it fits nice is a bit more.

30

00:01:57.990  -->  00:01:59.340
All right so there's our joint plot.

31

00:01:59.340  -->  00:02:02.020
And so what does the drone pilot show.

32

00:02:02.220  -->  00:02:07.610
So the Tobler got some stats and you can definitely go into a bit more detail knows if you like when

33

00:02:07.620  -->  00:02:08.950
we're going to do that now.

34

00:02:09.090  -->  00:02:12.480
For now we just want to understand how to read the giant plot.

35

00:02:12.480  -->  00:02:14.880
So basically it's a scatterplot as you can see.

36

00:02:15.030  -->  00:02:23.580
The critic creating audience rating scatterplot which shows you how if there's any relationship or dependency

37

00:02:23.580  -->  00:02:29.040
between the audience rating and critique creating as you can see if you draw a diagonal you know on

38

00:02:29.040  -->  00:02:35.820
this chart you'll see that overall the audience rating is above the Dagh all meaning that at a given

39

00:02:35.820  -->  00:02:36.760
critic creating.

40

00:02:36.780  -->  00:02:42.600
So 20 for instance the audience rating it looks like it's mostly above the diagonal so it's higher than

41

00:02:42.600  -->  00:02:47.030
20 so basically that means that the audience is a bit more forgiving to movies.

42

00:02:47.040  -->  00:02:51.990
But as you get into the further further we're here as you get into the higher ratings of the critics

43

00:02:52.350  -->  00:02:59.160
the audience ratings starts to match the critic rating as well more or less then in a joint plot wise

44

00:02:59.220  -->  00:03:03.450
collusion is because you also have these distributions on the left and right and it's a very interesting

45

00:03:03.450  -->  00:03:10.210
solution to visualizing a bi variant distribution here so we've got two variables creator creating what

46

00:03:10.210  -->  00:03:11.040
is rating.

47

00:03:11.070  -->  00:03:13.650
You can visualize them separately and have these distributions.

48

00:03:13.680  -->  00:03:18.420
Or you can visualize together but if you visualise them together then you have the question of where

49

00:03:18.450  -->  00:03:22.980
how do you see the distributions of the individual variables like if you don't look at the top.

50

00:03:23.010  -->  00:03:28.540
This chart you can really tell what kind of distribution you have here and that's why analysts and Darksiders

51

00:03:28.560  -->  00:03:34.620
have come up with this solution of putting these distributions on top and on the right and that allows

52

00:03:34.620  -->  00:03:38.850
you to see very clearly like this one looks like more or less like a normal distribution.

53

00:03:38.850  -->  00:03:44.520
Audience rating what is critic rating it looks more uniform and we'll talk more about that further down

54

00:03:44.640  -->  00:03:48.370
in this part of the course in this section.

55

00:03:48.690  -->  00:03:53.550
And so there's basically a joint plot very easy to create as you can see in Python it's very easy to

56

00:03:53.550  -->  00:03:59.520
create basically one line three parts into your function and you get a joint plot that's thank you very

57

00:03:59.520  -->  00:04:05.330
much to seaborne allows you to create some interesting adulations very simply.

58

00:04:05.460  -->  00:04:11.820
The other thing I want to show you is you can take this joint plot and change the style of the join

59

00:04:11.820  -->  00:04:13.590
plot so if you add a parameter.

60

00:04:13.830  -->  00:04:17.070
Well first I'm going to add a comma and then if a press shift tab.

61

00:04:17.150  -->  00:04:25.520
Why I like Jupiter so much is that it's got these are the main reason I like Jupiter is gods.

62

00:04:25.590  -->  00:04:32.280
Very helpful information so all of this help that pops up is very useful so I'm going to actually first

63

00:04:32.460  -->  00:04:38.310
add some lines and when I click here and some lines below so that we make some space and Africa shift

64

00:04:38.340  -->  00:04:46.450
enter a shipment shift tab I click shift tab you'll see that you can read more about this join upload

65

00:04:46.470  -->  00:04:52.890
function which comes from Seaborn and here it will tell you some parameters so x y Datto we were using

66

00:04:52.890  -->  00:04:53.120
those.

67

00:04:53.120  -->  00:04:58.120
And then here we've got kind and kind you can specify scatter that's a default value.

68

00:04:58.200  -->  00:05:03.510
That's a scatterplot what we're going to do is we're going to change this now to a different value.

69

00:05:03.510  -->  00:05:08.430
So again you can look at other parameters if you like and you can read more about them here.

70

00:05:08.430  -->  00:05:14.280
So if you look at kind you've got some couple a couple of options you've got scatter reg for aggression

71

00:05:14.280  -->  00:05:16.600
resod Cady hex.

72

00:05:16.980  -->  00:05:22.200
So the one we were interested in is we going to look at Hex today.

73

00:05:22.410  -->  00:05:24.150
So go ahead if you like.

74

00:05:24.150  -->  00:05:25.470
Feel free to experiment with those.

75

00:05:25.470  -->  00:05:28.040
But for now we're just going to do the hex parameter.

76

00:05:28.040  -->  00:05:29.330
So let's go kind.

77

00:05:29.400  -->  00:05:32.660
And here we go and you say don't forget the quotation marks hex.

78

00:05:32.880  -->  00:05:33.850
You're on that.

79

00:05:33.960  -->  00:05:37.250
You can see now you've got a hexagon diagram.

80

00:05:37.260  -->  00:05:41.050
So a bit of a change right so you've got that here.

81

00:05:41.240  -->  00:05:45.300
Here hexagon is quite useful because it groups a dog.

82

00:05:45.300  -->  00:05:50.760
So for instance here you you might not see the clusters like this looks like a cluster but you don't

83

00:05:50.760  -->  00:05:57.810
see that really there's a cluster here and you can't really pinpoint the cluster in this area but the

84

00:05:57.810  -->  00:06:02.660
hecks allows you to do that or does that automatically for you so you can see that there is a cluster

85

00:06:02.660  -->  00:06:10.200
or there is a closer and closer and not surprisingly those clusters do are associated with the distributions

86

00:06:10.200  -->  00:06:16.260
here so you can see distribution goes up and this vision goes up here and that's where the cluster is

87

00:06:16.260  -->  00:06:16.500
.

88

00:06:16.500  -->  00:06:21.630
Same thing here you can see this spike in distribution a bit of a spike hence cluster there.

89

00:06:21.630  -->  00:06:22.970
And so on.

90

00:06:22.980  -->  00:06:28.560
So that's it's an interesting type of diagram you don't often see it especially in other programming

91

00:06:28.560  -->  00:06:30.740
languages like an even an art.

92

00:06:30.780  -->  00:06:36.060
It would take some effort to create something like this but that's why you've got seaborne in Python

93

00:06:36.060  -->  00:06:36.320
.

94

00:06:36.330  -->  00:06:39.100
It does simplify a lot of things.

95

00:06:39.240  -->  00:06:45.500
It allows you to create a joint plot hexagon distribution or plot just like that.

96

00:06:45.510  -->  00:06:46.460
Very simple.

97

00:06:46.770  -->  00:06:47.490
So there we go.

98

00:06:47.490  -->  00:06:49.000
Looks like a very interesting chart.

99

00:06:49.020  -->  00:06:57.690
And that is the chart number one that we're going to take to our entire report let's say chart number

100

00:06:57.690  -->  00:06:58.880
one.

101

00:06:58.920  -->  00:06:59.320
All right.

102

00:06:59.430  -->  00:07:03.070
So I hope you enjoyed this a Tauriel definitely have a play around with that.

103

00:07:03.090  -->  00:07:07.980
The joint plots are quite interesting maybe try changing the variables here.

104

00:07:07.980  -->  00:07:15.060
For example try the other numeric variable that we have the budget in millions of dollars so budget

105

00:07:15.060  -->  00:07:16.580
billions.

106

00:07:16.680  -->  00:07:21.630
Also interesting to see what happens if you specify the same variable two times what the distribution

107

00:07:21.630  -->  00:07:23.680
or what the plot will look like.

108

00:07:23.680  -->  00:07:28.580
So definitely play around with that and that will give you some additional hands on exercise.

109

00:07:28.920  -->  00:07:31.420
And I will see you in the next Tauriel.

110

00:07:31.500  -->  00:07:33.090
Until then happy coding
