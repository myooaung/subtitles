00:00:05,750  -->  00:00:08,710
Welcome back to the course on Python programming.

2

00:00:08,790  -->  00:00:12,690
I hope you had a chance to practice with what we learned in the previous tutorial.

3

00:00:12,690  -->  00:00:19,620
It was a very powerful skill and a very important one to have and hopefully going great so far.

4

00:00:19,710  -->  00:00:22,770
Today we're going to learn how to access individual elements.

5

00:00:23,070  -->  00:00:23,960
Interesting.

6

00:00:24,120  -->  00:00:28,590
I thought we really talked about that you might say I thought we really talked about looking at rows

7

00:00:28,590  -->  00:00:36,570
and columns and yes indeed we did but we never actually accessed an individual element or cell in a

8

00:00:36,570  -->  00:00:37,270
doorframe.

9

00:00:37,440  -->  00:00:38,520
So how would you do it.

10

00:00:38,520  -->  00:00:39,570
What's your first instinct.

11

00:00:39,570  -->  00:00:42,600
Well you'd say starts to come into something that right.

12

00:00:42,900  -->  00:00:46,380
Because we know that in matrices this approach works.

13

00:00:46,380  -->  00:00:49,100
If I run that I will get an error.

14

00:00:49,470  -->  00:00:50,250
Interesting.

15

00:00:50,250  -->  00:00:51,670
Why doesn't it work.

16

00:00:51,680  -->  00:00:54,530
Let's type in our favorite comment error.

17

00:00:54,600  -->  00:00:55,920
Why.

18

00:00:55,920  -->  00:00:57,530
Why is it happening.

19

00:00:57,750  -->  00:01:01,470
Well first thing I wanted to mention is that we haven't talked about this yet.

20

00:01:01,500  -->  00:01:07,440
And also this tutorial if you find it complicated Don't worry about it you can always come back if you

21

00:01:07,440  -->  00:01:09,170
ever need to learn the skill.

22

00:01:09,180  -->  00:01:15,030
You can always come back and relearn it but otherwise when it's not such an important skill to have

23

00:01:15,040  -->  00:01:15,060
.

24

00:01:15,090  -->  00:01:19,560
And that's why we're only covering it off now and that's why we haven't talked about it yet because

25

00:01:19,770  -->  00:01:24,120
if you think about it with doorframes you're rarely going to access individual elements you almost are

26

00:01:24,120  -->  00:01:28,570
going to be using filters are going to be visualizing them are going to be subsetting them.

27

00:01:28,650  -->  00:01:36,000
But how often do you actually need a certain specific value from a doorframes or in Excel from a table

28

00:01:36,000  -->  00:01:36,930
from a table in Excel.

29

00:01:36,930  -->  00:01:41,610
How often do you actually need to pool all just one single value most of the time you're working with

30

00:01:41,610  -->  00:01:42,490
lots of others.

31

00:01:42,570  -->  00:01:46,960
But nevertheless it does happen sometimes so that's why I thought it would be important to cover of

32

00:01:47,040  -->  00:01:48,110
this topic.

33

00:01:48,200  -->  00:01:52,490
And once again you can always return to it if you need to use this skill.

34

00:01:52,500  -->  00:01:53,940
Further down the track.

35

00:01:53,940  -->  00:01:54,200
All right.

36

00:01:54,210  -->  00:01:55,500
So here we go.

37

00:01:55,620  -->  00:01:59,160
Let's look at our doorframes stats dog head.

38

00:01:59,160  -->  00:02:00,200
There it is.

39

00:02:00,630  -->  00:02:04,180
And the functions that we need have specific names.

40

00:02:04,230  -->  00:02:08,010
There are going they're going to allow us to access individual elements.

41

00:02:08,010  -->  00:02:14,010
There are two functions we need the add function or it's called the dot at and the dot I at.

42

00:02:14,010  -->  00:02:15,480
So what does this one do.

43

00:02:15,480  -->  00:02:20,660
This one is for labels so important here is important too.

44

00:02:20,700  -->  00:02:28,370
We'll put it separately important even integers are treated as labels.

45

00:02:28,680  -->  00:02:33,090
And here this one is for integer location.

46

00:02:33,090  -->  00:02:35,180
So what does this all mean and why.

47

00:02:35,220  -->  00:02:35,920
How does it work.

48

00:02:35,930  -->  00:02:38,900
And oh do you remember these names.

49

00:02:39,150  -->  00:02:45,930
Well the way I remember them is a T as an at it's X that's all you'll see how we use it just now but

50

00:02:46,050  -->  00:02:49,110
it will allow us access elements and specific cells.

51

00:02:49,110  -->  00:02:54,640
That's why I remember is that it says at that cell or it's at that cell it's at that cell.

52

00:02:54,760  -->  00:02:58,450
And that is you'll notice we'll be indexing by an integer.

53

00:02:58,530  -->  00:03:00,290
So we are looking at an integer.

54

00:03:00,510  -->  00:03:05,720
We're using an integer to go and find something at that cell at that silence on.

55

00:03:05,910  -->  00:03:10,540
So I know it might be a bit confusing right now but nominalist let's give it a go.

56

00:03:10,590  -->  00:03:15,760
And I think you all come into place so I'll say stats and instead of saying three four which we know

57

00:03:15,760  -->  00:03:21,480
will give us an error we'll say that instead of saying stat's three four which were all yours and arrogance

58

00:03:21,480  -->  00:03:27,180
is stats dot iat 3 4 let's run that I would get upper middle income.

59

00:03:27,180  -->  00:03:28,070
So let's see how that works.

60

00:03:28,080  -->  00:03:31,370
It went third row fourth column.

61

00:03:31,380  -->  00:03:31,710
All right.

62

00:03:31,710  -->  00:03:33,130
So zero.

63

00:03:33,150  -->  00:03:40,290
That's the first one are actually 0 0 1 2 3 32.

64

00:03:40,620  -->  00:03:41,400
That's that.

65

00:03:41,640  -->  00:03:48,750
And then fourth call them 1 2 0 1 2 3 4 fourth column upper middle income.

66

00:03:48,780  -->  00:03:49,630
Wonderful.

67

00:03:49,800  -->  00:03:58,460
Let's try another one let's say stats Daut at and they all say let's say row number zero and call them

68

00:03:58,470  -->  00:04:00,260
number one.

69

00:04:00,300  -->  00:04:01,600
What is that going to give us.

70

00:04:01,640  -->  00:04:02,780
What do you think.

71

00:04:02,780  -->  00:04:07,000
Is there a one country code for a Ruba wrote in Missouri.

72

00:04:07,010  -->  00:04:09,690
Call them number 0 1 AB W..

73

00:04:09,690  -->  00:04:10,140
There it is.

74

00:04:10,140  -->  00:04:11,040
That's what we got.

75

00:04:11,040  -->  00:04:12,080
Wonderful.

76

00:04:12,090  -->  00:04:15,540
So that's how I am works at this stage you notice I actually counted.

77

00:04:15,540  -->  00:04:20,240
I didn't just look at the number here and you'll know you'll see why exactly.

78

00:04:20,240  -->  00:04:26,790
In a second but actually counts physically counts the rows from the top count the columns from the left

79

00:04:26,800  -->  00:04:26,910
.

80

00:04:27,060  -->  00:04:28,810
And it gives you the result there.

81

00:04:28,830  -->  00:04:33,880
That's why it's called the integer because it counts it counts with those two years.

82

00:04:33,900  -->  00:04:40,770
Now how do we use at that is how do we use at what what X does is it looks at labels.

83

00:04:40,770  -->  00:04:44,840
So instead of counting it will look at the labels and labels here.

84

00:04:44,850  -->  00:04:46,670
0 1 2 3 4 and so on.

85

00:04:46,800  -->  00:04:52,660
They are integers indeed they are integers but they not necessarily have to always be in this place

86

00:04:52,670  -->  00:04:52,740
.

87

00:04:52,830  -->  00:04:54,470
And you'll see that in a second.

88

00:04:54,570  -->  00:04:56,020
Those are all integers.

89

00:04:56,040  -->  00:04:58,990
Now those are labels for rows and these are labels for columns.

90

00:04:59,010  -->  00:05:01,710
So to use at you need to use labels.

91

00:05:01,740  -->  00:05:06,000
So let's say one birthrate and here we're going to say first we need the row right so we're going to

92

00:05:06,000  -->  00:05:11,130
say row number two which is the label number two you just don't even count this time you just look for

93

00:05:11,130  -->  00:05:12,300
the two here.

94

00:05:12,570  -->  00:05:18,010
OK and then we'll look for column birthrates are we supposed to get forty five point ninety five.

95

00:05:18,330  -->  00:05:19,450
So it's the birthrate.

96

00:05:19,470  -->  00:05:22,630
Run that 45 4 9 8 4 9 9 9 9.

97

00:05:22,950  -->  00:05:23,700
Beautiful.

98

00:05:23,700  -->  00:05:26,520
That's our approach with labels.

99

00:05:26,520  -->  00:05:33,300
You can try another one for yourself if you like but what I want to show you now is the reason why we

100

00:05:33,750  -->  00:05:34,570
need.

101

00:05:34,670  -->  00:05:35,980
That's right you think.

102

00:05:36,150  -->  00:05:40,920
You think you can just do everything with as well or I at it.

103

00:05:41,190  -->  00:05:46,270
They can be useful in different cases sometimes you might know exactly which number row and number column

104

00:05:46,320  -->  00:05:51,570
you need sometimes you might know the labels but there is a very specific difference between this value

105

00:05:51,900  -->  00:05:53,260
and this value.

106

00:05:53,340  -->  00:05:54,520
Let's have a look at that.

107

00:05:54,660  -->  00:05:55,890
The way they're treated.

108

00:05:56,100  -->  00:05:58,260
Why we need start at.

109

00:05:58,470  -->  00:06:06,240
So let's create a new matrix will say subset 10 and we'll say all of the values every tenth of value

110

00:06:06,540  -->  00:06:08,510
and let's have a look at that subtend.

111

00:06:09,000  -->  00:06:11,160
So I'm not even doing the head function here.

112

00:06:11,160  -->  00:06:17,340
I'm just printing out the whole object the whole doorframe so you can see that we've got 0 10 20 30

113

00:06:17,340  -->  00:06:23,600
40 every 10th row in this Adoniram that we had got subset it into subtend.

114

00:06:24,020  -->  00:06:24,530
OK.

115

00:06:24,570  -->  00:06:26,670
And now why did we do that.

116

00:06:26,670  -->  00:06:27,640
What is this going to show us.

117

00:06:27,660  -->  00:06:30,540
Well let's have a look let's say sub 10.

118

00:06:30,630  -->  00:06:33,110
I at 10 0.

119

00:06:33,270  -->  00:06:33,850
Right.

120

00:06:34,020  -->  00:06:42,910
So we're saying give me the tenth row or roll with index 10 and the column of index 0 there whenever

121

00:06:42,910  -->  00:06:48,360
they cross give me that cell and let's see what it'll brings it'll give us Libya now which you would

122

00:06:48,360  -->  00:06:54,830
think is if you do subtend I chat and you do 10 and then what is the country name here country.

123

00:06:54,900  -->  00:06:59,250
Or what does the column column Zero name its country name.

124

00:06:59,280  -->  00:07:01,260
You'd think that this would give you the same results right.

125

00:07:01,260  -->  00:07:02,800
You're just basically saying 10 10.

126

00:07:02,800  -->  00:07:06,190
Replace the number of the column with the count with the name of the call.

127

00:07:06,230  -->  00:07:08,250
You're on that different results.

128

00:07:08,250  -->  00:07:09,060
Very interesting.

129

00:07:09,060  -->  00:07:09,780
Why is that.

130

00:07:10,020  -->  00:07:11,180
Well because of their behavior.

131

00:07:11,190  -->  00:07:12,460
So what does iat do.

132

00:07:12,480  -->  00:07:23,010
iat it actually counts remember what we talked about it counts out 10 and goes 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

133

00:07:23,010  -->  00:07:23,450
.

134

00:07:23,580  -->  00:07:31,090
In this new object in this new doorframe This is the roll with index 10.

135

00:07:31,200  -->  00:07:40,190
And that's why you gives you this row and this column column of 0 Libya or country name the they their

136

00:07:40,290  -->  00:07:41,280
intersection is Libya.

137

00:07:41,280  -->  00:07:45,290
That's why you get Libya on subtend dot at.

138

00:07:45,330  -->  00:07:46,280
You've got 10.

139

00:07:46,290  -->  00:07:46,960
And then country.

140

00:07:46,980  -->  00:07:53,070
But this time as we discussed as go up to the top as we discussed the dot at looks for labels it doesn't

141

00:07:53,070  -->  00:07:54,650
care about their sequence.

142

00:07:54,660  -->  00:08:00,930
It cares about the labels who's going to look for the label 10 as you can see label 10 is here and country

143

00:08:00,930  -->  00:08:01,690
name.

144

00:08:01,800  -->  00:08:03,280
So you get Azerbaijan.

145

00:08:03,360  -->  00:08:04,230
Azerbaijan.

146

00:08:04,380  -->  00:08:05,220
There we are.

147

00:08:05,520  -->  00:08:11,090
And this behavior of subtend at all actually not something that the misbehavior of a subset.

148

00:08:11,220  -->  00:08:17,310
Doorframe is very similar to what you get in are and are also when you filter a data frame or subset

149

00:08:17,310  -->  00:08:22,890
it this way what you get is these labels that don't get updated.

150

00:08:22,890  -->  00:08:24,600
So definitely watch out for that.

151

00:08:24,630  -->  00:08:30,990
If you're going to be using at night that then know the difference and use the correct function when

152

00:08:31,110  -->  00:08:34,470
you need to access either by integer.

153

00:08:34,470  -->  00:08:40,050
So when you actually fix that you really count which row and column or when you need to access it through

154

00:08:40,050  -->  00:08:40,910
the labels.

155

00:08:40,920  -->  00:08:42,320
There's a big difference.

156

00:08:42,360  -->  00:08:46,350
And sometimes it can affect the final outcome.

157

00:08:46,350  -->  00:08:51,570
All right so hopefully you enjoyed that tutorial and now you know how to access individual elements

158

00:08:51,660  -->  00:08:54,870
of a daughter frame and scenics them.

159

00:08:55,080  -->  00:08:56,710
Until then every coding
