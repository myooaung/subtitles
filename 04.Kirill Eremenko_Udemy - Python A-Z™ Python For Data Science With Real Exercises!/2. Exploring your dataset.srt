00:00:05,310  -->  00:00:05,710
Hello.

2

00:00:05,780  -->  00:00:11,960
Welcome back to the course and by the programming to day now that we've loaded the data set into Python

3

00:00:11,970  -->  00:00:18,130
we're going to learn how to explore how to perform that initial exploration of your data set in Python

4

00:00:18,140  -->  00:00:18,340
.

5

00:00:18,660  -->  00:00:25,260
And the first thing I'd like to do is to get rid of the top bits because we're going to need some space

6

00:00:25,260  -->  00:00:25,320
.

7

00:00:25,320  -->  00:00:31,110
This is going to be quite a heavy section on in terms of how much we're going to be creating So let's

8

00:00:31,110  -->  00:00:35,520
remove the header or before we move the head and let's give this file a name so we'll call it working

9

00:00:35,520  -->  00:00:35,830
.

10

00:00:35,960  -->  00:00:42,510
Let's just call doorframes reframes And now we can remove the header or we can remove the toolbar and

11

00:00:42,550  -->  00:00:43,820
yourself some space.

12

00:00:43,950  -->  00:00:49,850
All right so today we're talking about exploring your data.

13

00:00:49,950  -->  00:00:55,140
All right enter Number one what we already know is how to bring up the full data.

14

00:00:55,410  -->  00:01:00,690
Well except for some parts that are going to be omitted that are going to be in the middle usually.

15

00:01:00,750  -->  00:01:01,320
So there we go.

16

00:01:01,320  -->  00:01:04,650
So that's the full data frame we can explore it like that.

17

00:01:04,860  -->  00:01:06,550
And we got some information on them.

18

00:01:06,630  -->  00:01:06,980
All right.

19

00:01:06,990  -->  00:01:08,450
So that's a good start.

20

00:01:08,460  -->  00:01:12,720
Now how what are the other ways we can get some information very quickly about.

21

00:01:12,920  -->  00:01:17,930
While it's looking up to the Mattew is number of rows.

22

00:01:18,030  -->  00:01:18,820
Let's have a look.

23

00:01:18,840  -->  00:01:21,590
Len stats so stats is our daughter.

24

00:01:21,630  -->  00:01:27,090
And we're going to apply the land function to stats so for on that you get for one ninety five rows

25

00:01:27,090  -->  00:01:27,780
which is correct.

26

00:01:27,780  -->  00:01:29,510
We do have 185 rows.

27

00:01:29,520  -->  00:01:32,390
Important thing about the function even though it's a tiny little function.

28

00:01:32,390  -->  00:01:38,970
It's a tiny little call over here so it doesn't look like anything significant but in reality it's a

29

00:01:38,970  -->  00:01:45,800
very important skill to know and very important habit to have to check your land so your daughter said

30

00:01:45,810  -->  00:01:51,360
so the size and number of rows and also know when you need to check it when you should think about it

31

00:01:51,360  -->  00:01:51,380
.

32

00:01:51,390  -->  00:01:57,600
Because from a size perspective it can be very very telling very important to do.

33

00:01:57,600  -->  00:01:58,160
And why is that.

34

00:01:58,150  -->  00:02:03,640
Well back when I worked in consulting we had to do it constantly and we were importing daughter sets

35

00:02:03,660  -->  00:02:05,710
into sequel most of the time for analysis.

36

00:02:05,820  -->  00:02:11,520
But every time we would import data we would always check the size or the number of rows.

37

00:02:11,610  -->  00:02:17,780
And in fact we would actually put in a comment in the code or would say 195 rows imported.

38

00:02:17,790  -->  00:02:18,390
Why is that.

39

00:02:18,390  -->  00:02:23,080
Well that is for traceability so that later on you can always go back and check.

40

00:02:23,100  -->  00:02:28,680
Was this number actually equivalent to the number that was supplied by the client that was supplied

41

00:02:28,680  -->  00:02:29,850
in the file.

42

00:02:29,850  -->  00:02:31,590
Did anything happen during the import.

43

00:02:31,590  -->  00:02:35,730
Maybe something didn't get imported maybe some rules were corrupt maybe something was wrong.

44

00:02:35,730  -->  00:02:42,390
So for audit ability and traceability purposes we would always specify this value and it's a good idea

45

00:02:42,390  -->  00:02:45,330
to check especially if you have like large files that you're importing.

46

00:02:45,450  -->  00:02:50,590
And if you have information on how many rows they're supposed to be after they import just quickly around

47

00:02:50,610  -->  00:02:56,460
this line and check how many rows were actually imported and if it's all good then you know you're safe

48

00:02:56,520  -->  00:03:00,960
in that sense you know that you've done the check and you can proceed with your analysis.

49

00:03:00,960  -->  00:03:05,130
But if you find something is wrong then there'll be a red flag and you'll be able to fix it up quickly

50

00:03:05,130  -->  00:03:08,940
rather than finding out about it at the end of your analysis.

51

00:03:08,940  -->  00:03:09,460
All right.

52

00:03:09,540  -->  00:03:12,480
So number three how do we do something with the column.

53

00:03:12,480  -->  00:03:16,180
So one thing we can do with the columns that we can see the columns right.

54

00:03:16,260  -->  00:03:20,260
Let's go back up and let's run the line here we're going to say stats.

55

00:03:20,310  -->  00:03:23,170
Very simple Daut columns for on that.

56

00:03:23,200  -->  00:03:25,550
You'll see the actual columns that we have.

57

00:03:25,550  -->  00:03:32,490
We have country named country code birthrates for small loads of lower case users Internet users income

58

00:03:32,490  -->  00:03:33,110
group.

59

00:03:33,120  -->  00:03:36,760
So in this case it's kind of obvious because we already have.

60

00:03:36,810  -->  00:03:37,890
When you look at the data.

61

00:03:37,920  -->  00:03:43,950
We already have the calls you can see them here but sometimes you get doorframes or Excel files history

62

00:03:43,950  -->  00:03:44,880
files.

63

00:03:44,880  -->  00:03:50,640
So I've worked with files definitely over 20 columns sometimes over 50 and it depends on the structure

64

00:03:50,640  -->  00:03:51,740
of your data set.

65

00:03:51,940  -->  00:03:54,970
So sometimes they can be lots and lots of columns.

66

00:03:54,990  -->  00:04:01,120
So in order to bring them up in a very nice neat fashion you could just call stat start Kolb's.

67

00:04:01,140  -->  00:04:05,160
And another way to quickly college McCollum's just use the end function.

68

00:04:05,160  -->  00:04:12,300
So let's quickly say for a number of columns and say stats data columns.

69

00:04:12,330  -->  00:04:17,970
So basically passing this value into this object into here.

70

00:04:18,000  -->  00:04:19,290
So let's run this.

71

00:04:19,650  -->  00:04:21,030
You'll see that we have five columns.

72

00:04:21,030  -->  00:04:22,580
Again here it is very easy to tell.

73

00:04:22,590  -->  00:04:24,330
Sometimes they can be a lot of columns.

74

00:04:24,330  -->  00:04:26,580
So you will need to check like that.

75

00:04:26,590  -->  00:04:28,210
But if you do need to check.

76

00:04:28,440  -->  00:04:32,120
All right now we're going to move onto the fun stuff top Rose.

77

00:04:32,130  -->  00:04:33,700
How do we see the top rows of adults.

78

00:04:33,720  -->  00:04:38,820
Because we notice that it's quite cumbersome when we print out the whole Holder said something the most

79

00:04:38,820  -->  00:04:42,450
the time you don't need to see the whole dataset you just need to get a feel for it.

80

00:04:42,450  -->  00:04:49,290
So in that case you just do stats head and here remember the brackets.

81

00:04:49,620  -->  00:04:54,120
So in case of columns you don't need the brackets right for heads you need the brackets because if you're

82

00:04:54,120  -->  00:04:57,050
on the brackets you would get a jibberish result.

83

00:04:57,060  -->  00:05:02,580
So there's our stats head what it does is it prints out the top five rolls remember numeration starts

84

00:05:02,580  -->  00:05:05,810
from zero so it goes zero to four to five rows.

85

00:05:05,940  -->  00:05:09,710
And the other thing you can do is you can actually say stats head.

86

00:05:09,930  -->  00:05:13,480
And you can specify and equals six right.

87

00:05:13,520  -->  00:05:18,110
So is the parameter X-Fi specify here 6 or any other number.

88

00:05:18,100  -->  00:05:23,070
Ill give get that many rows and by the way this functionality is the same as the head function.

89

00:05:23,250  -->  00:05:26,760
In our IT ACTUALLY returns you six every time just looks different.

90

00:05:26,750  -->  00:05:29,060
So in that case headcount is a function here.

91

00:05:29,100  -->  00:05:35,990
It's a method inside the stats object so this function our method is carried around with this object

92

00:05:36,000  -->  00:05:37,550
so you can always call it from inside the object.

93

00:05:37,560  -->  00:05:42,820
That's the difference between object oriented programming and vectorize program which is our.

94

00:05:42,960  -->  00:05:45,180
And other types of programming as well.

95

00:05:45,180  -->  00:05:45,510
All right.

96

00:05:45,500  -->  00:05:47,650
So that's a very useful function.

97

00:05:47,650  -->  00:05:52,320
You'll see us using it all the time we'll be using it pretty much every single tutorial.

98

00:05:52,320  -->  00:05:56,840
Most of the generals in the section we're going to be using this function so we can see what's going

99

00:05:56,850  -->  00:05:58,400
on in our data center.

100

00:05:58,410  -->  00:05:58,760
All right.

101

00:05:58,760  -->  00:06:08,140
Number six you guessed it bottom morose stat's tail run that's there you go that's the bottom five.

102

00:06:08,160  -->  00:06:10,870
Because you can see 1 9 1 9 2 2 1 4.

103

00:06:10,980  -->  00:06:14,360
Or you can do bottom six or however many you like.

104

00:06:14,430  -->  00:06:22,040
So that's that's tell a story I always tell him in this in this case likely head and tail are the same

105

00:06:22,080  -->  00:06:24,680
as have the same names as in are.

106

00:06:24,840  -->  00:06:29,220
So if you've done it's going to be easy to remember if you haven't and this is something I struggled

107

00:06:29,220  -->  00:06:38,500
with Originally when I came from sequel to are that in sequel they're called top and bottom instead

108

00:06:38,510  -->  00:06:40,490
of head and tail so hard you remember them.

109

00:06:40,650  -->  00:06:42,240
Well just think of a fox.

110

00:06:42,240  -->  00:06:47,520
A Fox has a head and a tail and whole Fox is a random animal to think of but whenever you're going to

111

00:06:47,510  -->  00:06:52,590
be wondering you're going to remember Kiril said Fox aitches which is orange which is like a random

112

00:06:52,590  -->  00:06:56,030
animal to say you're going remember that a fox has a head and a tail.

113

00:06:56,120  -->  00:06:58,830
And that way you'll be you'll remember which functions you need to call.

114

00:06:59,000  -->  00:07:04,200
But with time especially if you finish this section of the course you're going to be so used to typing

115

00:07:04,290  -->  00:07:09,400
the names of these functions that you won't even need to remember that story.

116

00:07:09,420  -->  00:07:10,320
So we've done that.

117

00:07:10,380  -->  00:07:13,030
Let's have a look at a couple more.

118

00:07:13,050  -->  00:07:14,960
So we've got a few more left.

119

00:07:14,970  -->  00:07:21,230
Number seven we've got to get some information on the columns.

120

00:07:21,360  -->  00:07:22,520
So how do we do this.

121

00:07:22,620  -->  00:07:26,010
Well they're easy stats to add info.

122

00:07:26,220  -->  00:07:29,640
So sure on this you will see some information.

123

00:07:29,630  -->  00:07:35,400
So it's got a columns total five columns actually 195 entries so tells us some quite some years.

124

00:07:35,430  -->  00:07:41,500
A lot of useful information and here tells you OK Object object floats 64 for 64 object.

125

00:07:41,700  -->  00:07:46,330
Basically all floats 64 means a number of decimal points.

126

00:07:46,380  -->  00:07:49,720
Object is in this case because they're strings.

127

00:07:49,800  -->  00:07:52,290
It's identifying them as just objects.

128

00:07:52,530  -->  00:07:57,130
What we need to know is that this is just going to come in here.

129

00:07:57,140  -->  00:08:01,920
This is like the str function in our.

130

00:08:01,930  -->  00:08:04,280
So not exactly the same right there.

131

00:08:04,320  -->  00:08:09,070
Our function gives you a bit more information and can tell you about categorical variables which are

132

00:08:09,120  -->  00:08:10,730
cold factors.

133

00:08:11,070  -->  00:08:15,660
So in our I would say that this function is a bit more powerful but nevertheless this one still gives

134

00:08:15,660  -->  00:08:17,580
you quite a bit of information.

135

00:08:17,610  -->  00:08:24,980
The other function that we want to know is get stats on the columns so that information is going to

136

00:08:24,970  -->  00:08:31,230
be stats and are going to say stats describe the function we need is describe your that and what you'll

137

00:08:31,230  -->  00:08:37,850
get is count means standard deviation minimum first quarter second quarter third quarter and maximum

138

00:08:38,190  -->  00:08:44,700
for all of the columns which have numeric data in them and we only have 2 of those.

139

00:08:44,700  -->  00:08:47,290
So therefore we have two results here.

140

00:08:47,420  -->  00:08:49,070
And this is quite a powerful thing.

141

00:08:49,080  -->  00:08:51,150
It is similar to.

142

00:08:51,140  -->  00:08:52,200
Can you guess it.

143

00:08:52,230  -->  00:09:00,990
It is like summary the summary function in our scroll back up like this was is our function.

144

00:09:00,990  -->  00:09:02,850
So the summary function in our.

145

00:09:03,140  -->  00:09:06,540
And also if you want to maybe change it around a bit.

146

00:09:06,540  -->  00:09:10,040
So this is like the names of the columns are on the top.

147

00:09:10,080  -->  00:09:12,120
Then it goes downwards if you want to transpose it.

148

00:09:12,140  -->  00:09:13,040
Very easy done.

149

00:09:13,190  -->  00:09:20,520
So stats describe and then just press dot this is the object that we got right.

150

00:09:20,550  -->  00:09:28,040
This is the new the result and here we're going to say transpose Also in with brackets and that way

151

00:09:28,080  -->  00:09:31,500
you transpose the Matrix might be easier to read this way sometimes.

152

00:09:31,830  -->  00:09:36,250
In this case I think it's easier to like this because we only have two of these columns and now they're

153

00:09:36,270  -->  00:09:40,770
rows and now you can just read it very simply like that and supreme from top to bottom.

154

00:09:40,770  -->  00:09:45,260
All right so that is how we get information on our daughter said some basic information.

155

00:09:45,480  -->  00:09:47,200
Let's quickly recap what we learned.

156

00:09:47,210  -->  00:09:49,300
We learned quite a few functions today.

157

00:09:49,500  -->  00:09:55,420
So first way you can get information is of course print out the full frame by calling its name.

158

00:09:55,560  -->  00:09:59,580
Then you could get the length of doorframe by using the len function.

159

00:09:59,750  -->  00:10:01,100
So that's the number of rows.

160

00:10:01,130  -->  00:10:05,430
Also very important if you want to maintain audit ability and traceability.

161

00:10:05,420  -->  00:10:11,260
Number three get the visibility of the column Stanstead columns then Lenn of sets of Dotcom's gives

162

00:10:11,280  -->  00:10:12,470
a number of columns.

163

00:10:12,620  -->  00:10:20,010
Stats knothead gives you the top x rows of the women you specify 5 by default stats that tell same thing

164

00:10:20,040  -->  00:10:25,710
but for bottom rose stats info gives you information on the columns what they are what types and how

165

00:10:25,710  -->  00:10:32,700
many etc. and stats that describe it gives you a summary or some statistics on your numeric columns

166

00:10:32,690  -->  00:10:34,110
and also you can transpose it.

167

00:10:34,130  -->  00:10:34,620
So there we go.

168

00:10:34,620  -->  00:10:36,570
Hope you enjoyed this tutorial.

169

00:10:36,620  -->  00:10:37,850
Have a play around with that.

170

00:10:37,860  -->  00:10:39,590
Just practice those functions a little bit.

171

00:10:39,600  -->  00:10:45,000
And then I will see you in the next tutorial Conwy TSR and that one until next time.

172

00:10:45,140  -->  00:10:49,350
Heavy coding.
