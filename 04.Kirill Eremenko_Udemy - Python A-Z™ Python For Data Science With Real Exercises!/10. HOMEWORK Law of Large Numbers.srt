00:00:04,700  -->  00:00:05,780
Hello.

2

00:00:05,820  -->  00:00:12,390
And first off congratulations on completing this first section of the Python programming course.

3

00:00:12,390  -->  00:00:15,130
Some things were new Some things were different.

4

00:00:15,240  -->  00:00:21,070
I'm sure there were some challenges but nevertheless you poured through it and you got to the end.

5

00:00:21,090  -->  00:00:25,170
I'm super excited for you it's a very big first step into learning Python.

6

00:00:25,500  -->  00:00:27,720
And today I've got a very exciting tutorial for you.

7

00:00:27,720  -->  00:00:30,300
I've actually got a homework exercise prepared for it.

8

00:00:30,480  -->  00:00:34,740
Know right away I wanted to mention that if you're coming from why our programming course this is going

9

00:00:34,740  -->  00:00:41,280
to be exactly the same homework exercise and that is going to be the beauty of it that if you've done

10

00:00:41,280  -->  00:00:46,050
that course and you've done this homework exercise and are you going to see how different is going to

11

00:00:46,050  -->  00:00:52,020
be in Python you're going to be able to for yourself sit down program the same challenge in a different

12

00:00:52,020  -->  00:00:54,470
programming language and then compare the results.

13

00:00:54,600  -->  00:01:00,240
So that's a great advantage if you have already done our course if you haven't then maybe after this

14

00:01:00,240  -->  00:01:04,910
Python programming course check out the art course and you'll be able to do it in reverse order.

15

00:01:05,130  -->  00:01:08,710
Nevertheless let's jump straight into this exercise and I'll share around.

16

00:01:08,770  -->  00:01:10,920
It's very exciting.

17

00:01:10,920  -->  00:01:11,340
All right.

18

00:01:11,340  -->  00:01:18,090
So this is the law of large numbers and what is it telling us here and why are we even talking about

19

00:01:18,090  -->  00:01:18,590
it today.

20

00:01:18,750  -->  00:01:24,060
Well the law of large numbers even though it might look a bit complex at the start is actually a very

21

00:01:24,060  -->  00:01:28,770
simple mathematical concept that is extremely extremely powerful.

22

00:01:28,770  -->  00:01:35,550
Personally I like it so much that I use it everyday in everything I do whenever I can bring up the Law

23

00:01:35,550  -->  00:01:41,580
of Large Numbers even just to justify something myself or explain how things work in even in the real

24

00:01:41,580  -->  00:01:42,260
world.

25

00:01:42,480  -->  00:01:47,790
I do it because the Law of Large Numbers is such a simple and yet powerful concept so let's discuss

26

00:01:47,790  -->  00:01:51,460
it a bit more detail what the Law of Large Numbers is telling us here.

27

00:01:51,840  -->  00:01:53,430
Well to send a lot of large numbers.

28

00:01:53,490  -->  00:01:57,390
We need to first understand the environment in which is operating.

29

00:01:57,390  -->  00:02:00,870
So imagine you have a sample of observations.

30

00:02:00,870  -->  00:02:07,560
So for instance it could be coin tosses or it could be you just picked out 100 or 1000 people out of

31

00:02:07,560  -->  00:02:10,610
the population so you took a sample of some bigger population.

32

00:02:10,620  -->  00:02:16,770
So what the Law of Large Numbers is telling us is that the average over a certain value so x is a measured

33

00:02:16,770  -->  00:02:17,980
value for instance.

34

00:02:18,180  -->  00:02:24,660
It could be the height of the people in that sample that you picked out that average across the sample

35

00:02:24,660  -->  00:02:28,300
which represents a number of observations in our sample.

36

00:02:28,350  -->  00:02:35,770
So the average across the sample will converge to the expected value of that same measure when an increase

37

00:02:35,770  -->  00:02:36,580
is to infinity.

38

00:02:36,690  -->  00:02:41,910
So hypothetically speaking we know that there's several billion people on the planet and we can consider

39

00:02:41,910  -->  00:02:43,880
that to be very close to infinity.

40

00:02:43,950  -->  00:02:48,930
And we also know that the expected value of a person if you take the average value across all people

41

00:02:48,930  -->  00:02:49,460
on this planet.

42

00:02:49,470  -->  00:02:55,650
Let's say for example it's a 1 meter 72 centimeters or in feet it's let's say six feet.

43

00:02:55,710  -->  00:02:56,900
This is our expected.

44

00:02:56,910  -->  00:03:00,620
So the expected value of the height of a person is six feet.

45

00:03:00,620  -->  00:03:06,810
Now if your sample size is 10 people if you pick out 10 random people from this planet the average of

46

00:03:06,810  -->  00:03:14,020
their height will might be 6.5 feet might be seven feet might be five point five feet as you increase

47

00:03:14,070  -->  00:03:19,890
and as you increase the number of people that are in your sample as you go from 10 to a hundred thousand

48

00:03:20,100  -->  00:03:21,910
to 10000 people.

49

00:03:21,980  -->  00:03:28,890
But the average of the measured value in your sample is going to start to converge to the expected value

50

00:03:28,890  -->  00:03:29,280
.

51

00:03:29,280  -->  00:03:34,020
Now I know it might be hard to grasp at the start why this is happening but let's have a look at a more

52

00:03:34,020  -->  00:03:35,130
specific example.

53

00:03:35,280  -->  00:03:36,820
And it will all make sense.

54

00:03:37,050  -->  00:03:38,780
So here's an example of coin tosses.

55

00:03:38,970  -->  00:03:41,560
Let's say you performed 10 coin tosses.

56

00:03:41,790  -->  00:03:45,230
Then out of 10 coin tosses you just think of pause and think about it for a second.

57

00:03:45,240  -->  00:03:50,110
Out of 10 coin tosses if you'd just like take a coin right now and you throw it ten times.

58

00:03:50,190  -->  00:03:54,830
It is not unlikely that you will get seven heads and three tails right.

59

00:03:55,080  -->  00:03:58,770
Statistically speaking heads and tails should come with equal frequency.

60

00:03:58,770  -->  00:04:01,210
Right so your expected value is 50 50.

61

00:04:01,530  -->  00:04:05,500
So 50 percent of your tosses should be heads and 50 percent battels.

62

00:04:05,520  -->  00:04:07,540
But still it's totally normal.

63

00:04:07,560  -->  00:04:12,510
If you toss a coin to get head seven times or even get heads nine times out you wouldn't be surprised

64

00:04:12,510  -->  00:04:13,390
if that happened right.

65

00:04:13,440  -->  00:04:17,010
Well it's a coincidence but nevertheless it's normal even feels normal.

66

00:04:17,040  -->  00:04:23,460
Then if you do 100 coin tosses the likelihood of getting 70 heads and 30 tails is much less probable

67

00:04:23,460  -->  00:04:23,680
.

68

00:04:23,760  -->  00:04:28,200
If you've got 70 heads or 100 you'd think that something might be wrong with the coin you wouldn't feel

69

00:04:28,200  -->  00:04:28,600
normal.

70

00:04:28,740  -->  00:04:31,640
But at the same time getting like 52 heads and 48 tails.

71

00:04:31,710  -->  00:04:33,510
Yeah that sounds sounds about right.

72

00:04:33,510  -->  00:04:37,310
So there could be a bit of a deviation from what you're expecting 50 50.

73

00:04:37,380  -->  00:04:37,900
Right.

74

00:04:37,920  -->  00:04:45,110
If you throw a thousand coins the probability of getting 700 heads and 300 tails is very very low.

75

00:04:45,120  -->  00:04:51,450
If you get 700 heads out of a thousand coin tosses you're probably going to think that the coin is definitely

76

00:04:51,540  -->  00:04:52,180
rigged.

77

00:04:52,220  -->  00:04:58,590
It's it's weighted to one side or something's wrong with the coin if you get 500 into an 498 or if you

78

00:04:58,590  -->  00:05:03,360
get five hundred and nine and four hundred ninety one you wouldn't be that surprised that can happen

79

00:05:03,370  -->  00:05:03,580
right.

80

00:05:03,570  -->  00:05:09,660
It can deviate a little bit so not only just mathematically but even from the point of view of perspective

81

00:05:09,660  -->  00:05:11,560
like how it feels right or wrong.

82

00:05:11,690  -->  00:05:16,830
It's it makes sense that as you increase the number the likelihood of deviating away from 50 percent

83

00:05:16,830  -->  00:05:19,470
50 percent would quite far is decreasing.

84

00:05:19,470  -->  00:05:24,030
So as you can see in our examples at the start is there are 50 50 70 30.

85

00:05:24,120  -->  00:05:29,320
Then as we increase the number got to 52 48 then go to fifty point to forty nine point eight and so

86

00:05:29,310  -->  00:05:29,690
on.

87

00:05:29,860  -->  00:05:34,770
And so that's what we mean that as we increase the sample size the average of the measured value is

88

00:05:34,770  -->  00:05:38,120
going to start to converge to the expected value.

89

00:05:38,440  -->  00:05:42,620
Now that is the Law of Large Numbers and for this article we're going to need one more thing.

90

00:05:42,690  -->  00:05:44,580
We're going to need the normal distribution.

91

00:05:44,580  -->  00:05:52,450
Now we've already mentioned the rand and function which generates a random number from a normal distribution

92

00:05:52,440  -->  00:05:52,600
.

93

00:05:52,710  -->  00:05:54,280
And we learned how to work with it.

94

00:05:54,270  -->  00:05:58,050
We saw that that number can fall anywhere between minus 1 and 1.

95

00:05:58,060  -->  00:06:02,310
Most of the time that's where it fell as we saw Sometimes it falls further away sometimes and falls

96

00:06:02,310  -->  00:06:02,940
further away.

97

00:06:03,000  -->  00:06:04,590
And so what does this chart tell us.

98

00:06:04,590  -->  00:06:09,840
Well this chart is the bell curve is a position of the normal distribution and we not even going to

99

00:06:09,840  -->  00:06:14,730
bother with the vertical axis here because everything is already written out for us inside the charts

100

00:06:14,750  -->  00:06:14,960
.

101

00:06:15,150  -->  00:06:20,700
And so what it is telling us is that if you have a normal distribution or normally distributed variables

102

00:06:20,740  -->  00:06:25,920
or if you just take let's say for example of that function that we talked about the rand function if

103

00:06:25,930  -->  00:06:31,570
we take one normally dispute variable here we've got the the percentages are telling us what is the

104

00:06:31,560  -->  00:06:35,940
likelihood of that bearable ending up in each one of these segments.

105

00:06:35,980  -->  00:06:41,640
So the likelihood of that bearable being between 0 and 1 here we got 1 sigma but sigma is the standard

106

00:06:41,640  -->  00:06:44,460
deviation so we're just going to pretend that sigma is actually one.

107

00:06:44,460  -->  00:06:49,760
So then this is going to be a normal distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1

108

00:06:49,760  -->  00:06:50,230
.

109

00:06:50,460  -->  00:06:56,980
In this case your likelihood of that variable or that value that regenerating the likelihood of it falling

110

00:06:56,980  -->  00:07:01,960
between 0 and 1 is thirty four point one percent between minus 1 and 0 is also thirty four point one

111

00:07:01,950  -->  00:07:02,520
percent.

112

00:07:02,620  -->  00:07:05,100
Then it starts to drop off very rapidly.

113

00:07:05,110  -->  00:07:10,150
So between one and two there's only a thirteen point six percent chance that all four there then it's

114

00:07:10,170  -->  00:07:15,990
there's only a 2.1 percent chance between two and three and then 0.1 percent that it's greater than

115

00:07:16,000  -->  00:07:16,490
three.

116

00:07:16,530  -->  00:07:21,820
So it drops off as you can see this is how the normal distribution works.

117

00:07:21,850  -->  00:07:23,610
What do we need this for.

118

00:07:23,620  -->  00:07:28,960
Why do we need the old distribution Why do we need the law of large numbers of what curial What are

119

00:07:28,950  -->  00:07:30,110
you talking about.

120

00:07:30,120  -->  00:07:32,700
Why do we need these things for this homework exercise.

121

00:07:32,860  -->  00:07:37,830
Well the reason is because in this homework exercise we're going to be testing the law of large numbers

122

00:07:37,830  -->  00:07:38,270
.

123

00:07:38,280  -->  00:07:39,070
How cool is that.

124

00:07:39,070  -->  00:07:45,000
We're going to be using the normal distribution to check if the law of large numbers actually holds

125

00:07:45,000  -->  00:07:45,530
true.

126

00:07:45,750  -->  00:07:48,700
Let's have a look at in more detail what exactly we're going to be doing.

127

00:07:48,730  -->  00:07:54,210
So test the law of large numbers for and Aranda normally distributed numbers with a mean of zero and

128

00:07:54,220  -->  00:08:00,450
standard deviation of one meaning just use the brand and function and create a Python script that will

129

00:08:00,450  -->  00:08:06,150
count how many of these numbers fall between minus 1 and 1 and divide by the total quantity of.

130

00:08:06,140  -->  00:08:12,920
And you know that the expected value of x is sixty eight point two percent and you need to check that

131

00:08:12,940  -->  00:08:19,440
the mean of X and where is your sample size is converging to the expected value of x as you run your

132

00:08:19,440  -->  00:08:20,950
script while increasing.

133

00:08:20,950  -->  00:08:23,370
And so I know that's a lot to take in.

134

00:08:23,380  -->  00:08:26,820
Let's go back to the image and walk through what we're going to be doing.

135

00:08:26,820  -->  00:08:31,290
So here we can see that we're going to be analyzing the interval between minus 1 and 1.

136

00:08:31,440  -->  00:08:36,250
So we're going to be generating numbers random numbers and we'll take a sample of.

137

00:08:36,250  -->  00:08:42,060
And for instance could be 100 or next time it'll be a thousand but we'll be generating in one go and

138

00:08:42,150  -->  00:08:46,510
random numbers and we will want to see how many of them actually fall in this part.

139

00:08:46,680  -->  00:08:50,210
So let's go here we can see that fall between minus 1 and 1.

140

00:08:50,250  -->  00:08:50,920
Right.

141

00:08:50,940  -->  00:08:53,290
And where does the sixty eight point two percent come from.

142

00:08:53,430  -->  00:08:57,930
Well we can see here that three four point one plus thirty four point one actually gives the sixty eight

143

00:08:57,930  -->  00:08:58,560
point two percent.

144

00:08:58,570  -->  00:09:05,890
So we will be expecting that from our sample sixty eight point two percent of the observations will

145

00:09:05,880  -->  00:09:07,950
fall into this interval.

146

00:09:07,950  -->  00:09:08,250
Right.

147

00:09:08,250  -->  00:09:14,860
And so what we need to test is that as we increase our sample this means so we might if we only have

148

00:09:14,880  -->  00:09:20,920
10 observations we might get 50 percent fall in there or 70 percent or so only 5 percent but then we

149

00:09:20,910  -->  00:09:26,320
use as we increase and as we take more and more numbers so a hundred or a thousand 10000 numbers we're

150

00:09:26,350  -->  00:09:33,570
expecting that we're going to be testing that the means so the actual observed number that fall into

151

00:09:33,580  -->  00:09:38,800
that interval is going to be slowly getting closer and closer to sixty eight point two percent.

152

00:09:38,800  -->  00:09:39,060
All right.

153

00:09:39,070  -->  00:09:41,110
So hopefully all of that makes sense.

154

00:09:41,110  -->  00:09:45,650
And it's slowly shaping up in your mind how you would attack this problem.

155

00:09:45,690  -->  00:09:45,990
Right.

156

00:09:46,000  -->  00:09:51,310
We've already discussed quite a lot of Python concepts so we've discussed how to generate random variables

157

00:09:51,660  -->  00:09:56,800
so we would use the Rand and function then we've discussed the if statement will need the if statement

158

00:09:56,800  -->  00:10:00,320
here to see where exactly the values fall.

159

00:10:00,370  -->  00:10:05,890
We'll need some logical operators and logical variables we'll need some counters we'll need some of

160

00:10:05,880  -->  00:10:07,410
the earth network operations.

161

00:10:07,410  -->  00:10:11,470
So as you can see everything that we've talked about in this section of the Course is slowly shaping

162

00:10:11,460  -->  00:10:11,660
up.

163

00:10:11,670  -->  00:10:13,790
And of course we will also need a loop.

164

00:10:13,800  -->  00:10:14,110
Right.

165

00:10:14,110  -->  00:10:18,040
We're going to need to loop across those random variables that we're going to generate.

166

00:10:18,250  -->  00:10:22,810
So once again a lot of the things that we talked about in this section of course are really coming together

167

00:10:22,810  -->  00:10:28,320
to create this one statistical slash programming says slash mathematical test.

168

00:10:28,440  -->  00:10:34,710
And very exciting very kind of data science starts into this course are starting to the end of this

169

00:10:34,890  -->  00:10:37,050
section the start of the course.

170

00:10:37,140  -->  00:10:44,680
So hopefully you can have a go at that and pause this video give it a shot see how you go and if you

171

00:10:44,670  -->  00:10:50,190
find that you're getting stuck in new Qantas or the challenge then not a worry come back because I have

172

00:10:50,190  -->  00:10:51,140
two hints for you.

173

00:10:51,380  -->  00:10:55,740
I'm going to reveal those hints just now so if you want to give this a shot then go ahead.

174

00:10:55,750  -->  00:11:00,480
Otherwise I'm going to show you the first hint because I think I need to show that hand with you.

175

00:11:00,490  -->  00:11:06,090
It's something that we didn't actually discuss in the course and it will be very handy to solve this

176

00:11:06,100  -->  00:11:06,720
challenge.

177

00:11:06,930  -->  00:11:07,200
All right.

178

00:11:07,200  -->  00:11:12,260
So Hint number one how do we generate a certain number of random variables.

179

00:11:12,420  -->  00:11:18,430
Well you know that's in our section we used the rand and function with no arguments.

180

00:11:18,420  -->  00:11:25,360
Well what you can do is you can posit a value so if you pass around and 100 then it'll generate instead

181

00:11:25,360  -->  00:11:25,780
of one.

182

00:11:25,770  -->  00:11:32,330
Ill generate 100 random variables 100 normally distributed random values.

183

00:11:32,400  -->  00:11:38,590
And what we have here is actually the loop that will be used in the solution so we'll be creating an

184

00:11:38,620  -->  00:11:45,450
iteration variable which will be iterating across all of those hundreds values that will be random values

185

00:11:45,450  -->  00:11:46,480
that we're going to be analyzing.

186

00:11:46,500  -->  00:11:50,650
And then inside that loop you will need to perform those calculations.

187

00:11:50,640  -->  00:11:51,780
So that's a tip.

188

00:11:51,780  -->  00:11:54,390
And hopefully that will get you on the right track.

189

00:11:54,550  -->  00:11:58,280
If you still feel that you need a bit more guidance then stick around.

190

00:11:58,300  -->  00:12:01,330
I'm going to open the second event now.

191

00:12:01,360  -->  00:12:04,120
So Hint number two and for Hint number two.

192

00:12:04,120  -->  00:12:06,610
I've got a fill in the blanks exercise.

193

00:12:06,610  -->  00:12:12,700
So this is the solution but here to make it still a bit challenging I've replaced quite a lot of the

194

00:12:12,690  -->  00:12:17,640
code with underscores at the same time there's a lot of common so it should be total sense what is going

195

00:12:17,640  -->  00:12:18,350
on here.

196

00:12:18,550  -->  00:12:24,280
So your steps from here would be to copy this code or just type it up on your side and then replace

197

00:12:24,270  -->  00:12:26,460
these underscores with the correct code.

198

00:12:26,800  -->  00:12:27,400
So there you go.

199

00:12:27,390  -->  00:12:32,280
That's the challenge the homework exercise for the section and at the very end of the Course you'll

200

00:12:32,280  -->  00:12:36,130
find a separate section with all of the solutions to these homework exercises.

201

00:12:36,120  -->  00:12:42,240
So once you have taken a go at this exercise come and check out the solutions and we'll discuss how

202

00:12:42,250  -->  00:12:43,530
to create this code there.

203

00:12:43,840  -->  00:12:45,400
And I look forward to your next step.

204

00:12:45,420  -->  00:12:50,440
Until then happy coding.
