00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.860
The routes we've been using so far have been pretty simple.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.185
We have all of our menu items.

00:00:07.185 --> 00:00:11.430
You stand here on the same level with no child items.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.000
The router makes it easy for us to add nested routes,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.775
to group together routes which quantity related.

00:00:17.775 --> 00:00:20.930
We setup components in the last section.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.670
Just the contact and ordering guide,

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.695
which you can see inside here.

00:00:25.695 --> 00:00:29.910
This idea for us to group together as child or nested

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.450
components of the about us link back inside of this main.js file.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.660
We can start this off just like any other route by adding

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.605
our object to our route array, we can add a path.

00:00:42.605 --> 00:00:44.885
This time we're dealing with the about link,

00:00:44.885 --> 00:00:47.485
so this is forward slash about.

00:00:47.485 --> 00:00:51.665
Just after this, we also want to render out a component.

00:00:51.665 --> 00:00:55.090
The main components when clicked on is about.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.040
Then to add any nested child routes,

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.440
all we need to do is separate it by a comma.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.750
We can add the children property and then set this up as an array.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.379
Inside here, we're going to add some options,

00:01:09.379 --> 00:01:12.695
pretty much just like we did with our top-level routes.

00:01:12.695 --> 00:01:16.970
We're going to set up an objects where we set up a path.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.860
The first path is for forward slash history. Just like above.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.200
We then render out a component.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.035
I'm going to give the component's a name of history,

00:01:27.035 --> 00:01:29.545
which will import in just a moment.

00:01:29.545 --> 00:01:31.170
Separated by a comma,

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.120
I'm going to copy and duplicate this two more times.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.980
The second one is going to be for

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:42.090
delivery and the component is also going to be delivery too.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.595
Right at the very end,

00:01:44.595 --> 00:01:45.870
we're going to replace this with

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:52.830
the Ordering Guide and also the path which is ordering hyphen guide.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:01.475
One of the things to watch out for when nesting channel routes is the path to the route.

00:02:01.475 --> 00:02:04.905
When writing a child routes inside of this array,

00:02:04.905 --> 00:02:08.359
the way we write the path is also important.

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:11.100
If we add a forward slash at the beginning,

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.155
the path will be treated as a root path.

00:02:14.155 --> 00:02:16.785
I'm going to add an example just below,

00:02:16.785 --> 00:02:21.530
so forward slash history would leave us with our URL such as pizza

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.930
planets.com, forward slash history.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.895
Alternatively though, if we didn't have the forward slash before history,

00:02:31.895 --> 00:02:35.195
we could have simply typed in history inside of our path.

00:02:35.195 --> 00:02:38.915
This will be pizza planets.com.

00:02:38.915 --> 00:02:44.065
This would take into account the parent's path of forward slash about,

00:02:44.065 --> 00:02:47.685
then followed by history just afterwards.

00:02:47.685 --> 00:02:53.255
This is two different approaches all dependent on the forward slash inside of the path,

00:02:53.255 --> 00:02:57.100
depending on which way you want to construct the URLs.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.085
I'm just going to remove these two examples inside here.

00:03:01.085 --> 00:03:04.855
Then also are a comma to separate this about link.

00:03:04.855 --> 00:03:07.850
We can also add our contact link two,

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.870
but this one is at the root level along with our menu on home.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.975
I'm going to add this as our third item.

00:03:14.975 --> 00:03:25.185
A path is forward slash contact and the components is for contacts. Camera at the end.

00:03:25.185 --> 00:03:27.895
Then also our admin two.

00:03:27.895 --> 00:03:30.755
This is not controlled by a menu link,

00:03:30.755 --> 00:03:36.205
but we can still access this using the forward slash admin inside of our URL.

00:03:36.205 --> 00:03:42.910
Then the components of admin and a comma at the very end.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.550
We then need to import our components which you want to use,

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.420
which are the child components and admin and contact.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.315
Let's duplicate this a few more times.

00:03:53.315 --> 00:03:57.510
The menu which changes to be admin.

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.500
We also need to import the About page,

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.900
we also need contact.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.950
We also need history,

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.780
delivery and ordering guide.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:31.130
Delivery and finally at the end we need the ordering guide.

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.795
Once this is done, give this file a save and head over to the browser.

00:04:39.795 --> 00:04:41.955
Let's check out our home routes.

00:04:41.955 --> 00:04:45.990
We have our menu still working, the contact-us.

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.930
We can test our forward slash Admin.

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.135
This is all working too.

00:04:51.135 --> 00:04:55.315
Then finally we have the about us link which has a child component.

00:04:55.315 --> 00:04:59.045
If we click on this, none of the child components are visible.

00:04:59.045 --> 00:05:02.240
This is because the router view component,

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.080
which we have, if you open up the app.view.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.680
This is the router view component which we currently have.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.620
This renders out the component to the screen.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.135
But it only renders out the top level routes.

00:05:16.135 --> 00:05:19.490
To display a component of HL route,

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.525
we need to add a second nested router view component.

00:05:23.525 --> 00:05:27.210
I'll show you how to do this in the next video.
