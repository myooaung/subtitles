00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.030
We can look at the final version of in the admin components. In the last video.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.895
We created the table from its menu section,

00:00:08.895 --> 00:00:11.325
and added in a sample item.

00:00:11.325 --> 00:00:14.475
In this video, we're going to move down to the next div,

00:00:14.475 --> 00:00:16.800
which is for the current orders.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.885
This is also going to be a table two where we are going to have a title at the top.

00:00:21.885 --> 00:00:24.870
We're going to have a table heading with the item,

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.880
size, quantity, and price,

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.310
and I'm going to construct our orders just

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.495
below and also with the button to remove each item.

00:00:33.495 --> 00:00:36.045
We are now creating lots of components,

00:00:36.045 --> 00:00:37.770
and things such as tables.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.590
With static data is not the most exciting thing to do,

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:42.900
but stick with it,

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.485
it is good practice and we'll get to the database section very soon.

00:00:47.485 --> 00:00:50.435
So back over to the admin components,

00:00:50.435 --> 00:00:52.915
which is the admin.view.

00:00:52.915 --> 00:00:56.445
Now I want to move down to this orders wrapper,

00:00:56.445 --> 00:00:58.380
let's just change this,

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.790
and then inside here we can construct our level three heading,

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.400
with the title of currents orders.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.490
Then inside the brackets,

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.560
we are going to hard-code in a value.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.885
So we'll save 5 orders.

00:01:11.885 --> 00:01:15.415
Then just below this, we can create our table.

00:01:15.415 --> 00:01:19.645
The table will start with the table heads,

00:01:19.645 --> 00:01:21.980
which will be the headings of item,

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.960
size, quantity, and price.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.390
We'll add these into their own row,

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.155
and then each one will go inside of a table heading elements.

00:01:30.155 --> 00:01:33.250
The first one is for an item.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.525
Let's duplicate this three more times.

00:01:36.525 --> 00:01:39.375
The next one is for the size,

00:01:39.375 --> 00:01:42.340
the third one for the quantity,

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.115
and the last one is going to be for the price.

00:01:47.115 --> 00:01:50.160
Scrolling down below our header section,

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.380
we're going to add the table body,

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.720
with the tbody elements.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.225
Nest inside our first row,

00:01:57.225 --> 00:02:00.960
and this first row is going to be for our other number.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.300
I'm going to add a class of order and it's called number.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.385
It's order number section,

00:02:08.385 --> 00:02:12.440
taking a look at the final site is going to be this row which we see here.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.794
You will have a order number and also a button to remove this from the database.

00:02:17.794 --> 00:02:20.920
Most are going to make this into one cell two,

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.855
by making this span all four columns.

00:02:23.855 --> 00:02:27.685
So inside here we can add a table heading.

00:02:27.685 --> 00:02:30.390
We can make the span all for ourselves,

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.180
with cross span to be equal to four.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.750
Our order number, I'm going to add in the strong tags.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.850
So order number.

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.540
I'm going to set any value inside here followed

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.520
by our button which will take in the type of button,

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.020
and also a class for our CSS, make this red.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.510
We have the class of button of btn_red.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.835
As the value, we can add a HTML entity of ampersands,

00:02:59.835 --> 00:03:02.715
times, and then a semicolon.

00:03:02.715 --> 00:03:06.480
Save this and now we want to see our projects and scroll down.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.895
We have our; table heading,

00:03:07.895 --> 00:03:10.565
the order number, and also the button.

00:03:10.565 --> 00:03:13.550
The next thing to do is to add a new row,

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.570
which is going to display the pizza name such as;

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.225
vegetarian, the size, the quantity,

00:03:20.225 --> 00:03:22.380
and also the price.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.495
A new row inside here.

00:03:25.495 --> 00:03:29.380
The first piece of table data is for the name.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.080
I'm going to add margarita.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.635
The second one is for the pizza size.

00:03:35.635 --> 00:03:38.245
The third one is for the quantity,

00:03:38.245 --> 00:03:40.510
these ones are too inside there.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.940
The fourth one is going to be for the price.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.020
Save and let's check this out.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.675
Good. We now have our table contents there,

00:03:50.675 --> 00:03:54.595
and we can now add a little styling inside of the CSS section,

00:03:54.595 --> 00:03:57.370
inside of the admin to view components.

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.140
Scroll down below scripts.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.595
You can have the style elements.

00:04:03.595 --> 00:04:06.280
This can also be scoped to this components,

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.344
where we're going to start by targeting the admin_wrapper,

00:04:10.344 --> 00:04:12.215
which is the main wrapper.

00:04:12.215 --> 00:04:18.990
All I'm going to do is add some margin of 10 pixels nested inside.

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:21.330
I'm going to target our free sections;

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:25.990
so the first one was current_user_wrapper,

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.795
the second one was the orders_wrapper,

00:04:30.795 --> 00:04:35.260
and the third one is for the menu_wrapper.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:42.290
We can target all of these three sections together to keep the styling consistent.

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.830
Some margin to giving some space in outside of the div,

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.710
10 pixels on the top and bottom and zero on the left and right.

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.870
Some padding inside of the divs of 10 pixels.

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:02.270
A border surrounding each one with a solid line of one pixel,

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.490
and the color to be f79e38.

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.710
Next down to our table elements,

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.570
we can set the text-align to be on the left.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.500
We can make the width.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.290
I want to set this to be 70vw,

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:24.560
to be 70 percent of the viewpoint width.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.010
Next up, we can target the order number action,

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.050
and the table heading,

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.305
to give this a background color,

00:05:32.305 --> 00:05:34.365
which is going to be light gray.

00:05:34.365 --> 00:05:36.990
This is value of ddd.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.780
Finally, once again the order number,

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.965
but this time we're going to target the button.

00:05:42.965 --> 00:05:45.665
So the order number button,

00:05:45.665 --> 00:05:49.430
which is the one to remove the item from the database.

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:54.155
I'm just going to add some margin of zero on the top and bottom.

00:05:54.155 --> 00:05:57.715
Add 10 pixels on the left and right.

00:05:57.715 --> 00:06:00.890
Give this a save and over to the browser.

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:06.300
Reload. This is the current order section completed for now.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.315
If yours looks like this, congratulations.

00:06:09.315 --> 00:06:12.650
You are ready to now move on to add a new menu items,

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.480
and we'll add this in the next video.
