00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:06.015
We now know how to use getters to access state from our stall.

00:00:06.015 --> 00:00:08.160
We then add these getters as

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.690
computed properties just like here inside of the admin components,

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.485
to allow us to keep them updated if the state changes.

00:00:16.485 --> 00:00:18.630
This works completely fine,

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.285
but there is a way we can simplify this code,

00:00:21.285 --> 00:00:25.905
which will be useful if we have a lot more getters which you want to setup.

00:00:25.905 --> 00:00:28.920
We can do this by using mapGetters,

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.965
which is a helper provided by Vuex.

00:00:31.965 --> 00:00:36.670
To use this we first need to import this from our Vuex library.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.330
Up at the top of our scripts,

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.980
we can import as a named import mapGetters,

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.675
which is from the vuex module so we don't need the file path.

00:00:48.675 --> 00:00:53.655
We can then add mapGetters to our computed properties objects.

00:00:53.655 --> 00:00:56.150
Inside here we can use the three dots,

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.880
which is the ES6 spread operator,

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.195
which allows us to mix these getters in with

00:01:02.195 --> 00:01:06.685
any existing computer properties which you may already have.

00:01:06.685 --> 00:01:09.815
MapGetters takes in an array

00:01:09.815 --> 00:01:13.505
in which we add the names of the getters which you want to use.

00:01:13.505 --> 00:01:16.400
The getters which you want to use are simply listed below.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:24.540
We have; get menu items which were add in as a string separated by a comma,

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:31.440
we also have number of orders and the third one is the current user.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.585
Now we can delete the existing computed properties.

00:01:35.585 --> 00:01:38.450
Give this to save and go over to the browser.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.185
We can test if this is working okay.

00:01:41.185 --> 00:01:43.730
Let's scroll down to our menu.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.200
We have the menu items,

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.020
so get menu items is still working.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.710
We can test the current user is working too by login in.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.285
Scroll up and we see the e-mail just there,

00:01:58.285 --> 00:02:00.815
meaning everything is now working fine.

00:02:00.815 --> 00:02:04.070
Not so long ago we used to get an error message when using

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.795
the spread operator and we needed to add an additional Babel plugin.

00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:13.450
This is now no longer the case with the latest version of the Vue CLI.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.690
To finish this off now we can go back over to Visual Studio Code,

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.015
and repeat this over in the menu components.

00:02:21.015 --> 00:02:25.940
We can import the helper from Vuex at the top of our script,

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:36.440
which was mapGetters from vuex and scroll down to our compute its action.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.215
We could remove get menu items,

00:02:39.215 --> 00:02:42.095
and replace this with mapGetters.

00:02:42.095 --> 00:02:47.239
Remember this takes in an array and the string name was get menu items.

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.555
We can also add more getters in the future if we like,

00:02:50.555 --> 00:02:53.810
but for now let's save this and go over to the menu.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.610
Click on the menu link,

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.615
and our menu now still works.

00:02:58.615 --> 00:03:03.095
If like me, you were currently seen an empty array inside of the baskets,

00:03:03.095 --> 00:03:07.355
when it is empty, we can also remove this code from earlier.

00:03:07.355 --> 00:03:09.590
If you go over to the menu.view,

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.375
we can scroll up to our template,

00:03:11.375 --> 00:03:15.380
and am not going to remove this from just below our basket text where I'll put it.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.170
state. orders. I should remove this,

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.915
and our basket is now updated.

00:03:21.915 --> 00:03:26.540
Using the mapGetters helper it's a useful way to organize our code

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.609
and the benefits become even bigger as we add more getters to our application.
