00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:06.930
In the last video, we successfully added the menu items to this menu routes.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.270
You can see from the final version,

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:13.275
if you head over to there and then go over to our menu components,

00:00:13.275 --> 00:00:17.280
that we still need to add the basket on the right-hand side of the page.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.060
When the user clicks on a "Pizza," click on the "Plus

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.530
Symbol," the item will appear on the right-hand side in the basket.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:31.305
Also the basket house burns to change the quantity and the total price is also updated.

00:00:31.305 --> 00:00:35.910
In this video, we will take the first step towards creating this by

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.295
adding the baskets array to store the pizzas which the user adds to the baskets.

00:00:41.295 --> 00:00:43.430
If you're not already there,

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.940
select the menu components from Visual Studio Code.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.819
The first thing I'm going to do is to add a data property called basket,

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:54.590
which will be an array.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.465
Down to our scripts,

00:00:56.465 --> 00:00:58.595
inside of our data.

00:00:58.595 --> 00:01:02.555
Let's add just above get menu items.

00:01:02.555 --> 00:01:06.500
We can initialize our basket as an empty array,

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.945
then add a comma just afterwards.

00:01:08.945 --> 00:01:12.140
This array will be used to store the pizzas,

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.405
which is selected by the user.

00:01:14.405 --> 00:01:16.700
The other pieces to this array,

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.200
we need to add a method to the add to Basket button.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.225
Let's scroll up to our button.

00:01:23.225 --> 00:01:25.310
Inside the buttons opening tag,

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.690
I'm going to add a on click "Event Handler" with a click and set

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:35.060
this equal to a new method which you haven't created yet called addToBasket.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.435
AddToBasket is going to take in two things.

00:01:38.435 --> 00:01:40.565
The first is the item,

00:01:40.565 --> 00:01:43.390
and then the second is the option.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.585
The item is the individual item from our loop,

00:01:47.585 --> 00:01:49.610
such as a Margherita.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.960
The option is the option of which pizza size has been selected,

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.770
so that the nine or 12 inch version.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.905
Scrolling down, we can now add the addToBasket method.

00:02:00.905 --> 00:02:04.820
Just after our data property, that's okay,

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.420
it's the closing curly brace and a comma.

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.080
How we can set up our methods object just like this.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.874
I'm going to set this up as async,

00:02:14.874 --> 00:02:21.510
so we can make use of a JavaScript async/await method name was addToBasket,

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:27.730
which takes in the item on the option which is passed when she calls.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.650
What do you want this method to be able to do?

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.440
Well, won't say pizza is added to our basket.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.670
We want to push a new item to our basket array.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.035
We can use the JavaScript array method called push to do this.

00:02:42.035 --> 00:02:45.335
So let's say the soap, we can select our baskets.

00:02:45.335 --> 00:02:50.795
With this.baskets, we can use the JavaScript push method.

00:02:50.795 --> 00:02:54.970
The item we want to push is a new pizza object.

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:01.925
We can set this up. We can grab the name from our item, which is being passed.

00:03:01.925 --> 00:03:04.160
This is the full pizza objects.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.315
So we can drop the item and then select the individual name.

00:03:08.315 --> 00:03:11.285
We can also do the same for the price.

00:03:11.285 --> 00:03:13.400
We can grab an item,

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.135
select the price of the pizza.

00:03:16.135 --> 00:03:18.035
Also the size.

00:03:18.035 --> 00:03:21.560
The size is available inside of the options.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.500
We grab the option that size.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.820
Finally, we also want to set the quantity to be an initial value of one.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.020
Now with this in place, we can give this a test.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.150
If we scroll up to our templates,

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.370
we can try to output the value of

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.220
the basket and check that this is updated with each new pizza.

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.300
Can have this anywhere inside of

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.249
our template that you simply outputs the value of the baskets.

00:03:52.249 --> 00:03:56.035
Head over to our projects and into the menu.

00:03:56.035 --> 00:03:58.245
Let's try clicking on one of these.

00:03:58.245 --> 00:04:00.550
This is the 12 inch Margherita.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.220
You have the name and also the size inside of here.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.445
Let's try a nine in ham and pineapple.

00:04:07.445 --> 00:04:10.405
This has been added to our basket to.

00:04:10.405 --> 00:04:14.465
If we go ahead though and add the same pizza, once more.

00:04:14.465 --> 00:04:17.315
Whenever nine inch pineapple,

00:04:17.315 --> 00:04:19.980
we can see the inside of our array,

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:25.745
we now have three individual items rather than the quantity being increased.

00:04:25.745 --> 00:04:29.015
We can improve this even further by first checking

00:04:29.015 --> 00:04:32.120
if an item is already inside of the baskets.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.610
If not, we'll add the new pizza.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.110
If it's already in the basket,

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.485
will increase the quantity by one.

00:04:38.485 --> 00:04:44.640
Let's go back over to our method inside of here.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.435
Before we push our pizza to the array,

00:04:47.435 --> 00:04:50.675
let's first check the contents of the array.

00:04:50.675 --> 00:04:56.125
We can create a constant called pizzaExists.

00:04:56.125 --> 00:04:58.440
Inside here, we're going to

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:06.730
await this.baskets and then make use of the JavaScript find method.

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:10.590
Find is nothing specific to view js.

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.070
It's actually a JavaScript array method,

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.575
which returns a value of the first item

00:05:15.575 --> 00:05:18.925
which matches the condition we are about to provide.

00:05:18.925 --> 00:05:20.960
The conditioning is to check if

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.960
the pizza name and the size has already been added to the baskets.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.864
Inside here, we said that by function,

00:05:28.864 --> 00:05:32.610
we want to add an inline arrow function.

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.590
Here we're searching through our array and each item that is

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:41.420
found is stored inside this piece variable with unwanted check.

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:47.350
If the pizza.name is equal to item.name.

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:50.750
This is the pizza remember which had been passed to our method.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:59.805
We also want to track two if the pizza.size is equal to our option.size too.

00:05:59.805 --> 00:06:03.080
If the pizza size and also the pizza name,

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.080
it's both found inside of our basket.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.785
This means that this is going to be true.

00:06:08.785 --> 00:06:11.115
We can set up an if statement.

00:06:11.115 --> 00:06:14.180
We can say if pizza exists,

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.360
then we want to increase the quantity by one.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:23.910
We can do this with pizzaExists.quantity++.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.935
What I want to return out of our function

00:06:27.935 --> 00:06:31.195
since we don't need to do the push method just below.

00:06:31.195 --> 00:06:34.475
Save this file, and now let's head over to the browser.

00:06:34.475 --> 00:06:39.335
We can try at the end a 12 inch pepperoni, a nine inch.

00:06:39.335 --> 00:06:41.495
Limits are a second 12 inch,

00:06:41.495 --> 00:06:46.425
and the quantity has been increased to 2, 3, and 4.

00:06:46.425 --> 00:06:48.135
Let's try it for one more.

00:06:48.135 --> 00:06:49.920
Let's say ham and pineapple.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.960
The quantity is now being increased with each item which has been

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.480
added with this now in place our baskets is now working correctly.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.570
It doesn't look great at a moment.

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:04.830
But our data is there in place for the next video.
