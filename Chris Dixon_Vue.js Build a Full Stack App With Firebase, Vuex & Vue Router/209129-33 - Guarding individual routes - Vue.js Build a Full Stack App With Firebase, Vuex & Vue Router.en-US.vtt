00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.010
The last type of guard I want to show you is the before enter guard,

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:10.845
which can be added directly to where we define our routes in the main.js.

00:00:10.845 --> 00:00:12.420
Before I create this,

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.765
I'm going to remove any unneeded code for our application.

00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:18.225
So in the admin from the last video,

00:00:18.225 --> 00:00:21.080
we can remove before route enter,

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.185
and also the data property which we set up for this.

00:00:25.185 --> 00:00:28.875
Save this file and over to the main.js.

00:00:28.875 --> 00:00:33.250
I'm going to add this new navigation guard to the admin routes.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.975
So to make this more readable,

00:00:35.975 --> 00:00:39.485
I'm going to add these on two separate lines,

00:00:39.485 --> 00:00:43.325
separated by a comma just after our components we can add

00:00:43.325 --> 00:00:50.115
the before enter, guard beforeEnter works just like the

00:00:50.115 --> 00:00:58.100
global before enter guard and also takes in the same free arguments of two from our next.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.605
We said the server as a function.

00:01:00.605 --> 00:01:03.305
I'm going to add an alert inside here,

00:01:03.305 --> 00:01:07.340
which is going to send a string of text to the user to say

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.630
this area is for authorized users only.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.840
Please login to continue.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.455
After our alerts, we also need to pass in the next function to complete the navigation.

00:01:27.455 --> 00:01:32.020
Say this are now if we go over to the browser, and first of all,

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.540
we can test the individual routes inside

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.485
the header and we don't see any alert for these four links.

00:01:38.485 --> 00:01:41.575
If we now go to forward slash Admin,

00:01:41.575 --> 00:01:44.290
where we'll apply this navigation guards.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.195
We see our alert has now popped up.

00:01:47.195 --> 00:01:51.070
Of course just popping up an alert is not secure its own.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.700
But later on we will hide the admin area and only displayed to logged in users.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.325
We will also later on,

00:01:58.325 --> 00:02:00.650
are they before route leave god,

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.835
inside of the admin components for when leaving the admin area.

00:02:04.835 --> 00:02:11.490
Say automatically login out the user when navigating away from the admin.
