00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.220
We made a big step towards our functioning shopping basket

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.690
in the last video by pushing our added items to an array.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.510
Now we can create a table to display the old items by looping through this array.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.455
Let's head back over to the menu dot view components.

00:00:19.455 --> 00:00:22.410
Well, I'm going to add this basket at the end,

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.410
just above our closing div for the menu.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.990
Scroll over to the templates,

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.265
and remember we created our menu section with the menu class.

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:35.235
Let's locate the end of our menu.

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:37.695
In place of our basket just here,

00:00:37.695 --> 00:00:42.285
make sure we still have the closing div at the end for our main wrapper.

00:00:42.285 --> 00:00:45.060
Let's begin by adding a comment.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.190
This one is for our shopping basket,

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.530
our shopping basket needs a div,

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.520
and I'm going to give this a class of basket.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.735
We can use this in the CSS very soon,

00:00:57.735 --> 00:01:00.465
we'll now add a level free heading at the top.

00:01:00.465 --> 00:01:03.480
I want to add a tilde to either side,

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.310
with the text all baskets.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.200
Let's begin to construct our table for all of our basket data.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:18.440
The table is going to have the table body and then our first table row.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.810
The table row needs some table data with the TD elements and

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.610
this first piece of data is going to be for the increase and decrease buttons.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.425
If you look at the finished version,

00:01:30.425 --> 00:01:35.240
this is going to be the plus and minus buttons and also the quantity in the center,

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.985
we'll then add a second piece of table data,

00:01:37.985 --> 00:01:39.664
which is for our pizza,

00:01:39.664 --> 00:01:43.615
including size and then finally the price at the end.

00:01:43.615 --> 00:01:48.170
The first element is going to include our button.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.805
This is going to have the h small entity,

00:01:51.805 --> 00:01:53.665
which is going to be an ampersand,

00:01:53.665 --> 00:01:58.375
the hash, then the value of 8,722 with a semicolon.

00:01:58.375 --> 00:02:02.870
This will give us our negative symbol to deduct it from the quantity.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.130
You can also add a class,

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.265
this is going to be the value of btn underscore green.

00:02:09.265 --> 00:02:12.720
But our CSS, I'm going to duplicate this.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.730
This is for the plus button,

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.830
which is a h small entity of the ampersand,

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.415
the hash and then the value of 43.

00:02:21.415 --> 00:02:24.985
In between here we also want to add a span element,

00:02:24.985 --> 00:02:27.095
which is for the quantity.

00:02:27.095 --> 00:02:30.845
I'm going to add this all this in as a value of 2.

00:02:30.845 --> 00:02:36.160
Underneath our td, we can add our second set of data,

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.900
which is for the pizza name and

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.695
also the size followed by alpha piece of data for this row,

00:02:44.695 --> 00:02:46.705
which is for the price,

00:02:46.705 --> 00:02:48.475
and any price is fine.

00:02:48.475 --> 00:02:51.700
We will come back and make this dynamic very soon.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.895
You can say this and see how this is looking over in the projects.

00:02:55.895 --> 00:02:58.449
We have our buttons, our quantity,

00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:00.580
and also the pizza information,

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.215
along with the price,

00:03:02.215 --> 00:03:03.970
definition of our templates.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.530
Over to the final version,

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.335
we also need to add this order total just below our table.

00:03:09.335 --> 00:03:13.970
I just want to hear we can add a p elements with the tags of all the

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:21.780
total and a colon and then we can add a button to find the place of order.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:28.130
This button can also have a class to match the rest with the class name of

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.555
btn green, save and refresh.

00:03:33.555 --> 00:03:35.675
Just to finish this video off,

00:03:35.675 --> 00:03:38.915
I'm also going to add some CSS to this basket,

00:03:38.915 --> 00:03:41.915
so much as the menu on the left-hand side.

00:03:41.915 --> 00:03:45.625
Let's scroll down into our style tags,

00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:47.670
down at the very bottom.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.065
We are going to share some common styling with the menu.

00:03:51.065 --> 00:03:53.630
We can also add the baskets.

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.345
This is a class.

00:03:55.345 --> 00:03:59.780
This will give us the same background-color and border radius that we see

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.270
here and also to make it the full width of the available space.

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.870
Let's scroll down to our media query.

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.545
The menu has taken up 65 percent.

00:04:10.545 --> 00:04:13.215
We can add to the basket width,

00:04:13.215 --> 00:04:15.740
let's take up the rest of the content,

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.315
which is 35vw, and there we go.

00:04:20.315 --> 00:04:25.265
This is how our shopping baskets are now being displayed with some static data.

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:28.580
Let's now move on to the next video where we'll loop through

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.940
our basket data and display inside of this table.
