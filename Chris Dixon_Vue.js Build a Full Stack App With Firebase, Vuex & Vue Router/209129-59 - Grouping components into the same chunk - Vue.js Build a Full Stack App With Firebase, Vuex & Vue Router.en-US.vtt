00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:07.065
We now know how to split up the bundle and raise a little components when required.

00:00:07.065 --> 00:00:09.675
Sometimes though we may want to group together

00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:13.410
certain related components to be downloaded together,

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.930
and these groups are called chunks.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.310
For example, when a user clicks on any of these links in the menu,

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.870
we may want to also get all of the other menu components too.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:31.435
This is useful if our menu components is small and we want them to be ready for the user.

00:00:31.435 --> 00:00:35.660
Let's begin again over in the routes.js file.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.880
Currently our menu links,

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.170
which is the menu about and contact.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.520
As we know from the last video,

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.915
were all imported independently when the user clicks on them.

00:00:46.915 --> 00:00:50.885
I'm going to now group together the contact and about its components,

00:00:50.885 --> 00:00:52.595
which is simple to do.

00:00:52.595 --> 00:00:55.820
All we need to do, inside of our import,

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.940
is to add a comment of web pack chunk name,

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.735
and then give this group a name of our choice.

00:01:01.735 --> 00:01:05.580
So we create a comment with the forward slash and the star.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.550
When it closes off with the reverse,

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.770
which is the star and the forward slash.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.045
Inside here, we add the comments of web pack chunk name,

00:01:14.045 --> 00:01:16.405
all in common case.

00:01:16.405 --> 00:01:20.915
Then after the colon, we can add a name which you want to provide for our group,

00:01:20.915 --> 00:01:23.980
and we're going to call this the menu group.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.685
We can then grab this group.

00:01:26.685 --> 00:01:30.485
I'm going to copy this and also add this to our contact.

00:01:30.485 --> 00:01:32.899
Paste this image to our import,

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:36.175
save the file, and then on to the browser.

00:01:36.175 --> 00:01:39.615
We can reload and clear the console.

00:01:39.615 --> 00:01:42.510
So again, we see our app.js.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.365
If we click on the "Menu",

00:01:44.365 --> 00:01:47.905
our independent bundle for our menu is loaded in.

00:01:47.905 --> 00:01:53.210
Now, we should see that the about and contact will be downloaded in the same file.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.160
So we have the menu group.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.070
Let's try the about.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.400
Now, additional pages are downloaded for

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.285
these two components since they contain in our group.

00:02:03.285 --> 00:02:06.980
So this is how we can group together related components,

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:13.080
and we can really fine tune how we want our page to be loaded for our application.
