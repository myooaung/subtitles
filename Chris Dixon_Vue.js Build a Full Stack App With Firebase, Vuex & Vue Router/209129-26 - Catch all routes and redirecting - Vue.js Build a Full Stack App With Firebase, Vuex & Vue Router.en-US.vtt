00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.615
We finished in the last video by mentioning that since we have changed our router mode,

00:00:06.615 --> 00:00:12.165
we need a way to handle any follow for errors when a URL is not found.

00:00:12.165 --> 00:00:14.925
This is a pretty simple fix.

00:00:14.925 --> 00:00:18.000
All we need to do is add a catch-all route to

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.425
these cases and we can do this back in the main dot js-file.

00:00:22.425 --> 00:00:27.610
We can create a new route which is going to handle it up in our routes array.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.010
Just after the menu, we can add a new objects,

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.745
where the path is going to be equal to a star.

00:00:34.745 --> 00:00:40.775
The star as a URL path will cover us for any paths which are not matched above.

00:00:40.775 --> 00:00:42.830
Just like our other routes,

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.015
we can add a component to display if the path is not matched.

00:00:47.015 --> 00:00:51.455
For example, here we could add a component such as the follow four-page.

00:00:51.455 --> 00:00:54.530
Alternatively, we can also add a redirect,

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.800
which is going to redirect to any page which we choose,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.360
such as the home route.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.000
If we say this and give us a go in the browser,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.705
we can add in a unrecognized URL.

00:01:05.705 --> 00:01:10.285
It's enter, and we redirected to the home route.

00:01:10.285 --> 00:01:14.870
These are some options to cover us for unrecognized URLs.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.410
We can either redirect to a different page or set

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.705
up a custom components with some instructions to the user.

00:01:22.705 --> 00:01:27.050
This redirect can also be used on any other routes too,

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.310
it's not reserved just for the catch-all route.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.310
Coming up in the next video,

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.285
we'll keep on the subject of routing and

00:01:35.285 --> 00:01:39.660
look at how we can add nested routes to our application.
