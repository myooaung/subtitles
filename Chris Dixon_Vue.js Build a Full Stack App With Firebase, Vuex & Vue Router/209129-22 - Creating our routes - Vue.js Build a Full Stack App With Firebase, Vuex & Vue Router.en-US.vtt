00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.270
We have our router now installed.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.020
It's time to add some routes to allow us to switch between pages or

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.235
components by calling the main.js file,

00:00:11.235 --> 00:00:14.760
which we added our route to instance to in the last video.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.060
We can either add our routes directly inside here,

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.295
or to keep things nice and neat.

00:00:20.295 --> 00:00:21.525
I'm going to set up

00:00:21.525 --> 00:00:29.220
a new constant called routes and create a new array just above routers and array,

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.635
which we can add an object, eat routes.

00:00:31.635 --> 00:00:35.310
Inside this object, we need to define a path.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.415
Let's start by creating our objects.

00:00:38.415 --> 00:00:41.580
We can pass in the path property.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.900
Then we add the path which you want to navigate to.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.555
The Home route is the forward slash.

00:00:47.555 --> 00:00:50.600
Or for example, if we add forward slash menu,

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.035
this will be our URLs which are as pizzaplanet.com/menu.

00:00:56.035 --> 00:00:58.770
Let's get started with the home routes.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.325
Then we need to declare which components we want to

00:01:01.325 --> 00:01:05.375
render when the user visits the forward slash route.

00:01:05.375 --> 00:01:08.780
I'm going to navigate to the home components.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.625
We will also need to import this component in just a moment.

00:01:12.625 --> 00:01:16.355
The second routes I'm going to add is for the menu.

00:01:16.355 --> 00:01:19.595
Again, as I string forward slash menu,

00:01:19.595 --> 00:01:22.700
which is going to map to a component,

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.970
with the name of my new.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.675
Then up at the top of this file as ever,

00:01:27.675 --> 00:01:31.140
we can import our modules, all our components.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.135
Import, the home component.

00:01:34.135 --> 00:01:39.950
This is from our components directory, which is./components/home.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.630
These other command is going to be our menu,

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.110
the same file path components/menu.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.540
Now we have our two routes set up when X needs,

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.104
pass them to our router incidence.

00:01:58.104 --> 00:02:00.920
Scroll down, it's while routes a constant,

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.680
all we need to do is simply passing our routes from above and make

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.250
sure this is routes to allow us to switch between these routes,

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.370
we need to modify the header navigation links.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:21.995
Let's go over to the header W. We need to use a router link component,

00:02:21.995 --> 00:02:24.215
navigate between these routes.

00:02:24.215 --> 00:02:27.890
To begin, I'm going to comment out the existing link.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.904
Let's comment out the a link, the home menu,

00:02:32.904 --> 00:02:37.275
also contacts and also about us,

00:02:37.275 --> 00:02:40.380
any place we can add a router link.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.030
Router link just looks like any other HTML elements.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.355
A router hyphen link,

00:02:46.355 --> 00:02:49.550
this has an opening and also a closing tag.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.760
We need to close this off.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.910
Inside the opening tag,

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.440
we can then add To property and then add a forward slash.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.370
These To properties we just added is the path which you want to link

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.700
to and it is much is one of the routes we've just setup in the main.js,

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.705
the corresponding components will be rendered.

00:03:10.705 --> 00:03:12.870
Inside of our router link,

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.504
we can again passing our link using the a elements,

00:03:16.504 --> 00:03:18.350
the link name of home,

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:24.120
and then close off our link being careful not to add the href property inside here,

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.190
since we use the view router to handle all this.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.080
I'm going to copy our router link,

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.615
scroll down to our Menu.

00:03:32.615 --> 00:03:37.355
You can then change the router link to be the forward slash menu path.

00:03:37.355 --> 00:03:44.860
The title of menu go down to Contractors.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:54.780
The path is forward slash contacts and then finally the same for about.

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:06.860
Now the view router knows exactly which components we want to render for each route.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.970
But we also need to tell the view router exactly where we want them to be

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.640
displayed in our projects over in the app.view file.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.640
The final step is to add the router view components.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:25.190
At the moment we've got the admin and the home displaying at the same time in place,

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.895
we can add the router view.

00:04:27.895 --> 00:04:32.210
This has an opening and also a closing tag and this will

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.365
be the location where the rendered component will display.

00:04:36.365 --> 00:04:42.800
This basically acts as an outlet for whichever component is selected from the menu.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.405
This means we can now remove all of the components from our script below,

00:04:47.405 --> 00:04:50.030
still need the app header so we can leave this one

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.540
in or we could remove the Admin menu and home.

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.665
We no longer need these.

00:04:55.665 --> 00:04:58.310
We can also clean up our components,

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.845
leaving just the app header.

00:05:00.845 --> 00:05:02.780
With all of this now in place,

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.940
we can start up our development server with npm run serve.

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.630
Head over to the browser and we can open this up in our pot,

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.545
which is localhost 8080.

00:05:23.545 --> 00:05:27.050
We have our home component. Let's click on this.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:32.710
We can then go to our menu link and we say this is rendered just below. Back to the home.

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.880
Remember in the main.js,

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.490
we only set up the Home on the menu routes.

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.130
If we click on the contact and about us,

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.625
we don't have any content just yet.

00:05:42.625 --> 00:05:44.165
It is now in place.

00:05:44.165 --> 00:05:46.250
Let's now move on to the next video,

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:51.750
where we will take a look at the router link components in more detail.
