00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.755
We've done a lot of work to get to this stage of the project,

00:00:05.755 --> 00:00:07.945
so well done for making it this far.

00:00:07.945 --> 00:00:11.875
I just wanted to add a few finishing touches in this video,

00:00:11.875 --> 00:00:15.115
starting inside of the login components.

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:17.665
At the moment, if we log out,

00:00:17.665 --> 00:00:20.935
it may be obvious to some that this is a login section,

00:00:20.935 --> 00:00:25.325
but we can also add some text to tell the user they need to login.

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:28.575
Over any login view components,

00:00:28.575 --> 00:00:31.495
let's head over to the top of the templates.

00:00:31.495 --> 00:00:35.350
We will find our form and also our login wrapper.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.920
Inside here, I'm going to add a "p" elements with some text.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.330
Please login to continue.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.995
Save this and back over to the browser.

00:00:46.995 --> 00:00:49.030
We'll now see our text on here,

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.475
instruct new user to login.

00:00:51.475 --> 00:00:56.330
The next thing I'm going to do is to add a navigation guard to this admin.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.080
If the user is logged in, remember,

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.590
we can see sensitive information and anybody who has

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.480
access can see the orders and also remove any orders or pizzas.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.610
To protect this admin if the user were to navigate away without logging out,

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.470
we can add a navigation guard,

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.980
which is going to alert the user and also log out automatically.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.350
Lets do this in the admin.view components.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.920
We can add our navigation guard inside of our scripts.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.024
Just after our methods,

00:01:30.024 --> 00:01:33.680
I'm going to add the guard all beforeRouteLeave.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.990
As we looked at earlier, this takes in two from and also next.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:49.370
The first thing we want to do is add an if statement where we can add a confirm box.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.420
This will alert the user that they will be logged out if they

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.585
continue to navigate away from the admin area,

00:01:55.585 --> 00:02:02.770
so we can have a string of "You will be logged out when leaving admin."

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.005
This is a question. If this is true,

00:02:08.005 --> 00:02:11.030
if they continue to navigate away,

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.295
what I'm going to access our store,

00:02:14.295 --> 00:02:20.150
we can then call dispatch and the name of the action we want to dispatch is sign out.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.215
This will automatically log the user out when leaving the admin.

00:02:24.215 --> 00:02:26.885
If they were to cancel this conformation,

00:02:26.885 --> 00:02:29.050
we can add this in an else statements.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.480
All we want to do inside here is to stay on the same routes.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.885
We could do this by passing false to next.

00:02:36.885 --> 00:02:42.720
Let's say this under to the admin, we need to log in.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.280
Now, we're inside the admin components.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.610
Let's try and go over to the menu. We get an alert.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.900
If we cancel this, we stay on the same page.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.285
Back to the menu. Click on "Okay".

00:02:56.285 --> 00:02:59.860
You see we logged out but we still on the admin page.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.850
To continue on to the menu components or any over's,

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.190
then you also need called next inside here.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.510
We can try this once more. We're now logged in.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.340
Let's try the about.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.910
We can cancel and we're still inside the admin.

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:23.525
Let's try once more on okay and we now take into our over routes.

00:03:23.525 --> 00:03:27.175
The final thing is some minor CSS,

00:03:27.175 --> 00:03:32.560
which I'm going to add to the main view down in the Style section.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.010
The first one I'm going to do is to target our inputs and our text area for

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.700
our new Pizzas input, so input, textarea.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:49.500
All I'm going to do here is to increase the font size to be 1.1 rems.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:56.960
Next, we want to add some general style into the buttons so we can't remove the border by

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:04.240
setting to null and also increase the font size to be 1.1 rems too.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:10.625
Inside of our app, we also have some classes of btn_green and also btn_red.

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:13.385
This also currently missing our styles.

00:04:13.385 --> 00:04:15.230
Let's start with green.

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.320
All you need to do is to set the background color and set is to be

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:26.250
an rgb value of 101,168, and then 101.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:34.900
Next, the btn_red. The background color,

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.935
this is also going to be an rgb value of 241,

00:04:39.935 --> 00:04:44.285
70, and also 70 giving us the red color.

00:04:44.285 --> 00:04:46.525
Over to the browser,

00:04:46.525 --> 00:04:51.175
we have green colors inside here and also here too.

00:04:51.175 --> 00:04:53.360
Let's try the admin section,

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.550
where we also have our red buttons.

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:03.090
We have the red sign outs.

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.855
Also, where we remove the orders on pizzas,

00:05:05.855 --> 00:05:08.390
we have our red buttons too.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:12.620
If we wanted to, we could go even further with the style in,

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.600
but I'm going to lead this project here since this is a view JS Course.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.325
Next, we're going to move on to a new section which you can cover a new topic,

00:05:22.325 --> 00:05:27.750
which will be lazy loading and how to split our app into smaller bundles.
