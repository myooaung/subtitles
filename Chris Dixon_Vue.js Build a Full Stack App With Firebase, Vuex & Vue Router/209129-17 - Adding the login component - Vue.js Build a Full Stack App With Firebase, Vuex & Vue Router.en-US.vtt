00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.635
The admin section of the app needs to be in area,

00:00:04.635 --> 00:00:07.755
which only registered users can access.

00:00:07.755 --> 00:00:11.190
We don't want any visitor being able to add or remove

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.795
pizzas from our menu or access any of the current orders.

00:00:15.795 --> 00:00:19.925
Therefore, we need to add use authentication to our app,

00:00:19.925 --> 00:00:24.165
and we can do this by using the existing Firebase projects.

00:00:24.165 --> 00:00:27.105
First, we need to add a login component,

00:00:27.105 --> 00:00:29.475
which we can place inside of the Admin,

00:00:29.475 --> 00:00:34.155
and we're going to do this with a new component called Login.view.

00:00:34.155 --> 00:00:36.970
Head over to the Components,

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:44.705
create Login.view, where we can begin to construct our templates in the usual way.

00:00:44.705 --> 00:00:46.985
I'm going to add a wrapper.

00:00:46.985 --> 00:00:51.600
Let's add a div with the class of login_wrapper.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.140
Nested inside, we can have a form.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.889
This form is going to have two sections.

00:00:57.889 --> 00:01:01.820
We are going to be logging in using the e-mail and password combination,

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.035
so we're going to create a wrapper div first of all, for the email.

00:01:06.035 --> 00:01:08.275
The e-mail needs a label,

00:01:08.275 --> 00:01:10.170
so this is for the e-mail,

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.540
and then inside here we can have the text of e-mail address.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.170
Afterwards, we need our form inputs.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.505
The input type is going to be for e-mail,

00:01:21.505 --> 00:01:24.300
the id of e-mail too,

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.780
and then the placeholder value,

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.640
which is going to be enter e-mail.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.580
After this section, we can then add a second div still within the form.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.430
This one is going to be for our password.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.565
The label for password,

00:01:40.565 --> 00:01:43.770
the text of password,

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:50.590
the input is going to have the type of password along with the id,

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.275
and once more, the placeholder of password.

00:01:55.275 --> 00:02:00.650
To finish off this form, we just need to add a button just before the form closing tag,

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.140
and this is going to be the type of button,

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.135
the class of btn_green,

00:02:09.135 --> 00:02:12.425
and then the text of sign in.

00:02:12.425 --> 00:02:15.460
This component will now need to be imported and

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.180
registered so we can use this over in the admin file.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.340
So I head over to the Admin.view,

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:31.635
down to our script where we can import our login components, the file path.

00:02:31.635 --> 00:02:37.455
This is also in the components file so the file path is simply./Login.

00:02:37.455 --> 00:02:40.960
Then register our components,

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.650
and then up to our templates where we can add this in.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.990
I'm going to add this near the bottom,

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.665
so just above the closing div for our wrapper,

00:02:50.665 --> 00:02:53.415
let's add our login components.

00:02:53.415 --> 00:02:57.095
Save this file and then go to the Admin in the browser

00:02:57.095 --> 00:03:01.850
where we see our new form down at the bottom for the e-mail and password.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.030
The position of this component is not really

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.360
important at this stage since later on in the course,

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.255
when we have access to the user's logged in states,

00:03:11.255 --> 00:03:14.205
we will conditionally render these components,

00:03:14.205 --> 00:03:17.885
so this is the only thing which the user sees on the page.

00:03:17.885 --> 00:03:19.610
In the next video,

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:25.560
we'll head back over to Firebase and get to work with our user authentication.
