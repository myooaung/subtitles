00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.985
Having all of our states,

00:00:02.985 --> 00:00:06.404
both from the application and from external sources,

00:00:06.404 --> 00:00:11.235
such as Firebase inside of our one central store can be convenient.

00:00:11.235 --> 00:00:13.290
Also, as you would expect,

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.940
it can get pretty crowded as our application grows with all of the actions,

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.450
mutations and the getters in one place.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.710
Luckily, Vuex does not restrict the way we structure our store.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:32.050
We can split it up into multiple files to make our code more organized and maintainable.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.555
In this video and also the next,

00:00:34.555 --> 00:00:37.340
I'm going to show you a few different ways to organize

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.655
your store and also how to use modules.

00:00:40.655 --> 00:00:44.690
Of course, you may also come up with your own preferred way too.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.560
The first way I'm going to cover is the split our actions,

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.840
getters and mutations into their own separate files.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.520
These three new files will also live in the store folder.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.950
Let's go over to our store inside of the sidebar.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.995
And we can create a new file for each one of these.

00:01:03.995 --> 00:01:07.640
The first ones is actions.js,

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.730
the next one is for the getters.js,

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.360
and the third one is for the mutations.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:24.425
I'm going to start by quoting our actions from the main store.js file,

00:01:24.425 --> 00:01:27.830
and then pasting them inside of our new actions file.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.340
So inside here, let's look for our actions and we can remove

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.610
everything inside of the surrounding curly brace.

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.735
I'll sign out and also sign in,

00:01:38.735 --> 00:01:42.205
leaving just the curly braces surrounding this.

00:01:42.205 --> 00:01:46.115
Take these out, and then head over to the actions.js.

00:01:46.115 --> 00:01:48.065
We can paste these in,

00:01:48.065 --> 00:01:51.545
and we also need to export these as a constant.

00:01:51.545 --> 00:01:54.700
So we can import these inside of our main store.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.705
So the first one of sign-in,

00:01:57.705 --> 00:02:01.230
we can export this as a constant.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.449
Since it's now no longer part of the method's object,

00:02:05.449 --> 00:02:08.585
we also need to turn this into a standalone function.

00:02:08.585 --> 00:02:12.550
We can add an equals after the function name.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.860
We can repeat this also for the sign out just below.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:23.610
So export const, replace the colon with the equals.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.055
We also need to import our firebaseAuth too, up at the top.

00:02:29.055 --> 00:02:31.950
This is a name export.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:39.950
So firebaseAuth and this is from the file path of dot-dot slash and then firebase.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.880
If we scroll down, since these also now standalone functions,

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.440
we just need to remove the comma separating the sign-in and sign out.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.785
We can do exactly the same if you have more actions,

00:02:51.785 --> 00:02:55.070
and we will add more actions in this project later on.

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.895
For now though, we need to import this back into our store.js,

00:02:58.895 --> 00:03:00.925
where we just remove these from.

00:03:00.925 --> 00:03:02.670
Let's begin up at the top.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.590
We can remove our imports from firebase,

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.315
and instead we could replace this with a star,

00:03:08.315 --> 00:03:14.380
which we use to import the entire contents of our new file rather than a single member.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.010
This will import all of our actions from our actions file.

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.500
This name of actions is up to us,

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.685
but this is simply the name we use to refer to the imports object.

00:03:25.685 --> 00:03:27.890
Some actions make sense.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.945
This is in the same folder,

00:03:29.945 --> 00:03:33.440
so simply dot slash and then actions.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.690
We can then go down to the bottom of the file where we have our actions object.

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.675
We can remove the colon and the curly braces,

00:03:41.675 --> 00:03:45.724
leaving a reference to the actions which we just imported.

00:03:45.724 --> 00:03:50.570
We can now test this action is still working by logging in and out.

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.320
So we still see the user's e-mail in the admin.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.815
Let's head over to forward slash admin,

00:03:57.815 --> 00:04:03.390
scroll down to the bottom, sign-in.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.940
Hit the "Sign in" button.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.450
Then if we scroll up to the top,

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.070
we see the signed in user's e-mail.

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:15.650
Click "Sign out" and both file functions now still seem to working.

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.985
So we just need to do exactly the same for our getters and mutations.

00:04:19.985 --> 00:04:23.575
This is definitely a challenge I think you can do by yourself.

00:04:23.575 --> 00:04:25.495
Just follow the same process,

00:04:25.495 --> 00:04:29.515
moving the mutations and the getters to their own file,

00:04:29.515 --> 00:04:31.955
just as we have done with the actions.

00:04:31.955 --> 00:04:36.620
So pause the video and give it a go if you feel confident doing so.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.840
I'm going to begin over in the getters.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.690
Head over to the store.js.

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.620
We can grab all three of our getters,

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.960
over to our new file,

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.040
paste these in,

00:04:51.620 --> 00:05:01.350
export const, all three.

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.300
Remember, since these are now standalone functions,

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.074
we need to replace the colon with an equals,

00:05:07.074 --> 00:05:10.090
since these are no longer part of an object.

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.090
We also need to remove the commas separating each

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:18.025
one and then we can import these back into our store.js.

00:05:18.025 --> 00:05:23.670
Just like before we can remove the object pointing to a getters reference,

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.440
which we can now import at the very top,

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:34.480
replace the getters, and then the same for the mutations.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.035
Here we have the addOrder and the userStatus.

00:05:43.035 --> 00:05:45.340
Let's remove both these.

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:50.645
We can also remove an object while we're here into the new mutations file.

00:05:50.645 --> 00:05:57.250
Let's add these in, export const, add the equals.

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.320
Also the same for the second one,

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.145
add the equals in and also remove the comma.

00:06:04.145 --> 00:06:06.665
If you still have any commented code,

00:06:06.665 --> 00:06:08.255
we can also remove this.

00:06:08.255 --> 00:06:09.905
This is no longer needed.

00:06:09.905 --> 00:06:14.190
Back over to our store. We can import this.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.980
This was the mutations.

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:24.690
Also change the file path too. So this it.

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.750
Now gives this a "Save" and go over to the projects.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.380
Everything still works as normal.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:35.205
Let's try out the admin. Everything looks fine.

00:06:35.205 --> 00:06:39.575
So this is just one way to structure our Vuex code.

00:06:39.575 --> 00:06:43.670
Well, you can already see how this could benefit us as the application grows.

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:45.620
Next, we're going to cover modules,

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:51.330
which is another useful way to organize the code inside of our Vuex Store.
