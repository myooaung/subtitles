00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:06.749
In the last video, we created a total cost to the bottom of our basket,

00:00:06.749 --> 00:00:10.140
and then outputted this using a computer property.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.345
If we add to the basket quantities,

00:00:13.345 --> 00:00:17.465
you will notice that every now and again we get a lot of decimal places,

00:00:17.465 --> 00:00:20.630
so we need to add some format in it to this currency.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.440
Each line item has a hard-coded currency symbol,

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.265
but we don't have one for the order total.

00:00:27.265 --> 00:00:32.170
To fix this, I'm going to use a npm package called accounting-js,

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:37.760
which is going to add some currency parsing and formatting to our numbers.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.140
It also works well as a vue.js filter.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.080
Installing this is simple,

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.770
we can use the npm i command inside of the terminal.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:53.920
Let's open this up, then use npm i and the package name is accounting-js.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.420
While this is running, I'm going to go back to our server and then into

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.980
the main.js file where we can import this up at the top.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:12.010
We want to import this as accounting and the package name is accounting-js.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.580
We can then set this up as a vue filter by accessing

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.205
the vue instance and then a method name which is called filter.

00:01:22.205 --> 00:01:27.920
This will set up a global filter so it's available to use in all of our components.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.385
Our filter takes in two arguments.

00:01:31.385 --> 00:01:35.585
The first argument is the name we're going to give to our filter.

00:01:35.585 --> 00:01:37.920
I'm going to call this currency.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.940
Then the second one is going to be a function.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.975
A function is going to take in the value which we pass to it.

00:01:44.975 --> 00:01:47.640
This is going to be the price which we need to format,

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.560
so the price of each individual pizza on the order total.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.470
We then want to return a new value from our counting package.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.330
We're then going to access a method which is called

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.745
format money and format money takes in our value to process.

00:02:04.745 --> 00:02:08.360
We can also bring this onto its own line by removing

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.975
the return statements and also the curly braces,

00:02:11.975 --> 00:02:15.180
just make our code a little shorter,

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.500
and also make sure this is spelled correctly too, so change this.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.255
We mentioned before that this creates a global filter,

00:02:23.255 --> 00:02:26.630
so we can use it instantly in any of our components.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.815
We need to use this over in the menu of vue components.

00:02:30.815 --> 00:02:34.150
We can start inside of our order total.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.850
To use our filter,

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.885
all we need to do inside the double curly braces,

00:02:38.885 --> 00:02:44.395
is to use the pipe symbol and then pass in our filter name, which was currency.

00:02:44.395 --> 00:02:47.415
This doesn't have a hard-coded dollar symbol,

00:02:47.415 --> 00:02:50.595
but this is added in from our currency package.

00:02:50.595 --> 00:02:55.160
Just above, we have the individual price for each line.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.025
We can remove the hard-coded dollar symbol,

00:02:58.025 --> 00:03:01.255
then also add in our currency filter.

00:03:01.255 --> 00:03:05.900
We also have one more if we save this and go back to our menu.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.335
We also have the prices for each individual pizza.

00:03:09.335 --> 00:03:13.025
Let's scroll up into our menu section.

00:03:13.025 --> 00:03:19.440
The option.price, add in the pipe and our currency filter,

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.140
remove any hard-coded dollar symbol,

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.690
give this File a Save and over to the browser.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.310
Inside of our menu we still see

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.000
the currency symbol even though we've removed the hard-coded value.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.550
Let's add some items to our basket.

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.475
We see the dollar symbols inside of here too,

00:03:37.475 --> 00:03:40.570
and let's try increasing the value.

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.700
The currency now seems to be correctly displaying.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.580
The last place where we need to add this filter is in the admin components,

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.355
where we display our orders. Let's do this now.

00:03:53.355 --> 00:03:55.710
Inside of the admin components,

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:57.705
we need to look for our loop,

00:03:57.705 --> 00:04:00.710
our order items, and then when we output the price,

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:04.285
we can add our filter, just as we did before.

00:04:04.285 --> 00:04:07.445
Over to the browser and we can test this out.

00:04:07.445 --> 00:04:10.130
Let's start by placing a new order.

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:15.560
Send is off and head over to our admin where we may also need to log in.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.570
Add in the user details.

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.100
Scroll down to our orders,

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.185
and now we have some formatting for our price.

00:04:26.185 --> 00:04:29.165
We also have a mistake here for our size,

00:04:29.165 --> 00:04:35.305
so we just need change this to be orderItem.size, and there we go.

00:04:35.305 --> 00:04:40.010
This is now our filter all working with the currency format in.

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.610
Dollar symbol is the default when using accounting-js.

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.380
This can be easily changed,

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:46.880
however, if you prefer,

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.640
and then add some simple to follow steps if you head over to the documentation.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.530
For now though, I will see you in the next video where we're going to

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.130
add some final touches to our project.
