00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.980
Inside of our main.js where we've created our routes.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.145
This routes array is pretty manageable at the moment.

00:00:08.145 --> 00:00:10.155
We don't have too many setup.

00:00:10.155 --> 00:00:14.250
But you can see how it can really clutter up our main.js file

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.230
especially if adding more navigation guards or child components.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.735
We can take all of these routes out to the main.js and place them in there on file,

00:00:24.735 --> 00:00:28.140
which will tidy things up and make it more organized.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.885
Doing this is a pretty easy setup.

00:00:30.885 --> 00:00:34.755
First, I'm going to add a New File into the Source Folder.

00:00:34.755 --> 00:00:41.440
I'm going to add this into the root of the source and call this the routes.js,

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.715
then back over to the main.js.

00:00:44.715 --> 00:00:48.625
All we need to do is to grab the full routes array.

00:00:48.625 --> 00:00:51.825
From the closing square bracket,

00:00:51.825 --> 00:00:54.360
all the way up to our constant,

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.625
I'm going to cut this out.

00:00:56.625 --> 00:01:01.080
All to our routes, we can now paste this in since it's router.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.020
If referring to components,

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.330
we also need to import these too.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.055
We can grab these,

00:01:07.055 --> 00:01:10.970
and Visual Studio Code will make this a different color.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.435
We can see we no longer use these.

00:01:13.435 --> 00:01:17.690
I'm going to cut out all of these components which no longer needs,

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.010
place them in our routes.js.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.770
Next up, we need to export this object too.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.425
Since this is now in its own standalone file,

00:01:27.425 --> 00:01:29.765
we also need to export this file,

00:01:29.765 --> 00:01:34.020
so we can import it back in our main.js.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.280
With a matching name of routes,

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.810
which we gave it just here.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:46.330
The location as a string is dot slash and then routes.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.500
This is all we now need to do.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.760
We can now go over to our app and test if the routes is still working okay.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.935
Let's try the menu contacts,

00:01:54.935 --> 00:01:58.795
the about, and also our child routes are working too.

00:01:58.795 --> 00:02:03.155
This is something which is not necessary on small applications,

00:02:03.155 --> 00:02:08.015
but it's something which can keep a larger or a growing application more organized,

00:02:08.015 --> 00:02:11.670
and it's also something which is pretty simple to do.
