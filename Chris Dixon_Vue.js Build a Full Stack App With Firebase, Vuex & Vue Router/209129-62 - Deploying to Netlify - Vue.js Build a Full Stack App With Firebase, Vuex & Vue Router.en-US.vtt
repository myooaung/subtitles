00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:04.740
The first step towards deploying our application to

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.070
the web is to build our project for production.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.740
Remember, in the last section we inspected

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.860
our web pack config file and we looked at how

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.655
our bundle is output into a new folder called disc.

00:00:17.655 --> 00:00:21.870
We can create this bundle for production by using the build command,

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.155
which we can see if we go to the package.jason.

00:00:25.155 --> 00:00:28.665
Currently for development we are being using the subscripts.

00:00:28.665 --> 00:00:33.300
But now we can go on to move in our build scripts inside of the terminal.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.700
Let's go down to the bottom,

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.920
and inside the terminal we're going to close down our server with Command or

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.020
Control C. We can then run npm run build,

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.905
It give us a few moments to build our application for production.

00:00:48.905 --> 00:00:52.505
It will also create a new disk folder and once this is done,

00:00:52.505 --> 00:00:55.740
I will come back and see you in just a moment.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.580
Once this is finished inside of the sidebar,

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.455
when I'll have the disc folder,

00:01:03.455 --> 00:01:06.920
which will contain a production ready version of our app,

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.320
containing all of our CSS,

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.689
all of our assets such as images,

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:13.940
and also our JavaScript.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.645
These files are minified and optimized for production,

00:01:17.645 --> 00:01:19.430
along with removing things such as

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.515
any error messages and warning to siege during developments.

00:01:23.515 --> 00:01:28.355
We can now take this folder and use it to deploy to Netlify.

00:01:28.355 --> 00:01:31.480
If you head on to netlify.com,

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.150
there are lots of hosting providers out there,

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.625
but this is a really popular and easy to use one,

00:01:37.625 --> 00:01:40.520
which will get us going in just a few minutes.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.715
It also has a free option that you used to.

00:01:43.715 --> 00:01:48.185
We can quickly get our site online using a Netlify CLI,

00:01:48.185 --> 00:01:52.805
which will give us a set of commands to push our application to production.

00:01:52.805 --> 00:01:57.125
If we go back over to the terminal inside of Visual Studio Code,

00:01:57.125 --> 00:01:59.585
we can install this via npm.

00:01:59.585 --> 00:02:01.600
We're going to be installing this globally,

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.200
so if you are on a Mac,

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.995
you may need to use the pseudo keyword as a prefix.

00:02:06.995 --> 00:02:09.320
If you're Windows, this won't be necessary,

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:17.850
all we need to do is to install the Netlify-CLI with the dash g flag to make this global.

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.700
I already have this installed,

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.235
so I'm not going to go ahead and do this.

00:02:22.235 --> 00:02:23.960
But if you don't, go ahead and run

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.655
this command and then give it a few moments to install.

00:02:27.655 --> 00:02:29.630
Once this has been installed,

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.200
the first command we need to run is Netlify deploy.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.000
This may also open up in the browser where you may need to

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.330
log in or create an account if you don't already have one.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.230
Once you've signed up and verify your e-mail address,

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.670
you'll then be taken to the account area where you can create a new project.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.040
You don't need to do this inside the browser

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.245
since we are going to be doing it here inside of the terminal.

00:02:57.245 --> 00:03:03.470
You may also be asked to authorize the Netlify CLI 2 on the first use.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.600
I'm already logged in it since I've used these many times before.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.250
Back over to the terminal,

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.405
we need to answer a few simple questions and we're ready to go.

00:03:13.405 --> 00:03:16.330
The first thing we need to do is to use the arrow keys on

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.965
our keyboard to go down to create and configure a new site.

00:03:20.965 --> 00:03:23.290
I only have one team name,

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.595
so I'm going to select this.

00:03:25.595 --> 00:03:29.105
We can also enter a optional site name.

00:03:29.105 --> 00:03:36.240
I'm going to leave this empty and allow Netlify to generate a random name. Hit Enter.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.440
Next we need to tell Netlify where our build folder is

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.040
located in our projects and this is simply disc.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.785
Before we make this website available for the rest of the world to see,

00:03:51.785 --> 00:03:54.815
Netlify gives us a draft URL,

00:03:54.815 --> 00:03:57.575
which we can use to basically test our site,

00:03:57.575 --> 00:04:00.635
see if everything is working okay first.

00:04:00.635 --> 00:04:05.340
I want to copy this and open a server inside of the browser.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.230
On first glance, everything seems to work okay,

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.895
we have the homepage,

00:04:10.895 --> 00:04:12.679
we have the menu,

00:04:12.679 --> 00:04:17.410
we have our contact and also our about links below.

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.304
However, if we type out anything else on the end of our URL,

00:04:21.304 --> 00:04:26.225
if this is false slash admin or any other routes, it will not work.

00:04:26.225 --> 00:04:28.924
This is because we don't have any pages,

00:04:28.924 --> 00:04:34.040
we don't have a full search admin route to make a request and get from the server.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.770
Since we rely on the router to switch between our pages are components,

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:44.780
the solution to this one using a single page application is to tell the server we always

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:50.990
want to return the homepage regardless of any URL which is entered in the navigation bar.

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.085
This means we always get the homepage back and we can then

00:04:55.085 --> 00:04:59.605
use the router on the front-end to switch between pages.

00:04:59.605 --> 00:05:02.340
This is pretty simple to do.

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.715
If we go back to the text editor,

00:05:04.715 --> 00:05:10.715
we simply add a underscore redirect file inside of our disc directory.

00:05:10.715 --> 00:05:15.785
Open up our disc and inside the route we can create a new file,

00:05:15.785 --> 00:05:19.525
which is underscore redirect.

00:05:19.525 --> 00:05:26.845
Then all we need to do is to type a simple line of code where a forward slash and a star.

00:05:26.845 --> 00:05:30.795
We then need to tell Netlify to only always return the

00:05:30.795 --> 00:05:38.020
index.html in all cases with a server status code of 200.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.365
So give us a save.

00:05:40.365 --> 00:05:43.040
Now if we go back to the terminal,

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.590
we can again run, Netlify deploy.

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.940
The path once again is the disc folder.

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.890
We can grab our draft URL.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.485
Copy these, paste it in,

00:06:02.485 --> 00:06:04.950
all the regular links are fine.

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:08.665
This time we can type in the forward slash admin route.

00:06:08.665 --> 00:06:11.590
I will now say this is working.

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:15.080
We can just double-check by logging in.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.920
This is also working with our database too.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.970
We can see our current menu items and also the orders.

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:25.660
Once we are happy that everything is working fine

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.390
and we can finally deploy our application.

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:31.675
We can do this simply with a new command.

00:06:31.675 --> 00:06:35.465
For the final time we're going to run Netlify deploy,

00:06:35.465 --> 00:06:37.310
but this time we're going to add dash,

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:40.055
dash prod on the end for production.

00:06:40.055 --> 00:06:44.255
Meaning we now happy with our test sides and want to build this for our production.

00:06:44.255 --> 00:06:47.540
The deploy path once again is disc,

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.780
give us a few seconds to build our sites.

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:57.635
We should now see the message of deploy is live with a live URL,

00:06:57.635 --> 00:07:01.890
which we can now grab and open up inside of the browser.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.740
If you reach to this far, congratulations,

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.285
this is now your website,

00:07:08.285 --> 00:07:09.875
deploy it to production.

00:07:09.875 --> 00:07:14.430
You also have a live link which you can share with others too.
