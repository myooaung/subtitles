00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.740
For this course, there are only a few things which you will need,

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.470
and they are all free to use and download.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.750
You probably already have most of them already.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.740
First is access to a terminal.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.250
If you're using a Mac, you can use a built in terminal.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.440
To access this you can use

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.105
the spotlight search by pressing the command and space key together.

00:00:24.105 --> 00:00:26.400
Then search by typing in the terminal.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.935
If you're using Windows,

00:00:28.935 --> 00:00:31.725
you can use a program such as the PowerShell,

00:00:31.725 --> 00:00:34.395
which comes shipped with Windows.

00:00:34.395 --> 00:00:40.155
You can find this by typing in PowerShell into the Windows search bar.

00:00:40.155 --> 00:00:43.235
Don't worry if you're not familiar with the terminal.

00:00:43.235 --> 00:00:48.230
We only need a few commands and we'll do them together when we need to.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.955
You will also need a good web text editor.

00:00:51.955 --> 00:00:55.565
For this course, I'll be using the Visual Studio Code.

00:00:55.565 --> 00:00:58.235
This also has a built-in terminal,

00:00:58.235 --> 00:01:00.755
which will make things even easier for us.

00:01:00.755 --> 00:01:04.430
As we will use a terminal quite a lot during the project.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.540
But of course, feel free to choose any which you prefer.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.100
We will also need Node.js and npm installed too.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.315
These were downloaded from nodejs.org.

00:01:19.315 --> 00:01:22.020
I already have Node.js installed.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.230
If you don't, go ahead and click on

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.675
the latest version and download for your particular operating system.

00:01:28.675 --> 00:01:33.780
Downloading Node also installs the latest version of npm2,

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.480
which is a node package manager used to download JavaScript packages,

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.225
which we'll use throughout this course.

00:01:41.225 --> 00:01:44.720
Next up is the Vue CLI.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.400
If you go to github.com/vuejs/vue-cli.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.420
You can find out some more information about what the Vue CLI is.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.705
You will need to download Nodes before doing this,

00:02:00.705 --> 00:02:03.735
as Node is a requirement for the Vue CLI.

00:02:03.735 --> 00:02:07.805
The Vue CLI or command line interface,

00:02:07.805 --> 00:02:10.610
is a tool which allows us to quickly scaffold

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.365
Vue js applications with a quick terminal command.

00:02:15.365 --> 00:02:21.500
It has various templates which we can use to create apps from a single HTML page,

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.770
right fruit complex web pack setups.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.230
We'll be using a simple web pack version when a come to this episode.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.360
We will cover installing the Vue CLI soon when beginning this project.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.005
However, if you want to read through this guide to learn more about the templates,

00:02:39.005 --> 00:02:41.165
or even go ahead and install.

00:02:41.165 --> 00:02:42.875
Feel free to do this now,

00:02:42.875 --> 00:02:44.660
if not, continue on,

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.890
and we will install this soon.
