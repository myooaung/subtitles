00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:03.960
Sometimes when we create routes,

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.550
we need to take into account that paths to certain pages can also change.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.250
For example, inside of our URL,

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.940
we could go to the home routes and then have forward slash

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.510
user and then forward slash some username.

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.790
This username section will be of course different for each user.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.060
So we may want to use the same components for each logged in

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.815
user or the menu we may have some different sections.

00:00:31.815 --> 00:00:34.940
We can have forward slash menu and then for example,

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.050
we can have drinks,

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.990
or we can have food.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.940
We may want to show the same menu components,

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.255
but just skip down to different sections of our menu.

00:00:44.255 --> 00:00:48.649
However, this will be difficult because of the paths for the router,

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:50.120
as we've already learned,

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.475
needs to be an exact match.

00:00:52.475 --> 00:00:56.495
For this use case, we can use dynamic route match in,

00:00:56.495 --> 00:00:59.075
which involves telling the view router,

00:00:59.075 --> 00:01:02.360
which parts of the URL may change and we

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.235
can do this in the routes over in the main dot js.

00:01:06.235 --> 00:01:09.150
Let's head over to this file and we can set up

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.360
the dynamic segment by adding a colon followed by the name of our choice.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.545
So inside of the menu,

00:01:16.545 --> 00:01:19.870
we can add a forward slash and then use the colon to

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.260
declare that this section will be a dynamic part of the URL.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.930
By adding this, the menu components will be displayed each time

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:35.260
the URL ends with forward slash menu and then forward slash any name inside here.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:41.590
The dynamic segment can be any part of the URL too depending on the particular need.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.530
For example, we could have a dynamic section

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.125
and then forward slash and then a hard-coded section.

00:01:48.125 --> 00:01:51.925
This is useful for things such as admin sections,

00:01:51.925 --> 00:01:54.025
where we may have a forward slash,

00:01:54.025 --> 00:01:58.635
a user ID and then for example, forward slash orders.

00:01:58.635 --> 00:02:02.885
Another thing to note too, that this name which we gave the dynamic section,

00:02:02.885 --> 00:02:05.255
also acts as a variable.

00:02:05.255 --> 00:02:10.615
We can access the data inside of our components by using this variable name.

00:02:10.615 --> 00:02:14.470
So if we go over to the menu components,

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.560
menu dot view, and then scroll up to the top of

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.670
our templates just above our menu section here.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.500
Inside of the double curly braces,

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.435
we can use $ symbol route to access all of our route information.

00:02:29.435 --> 00:02:35.955
We want to access the parameters from dot params and then the variable name of items.

00:02:35.955 --> 00:02:41.010
Give this file a save and over to the browser inside of the URL.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.750
We can then access our link.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.610
So let's go for forward slash menu and then our dynamic section,

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.860
which can be any word we choose,

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.940
I'm going to add drinks hit Enter.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.000
We now see our menu components has been rendered and this is also

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.580
pulled out the URL parameters and I'll put this to the screen.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.520
This is some functionality which we don't need in our application,

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.560
so I'm going to remove this and restore the menu back to forward slash menu.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.195
But this is something really useful to know when using the view router.

00:03:14.195 --> 00:03:16.025
Also in the menu,

00:03:16.025 --> 00:03:18.820
you can change this to be forward slash menu.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.369
While you also want to subject off dynamics sections,

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:27.815
the actual paths in the router link component can also be dynamic too.

00:03:27.815 --> 00:03:33.380
For example, if we go over to the header dot view inside of our router link,

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.450
the two prompts which we did have

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:41.150
a hard coded value of forward slash menu, contact and about.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.355
We can also make these dynamic too by adding them to our view instance.

00:03:46.355 --> 00:03:49.870
So under the name we can add a data property.

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.095
We're going to return an object too.

00:03:53.095 --> 00:03:56.150
Inside here I'm going to add four data values.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.245
The first one is going to be the home link.

00:03:59.245 --> 00:04:02.670
Set this up as our forward slash string,

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.290
the menu link two,

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.245
which is forward slash menu,

00:04:08.245 --> 00:04:13.650
the contact link of forward slash

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:21.390
contact and then finally the about link at the bottom of forward slash about.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.820
We can then use these data names up in the router link,

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.060
prefixed with a colon to indicate that this is dynamic.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.215
Rather than this hard-coded string value,

00:04:33.215 --> 00:04:38.830
we can add to the colon just before and we can set this up to be home link.

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.280
Same for the menu.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.650
This is going to be menu link.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.110
We can add the colon to this and we'll do the same and just

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.560
below for our final two links, add the colon.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:57.110
This is contact link and the about section,

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.860
this is the about link.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.745
Say this, and head over to the browser and let's go to the home.

00:05:05.745 --> 00:05:08.040
You see the forward slash at the end,

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:13.580
the menu forward slash contact and finally about.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.605
This is maybe something which you will not need to use a lot.

00:05:17.605 --> 00:05:23.120
However, it is nice to know that this is available if we have a use case for it such

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:29.195
as if we need to dynamically create a URL and insert any variables into it.

00:05:29.195 --> 00:05:34.985
We can then add these to our data property and then update the URL accordingly.

00:05:34.985 --> 00:05:37.865
So this is it now for dynamic routing.

00:05:37.865 --> 00:05:39.020
In the next video,

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.110
we're going to take a look at exactly what this hash is inside of

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:48.240
the URL by taking a look at the history in hash modes which the router provides.
