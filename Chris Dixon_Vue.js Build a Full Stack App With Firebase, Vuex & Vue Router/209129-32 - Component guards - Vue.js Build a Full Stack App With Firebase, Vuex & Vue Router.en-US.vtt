00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:05.340
In the last video, we looked at global navigation guards,

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.385
which will affect the whole of our application.

00:00:08.385 --> 00:00:13.710
An alternative to this is is to only add a guard inside of a component.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.685
This way, only the components being navigated to and from will be affected by the guard.

00:00:20.685 --> 00:00:24.150
The first thing I'm going to do is to remove the global guard from

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.050
the last video inside of the main.js so,

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.350
the alert doesn't pop up for each navigation.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.740
Then I'm going to head over to the admin.view

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.565
components and start with the components folder.

00:00:38.565 --> 00:00:42.100
I'm going to add a guard inside of this components.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.415
I'm going to begin with the before route enter guard,

00:00:46.415 --> 00:00:50.120
and let's add this up just after our components.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.215
This can be added anywhere on the view instance,

00:00:53.215 --> 00:00:57.110
and the name is going to be before route sensor,

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:03.070
which again is going to take into from and also next as arguments,

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.620
add a comma to separate this from the methods animals

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.490
to add [inaudible] property just above to work with.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.530
We can return some data.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:19.170
Let's add a name, property and add your name inside of here.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.420
Before route enter is called before the route,

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.940
which when it is component is confirmed.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.320
Here I'm going to create an alert which is going to say hi to the user.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.220
We have the user's name just above inside of the dates property.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.155
I'm going to add this as a template string inside the back ticks.

00:01:38.155 --> 00:01:41.045
You can add inside our variable,

00:01:41.045 --> 00:01:43.945
which is going to be this name.

00:01:43.945 --> 00:01:47.510
Discard is inside of the admin component only.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.530
Let's give this a save and head over to the admin linked to see this action.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.000
We may also need to remove our free arguments for this to work.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
We click on any of these links,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.635
we don't see the alert.

00:01:59.635 --> 00:02:02.800
Let's try going out to the localhost slash admin routes.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.160
We don't see the alert which would just set up.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.725
Let's go to the console and take a look.

00:02:08.725 --> 00:02:14.495
We see a red error message cannot read property name of undefined.

00:02:14.495 --> 00:02:18.475
This may not be immediately obvious what the problem here is.

00:02:18.475 --> 00:02:22.450
There is in fact nothing wrong with how we setup the name property.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.715
In fact, the problem will occur if we tried to access anything from our view incidence.

00:02:27.715 --> 00:02:30.160
The reason behind this area is because the guard is

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.280
called before the component has even being created.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.080
This is why we don't have access to the data on our view incidence.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.650
If we need to add our view instance data inside of this hook,

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.825
we need to add a work around.

00:02:44.825 --> 00:02:49.085
To do this, we need to pass in a call back to the next function.

00:02:49.085 --> 00:02:54.980
We again need to add into from also next.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.545
We can pass in the next function,

00:02:57.545 --> 00:02:59.915
which is going to add a callback function,

00:02:59.915 --> 00:03:03.875
which will run once a component has been created.

00:03:03.875 --> 00:03:06.890
He says about function inside here,

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.300
which I'm going to add as a narrow function passing in VM,

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.475
which is short for view model.

00:03:13.475 --> 00:03:16.400
VM can be any name of your choice.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.130
But when using view, it is pretty traditional to

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.405
use VM as a name inside of this callback.

00:03:22.405 --> 00:03:25.880
Here we have access to the same view instance using

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.270
VM in the place where we usually use this.

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.310
Now we can grab our alert.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.165
We can bring this down into our callback function.

00:03:34.165 --> 00:03:37.415
We can then replace this with VM,

00:03:37.415 --> 00:03:39.715
and this should now work.

00:03:39.715 --> 00:03:44.375
What we're doing here is basically creating a callback function.

00:03:44.375 --> 00:03:49.465
Once the navigation is confirmed and our component has been created.

00:03:49.465 --> 00:03:51.845
Once the component is created,

00:03:51.845 --> 00:03:53.180
we then have access to

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.745
our view incidence data and we can now access is inside of this call back function.

00:03:58.745 --> 00:04:02.935
All we need to do is replace the this keyword with VM.

00:04:02.935 --> 00:04:07.785
Let's save this and head over to the browser. Let's reload.

00:04:07.785 --> 00:04:10.785
We now see the message of Hi, Chris.

00:04:10.785 --> 00:04:13.790
If you go to any other routes,

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.990
this won't work since we've only said this on the admin components.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.950
Now we have this working and we can move on to

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:27.120
the next video where we'll take a look at guardian individual routes.
