00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.300
Welcome back to this brand new section.

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.570
Here, we are going to take a dive into the Vue Router.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.180
The Vue Router will allow us to create routes,

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.135
to navigate to different parts of our application.

00:00:12.135 --> 00:00:14.400
At the moment, without the router,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.470
we just add in a components we're working on into the app.js file.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.300
We can see on the screen,

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.865
a router will allow us to switch between components for different URLs or pages.

00:00:26.865 --> 00:00:30.885
This app is built as a single page application.

00:00:30.885 --> 00:00:34.170
This is quite common for JavaScript projects.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.800
We use webpack to bundle all of our components and

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.270
dependencies all together into one main bundle file.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.570
This means when we first visits our application,

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.300
we'll request this bundle from the server.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.895
The server will usually return only the index page in all cases,

00:00:52.895 --> 00:00:56.630
and then JavaScript handles switching between the pages.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.580
All of our components inside of

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.050
the browser without time to make another request to the server.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.335
Hence the name single-page applications.

00:01:06.335 --> 00:01:11.180
This results in our app working really fast as this JavaScript is a lot

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.220
faster than a round-trip to the server to fetch a page when we need it.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.575
To get started with the Vue Router,

00:01:18.575 --> 00:01:20.375
we first need to install it.

00:01:20.375 --> 00:01:23.510
We can do this by using the CDN link,

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.225
which is available on the router.vuejs.org site.

00:01:28.225 --> 00:01:30.305
If you head on to the installation,

00:01:30.305 --> 00:01:32.955
you can grab the CDN link from here,

00:01:32.955 --> 00:01:36.245
or we can install the module using npm,

00:01:36.245 --> 00:01:38.590
and this is what we are going to be doing now.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.545
Over in the projects in Visual Studio Code,

00:01:42.545 --> 00:01:44.000
head down to the terminal.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.730
I'm going to install this with npm i,

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.245
and the package name of Vue Router.

00:01:50.245 --> 00:01:53.010
Once this has finished installing,

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.575
we can go over to the main.js,

00:01:55.575 --> 00:01:57.570
and begin to set this up.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.180
The file is helping create and import.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.195
it's pulling our node module.

00:02:02.195 --> 00:02:05.125
So we need to import the Vue Router.

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:09.365
and the package name was vue-router.

00:02:09.365 --> 00:02:15.485
Also, since we use modules or separate files which webpack bundles together,

00:02:15.485 --> 00:02:22.110
we can declare we want to use this router in all of our files by adding view.use.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.760
Inside the view.use we then passing our view router.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.135
This is available in all files,

00:02:29.135 --> 00:02:33.880
meaning we don't need to add the import statement at the top of each file.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.850
We then need to setup the new Vue Router instance,

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.200
which will take in an object.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:47.925
Just below this, we can set up our constants called Router.

00:02:47.925 --> 00:02:52.215
This up to be a new instance of Vue Router.

00:02:52.215 --> 00:02:54.670
Personal objects.

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.115
We will be adding to this object for all this section,

00:02:58.115 --> 00:02:59.825
starting in the next video,

00:02:59.825 --> 00:03:02.480
where we'll actually set up our routes.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.720
Then we can inject our router into the view instance just

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.505
blow by adding in this constant name of router.

00:03:09.505 --> 00:03:14.305
Inside the new view instance, passing our router.

00:03:14.305 --> 00:03:15.830
With this now in place,

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.705
our router is setup,

00:03:17.705 --> 00:03:21.140
and ready to add some routes to switch between components.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.630
This is what we'll get to in the next video.
