00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:07.605
I'm going to be creating this project using a view CLI to quickly create our new app.

00:00:07.605 --> 00:00:10.400
If you've not used the view CLI before,

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.820
It is a great tool to quickly scaffold out out of

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.515
application and get up and running with view project really fast.

00:00:17.515 --> 00:00:21.520
It includes everything we need to run view applications,

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.160
including it to links such as web pack,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.650
and gives us options to install other plug-ins such as bubble and Linda.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.780
If you have this already installed,

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.805
that's great and continue on.

00:00:33.805 --> 00:00:38.660
If not, you will need to run a command in the terminal to set this up.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.020
I'm going to be using the built in terminal with Visual Studio code,

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.185
and of course you can use a standalone terminal if you prefer.

00:00:47.185 --> 00:00:49.930
Head over to Visual Studio code.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.955
I already have the terminal open at the bottom.

00:00:52.955 --> 00:00:56.465
If you don't click on the Options at the top of the screen,

00:00:56.465 --> 00:00:59.960
go to terminal and then new terminal.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.839
I'm going to install a view CLI globally,

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:06.680
so it's available for all projects and using npm.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:14.280
The command which needs is npm i have install dash g flag,

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.200
so this is installed globally.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:25.080
Then the package you need is @ vue /cli gave this a few moments to install,

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.030
and then I'll see you when this is done.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.060
With the vue cli now installed we can use this to

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.435
create our new project inside of the terminal again,

00:01:35.435 --> 00:01:38.735
I am currently inside of the root user directory.

00:01:38.735 --> 00:01:42.980
I'm going to use the cd command to change into the desktop.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.650
This is where I'm going to add the project.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.895
Of course, you can use any location of your choice to stall this project.

00:01:49.895 --> 00:01:55.750
We can then initialize the project in a terminal using the command view create.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.905
Then the name of our project,

00:01:57.905 --> 00:02:01.505
which I'm going to call the pizza - planet.

00:02:01.505 --> 00:02:05.670
It entered to create our projects.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:12.800
I'm going to begin with the default bubble and yes lens, hit'' enter''.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.580
This will learn install the plugins which is required,

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.830
so once again, I will come back once this is done.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.429
With this now completed,

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:26.045
you should now have the project folder on the desktop here.

00:02:26.045 --> 00:02:29.945
I'm going to go ahead and drag this over into Visual Studio Code,

00:02:29.945 --> 00:02:31.940
which will automatically detect

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.870
the new file path photos and add this inside the terminal.

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:43.040
Meaning we don't need to change directories into this new folder and once again,

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.250
I'm going to open up the terminal since this has restarted,

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.545
we in the pizza planet folder.

00:02:48.545 --> 00:02:54.244
All we need to do now is to start off our development server using the command npm,

00:02:54.244 --> 00:02:57.620
run serve. Let's start this off.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:04.320
I'm also going to open up the browser where we can access this using our local host.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.785
We can see here our local host is running on port 8080,

00:03:10.785 --> 00:03:13.805
so I'm going to command or control click on this,

00:03:13.805 --> 00:03:17.200
then open this up inside of the browser.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.655
This is the default view we see when using view CLI and if you see this page,

00:03:22.655 --> 00:03:24.720
everything is working fine.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.590
I'm going to go into the source directory wherever vue files are stored,

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.050
and then go into the main app vue

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.365
and just do a little bit of clean-up work with this file.

00:03:35.365 --> 00:03:39.925
I'm going to remove the image and the HelloWorld components.

00:03:39.925 --> 00:03:44.920
We can also remove this Helloworld component since we'll be creating our

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.185
own and also the HelloWorld reference from our vue instance.

00:03:50.185 --> 00:03:53.230
This div inside of our template is where we can add

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.635
any content which you want to appear inside of our app.

00:03:56.635 --> 00:03:59.740
Let's begin by adding "p" elements.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.350
Then inside here we can simply say hello,

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:08.070
save this file and head over to the browser and any changes are automatically updated.

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.230
Next, I'm going to add the images to our assets folder,

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.570
so these already when we need them.

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.870
The images have been provided with this course,

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.600
and I have these available on the desktop.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.010
You can of course, use a different set of images if you prefer,

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.655
or follow along with the exact ones which I'm using.

00:04:28.655 --> 00:04:33.035
Let's open up the side bar and head over to our assets,

00:04:33.035 --> 00:04:35.075
which are inside the source.

00:04:35.075 --> 00:04:40.920
We can grab the images folder and drag this over inside here,

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.070
and all of our images are now available when we need them.

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.970
We of course need a components folder to and this is

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.425
now automatically created photos when using the vue CLI.

00:04:54.425 --> 00:04:59.510
To begin, I'm going to add some components which are going to be a single files.

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.480
Let's click on components, add a new file,

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.955
and the first one is going to be the Home.vue.

00:05:05.955 --> 00:05:12.150
The second one is going to be photo Header.vue.

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.340
We can also remove the HelloWorld example by the deleting.

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.270
Since we don't need this for our project, we have this in place.

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.290
Let's move on to the next video,

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:28.920
where we'll begin to add some content to these new components.
