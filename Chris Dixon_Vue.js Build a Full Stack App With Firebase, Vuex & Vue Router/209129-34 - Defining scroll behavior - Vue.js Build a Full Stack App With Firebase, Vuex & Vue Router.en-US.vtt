00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.695
When we all tune, we may want to preserve the scrolling position.

00:00:04.695 --> 00:00:09.240
We will ask them when revisiting a page, or alternatively,

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.025
we may want to scroll to a sub-position on the page when navigating into it,

00:00:14.025 --> 00:00:16.695
even if it is only at the top of the page.

00:00:16.695 --> 00:00:21.614
Using view router, we have full control over the scrolling behavior.

00:00:21.614 --> 00:00:25.935
This is also dependent on the router mode being set to history modes.

00:00:25.935 --> 00:00:29.895
We already have the history mode enabled in the main.js,

00:00:29.895 --> 00:00:32.205
so we can take advantage of this.

00:00:32.205 --> 00:00:35.310
The first thing to do over in the main.js,

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.735
is to add the scroll behavior function to the router instance.

00:00:39.735 --> 00:00:43.610
Let's take a look, inside of our router here,

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.500
I'm going to add the scroll behavior.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.950
Inside of the brackets or the parentheses.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.870
Just like the gods we looked at,

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.610
it takes only to and from route objects.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.535
Also an argument we pass in a cold, say position,

00:01:01.535 --> 00:01:04.070
which is the position, say by the browser

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.865
when the back or forward buttons have been used.

00:01:07.865 --> 00:01:12.050
Say position. Inside of this function,

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.345
we could define our scroll behavior.

00:01:14.345 --> 00:01:18.350
Probably the most simple way to do this is to return an object.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.765
I'm passing the x and y position,

00:01:20.765 --> 00:01:24.280
which you want to scroll to when navigating to a page.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.625
We can return our objects.

00:01:26.625 --> 00:01:32.595
We can set the exposition to be zero and then set the y to be zero too.

00:01:32.595 --> 00:01:36.425
Using this setup, each time we navigate to a route,

00:01:36.425 --> 00:01:38.990
the page will be scrolled to the very top.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.315
You see this pattern in action.

00:01:41.315 --> 00:01:44.830
Let's change the y-axis to be 200.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.790
This will load up a new page,

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.875
200 pixels from the top.

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:52.910
Let's save this and of course we need to remove

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:59.070
our free arguments so you don't get any Linton problems since we're not using those.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.920
Let's go to home. We don't have enough content on this page to scroll down.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.335
Let's try the menu and you can see we are 200 pixels from the top.

00:02:08.335 --> 00:02:14.165
Alternatively, we can pass in a CSS selector in place of coordinates.

00:02:14.165 --> 00:02:20.020
Let's go for a selector and let's open up the menu components.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.580
We can set the scroll behavior to scroll down to any one of our CSS selectors.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.125
We can choose a button,

00:02:27.125 --> 00:02:28.550
we can choose a class.

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.845
We can choose any ID or simply an elements by its name.

00:02:32.845 --> 00:02:36.690
I'm going to go for the shopping basket.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.770
Lets go for the class of baskets.

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.075
Inside of the main.js.

00:02:41.075 --> 00:02:42.950
We can keep our object.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.245
What replaces with a selector,

00:02:45.245 --> 00:02:47.060
which is going to be a string.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.530
Since this is a class,

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.430
we can target this with the dot and the name is baskets.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.020
Give us a safe. Let's go to home.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.975
Then back to our menu.

00:02:57.975 --> 00:03:02.995
Now you can see the browser has been scrolled down to the basket location.

00:03:02.995 --> 00:03:08.060
This works for any selected two just [inaudible] when using CSS.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.520
Remember we mentioned the safe position parameter which you passed in.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.315
This saves the scroll position when the browsers forward and backbones are used.

00:03:17.315 --> 00:03:19.865
Lets now take a look at how we can use this.

00:03:19.865 --> 00:03:21.710
Let's pass in our arguments once more,

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.860
which was to, from and a safe position.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.325
I'm then going to add an if statement.

00:03:29.325 --> 00:03:33.545
The if statement is going to check first if there is a saved position.

00:03:33.545 --> 00:03:35.495
If saved position is true,

00:03:35.495 --> 00:03:38.800
we're going to return the saved position.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.410
We have one available, we're going to scroll to this position.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.430
If not, we're going to add the else condition where we are simply going to return

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.750
an object where we set up the x and y position to be zero,

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.915
just like we looked at before.

00:03:52.915 --> 00:03:54.710
So to see this in action,

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:59.135
we need to go over to the browser and navigate between a few pages.

00:03:59.135 --> 00:04:04.915
So first of all, let's go to the menu and then scroll down to the very bottom.

00:04:04.915 --> 00:04:10.430
We can then use the Back button and then the Follow button to return back to the menu.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.525
I'm an opposition right at the bottom of the page.

00:04:13.525 --> 00:04:16.940
If we try this again, if we scroll up just a little bit,

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.370
just so we can see some white space in the menu.

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.660
If we try going backwards and then forwards the browser,

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.620
saved position, returns us to exactly the point where we were in the menu.

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.435
The last one I want to show you keeps the saved position,

00:04:32.435 --> 00:04:34.850
just like this one which we just looked at.

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.500
However, it works when switching between components using menu links,

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.490
rather than just using the back or forward buttons in the browser.

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.250
We can again use an if statement.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.800
But rather than the saved position,

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.505
we're going to use the two arguments and select the harsh,

00:04:53.505 --> 00:04:59.780
and this will first check if the route which we navigate into has a location hash saved.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:05.675
If it does, we're going to set the selected to be equal to the value of this hash.

00:05:05.675 --> 00:05:09.394
We can return inside the curly braces,

00:05:09.394 --> 00:05:11.860
a selector just like looked up before.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.985
On the selector we're going to add is to.harsh.

00:05:15.985 --> 00:05:21.080
We will also need to remove the unused parameters so we don't see any errors.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.480
This notion, we do need to add more content to one of the other pages.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.820
I'm going to go to the contact and just

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:33.540
simply copy all of the contents from the contact rapper.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.920
Being shoots, keep the surrounding div,

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.980
and paste this in a couple more times just to give us some

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.885
more content inside of contacts where we can scroll up and down.

00:05:43.885 --> 00:05:47.175
We close the sidebar back over in the main.

00:05:47.175 --> 00:05:50.060
We can also remove the L section here,

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.640
this file save and over to the browser.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:57.800
Now if we have the contact and menu with some content where we can scroll down to,

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.475
I'm going to scroll down to just above the flag.

00:06:01.475 --> 00:06:03.505
We have this as a reference point.

00:06:03.505 --> 00:06:05.475
Switch to the contact page.

00:06:05.475 --> 00:06:10.130
We see the browser position has been saved back to the menu.

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.570
This will keep the saved position between components.

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:16.370
It won't work if you go to the Home, for example,

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.580
or the about us because we don't have enough content.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.780
Scroll down too. But this gives you the idea of how it works anyway.

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.835
This is it now for this video.

00:06:25.835 --> 00:06:27.800
Just to wrap this up, I'm going to reinstate

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.400
the contact page just to harvest content only once.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.035
Give this to save and restore this back to normal.

00:06:35.035 --> 00:06:39.800
These are the options available to us to control the scroll behavior.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:45.060
Next, we'll refactor our routes by moving them to their own file.
