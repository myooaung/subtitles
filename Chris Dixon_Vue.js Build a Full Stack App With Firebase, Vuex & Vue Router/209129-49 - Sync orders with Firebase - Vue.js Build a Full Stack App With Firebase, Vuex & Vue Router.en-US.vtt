00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.255
While we're on the subject of keeping our menu items in sync with Firebase,

00:00:06.255 --> 00:00:08.715
we can also do the same with our orders.

00:00:08.715 --> 00:00:13.200
To begin, I'm going to head over to the Firebase config file,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.795
which is a firebase.js.

00:00:15.795 --> 00:00:19.560
We already have a database reference to our menu.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.560
We also need to do the same for our order too.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.845
I'm going to duplicate this and changed the dbOrders reference,

00:00:27.845 --> 00:00:31.075
which we are going to point to our orders collection.

00:00:31.075 --> 00:00:36.860
Remember, it is okay we don't have an object named orders yet inside the Firebase.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.170
The first time we push a new order,

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.245
it will be created for us.

00:00:41.245 --> 00:00:45.015
Then we can go over to the app.vue components.

00:00:45.015 --> 00:00:49.475
Then inside here, we also need to import this reference.

00:00:49.475 --> 00:00:51.845
We have the menu reference,

00:00:51.845 --> 00:00:56.155
so we can also grab our new orders reference.

00:00:56.155 --> 00:00:59.430
Then scrolling down inside of the creative hook,

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.230
we can duplicate this and do the same for our orders.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.975
This is going to keep in sync our orders reference,

00:01:07.975 --> 00:01:12.960
which will create in just a moment with our reference from Firebase.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.625
This set orders reference is an action we have not created,

00:01:17.625 --> 00:01:20.220
so let's go over and do this now.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.380
This is going to be similar to set menu ref,

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.510
which we created in the last video.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.075
Let's copy this from our menu.

00:01:28.075 --> 00:01:31.580
Menu is inside of the modules.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.240
Grab this from the actions and then we can go over to our

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.680
orders.Js paste this in as an action,

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.940
and all we need to do is to change any reference from our menu to be orders.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.030
The name, the orders ref,

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.880
this is simply orders,

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.460
which is the name of our state just above,

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.775
which is said to be an empty array.

00:01:57.775 --> 00:01:59.270
Remember, for this to work,

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.830
we also need to import our Firebase action and our orders reference.

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.345
We can go up to the top of the file above our states.

00:02:07.345 --> 00:02:17.020
Let's import first our Firestore action from our package, which is vuexfire.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.945
Second of all, we're going to import our dbOrdersRef,

00:02:22.945 --> 00:02:26.245
which we just created in our Firebase file.

00:02:26.245 --> 00:02:33.290
so../firebase. Just like with the menu,

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.480
this is going to add an action,

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.145
which binds our orders,

00:02:37.145 --> 00:02:41.690
which is the name of our state inside this module with all our ordersRef,

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.860
which points to our collection inside of Firebase.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.560
With this now in place, we can setup a getter just below,

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.725
which is going to pull our orders from Firebase.

00:02:51.725 --> 00:02:54.125
I'm going to call this getOrders.

00:02:54.125 --> 00:02:56.960
This is going to take in our states inside of

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.910
our function and then return our state the orders.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.450
You may begin to see a pattern here as a lot of what we are

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.185
doing is just the same as we did for the menu items.

00:03:09.185 --> 00:03:11.510
We set up a binding between local, state,

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.425
and Firebase then create a getter to grab this data,

00:03:15.425 --> 00:03:18.370
which you can use inside of our components.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:24.390
We'll use this getter in the next video to display our orders inside of the admin.
