00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:05.085
If we head back over to our main.js,

00:00:05.085 --> 00:00:08.445
where we've declared all of our routes for our application.

00:00:08.445 --> 00:00:12.900
All the routes we've created so far have used a string

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.310
to specify the path of the URL which you want to navigate to.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.045
Such as forward slash,

00:00:19.045 --> 00:00:22.965
path slash menu, path slash contacts and also about.

00:00:22.965 --> 00:00:27.460
This works perfectly fine and there is nothing wrong with using this approach.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.360
There is an alternative, however,

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.085
which may be more convenient,

00:00:31.085 --> 00:00:33.350
especially for longer paths.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.950
This alternative is to add a name to the route.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.369
We can do this inside of the routes objects,

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:43.475
or we need to do is to add the name option.

00:00:43.475 --> 00:00:49.085
Then inside here we can specify as a string and name which you want to give to this.

00:00:49.085 --> 00:00:53.749
I'm going to add to the home link and then a comma just afterwards.

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:56.135
These names are totally up to you.

00:00:56.135 --> 00:01:00.350
Just go with something which best describes the route willing to consume.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.195
We can also add this to all of our over objects too, paste this in.

00:01:06.195 --> 00:01:09.540
The second one is going to be for the menu link.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.330
The next one, this is for the contact link.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.470
Then the admin link.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.585
We can also add this to our channeled routes to,

00:01:29.585 --> 00:01:32.285
this is not just for our top-level routes.

00:01:32.285 --> 00:01:35.760
We can add this for our history link,

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:45.220
the delivery, and also for our ordering guide too.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.900
Now all we need to do is save this file.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.220
I'm going to make use of these inside of our menus,

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.585
starting with the header.view.

00:01:57.585 --> 00:01:58.880
Inside of our router,

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.760
we already have some form of name routes,

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.280
which was set up early in the section.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.055
Each one of these names are dynamically binded to our dates property.

00:02:09.055 --> 00:02:12.455
To make use of the names we just setup in a router.

00:02:12.455 --> 00:02:14.465
Inside of our quotations,

00:02:14.465 --> 00:02:17.000
we need to pass this in as an object,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.445
passing in the name where the value is the name of our link.

00:02:21.445 --> 00:02:28.820
Next, we can do the same for all menu link passing objects and set the name as a string.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.390
Then we could do the same for the contact link and also about.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.445
These also need the dynamic colon to bind this just like before.

00:02:43.445 --> 00:02:45.950
But we can now remove the date property between

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.495
those script tags since we no longer need this.

00:02:49.495 --> 00:02:54.220
Let's clean this up. Then we can go to the about.view,

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.355
where we also have a menu to these are not currently dynamic.

00:02:58.355 --> 00:03:01.015
We need to add to the colon, to bind this.

00:03:01.015 --> 00:03:07.280
We could remove this and out of objects with the name property and the name value,

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.365
which is going to be history link.

00:03:09.365 --> 00:03:12.780
The same for the ordering guide, just below.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.300
Fasten our object with the name.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.585
This was ordering guide link.

00:03:19.585 --> 00:03:26.740
The delivery at the colon, fasten our objects.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.870
This one was delivery link.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.215
This should now be all of our links taken care of.

00:03:36.215 --> 00:03:38.780
All that we need to do now is to test our links,

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.245
is still working in the browser. Let's go over.

00:03:42.245 --> 00:03:47.720
We have the home, the menu, contact, and browsers.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.550
The about link is working.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.440
Let's check this out in the header,

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.470
this just needs to be about, say this.

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.995
The about link is now working.

00:04:00.995 --> 00:04:03.230
We can test out the nested routes.

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.395
History, ordering guide and delivery.

00:04:06.395 --> 00:04:09.830
Our URL is updated with the correct URL.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.490
Even though we now referencing this by a name.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.460
This is how we can add names to our routes,

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.640
and next we will look at changing routes without needing

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.150
to click on links by using router.push.
