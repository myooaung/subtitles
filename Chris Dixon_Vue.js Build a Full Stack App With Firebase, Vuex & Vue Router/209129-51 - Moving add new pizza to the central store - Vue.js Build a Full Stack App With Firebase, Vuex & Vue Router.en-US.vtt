00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:04.875
Inside of this newPizza.view components,

00:00:04.875 --> 00:00:09.675
we use this inside of the admin to add new items to the menu.

00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:14.040
At the moment, everything works completely fine and as expected,

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.360
we directly push a new pizza objects to Firebase,

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:24.330
use dbMenuRef, and then over in at the menu.js module,

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.325
we have an action setup,

00:00:26.325 --> 00:00:32.730
which is a bindings pull in any new pizzas and then save them to our storel.

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.270
What we going to do now is just a refactor.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.135
We're going to move the functionality of adding a new pizza into our store.

00:00:42.135 --> 00:00:44.730
Inside of this menu.js,

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.725
I'm going to set this up as a new action just under setMenuRef.

00:00:49.725 --> 00:00:55.205
This will keep all of our related functionality together and more organized.

00:00:55.205 --> 00:00:59.830
First we can create this action which I'm going to call addMenuItem.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.705
This is going to be async as in the context.

00:01:03.705 --> 00:01:05.380
Then as a second argument,

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.975
we're going to pass in the pizza as the payload,

00:01:07.975 --> 00:01:12.214
which will pass when we dispatch this action from our components.

00:01:12.214 --> 00:01:15.045
We can set up the rest of the function,

00:01:15.045 --> 00:01:17.030
we can add error handling,

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.385
so we can add try and catch passing in any errors.

00:01:22.385 --> 00:01:26.800
Then from now, I'm going to add an alert inside of the back ticks,

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.070
so we can insert a variable of error,

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.405
create a new pizza,

00:01:32.405 --> 00:01:35.715
passing in our error as a variable.

00:01:35.715 --> 00:01:37.635
Inside of the try section,

00:01:37.635 --> 00:01:40.180
this again is going to be pretty simple just like with

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.420
the orders which we call our dbMenuReference.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.235
Only add method, passing in the pizza as the payload.

00:01:49.235 --> 00:01:54.190
Hope at the very top, we already importing our menu reference, so this is fine.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.680
Now we can head over to the new pizza components where we can now dispatch this action.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.440
We first need to impose our store inside VO script.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.260
The final path for our store is

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.455
dot dot slash into the store folder and then our store file,

00:02:14.455 --> 00:02:17.330
back down to our add method.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.010
I'm going to comment this out,

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.360
access our store and then we can dispatch our action.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.385
The first argument is the action name of addMenuItem.

00:02:29.385 --> 00:02:32.605
Then the second one is the payload of the pizza,

00:02:32.605 --> 00:02:36.605
which we can access with this.newPizza.

00:02:36.605 --> 00:02:42.070
All I need to do now is give this a Save and head over to the admin inside the browser.

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:47.795
We no longer using dbMenuReference so we can scroll up and also remove this too.

00:02:47.795 --> 00:02:51.150
Back over to the browser and into the admin.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.355
Currently in the database, we just have the pepperoni and margarita.

00:02:55.355 --> 00:02:56.825
Let's try one more.

00:02:56.825 --> 00:02:58.100
That's not a vegetarian.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.325
I'm just going to consider using the description and the rest of the options.

00:03:01.325 --> 00:03:03.200
Click "Add". There we go,

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.935
we have a new vegetarian pizza inside of our menu.

00:03:06.935 --> 00:03:12.860
We can also check inside of the menu components and this is also being added too.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:20.189
This is just a small refactor but it keeps all functionality together and more organized.
