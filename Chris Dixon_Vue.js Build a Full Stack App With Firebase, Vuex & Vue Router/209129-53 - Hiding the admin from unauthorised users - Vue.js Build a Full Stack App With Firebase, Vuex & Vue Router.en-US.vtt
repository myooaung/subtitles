00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.890
We're going to now do some work over in the admin components.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.735
Make these admin section look and behave exactly how we want it to.

00:00:09.735 --> 00:00:13.305
At the moment, even when a user is not logged in,

00:00:13.305 --> 00:00:18.345
we still have access to the sensitive information such as the menu items,

00:00:18.345 --> 00:00:21.480
the orders, we can still remove items,

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.455
and we can add extra pizzas even when not logged in.

00:00:25.455 --> 00:00:30.480
What we want to do is to add some conditional rendering using v-if.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.570
When a user is not logged in,

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.780
we simply only want to show the login components.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.340
When they are logged in,

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.745
we want to change it around and hide these components,

00:00:40.745 --> 00:00:44.190
leaving the remainder of the admin section.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.240
If we go ahead and sign in,

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.910
we can see by our e-mail up at the top,

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.505
that's our admin view components has access to our logged in states.

00:00:55.505 --> 00:01:02.630
It has access to this because of a getter inside of the Admin.Vue called "currentUser."

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.235
I'm going to make use of this now to hide and show the contents.

00:01:07.235 --> 00:01:13.110
Let's go and look to our admin templates and write down at the very bottom.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.720
We'll have a login component just here,

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.280
then everything above this inside of our template is sensitive information,

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.500
which we only want to display when logged in.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.830
To do this, I'm going to wrap everything else in a new section.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.245
Everything above the login.

00:01:30.245 --> 00:01:32.485
Let's scroll up to the very top,

00:01:32.485 --> 00:01:34.890
just underneath the admin wrapper,

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.199
we can create a new section,

00:01:37.199 --> 00:01:40.760
and then add some conditional rendering using v-if.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:47.160
We can check if the current user is not equal to null.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.245
Scroll down, we can now close off the rest of the section,

00:01:51.245 --> 00:01:53.970
just above our login.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.290
Now, everything apart from the login section will only show if

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.280
the user is logged in with the login component itself.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.760
We can do the opposite inside of our v-if statements.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.670
We can check if the current user is equal to null.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.230
If this is true, this means the current user is not logged in,

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.830
and then we'll render the login components,

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.930
give this a save,

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.370
and then head over to the browser.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.955
We couldn't logged in.

00:02:24.955 --> 00:02:27.520
Meaning we see all of the admin section.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.290
If we scroll down to the very bottom,

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.095
our login component is now hidden.

00:02:32.095 --> 00:02:34.305
Let's try signing out.

00:02:34.305 --> 00:02:38.025
Now, this removes all of the sensitive admin information,

00:02:38.025 --> 00:02:40.000
leaving a login form.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.860
Let's check if this is also working after we log in.

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.795
Once again, we see the admin section,

00:02:48.795 --> 00:02:50.255
and if we go to the bottom,

00:02:50.255 --> 00:02:53.180
the login component is now removed.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.630
Now we have the admin screen correctly displaying,

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.690
depending on if the user is logged in, or logged out.
