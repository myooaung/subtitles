00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.800
Welcome to this course. It's great to have you here. My name is Chris.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.300
I'm a web developer and

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.130
online course creator teaching thousands of students across the world.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.995
I have created this course to take all of you-all JavaScript skills to the next level.

00:00:16.995 --> 00:00:22.125
Here in this course, we will build a full stack application using Vue.js,

00:00:22.125 --> 00:00:25.890
one of the most popular front end frameworks available today.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.520
We will be building a pizza restaurant application

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.490
where a user can place orders from our restaurant menu.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:40.055
Also, we'll have the facility for the restaurant owner login to an admin section.

00:00:40.055 --> 00:00:44.195
This section will allow us to add or remove items from our menu,

00:00:44.195 --> 00:00:46.010
see any current orders,

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.339
and also remove orders when completed.

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:52.940
This project will use the latest Cloud Firestore from

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.060
Firebase for the back-end of our application,

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.515
which will be used to store all menu items along with any orders.

00:01:00.515 --> 00:01:04.765
We will also take advantage of Firebase for authentication too.,

00:01:04.765 --> 00:01:08.674
this will only allow authorized users into our admin section,

00:01:08.674 --> 00:01:11.630
along with certain security rules too.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.960
Also we will keep a local Vuex store in sync

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.500
with Firebase to manage our application state.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.230
This will allow us to access and manage all of

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.520
the information we need easily in one central place.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.535
You will also learn about the Vue Router,

00:01:28.535 --> 00:01:32.725
which is used to manage navigation between pages in our app.

00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:35.840
Here, you will learn many concepts such as adding

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.405
navigation guards and defining scroll behavior to name a few.

00:01:40.405 --> 00:01:43.369
We even move on to some more advanced concepts,

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.740
such as lazy loading and code splitting,

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.195
to make the application load more efficiently.

00:01:49.195 --> 00:01:53.180
The ideal student for this course will be somebody comfortable building

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.639
websites with a little JavaScript knowledge, experience of Vue.js,

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:03.730
or even another framework or library such as React will be an advantage,

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:09.740
although I will try to make things as clear as possible for people new to Vue.js.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.310
This course is ideal for students looking to see how everything

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.135
fits together in a real phone application.

00:02:17.135 --> 00:02:18.920
By the end of this course,

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.830
you'll become full building full stack applications using Vue.js and Firebase.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.220
Sign up now and I hope to see you in the course.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.500
Take your Vue skills to the next level.
