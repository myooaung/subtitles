00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.390
But moments inside of our menu section,

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.780
we can successfully add items for shopping baskets.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.175
We can also increase and decrease the quantity for each line item.

00:00:11.175 --> 00:00:15.585
As you can see here, the number is not yet formatted to a currency value,

00:00:15.585 --> 00:00:18.835
but we will do this in the next video with a filter.

00:00:18.835 --> 00:00:22.115
At the bottom, we have the text of order total,

00:00:22.115 --> 00:00:25.730
but we don't have any total price display in just yet.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.290
But this is what we're going to do in this video by setting up a computed property,

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.145
which is going to recalculate our total.

00:00:33.145 --> 00:00:37.020
Let's head over to our menu dot view components,

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.440
and now scroll down to our script.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.455
Inside of here, seems our basket is currently an array,

00:00:45.455 --> 00:00:49.520
we can use the map method to leave through all items in the basket,

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.480
it's probably price and quantity which is going to recalculate our total.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.780
Now, we can do this inside of the computed section,

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.570
just after where we map our getters,

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.570
and a comma, and I'm going to call this the total.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.185
As begin by initializing a variable called the total cost,

00:01:09.185 --> 00:01:14.200
which we can obtain very soon and so this two add initial value of zero.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.975
Then to obtain this, we're going to loop through our basket,

00:01:17.975 --> 00:01:20.585
so we can access this done basket,

00:01:20.585 --> 00:01:23.710
then we are going to use the JavaScript map method,

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.970
passing in the item variable,

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.755
which is the each item inside of our baskets.

00:01:29.755 --> 00:01:33.440
Inside here, the way we're going to grab the value,

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.635
is going to be by accessing the individual item.

00:01:36.635 --> 00:01:43.075
We need to multiply the quantity for each item by the item dot price.

00:01:43.075 --> 00:01:46.765
This will give us the total quantity for each line item,

00:01:46.765 --> 00:01:48.415
so the first one in the loop,

00:01:48.415 --> 00:01:50.785
at the moment will be the two margheritas.

00:01:50.785 --> 00:01:54.565
Then we'll have the three margheritas on the next loop.

00:01:54.565 --> 00:01:58.075
I can store this in our total cost variable,

00:01:58.075 --> 00:02:01.150
and then add to the value with plus equals.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.510
After this, we're then going to return the value of total cost.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.300
This is available when we call our computed property.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.580
We can now put the value of total,

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.410
after our order total here inside the double curly braces.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.500
Give us a save and head over to the browser.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.285
Inside of our menu,

00:02:21.285 --> 00:02:23.580
we can now add some pizzas.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.115
We now see with one of each quantity,

00:02:26.115 --> 00:02:28.565
the order total is now being updated.

00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:31.045
Let's try increasing the value.

00:02:31.045 --> 00:02:38.905
Again, and also deducting an item and this is updated with each additional item.

00:02:38.905 --> 00:02:42.619
Now our total basket cost is now displaying.

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:45.245
In the next video, I'm going to look at how we can add

00:02:45.245 --> 00:02:50.910
a global filter to the price so it displays in a currency format.
