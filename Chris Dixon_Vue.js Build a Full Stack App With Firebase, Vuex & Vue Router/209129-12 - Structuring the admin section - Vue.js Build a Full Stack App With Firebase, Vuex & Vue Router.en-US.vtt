00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:05.325
Welcome back, the Admin component is going to be a large part

00:00:05.325 --> 00:00:09.510
of this application with quite a bit of functionality to work through.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.215
To begin, we protect the page with the login form,

00:00:13.215 --> 00:00:15.780
as we can see here on the final version.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.455
Only authorized users can see the admin section.

00:00:19.455 --> 00:00:21.480
If we sign in,

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.525
the rest of the admin, then becomes visible.

00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:30.045
At the top we have the current logged in user and also a logo bottom,

00:00:30.045 --> 00:00:32.805
followed by a new pizza section,

00:00:32.805 --> 00:00:38.745
and also its own components to allow the logged in user to add new pizzas to the menu,

00:00:38.745 --> 00:00:42.590
and below we can see all items which are currently on the menu,

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.650
and again, we can remove items from our menu and also a database to.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.035
Down at the bottom we have a list of current orders,

00:00:51.035 --> 00:00:54.439
and these can also be deleted when completed.

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:59.945
We begin again my creating its own component called the Admin W,

00:00:59.945 --> 00:01:02.690
and then we can add some basic structure.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.085
Over to our side bar into the components,

00:01:07.085 --> 00:01:12.740
the unmanned w. Inside here,

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.470
we can add our templates where we're going to add

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.805
a div as a wrapper with the class of admin.

00:01:19.805 --> 00:01:26.480
On this call wrapper. This will be the main wrapper for our admin.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.330
This is going to have inside Free different divs.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.275
The first one is going to be for the current user,

00:01:32.275 --> 00:01:34.730
this is going to be its own components.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.920
We're going to have the menu wrapper,

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.700
and then down at the bottom, the orders wrapper.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.015
Let's add these divs in now.

00:01:42.015 --> 00:01:49.175
The first one is going to be a div with the class of current user wrapper.

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:52.190
After this will create a new div,

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.735
which is also going to have the class of menu wrapper,

00:01:56.735 --> 00:02:00.230
and the last one is going to be the orders wrapper,

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.360
which will sit down at the bottom.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.500
We need to add our script just below this,

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.040
we give our components a name.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.220
The export default.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.395
We'll add the component name,

00:02:15.395 --> 00:02:17.995
and we are going to call mine, the admin.

00:02:17.995 --> 00:02:21.830
Save this file, and we can see this inside of the browser.

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.860
We can add this over in the app w. First of all,

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.450
we can import this.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.625
I'm going to call this admin,

00:02:29.625 --> 00:02:36.220
and this is from the file path of dot slash Components, and then the admin.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.570
We also need to register this components down in the view instance.

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.310
This is available to use inside of the templates.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.450
Go up to the templates.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.555
We don't need this menu inside here anymore.

00:02:50.555 --> 00:02:53.190
I'm going to change this to be admin.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.565
Back over to the admin, templates.

00:02:57.565 --> 00:03:01.235
Right at the very top we have this current user wrapper,

00:03:01.235 --> 00:03:05.015
which I'm going to come back to later when we have users registered.

00:03:05.015 --> 00:03:10.745
For now we can move down to the menu wrapper just below and create our table.

00:03:10.745 --> 00:03:15.700
That gives us a level three heading with the title of Menu.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.230
Below this, we can construct our table.

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:25.040
Let's add the table head at the very top with the first table row.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.220
This table row is going to have two headings.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.934
If we go to the final version,

00:03:30.934 --> 00:03:36.965
these two headings are going to be for the item and also the text off remove from item.

00:03:36.965 --> 00:03:41.080
We can add these in, inside of the TH tags,

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.555
the item, and then just below this,

00:03:44.555 --> 00:03:47.820
we can also add remove from menu.

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.845
Below the table head.

00:03:51.845 --> 00:03:56.445
We can then add the table body out in a row,

00:03:56.445 --> 00:04:01.385
and this is going to be for our Pizza name and also the potential to remove.

00:04:01.385 --> 00:04:06.670
The first cell inside of the table data is going to be for the pizza name.

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.830
I'm going to add Margarita inside here.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.800
This will be read from a database later on.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.390
But for now we can just study hard coded value followed by a button.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:22.535
This button is going to be to remove the menu item from the database.

00:04:22.535 --> 00:04:29.864
Someone give this type of button a class of btn_reds,

00:04:29.864 --> 00:04:31.730
and then for the cross,

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.590
we use the HTML code,

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.530
which is the ampersand times,

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.515
and then the semicolon.

00:04:38.515 --> 00:04:41.610
Save this file and then over to the browser,

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.815
we have a menu components but not used over in the App.

00:04:45.815 --> 00:04:48.475
Select just comment this out.

00:04:48.475 --> 00:04:50.760
While view instance.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.805
We can also comment out the impulse.

00:04:52.805 --> 00:04:59.200
Now, I'm see a very basic table with our menu items down at the bottom.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.625
The table is now in place,

00:05:01.625 --> 00:05:06.049
and we will come back to this later on to loop through all of our menu items,

00:05:06.049 --> 00:05:09.265
just like we have done inside of the menu components.

00:05:09.265 --> 00:05:12.380
I will see you now in the next video where we'll stick with

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:17.160
our admin components and begin to work with the current orders.
