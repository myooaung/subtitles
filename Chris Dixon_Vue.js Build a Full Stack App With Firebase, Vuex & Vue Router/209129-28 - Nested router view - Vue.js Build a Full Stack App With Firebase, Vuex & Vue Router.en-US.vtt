00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.420
As we discovered in the last video when we click on the About Us link inside of

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.540
our menu we see only the empty About

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.920
Us component and none of the child components are displayed.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.820
This makes sense because this is the parent component,

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.780
and we want to have control over how the child routes are displayed.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.450
To switch between the child routes,

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.890
we need to go over to the about components and then do two things.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.270
First, we need to add some menu links to switch between the child components.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.065
Then to actually display these components,

00:00:36.065 --> 00:00:41.060
the about component will also need its own router view component too,

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.385
which we can add underneath the menu.

00:00:43.385 --> 00:00:45.665
Let's start up inside of our div,

00:00:45.665 --> 00:00:47.120
inside the main templates.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.180
We want to begin with a level three heading with a tilde on either side.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.485
Then the text of,

00:00:54.485 --> 00:00:59.684
"Click on the links below for more info."

00:00:59.684 --> 00:01:05.165
The navigation tags, which is going to nest inside an on order list.

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:08.345
This on order list is going to contain our links.

00:01:08.345 --> 00:01:10.805
For this, instead of the list items,

00:01:10.805 --> 00:01:12.845
we'll use the router link,

00:01:12.845 --> 00:01:15.795
making sure it closes off just below.

00:01:15.795 --> 00:01:17.455
Inside the opening tag,

00:01:17.455 --> 00:01:19.105
we can add our two prop,

00:01:19.105 --> 00:01:22.980
and its going to link to the forward-slash history route.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.785
We can add our tag which is going to be a list item,

00:01:26.785 --> 00:01:29.410
and then nested inside a link.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.580
We don't need the href since the view router is going to handle our routing.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.600
Instead, we'll just add a class which is going to be nav link.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:46.095
The text inside of our history and this is our first child routes.

00:01:46.095 --> 00:01:47.880
I'm going to copy this.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.980
Remember we had three links.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.050
The second one is going to be for the ordering guide.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.405
This is going to link to the ordering guide.

00:01:56.405 --> 00:01:59.620
Then the text of ordering guide too.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.175
Everything else is fine.

00:02:03.175 --> 00:02:07.400
The third and final link is going to be for delivery.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.655
Change the text and also the two prop,

00:02:12.655 --> 00:02:18.465
save this file and let's click on the About Us link on the forward-slush about routes.

00:02:18.465 --> 00:02:22.045
We now see our level three heading and our menu links below.

00:02:22.045 --> 00:02:23.890
The styling needs a bit of work too,

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.525
but we'll come back to this.

00:02:25.525 --> 00:02:29.050
If we click on the links of history, ordering guide,

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.290
and delivery, we see the URL is changed up at the top two.

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.410
These links are changing the URL,

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.425
but we don't see any components displaying just yet.

00:02:38.425 --> 00:02:40.180
To see them, as we mentioned before,

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.710
we also need to add a router view to show the selected link just below the menu.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.865
Just after our nav,

00:02:47.865 --> 00:02:51.165
we can add inside a router view.

00:02:51.165 --> 00:02:55.845
Close this off. Save this. There we go.

00:02:55.845 --> 00:02:57.710
There's our delivering info,

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:02.185
the ordering guide, and the history components.

00:03:02.185 --> 00:03:05.795
Finally, we can finish this off by adding a little style in.

00:03:05.795 --> 00:03:09.680
First, we can center the level three heading up at the top.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.595
Let's go back to the About.vue.

00:03:12.595 --> 00:03:16.085
Underneath the script we can add the style tags,

00:03:16.085 --> 00:03:18.565
tag is the h3.

00:03:18.565 --> 00:03:24.655
The text line is going to be center and this now pushes this over into the middle.

00:03:24.655 --> 00:03:27.405
Also, the links need some work too.

00:03:27.405 --> 00:03:31.820
Rather than repeat the styling for these links and also the main header,

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.325
I'm going to add these as global styles.

00:03:34.325 --> 00:03:39.230
I'm going to place these in the App.vue without the scoped keyword.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.655
This is just my personal choice to add them here in this file.

00:03:43.655 --> 00:03:48.275
It will also work in any of our file too without the scope tag.

00:03:48.275 --> 00:03:51.445
Let's start with the body.

00:03:51.445 --> 00:03:57.615
I'm going to set up the font firmly of Crimson text.

00:03:57.615 --> 00:04:01.230
With a plain setit fallback.

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.905
The margin can be reset to zero.

00:04:04.905 --> 00:04:10.205
Also, the font size of the body to be 1.5em.

00:04:10.205 --> 00:04:12.320
Next up the links.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.740
The text-decoration to be none.

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:22.740
The color we're going to inherit underneath this,

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.845
we can target the on order list.

00:04:24.845 --> 00:04:28.820
I'm going to set the display type to make use of the flexbox,

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.840
so we can justify the contents in to the center.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.060
We can reset any margin to be zero.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.690
Also, some padding for our on order list of

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.860
10 pixels on the top and bottom and zero on the left and right.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.265
A background color.

00:04:48.265 --> 00:04:52.480
I'm going to use the hash value of f1e6da.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.485
We also need to remove the bullets from our list items.

00:04:58.485 --> 00:05:02.890
We can do this with the list-style by setting this to be none.

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.955
Save this. Over to the browser.

00:05:05.955 --> 00:05:09.640
We also need to add some spacing in-between these links.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.640
Here we used a tilde inside of a span element.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.590
I'm going to add some margin around

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:19.350
this and also use the same tilde icon and just below too.

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:24.510
Let's go back to the About.vue and open inside of our template.

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:28.515
Just after each router link, we can add a span,

00:05:28.515 --> 00:05:32.175
the tilde icon, and copy this,

00:05:32.175 --> 00:05:35.355
paste this just after our ordering guide.

00:05:35.355 --> 00:05:39.465
I'm working at these as global styles back in the App.vue.

00:05:39.465 --> 00:05:41.880
Just after our list item,

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.130
we can tag the span and set the margin of

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:51.235
zero on the top and bottom and five pixels on the left and right.

00:05:51.235 --> 00:05:54.600
Over to the browser. There we go.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.960
There is still small styling to add to

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.595
our project but we will come back to this later in the course.

00:06:00.595 --> 00:06:03.160
With our nested routes now working,

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:08.190
I will see you next time where we will cover using name routes.
