1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,700
So next, we're going to talk through some example scenarios

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,410
to see how well you've absorbed the material that we have

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,030
presented within this module.

4
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:09,210
And then in the next clip,

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,090
we're going to be walking through the answers to these scenarios.

6
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,240
So, here is our first scenario.

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,330
We have Elaine, and Elaine has launched a site that

8
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:19,990
offers daily tutorials for developers.

9
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:24,340
And she uses S3 to store the assets that are needed per tutorial.

10
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:28,670
Now these assets are very popular within the first week that the tutorial is

11
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,830
launched, but then, you know what, after this initial week,

12
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,970
these assets are rarely accessed.

13
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:39,640
So, how could Elaine reduce her S3 costs while maintaining durability?

14
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:45,050
Okay, next we have Esteban, and Esteban works for a social networking company,

15
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:48,890
and they are moving to AWS. Now as a part of this transition,

16
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:52,340
they have about 2 PB of userâ€‘generated content that

17
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,640
they need to migrate into the cloud.

18
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,900
Now he's trying to determine if there is a faster

19
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,910
approach than uploading over the internet,

20
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,680
because that is just going to take too long.

21
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,560
So in this case,

22
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:06,540
would there be another approach you would recommend for Esteban's company?

23
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,800
Okay, finally,

24
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:12,840
we have Emily, and Emily works for a company that produces a messaging app.

25
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,540
And she's looking for a shared file system that'll connect to eight different

26
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:21,900
Linux EC2 instances. Now the file system would need to support 1 PB of data,

27
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:29,000
so what approach would you recommend for Emily? Okay, we're going to run through the answers to these in the next clip.
