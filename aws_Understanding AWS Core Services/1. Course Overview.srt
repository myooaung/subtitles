Hello everyone.

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,490
My name is David Tucker, and welcome to the course, Understanding AWS Core

3
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:15,350
Services. I'm a cloud consultant that helps organizations plan, build, and

4
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:19,760
implement custom software solutions in the cloud. I have over 15 years of

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,550
experience in software architecture and development,

6
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:26,370
and during that time, few things have fundamentally changed computing

7
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:30,960
like the cloud. AWS certifications add value for both technical and

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,110
nontechnical resources in today's digital world.

9
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,420
In this course,

10
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,940
I will walk you through the services from AWS that you will need to know

11
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,920
before you take the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam.

12
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,620
First,

13
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,220
I will review the ways that you interact with AWS services. And

14
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,590
next, I will review the major categories,

15
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:52,780
including compute, networking and content delivery,

16
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:56,030
file storage, databases, app integration, and

17
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,970
management and governance services.

18
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:02,320
And finally, I will provide an approach for preparing for the certification exam.

19
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,450
When you finish this course,

20
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:07,230
you will have a clear understanding of these core services, whether you want

21
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:20,000
to take the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam or just have a better understanding of the services that AWS provides.
