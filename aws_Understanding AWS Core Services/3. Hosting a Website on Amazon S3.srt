1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,160
So next, we're going to walk through the process of

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,680
hosting a static website on Amazon S3.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,760
And so over the course of this demo, here's what we're going to be doing.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,690
First,

5
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:15,130
we're going to be creating a new S3 bucket from within the AWS console,

6
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,890
and then we'll be uploading objects to that S3 bucket.

7
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:23,690
After that, we'll be accessing objects from the S3 bucket using a URL.

8
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:28,540
And finally, we will be configuring a bucket for website hosting.

9
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:32,840
So now I've logged into the console and I'm now going to navigate to S3.

10
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,940
I'm going to choose to search for it,

11
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,190
and then we'll select S3 to go to the S3 console.

12
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:38,860
And from here,

13
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,060
the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to create a

14
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:44,540
bucket, so we'll hit Create bucket.

15
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,820
Now the first thing we need to do is give the bucket a name.

16
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,940
Now you'll need to choose your own unique name. S3

17
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:54,040
buckets do need to have unique names, even across accounts.

18
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,640
So now that I've entered in a bucket name and I have the region selected,

19
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,650
I can now hit Next. Now from here, we have additional

20
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:03,770
options that we can configure for our bucket,

21
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:06,540
including versioning, but I'm going to choose to not set

22
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,740
any of these values. We can now hit Next.

23
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:13,640
Now from here, we have to specifically enable public access.

24
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:18,420
Now by default, AWS is trying to block all public access.

25
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,210
Now this is because organizations that put sensitive data into

26
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:25,260
S3, AWS wants to be sure they don't accidentally enable public

27
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,990
access to one or more files.

28
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:29,100
So by default, now, they're telling everyone that the

29
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,240
buckets need to block public access.

30
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,940
But in this case, because we do want to allow public access into our bucket,

31
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,600
we're going to choose to deselect this.

32
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,260
Now it's important to note, this doesn't change the permissions

33
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,990
for the data you put into your bucket yet, it just gives you

34
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:45,880
the option to make items public.

35
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,840
So I'll go ahead and hit here that I acknowledge this, and then we'll hit Next.

36
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,350
Once we see the information here for our bucket and everything looks correct,

37
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:57,340
we can now hit Create.

38
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,960
So now that we've created our bucket,

39
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,140
we can scroll to it and we can now click on our bucket. Now from within here,

40
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,370
we can now go to upload files, so now I'll hit Upload.

41
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:12,710
Now we need to select the files, and I'll go in and select the files that

42
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:16,240
are included within the exercise files for this module.

43
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,220
We'll go ahead and select both of them, and now we need to go

44
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,690
through the wizard for uploading files.

45
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,470
Now, we can go ahead and hit Next here.

46
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,260
Now the first step is to set permissions,

47
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,850
and at this point we're not going to change any of the

48
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:32,940
permissions, so we can go ahead now and hit Next.

49
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,240
Now, we have the opportunity to go in and set the

50
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,390
properties for those uploaded files.

51
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,440
You'll see first, we can go in and set the storage class,

52
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,620
and we can see here the different storage classes that we have discussed for

53
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,830
S3. We'll choose to leave it at S3 Standard for now. But now,

54
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:52,040
once we go down to Encryption, I'm going to select Amazon S3 master‑key.

55
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,970
This will help us make sure that the data is encrypted at rest

56
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:57,140
that we're uploading into the S3 bucket.

57
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,040
We can now hit Next.

58
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,690
Now once we look at the data here, if everything looks correct,

59
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:04,040
we can now hit Upload.

60
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,270
Now we have two objects that have been uploaded into our bucket.

61
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,770
Now I'm going to look at the ps‑logo file.

62
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,250
Now we can see here when we click on it,

63
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,160
it presents us with an object URL. As I mentioned,

64
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,440
everything within S3 you can access via a URL. So if I open

65
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,410
up a new tab and I try to go to that URL, we'll see here that

66
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,940
we get an AccessDenied message.

67
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:28,240
That's because we haven't actually changed the permissions on our object yet.

68
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,340
So I'm going to go back to the console,

69
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:35,090
we'll choose to scroll down here and go to Permissions. From within permissions,

70
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:38,040
we're going to scroll down to where it says Public access.

71
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,130
We'll then click on Everyone and we will say Read object.

72
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,910
So this will give everyone read access to this

73
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,140
particular object from within our bucket.

74
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:51,410
Now, I'll hit Save. Once this is in place, I should now be able to go

75
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:56,030
back to the tab we were on previously and reload. When I do, we should

76
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,830
now be able to see the Pluralsight logo that was included within the

77
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:01,040
files that were uploaded into the bucket.

78
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,070
Now we'll navigate back to the Management Console tab. Now from within

79
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:09,470
here, we're going to go back to our bucket. Now from within the bucket,

80
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:12,490
we're now going to go under Properties.

81
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:16,200
We're now going to enable the option for static website hosting, so

82
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,920
I'll click on Static website hosting. Now from here,

83
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,840
we're going to say that we do want to use this bucket to host a website.

84
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,960
Now the first thing we need to do is we need to enter the

85
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,430
name for the index document for our site,

86
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:32,590
which in this case will be index.html. Now we also can choose

87
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:35,010
to go in and enter a custom error document.

88
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:37,880
This document will be shown every time the bucket needs to

89
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,470
throw an error, for example a 404 error,

90
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,410
which means they're trying to access a file that

91
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,010
isn't included within the bucket.

92
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,080
In that case, it would serve this error document,

93
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,840
but we're not going to enter an error document for now.

94
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,240
We also have the option to go in and use the redirect rules.

95
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,660
So, for example, if we wanted to redirect someone from index.htm to index.html,

96
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,460
we could define those rules here, but we also aren't going to add

97
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:04,860
any of those. We can now hit Save. Now once we do,

98
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,780
we can see here that Bucket hosting is enabled.

99
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,030
So if we click back on Static website hosting,

100
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:14,290
we can see here that it gives us a unique URL. So we're going to click

101
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:17,460
on this link to launch our site, but if you remember,

102
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,990
we haven't yet set any permissions for our index.html file.

103
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:26,240
So when we click on this, we should see, indeed, we do have a Forbidden message.

104
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,450
So now let's navigate back into the console, let's go back to our

105
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:34,640
bucket, and let's go to our index.html file.

106
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,820
Now from within here,

107
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:40,270
we should be able to go down to Permissions, we can go in for everyone,

108
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:43,830
and we can choose to give everyone read access to the object, and then

109
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,560
hit Save. Now once we have that in place,

110
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,440
we should be able to go back to the tab where we had

111
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,010
loaded in the specific URL that was given for static

112
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:55,340
website hosting, and now reload this.

113
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,220
And when we do,

114
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:00,970
we can see that we have indeed loaded our index.html file and we're

115
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:04,640
pulling in both the index.html file, as well as the Pluralsight logo

116
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,180
file that we uploaded within the bucket.

117
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:11,340
So over the course of this clip, you've been able to create a bucket,

118
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,640
upload files into that bucket,

119
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:22,000
configure access for the objects within the bucket, and then ultimately enable static website hosting for the contents of that bucket.
