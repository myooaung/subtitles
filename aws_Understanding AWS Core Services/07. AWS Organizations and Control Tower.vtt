00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.580
So next, we're going to revisit a topic that we have

2
00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.650
already discussed called AWS Organizations.

3
00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.480
But we're bringing it back because we want to talk about another management

4
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.860
service, and that is Control Tower. So quickly, revisiting AWS Organizations. So

5
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.630
it allows companies to manage multiple accounts under a single master account,

6
00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.720
and it provides organizations with the ability to leverage a feature called

7
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.100
consolidated billing where it'll roll up all those child accounts under the

8
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.440
parent account for the billing.

9
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.370
And, it enables organizations to centralize logging and

10
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:35.080
security standards across accounts.

11
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.460
But really up to this point,

12
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.960
we've talked about what you can do with AWS Organizations,

13
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.040
but we haven't necessarily talked about what you should do with it.

14
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.360
And so, AWS collected a lot of the best practices for this

15
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.240
multi‑account setup under a service called Control Tower.

16
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.690
And so Control Tower is a service that creates this

17
00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.670
multi‑account environment based on recommended best practices

18
00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.550
in areas like operational efficiency, security, and governance.

19
00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.470
So let's look at Control Tower at a little bit of a

20
00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.750
deeper level. So first of all,

21
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.920
it does things like centralizing users across all AWS accounts,

22
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.580
and this allows us to minimize effort of creating

23
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.570
users across multiple accounts.

24
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.740
And, it provides a way to create new AWS accounts based on templates.

25
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.140
So maybe you want to be sure that every AWS account that is created within your

26
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.140
finance department has specific settings included with it.

27
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.870
It also includes this feature called guardrails,

28
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.540
and this helps make sure that there are specific protections

29
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.460
for accounts underneath your master account.

30
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.720
So let's say, for example,

31
00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.480
you want to be sure that CloudTrail doesn't get turned

32
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.870
off in any of the child accounts.

33
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:43.010
Well,

34
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.130
that is an example guardrail that can be included to make

35
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.760
sure that they stay in compliance with what you want each of

36
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.740
your child accounts to be doing.

37
00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:59.000
And it also includes a dashboard so that you can gain operational insights from a single view across all of your accounts.
