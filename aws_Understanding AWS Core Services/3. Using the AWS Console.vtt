00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:05.140
So next, we're going to look at how we leverage the AWS Console,

2
00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.650
and we're specifically looking at the browser version of this

3
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.040
and not the mobile app version of the console.

4
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.780
So here, over the course of this demo, here's what we're going to be doing.

5
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.440
We're first going to be accessing the AWS Console in the browser,

6
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.310
and then we'll be talking about the login

7
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.590
differences between root and IAM users.

8
00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.890
We'll be introducing this concept here within this demo.

9
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.160
Then, we'll look at how we select a specific region,

10
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.670
and then we will be reviewing the list of services that

11
00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.640
are supported within the AWS Console.

12
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.840
Now, I'm here at the Root user sign in for the AWS Console.

13
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.540
Now, it's important to note that the root user is a special kind of user.

14
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.240
It was the user that was created when you initially created the AWS account,

15
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.610
and it has special permissions that no other account has,

16
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.740
including things like selecting a support plan and deleting the account.

17
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.440
Now in this case, if you're here,

18
00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.840
you need to be sure that you're using the root user to log in.

19
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.750
Now, there is another type of user that can access the AWS Console,

20
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.480
and that is an IAM user, and we'll talk more about IAM later within this path.

21
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.720
However, in this case,

22
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.330
I'm going to be able to log in, I'm going to take my password, I'll sign in,

23
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.740
and then here I have it currently set up for multi‑factor authentication,

24
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.400
and that means I'm going to have to enter in a special code in addition to

25
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:31.300
my password to be able to log in. So I'll enter in the code, and now I'm

26
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.310
logged in to the AWS Console. Now at a high level, there's a few things I

27
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.440
want to point out.

28
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.040
One of them is here, you can clearly see my user information,

29
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.280
and if I pull down on this,

30
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.700
I'll be able to go in and look at the high‑level information for this account,

31
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.090
including the account, the organization,

32
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.180
which we've talked some about, as well as the billing dashboard.

33
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.550
I can see all of my invoices,

34
00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.740
and I can go look at my security credentials if I need to change those.

35
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:56.980
In addition to this,

36
00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:02.540
we also have a drop‑down next to that for selecting the AWS region.

37
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.180
So here, I've currently selected N. Virginia,

38
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.830
which is us‑east‑1, but we can see that there are many different

39
00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.370
regions, and we've already talked about the AWS global infrastructure

40
00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.340
and the different regions that are supported.

41
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.990
But in this case,

42
00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.650
if I were to now switch over and select us‑east‑2, any of the resources

43
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.360
that I launched here within the console would be launched within the Ohio

44
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.240
region as opposed to the N. Virginia region.

45
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.150
Now, for most all services, this matters.

46
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.610
There are a few services that don't, and we'll talk

47
00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.340
about those in just a minute.

48
00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.960
Now, the next thing I want to do is I want to look at the Services

49
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:41.180
drop‑down. From here, you can see a list of all AWS services,

50
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.520
and they're currently grouped according to category.

51
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.100
For example, you can see the Compute category,

52
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.280
which has EC2 and Lightsail, and ECR, and ECS, and EKS,

53
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.040
and several more, and we'll talk more about those in an upcoming module.

54
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.860
But this gives us a high level way of looking at the

55
00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.840
services based on their category.

56
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.570
However, we can also choose to go in and search for a service.

57
00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.220
For example, if I wanted to look at a service like Lambda,

58
00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.770
I could simply type that in, and you can see a list here

59
00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.320
of services that include Lambda. Now, in this case,

60
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.950
we would be looking here just for Lambda. And if we click on it,

61
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.990
we would go into the console for this specific service.

62
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.100
Now, next,

63
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.340
we can also go back to the home page and there also is a search box that

64
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.520
is included here within the home page of the console.

65
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.690
And so we could go in here and we could type in a service like rds,

66
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.840
which is Relational Database Service.

67
00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:33.520
Now, in this case,

68
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.390
we also can look at recent services that we have

69
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:37.870
launched here within the console,

70
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.280
which include Lambda, and Trusted Adviser, and Cost Explorer.

71
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.570
And so,

72
00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.400
if you're working within a small handful of services, this can be a

73
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.130
very quick way to simply click on these and actually launch into those

74
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.970
specific services. Now, I'm going to search for a service called Route

75
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.840
53, and I'll click on Route 53.

76
00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.980
Now,

77
00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.630
one of the things that I want to point out here as we go into this

78
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:06.330
service, and this is AWS' DNS service, is that this is one of the few

79
00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.920
services where the region doesn't matter.

80
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.140
You'll notice here that it says global as opposed to region.

81
00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.880
And it says here that Route 53 does not require region selection.

82
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.470
So you can note when you're working with services whether

83
00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.460
or not they are global services or whether or not they are

84
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:23.740
region‑specific services.

85
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.490
So now I'll navigate back to the home page of the console. And the

86
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.310
last thing that I want to point out is we can go here within our

87
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.640
user and go to Security Credentials.

88
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.740
So here, we can go in as the root user, and we can update our password.

89
00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.900
You can turn on multi‑factor authentication, which we'll do later

90
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.140
within this path. You also can configure access keys, and access

91
00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:51.000
keys will be where we pick up our next demo when we're looking at leveraging the SDK and the CLI.
