1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,070
So next, we're going to talk about how you actually get

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:07,470
large amounts of data onto the AWS cloud,

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,680
even if you don't want to put it over the public internet. And one of the

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,930
ways that we can do that is by leveraging the data transfer services that are

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:19,220
provided with AWS. Now the first is AWS Snowball,

6
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,090
and this is a service where you want to physically

7
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,340
migrate petabytes of data onto the cloud.

8
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,720
But if that's not enough,

9
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,790
there's even another service called AWS Snowmobile, and this is a service if you

10
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:34,760
physically want to migrate exabytes of data onto the cloud.

11
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,140
So let's compare these two options.

12
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,040
First of all, we have AWS Snowball,

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,420
and it is designed for large‑scale data transfer, and as we mentioned,

14
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,640
it supports petabyte scale in terms of data.

15
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,320
Now in this case,

16
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,310
it is going to be a physical device that is delivered

17
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,540
by AWS to your office location,

18
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,860
and you can actually connect this to your network and then upload your

19
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,070
data from within your network. Now when you return it,

20
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:03,170
it's going to be returned by a local carrier back to

21
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:08,440
AWS, and then when they get the device, they're going to load your data into S3.

22
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,690
And so that's how AWS Snowball works.

23
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:14,300
Now, AWS Snowmobile is a little bit more intense.

24
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,640
First of all, it is also designed for large‑scale data transfer,

25
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,380
but in this case it supports exabyte scale.

26
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,790
Now it is a ruggedized shipping container,

27
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:25,340
and it is going to be delivered to your location.

28
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:28,710
Yes, a shipping container like one that's pulled by a tractor‑trailer truck.

29
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,910
This is rather large, and this is for some more extreme type scenarios.

30
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:35,520
Now, AWS will be there to set up a connection from your

31
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,590
network to that shipping container,

32
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,610
and then it actually loads your data onto the Snowmobile, and then AWS

33
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,020
will work to be sure your data is then loaded into S3 when that

34
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:53,000
shipping container is received back at AWS and they can do multiple trips to get, again, exabytes of data.
