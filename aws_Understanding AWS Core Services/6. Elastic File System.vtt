00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.590
So next, we're going to talk about Elastic File System, or EFS.

2
00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:06.860
Now in a previous clip,

3
00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.520
we talked about Elastic Block Store, or EBS, as one approach

4
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.090
for attaching storage to an EC2 instance.

5
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.040
And here, this is going to be the other option.

6
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.180
So here, for EFS, first of all,

7
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.740
it's important to note that it is a fully managed NFS file system,

8
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.350
and it is designed specifically for Linux workloads.

9
00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.110
Now, similar to EBS, it supports up to a petabyte scale.

10
00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.740
So we're talking here about petabytes of data.

11
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.570
It also can store data across multiple availability zones, so

12
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.980
you get some of that durability by default.

13
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.520
Now it provides two different storage classes,

14
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.470
the first being Standard and the second being Infrequentâ€‘Access.

15
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.660
And it can provide configurable lifecycle data rules so you can

16
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.270
transition between those storage classes.

17
00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.050
Now let's quickly take a look at an example of how we could

18
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.360
leverage Elastic File System, or EFS.

19
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.360
So here you can see an example where we have two different EC2 instances,

20
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.370
one in availability zone A and one in availability zone B.

21
00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:07.160
And in this case,

22
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.040
Elastic File System is working across both of those availability zones

23
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.040
and has a mount point within each availability zone.

24
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.190
So unlike EBS where we're targeting attaching a volume to a single EC2 instance,

25
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.110
Elastic File System has an ability to be a network file system that you

26
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.160
can attach to multiple instances at the same time.

27
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.460
Now,

28
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.380
if you're running Windows workloads on AWS, one option you need to be

29
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.640
familiar with is Amazon FSx for Windows File Server.

30
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.870
And it is a fully managed native Windows file system,

31
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.910
as opposed to being a Linux file system like we saw with EFS.

32
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.210
And it includes native Windows features, and this

33
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.490
includes things like SMB support,

34
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:56.000
Active Directory integration, and support for Windows NTFS. And it also utilizes SSD drives for low latency.
