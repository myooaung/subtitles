1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,780
So next, we're going to walk through three different scenarios that

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,840
will help you gauge how well you have absorbed the information that

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,580
we have presented within this module.

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,870
So first of all, we're going to be looking at Sylvia,

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:17,440
and her company is in the process of moving multiple workloads into AWS.

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,170
And one of those workloads is an application that will be

7
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:21,890
leveraged for at least five more years.

8
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:25,120
This is just a core business application that her company will

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,540
be leveraging for the foreseeable future.

10
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:32,840
However, they're looking to be as cost efficient as possible for this EC2 usage.

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:38,130
So for them, what EC2 purchase option should be chosen for the application? Okay,

12
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:42,040
next we have Edward, and he's looking to deploy his PHP web

13
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,320
application to a virtual server, but he doesn't have

14
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,020
experience managing EC2 instances on AWS.

15
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,990
He does need the ability to scale, though,

16
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:54,240
because he does think this application is going to be pretty popular.

17
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:59,610
So for Edward, what is the best compute option for him based on this criteria?

18
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:03,620
Okay, and now our third scenario. Cindy's company is transitioning

19
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:06,520
to the cloud for its data processing workloads.

20
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,900
Now these workloads happen daily and can start or stop without a problem,

21
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,040
so they're configured to handle that.

22
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:22,000
The workload will be leveraged for at least one year, so for Cindy, what EC2 purchase option would be the most cost efficient choice?
