1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,840
So next, we're going to be talking about management and governance services.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,590
And when we're talking about this category, we're primarily

3
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:11,450
talking about six different services. First of all,

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:19,040
we have AWS CloudTrail, and then AWS CloudFormation, Amazon CloudWatch,

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:25,540
AWS Config, AWS Systems Manager, and AWS Control Tower.

6
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,840
So over the course of this module, here's what we're going to cover.

7
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,550
First,

8
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,960
we're just going to be reviewing the ecosystem of services that are

9
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,960
provided for management. While we've looked at a lot of services that we

10
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,720
can launch, this is where we transition to looking at what do we do once

11
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,470
we launch resources within the cloud.

12
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:45,090
Then, we're going to be examining how to create an audit

13
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,340
trail by leveraging AWS CloudTrail.

14
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,650
And then, we'll be exploring how you track

15
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:54,640
infrastructure with both CloudWatch and Config.

16
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,800
Then we'll be looking at a concept called infrastructure automation,

17
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,640
or infrastructure as code, with CloudFormation.

18
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,670
And then we'll be looking at operational insights utilizing Systems Manager.

19
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,150
And then finally, we'll be reviewing AWS Organizations,

20
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:15,000
which is a concept we have already explored, but we'll be looking at how that works with Control Tower.
