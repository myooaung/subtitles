00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.270
So next, we're going to be talking through Glacier and Glacier Deep Archive.

2
00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:06.310
So at a high level,

3
00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.020
Amazon S3 Glacier is designed for archiving of data

4
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.700
within S3 as a separate storage class.

5
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.480
Now let's talk about what that means.

6
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.380
Let's say, for example,

7
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.460
that your company needs to hold onto payment information from

8
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.070
your customers for one year or for three years.

9
00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.460
In those cases, you need to have somewhere to store it,

10
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.410
and you need to be able to produce that data for legal or

11
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.840
compliance reasons, but you're not generally going to go in

12
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.030
and access that on a regular basis.

13
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:36.970
That is a great use case for archiving data within S3 using Amazon S3 Glacier.

14
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.720
Now the way that this works is that it offers configurable retrieval times.

15
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.130
So with this data,

16
00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.130
you won't be able to retrieve it right away, but you can choose to

17
00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.810
either retrieve it quickly or retrieve it less quickly,

18
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.940
and you'll pay different based on the choice that you make.

19
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.240
Now you can send files directly,

20
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.730
or you can actually utilize the lifecycle rules in S3

21
00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.540
to transition data into S3 Glacier.

22
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.250
Now it does provide two different storage classes, being

23
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.440
S3 Glacier and S3 Glacier Deep Archive.

24
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.280
Let's quickly compare these two different options.

25
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.190
So first of all,

26
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.350
S3 Glacier. It's designed for archival data, and it has a 90‑day

27
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.710
minimum storage duration change. So, we wouldn't just store data

28
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.390
here for a week or for a month.

29
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.640
In this case, it needs to be at least 90 days,

30
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.800
and it can be retrieved in either minutes or hours.

31
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.310
This is where you pay based on the decision that you make,

32
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.140
you would have a higher cost to retrieve in minutes over hours.

33
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.720
Now you do pay a retrieval fee per gigabyte retrieved.

34
00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.470
So in this case, in addition to the storage cost,

35
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.000
you do pay to retrieve it. Now,

36
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.120
it will be about five times less expensive than using the S3

37
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.860
Standard storage class, so there is a compelling reason to utilize

38
00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.070
this if you do have data that you know you won't need to access at

39
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.840
all except for rare circumstances.

40
00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.640
Then we have S3 Glacier Deep Archive,

41
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.540
and this is also designed for archival data.

42
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.220
But in this case,

43
00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.170
it has a 180‑day minimum storage duration change, so you're

44
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.010
going to want data here for basically about half a year at

45
00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:11.660
minimum. And in this case,

46
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.290
it can be retrieved in hours, so we don't have the option to get it

47
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.370
back in minutes like we do with S3 Glacier. Here, you also pay a

48
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.040
retrieval fee per gigabyte that you retrieve.

49
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.980
But in this case,

50
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.340
it is over 23 times less expensive than the S3 Standard storage class.

51
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.070
So in this case,

52
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.900
the AWS Management Console can be used to set up S3 Glacier; however,

53
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.800
when we're looking at uploading and retrieving data,

54
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.190
this is where you're going to be using the programmatic approaches,

55
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.690
so either utilizing the CLI or using the SDKs.

56
00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.590
This is one of those situations that I alluded to earlier where

57
00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:54.000
there are certain things you can't do within the console that you can do within the other interaction methods.
