1
00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:01.290
So,

2
00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:03.490
now that we've covered the core concepts that you

3
00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:05.820
need to launch an EC2 instance,

4
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.050
we're actually going to dive into the console and launch an instance ourselves.

5
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.380
Now, I do want to call‑out here, you need to understand EC2 for the exam.

6
00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.860
You don't necessarily need to know how to launch an instance yourself,

7
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.280
although I think this will be valuable in understanding the concepts

8
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.940
that have already been presented within this module.

9
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.420
So here's what we're going to do.

10
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.950
We're, first, going to launch a new EC2 instance

11
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.400
based on an AMI provided by AWS.

12
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.480
And then, we're going to be exploring the launch wizard in

13
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.530
the AWS Console. We'll then be configuring an EC2 instance

14
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.100
to be used as a web server.

15
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.540
And finally, we will cover how you terminate an EC2 instance once you're done.

16
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:51.060
So, I'm here within the AWS Console. I've already logged in as my user and here,

17
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:56.800
from the search box, I'm going to search for EC2. I'm now going to click on EC2,

18
00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.150
and from here I can now see my dashboard for EC2 which will list all of my

19
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.900
running instances as well as many of the other types of information that are

20
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.310
contained within this dashboard.

21
00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.980
Now,

22
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.450
the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to scroll down, I'm

23
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.540
going to go to the option to launch an instance,

24
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.140
and from here we're going to click on Launch Instance.

25
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.560
Now, we get a chance here to choose an AMI.

26
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.490
Now, as I mentioned, there are several that are provided by AWS.

27
00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.380
There also are some that are provided by the community, and then there

28
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.520
are some that are provided in the AWS marketplace,

29
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.230
which those could charge an extra fee for using those AMIs.

30
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.630
We also can see here that there's an option for my AMIs because,

31
00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:38.310
as I mentioned,

32
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.740
we can actually create our own AMIs based off of our own customizations.

33
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.560
In this case, I'm going to choose the Amazon Linux 2 AMI.

34
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.570
So I'm going to select this first one. And now we get an

35
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.500
option to go in and select our instance type.

36
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.880
Now, we've talked a lot about instance types, and if we were to

37
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.880
scroll down, this list is pretty long, and we can go all the way

38
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.290
from general purpose into commute storage, memory optimized, and

39
00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.040
accelerated computing.

40
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.190
For now, though, since we're just interested in testing this out,

41
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.010
we're going to use a t2.micro instance type, and part of

42
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.260
the reason that we're going to use that is because that is

43
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.420
free until you're eligible.

44
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.000
So if this is a new AWS account for you,

45
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.730
you should be able to run this within the free tier

46
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.900
and not incur charges in doing so.

47
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:22.680
However,

48
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.050
I do want to quickly remind you that if you leave these instances up and

49
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.620
running there will be charges associated with them.

50
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.350
Make sure that you've set up the billing alarm that we guided you

51
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.340
through in the previous course within this path.

52
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.840
So next, I'm going to hit the Next option to Configure Instance Details.

53
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.280
Now, from here, I'm telling it to only launch one instance.

54
00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.210
That's all that we need. Now, the next step is we have an

55
00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.540
option here for our purchasing option.

56
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.330
So I do have the option here to make this a Spot instance or to

57
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.850
at least request a Spot instance. However,

58
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.150
I'm not going to do that here,

59
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.540
and we're going to choose to simply launch an On‑Demand instance.

60
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.010
Now, we haven't yet talked about VPCs, and so I'm going to leave these options

61
00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.260
here as the default values for both the network in the subnet, but I do want to

62
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.510
switch Auto‑assign Public IP to be Enable. And now we can look here that we have

63
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.770
some other values for things that we haven't covered yet, but I'm now going to

64
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.540
navigate down to the bottom,

65
00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.840
and I'm going to go to the section for Advanced Details.

66
00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.940
Now, here within this section we have something called User data,

67
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.510
and this is basically just commands that the server will run when it starts.

68
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.900
And so I'm going to paste in a value here that will basically have it

69
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.910
install a web server and then start that web server.

70
00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.060
And if all of this works correctly, when we're done we should be able to go

71
00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.540
and see the test page for that web server up and running.

72
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.840
So let's go ahead and hit Next and add storage.

73
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.940
So here, we do have an EBS volume that we're going to be leveraging,

74
00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.830
and we could choose to add additional storage if we wanted to onto this server.

75
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.840
Now we don't need to, and so because of that,

76
00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.620
I'm not going to change anything on this screen, but just know

77
00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.370
that you can. And we'll talk more about EBS later, but we even

78
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.740
have the option here to go in and change the type of volume that

79
00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.640
we're using, in this case, we're just going to keep it as a General Purpose SSD,

80
00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.870
which is known as a gp2. Next,

81
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:20.240
we could go through here and add tags, so I could go in and add a tag here.

82
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.780
We could say here that this is just a test server, and so if

83
00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.150
we used that purpose tag across everything,

84
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.370
we could note how much of our charges are associated with,

85
00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.510
for example, test versus production.

86
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.160
We could change a lot of different things on that,

87
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.140
but in this case we'll keep that tag in place, and next,

88
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.480
we'll go in and configure the security group.

89
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.260
Now, this is something else that we haven't covered in depth yet, but we

90
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.410
will be covering more later on within this course.

91
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.210
But I need to do two things here.

92
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.250
First of all,

93
00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.870
currently any IP address, so any user, could go in an attempt to log into the

94
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.880
server to manage it, and we don't want that to be the case.

95
00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.070
And fortunately, AWS provides an easy way to limit access.

96
00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.720
At this point,

97
00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.460
I'm just going to say my IP, so only my IP address, right now, can actually go

98
00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.530
in to manage the server. But I need to add one more rule.

99
00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:08.350
As I mentioned,

100
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:12.060
we want to set up a web server. Now, the type of communication

101
00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.560
that a web server has is called HTTP, so I'm going to select HTTP,

102
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.260
here on the left. If we leave this at the default value where it

103
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.930
says 0.0.0.0/0, in this case,

104
00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.660
what that's saying is is that anyone can access the

105
00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.740
web information from this server, and that's what we want.

106
00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.400
Now that we have that in place, we're going to hit Review and Launch,

107
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.920
and then we will look at the summary page here.

108
00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.290
Everything looks good, and we'll just hit Launch.

109
00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.720
Now, it's going to ask us here to create a key pair,

110
00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.650
and if you haven't done that yet, you will need to do it.

111
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.070
In this case, this is what will allow you to actually sign in to this server,

112
00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:50.360
utilizing this key pair.

113
00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.500
Now,

114
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.540
we're not going to be signing into this server to administer it. But

115
00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.930
you still will need to create a key pair, then we'll need to

116
00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.040
acknowledge that we have access to that key pair,

117
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.640
and then we can finalize the launch process.

118
00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:01.270
Now, from here,

119
00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.480
it's telling us that our instance is launching, so

120
00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:07.360
congratulations, you have now launched an instance in EC2, so

121
00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.680
you've launched a web server in the cloud.

122
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.130
Now it's going to take in a minute to get started, but what we can

123
00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.580
do is we can click on this little value here.

124
00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.460
This is the identifier for our EC2 instance,

125
00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.600
and it will let us know right now that it is currently

126
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.540
pending, so it is going through the launching process. So

127
00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.640
we'll give this just a minute to complete.

128
00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.480
So now we can see that our instance is currently set to be running,

129
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.810
and so we should be able to access it now.

130
00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.830
So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to look at the section down

131
00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.660
here that gives the information for this instance, and there will

132
00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.510
be a section called Public DNS.

133
00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:42.240
I'm going to click on this to copy it to the clipboard,

134
00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.970
and then I'm going to go up here and I'm going to open up a new tab in

135
00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:47.750
the browser and I'm going to paste that value in.

136
00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:51.990
I'm going to hit Enter and you can now see that we do indeed see our test page.

137
00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:55.320
This means that you have properly configured a web server to be up and

138
00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.970
running in the cloud, so this is what we want to see.

139
00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:01.280
However, we just don't want to leave an instance running if we don't need it.

140
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.790
So I'm going to go in here and I'm going to be sure that my instance is

141
00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:07.340
selected, and then from here we're going to go under Actions,

142
00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:11.440
and then we're going to go to Instance State and we're going to go to Terminate.

143
00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.930
Now here, this is going to let us know that the EBS volume will

144
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:17.320
be deleted when we delete the instance, and this is actually

145
00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:21.510
what we want. So we can now hit Yes, Terminate, and by doing so,

146
00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:24.330
we now have shut down our instance and it'll take it a little

147
00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.300
bit to shut down and be fully terminated.

148
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.840
But let's walk through what we've done here.

149
00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.040
We've been able to go in through the console,

150
00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:34.350
launch a new EC2 instance from an AWS provided AMI.

151
00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:36.850
We have then been able to go in and configure it as an

152
00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:39.680
On‑Demand instance to be a web server, and then we've

153
00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:49.000
launched it, we've seen that it worked, and now we have terminated our instance. So congratulations on firing up and spinning down your first server on EC2.
