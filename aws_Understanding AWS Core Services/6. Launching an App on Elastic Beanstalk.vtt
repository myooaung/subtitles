00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.690
So now that we've had a chance to understand the purpose

2
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.170
and features within Elastic Beanstalk,

3
00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.940
we're now going to launch a sample application on the platform.

4
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:10.890
So here in this demo,

5
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.560
we are first going to be accessing the sample Elastic Beanstalk

6
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.940
applications from the Elastic Beanstalk documentation.

7
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.680
We will then be launching one of those sample applications on Elastic Beanstalk.

8
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.680
And then finally, we will be deleting a deployed Elastic Beanstalk application.

9
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.910
So I'm here on the Tutorials and samples page within

10
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.040
the Elastic Beanstalk documentation.

11
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.450
Now a link to this page will be provided within the

12
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.200
guided outlined for this course.

13
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.010
And I'm going to scroll down to the bottom half of the page where we

14
00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.470
actually have sample applications that have been included.

15
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.280
Now I'm going to click on this Node.js application to download it.

16
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.680
Now in this case, this is going to be the sample application that I choose.

17
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.740
If you wanted to try out one of the others, you certainly could as well.

18
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.330
But when we go to launch it within Elastic Beanstalk,

19
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.240
you'll need to be sure that you select the correct platform.

20
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.130
So now I'm going to navigate over to the AWS console, and

21
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.990
I'm already logged into the console.

22
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.740
And from here,

23
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:08.500
I'm going to either click on Elastic Beanstalk within Recently visited services,

24
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.460
or if you don't have it within Recently visited services,

25
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.640
you can simply type in Elastic and then search for Elastic Beanstalk.

26
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.260
Now from here,

27
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.710
it's going to tell us Welcome to Elastic Beanstalk, and we're

28
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.140
going to click on the Get started button.

29
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.790
Next, we're going to create a web application,

30
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.180
and I'm going to call this one sampleâ€‘app. And then from here,

31
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.000
we're going to go down and choose the platform. Now because I chose

32
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.560
Node.js, this is the platform that I'm going to select here.

33
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.770
Now,

34
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.650
we do have the option here to just do a sample application

35
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.560
without having to leave the Elastic Beanstalk dashboard

36
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.020
here in the console; however,

37
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.460
I'm going to choose to go to the Upload your code option.

38
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.510
Part of the reason I'm doing this is because I want you to have

39
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.490
experience uploading your own code into Elastic Beanstalk.

40
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.920
I'm now going to hit Upload,

41
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.560
and I'm going to select the local file. And here I'm going

42
00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.070
to go in and select the Node.js sample application, and

43
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.640
then I'm going to hit Upload.

44
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.470
Now from here,

45
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.760
we'll get a chance to go in and configure more options. Now at a high level,

46
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.700
we don't need to change any of the settings that are included here; however,

47
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.570
I wanted to show this to you so that you can see some of the

48
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.580
different capabilities that you can configure within Elastic

49
00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.360
Beanstalk. Now at this point,

50
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.580
we'll choose to leave all of these values in place, but you

51
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.140
can see there's quite a bit of configuration that is available

52
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.240
to you. We'll now hit Create app.

53
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.960
And now we can see that Elastic Beanstalk is going through the process of

54
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.220
guiding our initial deployment and we're able to use this console here to view

55
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.640
the progress as it deploys it out for the first time.

56
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.530
And we can now see that our application has launched successfully.

57
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.110
It's currently letting us know that the health of this application is okay.

58
00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.880
And if we look,

59
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.740
there is a URL that we can click on to get access to our web

60
00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.820
application. And if we go look at this,

61
00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.190
we can see that we have indeed launched our first web application

62
00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.440
here on Elastic Beanstalk. And it actually allows you to kind of

63
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.740
scroll through and look at the different documentation based on

64
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.310
the links that are included.

65
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.500
Now if we go back and look at the dashboard, as a reminder there are several

66
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.230
different things that are included within the platform,

67
00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.560
including keeping things like our logs, so we can see our logs, we

68
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.580
actually can go in and request those at any point in time, we can look

69
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.180
at the health, it'll go through and let us know the instances that are

70
00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.280
running and the percentage of requests, we can see here that we have

71
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.140
had some good 200 requests, which is what we would want.

72
00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.530
We can go in and see monitoring so we can actually see

73
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.530
how our web application is performing.

74
00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.530
Now, this has just started up,

75
00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.290
so we're not going to have any good data to look at at the moment.

76
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.090
We can even go in and configure alarms based on,

77
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.040
for example, if our application becomes unhealthy if it's not responding.

78
00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.310
So these are all the things that are provided by Elastic Beanstalk

79
00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.330
just as a part of the platform as a whole, and it doesn't require you

80
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.620
to know how to go in and configure all of the backing services that

81
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.570
are feeding into Elastic Beanstalk.

82
00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.340
But now we're going to take our last step,

83
00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.880
and that's we're going to delete our application.

84
00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.770
So I'm going to go here under this application, so I'm going to go

85
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.920
here under Actions and I'm going to choose to Terminate

86
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.810
environment. And here to terminate it, we're going to need to

87
00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.980
enter in the name of our application, and then we're going to hit Terminate,

88
00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.950
and this will destroy the web application that we've just deployed,

89
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.540
which is what we want.

90
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.000
So now, through this process,

91
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.520
we have been able to take a sample application provided by

92
00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.930
Elastic Beanstalk, launch it within the platform,

93
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:23.840
see it running,

94
00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:31.000
see some of the capabilities that are provided by Elastic Beanstalk, and then ultimately terminating our custom application.
