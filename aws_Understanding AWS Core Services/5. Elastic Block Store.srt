1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,180
So next, we're going to talk about Elastic Block Store, or EBS.

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:07,380
But before we get too deep into EBS,

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,540
let's take a look at some different approaches that we have for file

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:15,210
storage within Amazon EC2. The first is Amazon EBS,

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,910
which is persistent block storage for use within Amazon EC2,

6
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,740
and that's what we're going to be covering within this clip.

7
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:25,970
But the next option is Amazon EFS, or Elastic File System,

8
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:29,580
which is a network file system that is designed for Linux‑based workloads,

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,640
and we'll be covering that within the next clip.

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,560
So at a high level, EBS is block storage that's designed to

11
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,230
be connected to a single EC2 instance,

12
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:42,570
and it can scale to support petabytes of data and also support

13
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,540
multiple volume types based on what you need.

14
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:49,340
So let's quickly give a high‑level overview of EBS.

15
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:54,270
So first of all, it does enable redundancy within an availability zone.

16
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:54,810
This way,

17
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,830
you can make sure that your data is durable. Now it also

18
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:01,040
allows users to take snapshots of its data.

19
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,620
So if you have data that you want to have on a drive

20
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:06,400
attached to your EC2 instances, but you do want to

21
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,340
periodically take backups of this data, EBS can be a compelling choice.

22
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,870
Now it does offer encryption of its volumes,

23
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,330
but it doesn't necessarily encrypt things by default.

24
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:18,960
You do need to make sure that is a step that you take if you're

25
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,320
leveraging EBS. It also provides multiple volume types,

26
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:29,300
including General Purpose SSDs, Provisioned IOPS SSDs, Throughput

27
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:33,180
Optimized hard disk drives, and Cold hard disk drives.

28
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,940
And we're going to review each of those volume types at a deeper level.

29
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:37,910
So first of all,

30
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:41,570
your General Purpose SSD is a cost effective type that

31
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:43,940
is designed for general workloads.

32
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,220
But if you have a more intense use case,

33
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:50,190
you might want to take a look at Provisioned IOPS SSDs.

34
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,580
So this is a situation where you're looking at high‑performance volume,

35
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:57,190
but you really need a low latency. Now we also have

36
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,870
Throughput Optimized hard disk drives,

37
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,630
and this is designed for frequently accessed data.

38
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:12,000
But, if we have situations where we have less frequently accessed data, we might want to consider the Cold hard disk drive volume type.
