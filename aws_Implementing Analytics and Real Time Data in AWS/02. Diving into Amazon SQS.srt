00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,640
[Autogenerated] Alright, Amazon's simple cue service, also known as sqs.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,560
So what is Sqs?

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,740
Well, Sqs offers us a secure,

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:17,040
adorable and hosted cue service for us to use within a W S.

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:22,090
What this allows us to do is to decouple our architecture.

6
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:24,970
ER, while also integrating are different.

7
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:29,320
Microsurgery is is so decouple ing and architecture is a key

8
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,860
component in a fundamental understanding.

9
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:36,840
You have to have to pass the solutions Architect Professional exam.

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,490
You have to understand where you can decouple your

11
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:42,940
pieces for a more optimal workflow.

12
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:46,290
Now Sqs offers two different types of queues.

13
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,730
There's a standard Q.

14
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,740
And then there's a FIFA Q,

15
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,040
and we'll look at both of those here in the console coming up.

16
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,580
And the beauty of using sqs is there's no requirement for setting up

17
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:03,860
message brokers in a typical messaging Q system like Amazon.

18
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:10,030
MQ, for example, or rabbit MQ for on premise cueing systems to use those.

19
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:14,440
It requires that you set up some type of message broker that consent the

20
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,440
message and received the message from those queuing services.

21
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:23,710
So Sqs allows us to quickly stand up a cue service within our

22
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:30,210
architectures and just a fun fact about Amazon Simple que services sqs

23
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:35,340
was actually the first services ever offered by AWS.

24
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,290
A lot of people think it's compute, but in fact it's actually sqs.

25
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,670
Now with this review out of the way,

26
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:50,000
let's go ahead and move into the console and start creating and using these different types of queues.
