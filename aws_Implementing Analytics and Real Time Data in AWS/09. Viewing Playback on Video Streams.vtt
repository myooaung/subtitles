00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:01.490
[Autogenerated] Alright,

2
00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:04.560
So let's just talk about the last technology within

3
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.080
Ken is is and that's video streams.

4
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.840
So if I select create video stream,

5
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.520
it brings us to our creates stream set up page.

6
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:13.590
So we give it a name.

7
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.540
I'll call this Pluralsight will just follow suit like our other demos.

8
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.550
We can have a default configuration.

9
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:26.000
So our default retention period for our data in an a W s K m s key or we can

10
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.600
supply a custom one where we specify our data retention.

11
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.400
So I can do let's say five days just for an example

12
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.340
and I can specify a key as well.

13
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.040
So I'll do default.

14
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.520
You can see that the default is one day and the default key is the typical a

15
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.590
W s prefixed managed key and then we can give some tags.

16
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.550
So if I create our video stream, that's it.

17
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.070
That's how simple it is.

18
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.020
We just created a video stream for our producers to connect to.

19
00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.520
Now what you would do is you go to download sdk and this brings you to the

20
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.970
pages on the STK for the producer libraries and you can see the main languages

21
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.390
here on the left Java Android C++ and then see So those error just some Amazon

22
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.840
supported examples that you can use.

23
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.870
And what would happen is we can go in here and we can

24
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.660
actually have media playback as those videos.

25
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.340
And that data is coming in in real time.

26
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.680
So as its streaming this data as our producer is pushing our data in we can

27
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.340
start streaming here and visualizing that media playback,

28
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.640
it's a really cool technology.

29
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.230
Now, one last thing before we go, you'll see there's a signaling channels here,

30
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:48.150
and this is the other possibility that we have so for non video data,

31
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.790
right?

32
00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.190
So if I go down here and I do Pluralsight SignalR,

33
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.610
we specify a time to live and we can do a tag.

34
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.750
So this is going to allow us to set up video streams via a

35
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.940
different sdk on our devices and applications.

36
00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.980
And what it's doing is it's using a different

37
00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.040
protocol than the typical video stream.

38
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.560
Now, I'm not going to set anything up.

39
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.350
I'm gonna clean this up, but that's all I wanted to show you.

40
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.630
I just wanted to walk through how this looks when you're wanting

41
00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:28.000
to create a video stream within Ken is is. So let's go ahead and end here and then we'll move on to the module, wrap up
