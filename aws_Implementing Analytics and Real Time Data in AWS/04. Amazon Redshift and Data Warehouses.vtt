00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.740
[Autogenerated] This brings us to Amazon Red shift.

2
00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.580
So what is red shift?

3
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.860
Well, Amazon Red Shift is a fully managed,

4
00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.740
petabytes scale data warehouse service within a W s.

5
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.370
So since it's fully managed, Amazon handles the infrastructure side of things,

6
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.040
and then we just configure some other odds and ends.

7
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.500
Now read Shift is composed of a collection of compute

8
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.640
resource Is and these error known as nodes,

9
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.140
and these notes are then organized into groups that we call clusters.

10
00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.680
And each cluster runs a Mazon red shift engine and

11
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.340
contains one or more database is within it.

12
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.450
So if you ever get a question relating to data warehouses within a W s,

13
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.240
it's more than likely going to lead to Amazon Red Shift as the solution,

14
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.040
or at least a part of the solution.

15
00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.950
Let's go ahead.

16
00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:07.000
We'll end here, and then in the next clip, we'll start looking at red shift from within the AWS console
