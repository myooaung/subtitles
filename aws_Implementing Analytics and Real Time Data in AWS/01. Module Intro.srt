[Autogenerated] welcome to the third module of this course in this module.

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:07,920
We're going to start looking at using application

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,040
integration services within a W s.

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,140
So what can we expect to take out of this module?

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:16,410
Well,

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:21,240
we're first going to look at the different use cases for simple cue service,

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,940
which is also known as Sqs.

8
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,570
We're gonna talk about leveraging SNS for

9
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,340
notifications and pub sub architectures,

10
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,550
and then we're going to dive in to how to use step

11
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:44,000
functions for our application needs. So let's go ahead and get started in the next clip, we'll start looking at Sqs.
