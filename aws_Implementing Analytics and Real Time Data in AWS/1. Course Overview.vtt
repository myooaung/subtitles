[Autogenerated] Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.410
My name is Andrew Estes and welcome to my course

3
00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.320
Implementing analytics in real time data in a W s.

4
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.990
Currently I'm an enterprise cloud architect at CSG

5
00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.240
International and founder of Quick iCloud.

6
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.650
Real Time Data Analytics is a massive and rapidly

7
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.290
growing field within the I t industry.

8
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:27.140
Today.

9
00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.140
In this course,

10
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.800
we're going to learn how we can leverage AWS services for

11
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.440
real time data Analytics and streaming.

12
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.190
Some of the major topics that we're going to cover include que nested streams,

13
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.260
elasticsearch and M R s and s and sqs architectures

14
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.640
and a W s i o T ecosystem offerings.

15
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.140
By the end of this course,

16
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.130
you'll know which a W s services can be used to accomplish your data

17
00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.050
streaming in analytics needs before beginning the course.

18
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.270
You should be familiar with the solutions architect, professional learning path.

19
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.460
And with that, it will be helpful to be aware of the solutions,

20
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.340
architect, associate and professional exam material.

21
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.440
And then finally,

22
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.100
URL want to at least have a general understanding

23
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.170
of microcircuits architectures.

24
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.180
From here,

25
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.900
you should feel comfortable diving into other data streaming

26
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.300
and analytics with courses on other real time data streaming

27
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.340
services deep dives into a W S I, O T.

28
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.840
And the other solutions architect professional learning path courses.

29
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.360
Now I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn how we can implement

30
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:54.000
real time data streaming with the implementing analytics and real time data in a W S course here at Pluralsight.
