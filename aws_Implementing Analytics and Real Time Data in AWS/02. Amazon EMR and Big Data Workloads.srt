00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,440
[Autogenerated] Okay, let's begin looking at Amazon EMR.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,140
Now, if you've taken the solutions architect,

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,840
associate, examine learning path, you should be familiar with EMR.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,790
But for those who aren't,

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:15,020
we'll have a quick review so we can get a general

6
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,240
understanding of what it is before we dive in.

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,780
Now M R is a managed cluster platform for running

8
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,340
big data frameworks within a W s.

9
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,650
Now, some examples of those big data frameworks are Apache,

10
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,740
Hadoop and Apache Spark.

11
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,290
So these error very well known frameworks within the big data industry that

12
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:40,640
allow us to perform different analytics for different data sets.

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,250
Now, the neat thing about M.

14
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:47,940
R is that it allows us to process and then analyzed vast amounts of data.

15
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,030
So we're able to ingest tons of data,

16
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,070
perform some analysis of it and then generate either reports or

17
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:58,240
some type of output that we can look at later.

18
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,430
And since it's a service hosted on a W s,

19
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:07,890
it easily allows us to transform and move data into and out

20
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:11,640
of A W S data stores and data stores.

21
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:18,140
Here are things like S3 or maybe a relation all database or something similar.

22
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,510
So with the quick review.

23
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:27,000
Out of the way, Let's go ahead, will dive into the console and we'll start configuring some EMR clusters.
