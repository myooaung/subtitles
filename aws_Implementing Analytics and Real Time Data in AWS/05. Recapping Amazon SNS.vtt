00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:01.070
[Autogenerated] Alright.

2
00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:06.830
With Sqs out of the way, let's start looking at simple Notification Service,

3
00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.900
which is known as S N s.

4
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.310
Now Amazon.

5
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:16.660
SNS is a Web service that coordinates and manages the delivery and

6
00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.360
sending of messages to subscribers through resource is that we call

7
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.470
topics within the SMS service itself.

8
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.420
There are two different types of clients and these error

9
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.640
known as subscribers and publishers.

10
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.240
Now they're also known as consumers and producers.

11
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.860
And what it means is that subscribers subscribe to

12
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.540
our topics and receive messages,

13
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.940
and publishers published messages to our topics for our subscribers to consume.

14
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.450
Now these subscribers consume messages and notifications that

15
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.880
error published via a supported protocol,

16
00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:02.640
and these include http and https, or even email as an example.

17
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.260
Now there's several more protocols supported, and we'll look at them.

18
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.140
But I just wanted to give you a general understanding.

19
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.580
Now to lock it down,

20
00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.780
you configure policies that error put into place to control who can

21
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.460
publish messages to the topics so you can have an application post

22
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.730
messages from within the same A W s account,

23
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:29.340
or you can open it up for even cross account publishing of messages,

24
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.760
depending on your needs and we'll see how that's done in the console here,

25
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.670
coming up shortly and that's a good spot to start leading into our next clip.

26
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:48.000
So let's end here and we'll pick up in the SNS console and start creating different topics and publishing messages.
