[Autogenerated] awesome.

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:04,080
You've made it through the second module of this Pluralsight

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,980
course before we move on to the next module.

4
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:10,090
Let's just have a quick wrap up and review on what we

5
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:14,770
learned Now we started off by using E M R elastic map

6
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:18,340
reduce to perform Big Data Analytics.

7
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:21,590
So we looked at spinning up a cluster and then passing

8
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:24,840
in data using the Apache frameworks.

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,240
We then moved on to exploring red shift for data warehouse needs.

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,120
So we mentioned how whenever an exam question comes up on the

11
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,360
solutions architect exam relating to data warehouses,

12
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,060
Amazon redshift is more than likely going to be within

13
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,100
that architecture for the solution.

14
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,740
So be sure to keep that in mind.

15
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,730
We then moved on to standing up in elastic search

16
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:53,440
service cluster for real time analysis.

17
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,760
So we stood up a cluster and then we passed in some data,

18
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,140
so we can see how it works.

19
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,590
And while we did that,

20
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:05,310
we talked about how elastic search plays well with log

21
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,940
analytics in real time application monitoring.

22
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,790
And then we just finished up discussing how quick site can

23
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:16,540
be used to visualized data and reports.

24
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:22,250
So using quicksight allows us to gain business insights for our companies.

25
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:27,140
So we can visual eyes, What's going on within our applications?

26
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,300
So let's go ahead.

27
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:32,600
We'll wrap up this module and then we'll pick up in the next module,

28
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,660
where it will start looking at using application integration services within A.

29
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,000
