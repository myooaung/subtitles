00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.950
[Autogenerated] Okay, welcome to the quicksight portion of this module.

2
00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.210
Now, we just had an overview on what QUICKSIGHT is and why it's used.

3
00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.050
And this is going to be a very short clip on how we can

4
00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:13.820
implement it or what it looks like.

5
00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.640
So I'll click on, Sign up for Quicksight,

6
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.040
and this brings us to our create account screen.

7
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.190
Now, I'm not gonna go through with this because I don't want to pay for this,

8
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.750
But you can see there's standard and enterprise selections.

9
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:33.060
So depending on your use case, they have a lower tier and a higher tier,

10
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.340
and you can see the primary differences right here at the bottom.

11
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.500
There's private VPC access, role level security data encryption at rest,

12
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.240
etcetera on the enterprise selection as opposed to the basic standard.

13
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.840
And you can see, in addition to that,

14
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.530
that the author per month prices are different.

15
00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.570
So you pay a fee per author that can access the data

16
00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.880
and alter it as well as your readers.

17
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.440
So you pay per session for the readers,

18
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.540
and what's nice is they max it out at $5 per month.

19
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.750
Now a reason you might use the enterprise selection is really for the

20
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.760
encryption protocols and the row level security.

21
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.350
So you can create different dashboards for different users

22
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.150
so they don't get to see other user data.

23
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.540
They can only see their own.

24
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.580
So this allows you to have shared tendency for your database is

25
00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.050
in your data sources but still restrict Who can see what when

26
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.090
you're reporting those visualizations.

27
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.030
So if you ever get an exam question mentioning business

28
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.940
intelligence and data visualizations with dashboards,

29
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.430
chances are quick Site is going to play a part of that solution.

30
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.510
It allows for business intelligence related people to

31
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.340
make decisions based on reports.

32
00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.280
So that's gonna do it.

33
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:05.000
Let's go ahead and finish here and in the next clip, we'll have a quick module review before we move on.
